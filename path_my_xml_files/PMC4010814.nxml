This study sought to determine the priorities, values and concerns of men who were &#x02018;fully informed&#x02019; about the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; and empirically examine the value of a community jury in eliciting public values on PSA screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Community jury was convened on the Gold Coast, Queensland (Australia) to consider PSA screening benefits and harms, and whether government campaigns on PSA screening should be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>27 men (volunteers) aged 50&#x02013;70 with no personal history of prostate cancer and willing to attend jury 6&#x02013;7 April 2013: 12 were randomly allocated to jury (11 attended).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>A qualitative analysis was conducted of the jury deliberations (audio-recorded and transcribed) to elicit the jury's views and recommendations.

Based on current evidence, it is possible that screening improves survival but also leads to harms, particularly the diagnosis and treatment of cancers that would not otherwise become clinically apparent.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> It was hoped that two large randomised controlled mass population trials with survival as the primary end-point would provide a conclusive answer to the benefits and harms of screening, but the US PLCO trial found no benefit,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> possibly because a large proportion of men in the control arm were screened and the European ERSPC trial showed a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality (1 life saved for every 1055 men screened) though no reduction in all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>This equivocal evidence has led to disparate recommendations about PSA screening. The National Screening Committee in the UK and the US Preventative Task Force have advised against routine PSA testing for asymptomatic men.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The American Urological Association recommends routine PSA screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The 2013 Prostate World Congress Melbourne Consensus Statement on Prostate Cancer Testing did not recommend routine screening, but recommended that well-informed healthy men aged 50&#x02013;69 be counselled about the positive and negative aspects of PSA testing and the ability of PSA testing &#x02018;to reduce their risk of metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality&#x02019;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Owing to increasing recognition of the potential harms from screening, information about screening programmes has shifted from emphasising screening uptake to ensuring potential participants are provided with adequate information to make an informed choice about whether or not to be screened.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> This, however, requires understanding of complex issues, such as disease-specific mortality, avoidance of metastatic disease and latent cancers that are indolent in nature. The complexity is further compounded by the uncertainties regarding the estimates of screening outcomes. Moreover, the concept of potential harm from an early detection of cancer runs counter to messages men may have previously heard regarding the benefits of early detection. Men with a family history of prostate cancer are particularly likely to have concerns about the benefits and harms from screening.</p><p>While offering evidence-based information is ethically imperative,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the complexities of PSA screening make this difficult to achieve within the context of the average clinical consultation and can be burdensome for patients and clinicians.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Indeed some patients prefer to be advised what to do rather than considering detailed information about benefits and harms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> All recommendations on PSA testing emphasise the provision of information and shared decision-making. We conducted a community jury process<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> to determine the priorities, values and concerns regarding PSA screening among men aged 50&#x02013;70 who we &#x02018;fully informed&#x02019; about the reasons for and against screening. The jury members were asked to deliberate evidence presented by experts on PSA screening and invited to formulate recommendations on potential government actions. A survey using a randomised control design was incorporated to also determine the impact of the jury process on participants&#x02019; knowledge and individual testing intentions (personal communication, Thomas R, Glasziou P, Rychetnik L, <italic>et al</italic>, 2013). The protocol was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612001079831).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>Community juries provide an opportunity to examine what &#x02018;mini-publics&#x02019; would conclude if well-informed and supported to deliberate on a given topic.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While various kinds of deliberative methods exist, we adopted the community jury method as this has been successfully applied in other settings to consider questions on breast cancer screening.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Recruitment and selection</title><p>The study participants were recruited through unpaid news articles, one paid advertisement in a local paper, two radio interviews and two presentations by the jury facilitator (RT) at Rotary Club community groups. Men were eligible to participate in the study if they were aged between 50 and 70, had no personal history of prostate cancer and were willing to attend an information session on Friday night and community jury sessions on Saturday and Sunday. We sought to recruit 12 participants to the jury: 31 men were recruited, 4 withdrew prior to the Friday information night, and all of those who attended the information session chose to participate in the study randomisation. The 27 participants attending the information session were randomly allocated to either the jury (n=12) or a control group (n=15) by selecting a folded piece of paper from a container. Members of both groups were provided with two fact sheets about PSA screening.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The jury members were given additional summarised information to take home,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> subsequently discussed as part of the jury process.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Questions for deliberation by the community jury</title><p>At the start of the community jury process, the participants were invited to consider two questions about potential government actions regarding PSA screening (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1)</xref>, with the aim of finalising a group response to these questions at the end of the second day. The terms government &#x02018;campaigns&#x02019; and &#x02018;organised invitation programme&#x02019; were purposefully left open so that the jury members could deliberate among themselves on what types of government action would or would not be appropriate. The second question about an invitation programme was asked because this had been identified by men's health advocacy groups as a way of matching breast cancer screening services offered to women.

On the first day of the PSA screening jury, the participants heard presentations from the following experts:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Professor Jim Dickinson, University of Calgary (visiting scholar at Bond University at the time of the jury) who provided information about the prostate, prostate cancer and the methods used to diagnose and treat prostate cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Professor Robert (Frank) Gardiner, Professor of Urology, University of Queensland who presented information in support of selective screening of informed men and additional information on prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment (RG).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Professor Paul Glasziou, Director, Research Centre for Evidence-based Practice, Bond University who presented on why he did not recommend screening (PG).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The three expert sessions ran for approximately 40&#x02005;min each, followed by questions from the jury. Each session was followed by a facilitated discussion to elicit the men's reflections and responses to the information presented. Any further questions arising from the facilitated discussions were noted and addressed on day 2. Expert witnesses RG and PG were introduced to the jury as members of the research team. Other than to present evidence and answer the jury's questions, the expert witnesses did not attend any of the jury deliberations.</p><p>At the start of day 2, the jury again reflected on the issues raised from day 1 and identified any final questions for the experts, which were answered via a speakerphone. The jury then deliberated without a facilitator present on the two questions about potential government action on PSA screening (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>).

The jury's recommendations were compiled onto a flipchart and each point was reviewed and corrected as required by the participants to ensure that the summary of the jury's verdict accurately represented the group's deliberations and conclusions. In addition, two researchers (LR and GM) observed the jury process to compile field notes and provide feedback to the primary facilitator on group process and participant interactions.</p><p>The qualitative findings were derived from an analysis of the full transcripts of the jury process.

Findings on the jury process were also derived from the transcripts, plus from the observational field notes and all researchers&#x02019; reflections documented in postjury memos and email exchanges. The validity, relevance and interpretation of the findings were reviewed in research team discussions.

A majority of the men said the jury was an opportunity to learn about a topic on which they knew very little, heard conflicting messages and reports on what to do or had &#x02018;snippets of information each way&#x02019; for and against testing. One man revealed he was undergoing regular monitoring of his PSA levels by an urologist after his first PSA test had been ordered by a GP without his knowledge when he had attended for a cholesterol check. One other man said he had prior urological symptoms but had been cleared of significant disease. Several participants reported the experiences of family and/or friends with prostate cancer that resulted in variable outcomes, including a number of premature deaths.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Core values related to PSA screening</title><p>The men discussed their own and others&#x02019; experiences of PSA testing and compared the evidence presented at the jury to the information and advice they received from GPs and other doctors. In their reflections, they particularly noted how much of the evidence presented by the experts was unfamiliar and surprising for them; particularly the likelihood of a raised PSA result, the uncertainty about what raised PSA levels mean, and the high prevalence of prostate cancer with no clinical significance. The issues that men identified as important information but unexpected or surprising are summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx2">box 2</xref>.</p><p>Overall the group concluded that given the uncertain evidence and divergent opinions about screening, PSA testing was an individual choice for which they needed to take personal responsibility. For some in the group, the idea that it was acceptable to chose not to have a PSA test&#x02014;even if offered or advised to have one&#x02014;was a revelation as they had previously interpreted such a choice as avoidance or as being &#x02018;slack&#x02019; about their health:<disp-quote><p>I was of the opinion when I came in that every man over 60 should be screened as a matter of fact, but now I think I've changed my ideas, that it's a personal decision</p></disp-quote></p><p>The group also concluded that the poor quality or lack of information provided by GPs did not currently support men in making informed decisions. Thus one of the most discussed concerns among the participants was the variable and inconsistent advice provided by their GPs; as well as the inadequate or conflicting information and messages about PSA testing from different doctors, media campaigns and other sources. The points reflecting general group consensus during deliberations are summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx3">box 3</xref>, while some differences in opinion are summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx4">box 4</xref>.</p><p>The men were generally concerned that GPs were not following the guidelines of their College,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and that it depended on which GP they went to as to whether or not they were advised to have a PSA test, and what (if any) information was provided when a test was ordered. For example, the jury shared experiences of their doctors requesting PSA tests without informing the patient, for example at a time when another blood test was also requested. For one participant this experience resulted in significant personal regret and ongoing anxiety associated with continued monitoring &#x02018;If only I hadn't gone for the cholesterol test in 2007&#x02019;. Conversely, another man had been refused a PSA test even though he specifically asked for it and he changed his doctor as a result. The group also shared their own and others&#x02019; experiences of inconsistency in how different doctors interpret PSA test results (eg, what degree of elevated PSA levels were perceived to be ok or expected); and how urologists varied in what they recommended once PSA levels were found to be raised (eg, biopsy vs no biopsy, surgery or monitoring). The men also worried about the lack of standardisation of testing procedures, for example, whether or not men were advised to abstain from sexual activity before testing.</p><p>In addition to the core concerns about the available information and advice, the men were also concerned about the relationship between PSA testing and anxiety and depression. On deliberating the evidence many concluded that the apparent uncertainties in the science of PSA testing primarily mean that a raised PSA test result (or subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer) was a source of significant anxiety without offering any valuable information on how to act:<disp-quote><p>All they're going to say is yeah, you've got it. You're going to worry for the next 15&#x02005;years, is it bigger, is it smaller, am I going to get tested again?</p></disp-quote></p><p>After deliberating the evidence most of the jury concluded that having a PSA test was a genuinely difficult and personal choice. As a result, several of the men expressed concerns about the active promotion of PSA testing by some doctors and through public campaigns and charities such as &#x02018;Movember&#x02019;.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This was considered by some to be deceptive in the light of current uncertainty about what PSA results mean, the lack of available technologies to differentiate aggressive versus indolent cancers and the lack of satisfactory/safe treatment options for prostate cancer. The jury's discussions focused on the importance of not harming men through unnecessary investigations and treatments, including those for whom the cancer will never progress, or for whom other conditions would kill them first. Several in the group agreed that for many of their peers other emerging health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes or mental health were more important concerns than prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Community jury verdict on community-level questions</title><p>The jury's responses to the community-level questions (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>) on potential government action on PSA screening for prostate cancer were as follows (final day, n=10):

The latter was preferred to identifying PSA screening as a targeted priority issue (unanimous).</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Jury's rationale for final verdict</title><p>The jury's primary concern was that any public campaign focused on PSA testing for prostate cancer had potential to cause anxiety and alarm among the majority of men who did not need to be concerned about prostate cancer.

Deliberative methods such as community juries are well suited to support evidence-informed public engagement on screening policies and programmes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In this study, a group of men aged between 50 and 70, after deliberating on the benefits and harms of PSA screening, concluded that governments should not invest in any organised programmes focused on PSA screening that were directed at the public. They determined that the PSA test did not offer sufficient reassurance or benefit to warrant a public campaign, and that such an approach would raise unnecessary alarm about prostate cancer. The jury did however want men to continue to have access to the test and to be able to make an informed choice about whether or not to be screened. They recommended an alternative government programme aimed at supporting GPs to provide patients with better quality and more consistent information about the benefits and harms of PSA screening.</p><p>The jury's verdict on public campaigns was not anticipated by the research team; rather we expected that if anything, the jury may identify a need for a public education campaign on PSA screening. The jury overwhelmingly reported being previously unaware of the relative benefits and harms of screening, and their preference for obtaining such information from their doctor. The option of a government programme targeting GPs was nominated by the jury themselves, reflecting their primary concern about the lack of information provided by their doctors and their shared experiences of inconsistent PSA screening advice. The findings indicate the facilitation process had been open and non-directive.</p><p>Community juries are not intended to be representative of the wider population in the statistical sense; rather they offer valuable insights on the informed views and conclusions of a &#x02018;mini-public&#x02019;.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This study provides valuable insights into the concerns and priorities with regard to PSA testing among men aged 50&#x02013;70; both as individuals interested in PSA testing, and as citizens invited to weigh community benefits and harms. The jury's unanimous verdict about government programmes was notable in the light of the men's divergent views on whether or not they would get tested again in future themselves if they had no symptoms. These findings support other literature indicating community juries delineate and rise above individual decisions to consider higher order questions about the common good.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> While the men's personal interest in PSA testing did not appear to hinder their willingness and ability to consider more broadly its relative value for their community, other kinds of public may have reached different conclusions. For example, a majority of the jury had been previously tested, and while the proportion of Australian men who have ever had a PSA test is unknown, approximately 20% of Australian men aged 45&#x02013;74&#x02005;years had screening PSA tests between 2010 and 2011.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In other countries such as the USA the participation in PSA testing is relatively high; around 50% among men aged 60&#x02013;74.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The impact of these differences on the deliberation and conclusions of a jury on PSA testing is currently unknown.</p><p>It will be important therefore to repeat the deliberative process with other juries, both to examine the views of different publics, and to assess the generalisability of the findings to other parts of Australia and other countries with different information and services. Similarly, it will be relevant to assess the potential impact on jury deliberations or conclusions of varying aspects of the community jury process, such as the method of recruiting participants or of presenting evidence. Different publics could include men of different ages, a mixed group of men aged 50&#x02013;70 and partners or other family members (particularly as the men noted the influence of partners on their health behaviours) or a random sample from the electoral roll&#x02014;although these methods are still affected by respondents&#x02019; level of interest. Other forms of evidence could include the personal stories of men affected by prostate cancer and/or the side-effects of treatment, or those without a diagnosis but whose PSA level is being monitored. Finally, it will also be valuable to compare the effectiveness of eliciting public values about cancer screening using other deliberative methods.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The recent Australian NHMRC <italic>Information for Health Practitioners: Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing for Prostate Cancer in Asymptomatic Men</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> provides guidance on communicating the evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA screening to asymptomatic men. It will be imperative to identify effective mechanisms to facilitate implementation of this guidance within Australian general practice. It will be also important to better align and even regulate the messages about PSA testing that are promoted in media campaigns by prostate cancer charities and other non-government organisations and special interest groups so that more consistent information and advice is presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e211" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004682.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e212" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004682.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LR led the preparation and subsequent revisions of the manuscript, contributed to the study design, and led the analysis and interpretation of the qualitative data.
