The primary endpoint was the change in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of deep peroneal, tibial and sural nerves. Secondary endpoints included the effects of treatment on pain, tactile, thermal and vibration sensations. Patients eligible to participate were aged 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years with diabetes for &#x02265;1&#x000a0;year, HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;11.0% (97&#x000a0;mmol/mol), with symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy at the lower extremities (i.e. abnormal amplitude, latency or NCV of either tibial, deep peroneal or sural nerve, but with an evocable potential and measurable NCV of the sural nerve), a Michigan Diabetes Neuropathy Score &#x02265;7 and on a stable dose of medications for diabetic neuropathy in the month prior to enrolment. Data were collected in an outpatient setting. Participants were allocated to the FREMS or placebo arm (1:1 ratio) according to a sequence generated by a computer random number generator, without block or stratification factors.

The most common nerve pathological findings include endoneural capillary angiopathy and nerve ischaemia, leading to axonal atrophy and progressive loss of axons. Peripheral diabetic neuropathy affects the lower extremities, the most common clinical signs and symptoms being diminished sensation, numbness and painful symptoms, such as burning, pins and needles, intolerable pain and hyperaesthesia.</p><p>The pharmacological treatment of peripheral diabetic neuropathy remains a challenge. Different classes of agents, such as anti-epileptics (e.g. topiramate, valproic acid and the &#x003b1;-2-&#x003b4; agonists pregabalin and gabapentin), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, venlafaxine, duloxetine) and opioids are variably efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] but do not have an impact on the natural history of the disease. Among disease-modifying agents, the antioxidant &#x003b1;-lipoic acid met secondary endpoints in a recent clinical trial in peripheral diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the protein kinase C beta inhibitor (ruboxistaurin) was effective in a subgroup of patients with less-severe symptomatic diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] whereas aldose reductase inhibitors were found to be ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Several non-pharmacological approaches, including different electrotherapies, have been proposed for the treatment of peripheral diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The rationale for using electrical or magnetic stimulation is the potential enhancement of the microcirculation and endoneural blood flow, possibly counteracting the ischaemic pathogenetic component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and possibly other poorly understood mechanisms such as masking pain by interfering with pain gate control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have reported the efficacy of various electrotherapies: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); pulsed-dose electrical stimulation; peripheral nerve, nerve root, spinal cord, deep brain and epidural motor cortex stimulation; pulsed (electro-)magnetic fields and static magnetic fields; high-frequency external muscle stimulation; high-tone external muscle stimulation and external muscle stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, of all these electrotherapies, only TENS is currently recommended as a treatment for painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy by the American Academy of Neurology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a novel transcutaneous frequency-modulated electromagnetic neural stimulation (also known as frequency rhythmic electrical modulation system, FREMS), has been developed, using an innovative mechanism of stimulation, consisting of a sequence of modulated electrical stimuli that varies automatically in terms of pulse frequency, duration and voltage amplitude. In a pilot, randomised, crossover study, FREMS reduced diabetic neuropathy pain and ameliorated the sensory tactile and vibration perception threshold and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) when compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of FREMS in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study enrolling a large population of patients with symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy, with repeated treatment sessions and a post-treatment follow-up of adequate length.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="d29e449"><title><italic>Participants</italic></title><p>Patients meeting the following criteria were invited to participate in this study: (1) documented diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes according to ADA criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with duration of disease of at least 1&#x000a0;year and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;11.0% (97&#x000a0;mmol/mol) (normal range 3.5&#x02013;6.0%, 15&#x02013;42&#x000a0;mmol/mol); (2) age between 18 and 75&#x000a0;years; (3) symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy affecting the lower extremities with at least one positive sensory symptom such as pain, burning, paraesthesia or prickling; (4) abnormalities in amplitude (&#x0003c;6&#x000a0;mV), latency (&#x0003e;6.5&#x000a0;ms) or conduction velocity (&#x0003c;40&#x000a0;m/s) in at least one motor nerve (either tibial or deep peroneal) and/or in the sural nerve; (5) a measurable sensitive NCV and evocable potential in the sural nerve; (6) a Michigan Diabetes Neuropathy Score (MDNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] equal to or greater than 7 points; and (7) stable dose of pain medications or other medications prescribed for diabetic neuropathy, if any, during the month leading up to enrolment.

After screening, eligible participants were randomised to the FREMS or placebo arm with a 1:1 ratio according to a sequence generated by a computer random number generator, without block or stratification factors. Investigators digitised patients&#x02019; date of birth and site number into an interactive voice recording system to obtain the assigned treatment. Treatment group was confirmed by a fax, which was included in the case-report form. Randomised patients received three series of FREMS or placebo treatment at 3-month (12&#x02013;13&#x000a0;weeks) intervals: each series consisted of ten consecutive treatment sessions administered at least 24&#x000a0;h apart, within a maximum of 21&#x000a0;days. Follow-up after randomisation was 51&#x000a0;weeks. For the entire duration of the study each patient was examined by the same investigator who was also responsible for the administration of the study questionnaires and reporting of side effects. Patients, clinical investigators, technicians, neurophysiologists and statisticians were unaware of treatment assignment. Moreover, to secure the blindness of the study, patients were instructed not to consider any perception at the site of electrode placement during the treatment as a sign of active treatment and also not to judge the absence of any such perception as a sign of sham treatment. Investigators who performed the neurological outcome assessment were different from those who administered the FREMS or placebo treatment. Patients were enrolled at six clinical sites: Milan, Padua, Perugia and Rome (Italy), D&#x000fc;sseldorf (Germany) and Bondy (France). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of each participating Institution and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="d29e470"><title><italic>Intervention</italic></title><p>Treatment with FREMS consisted of sequences of biphasic (negative and positive), asymmetric and electrically balanced pulses composed of an active phase of high negative voltage spike (variable, max &#x02212;300&#x000a0;V) and extra short duration (variable, 10&#x02013;100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s, mostly &#x0223c;40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s) followed by a recharging phase of low voltage and long duration (0.9&#x02013;999&#x000a0;ms); the pulse frequency was variable, in the range of 1&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;Hz (mainly in the low range [1&#x02013;50&#x000a0;Hz]; see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Treatment with placebo consisted of no electrical pulses (i.e., sham treatment). Both FREMS and placebo treatment were administered using the Aptiva device (Lorenz Lifetech, Ozzano dell&#x02019;Emilia [formerly Lorenz Biotech, Medolla], Italy) via four pairs of disposable electrodes applied to both lower extremities. For the purpose of this study the original device was modified by adding a switch to apply treatment A (later revealed to be placebo) or treatment B (later revealed to be FREMS). Each session of either placebo or FREMS treatment lasted 30&#x000a0;min and during sessions patients were invited to modulate the delivery of sham or true neurostimulation by progressively increasing the voltage of the electrical stimulation from 0&#x000a0;V to 255&#x000a0;V through a hand-held remote control, which increased the nominal voltage by 1&#x000a0;V at each step. The complete treatment consisted of three series of ten consecutive (one a day for 5&#x000a0;days/week) FREMS or placebo treatments to both lower limbs.</p></sec><sec id="d29e479"><title><italic>Timing of study assessments</italic></title><p>Participants were assessed eight times during the study: T&#x02212;1 (enrolment visit), T0 (week 0, within 2&#x000a0;weeks after T&#x02212;1: start of first therapeutic cycle), T1 (week 3, after the first therapeutic cycle), T2 (week 17: start of second therapeutic cycle), T3 (week 20, after the second therapeutic cycle), T4 (week 34: start of third therapeutic cycle), T5 (week 37, after the third therapeutic cycle) and T6 (week 51).</p></sec><sec id="d29e485"><title><italic>Neurophysiology</italic></title><p>Neurophysiological measurements were carried out at T&#x02212;1, T1, T2, T4 and T6. Before the start of the study a common operative protocol for the electro-neurophysiological measurements was developed by a panel chaired by the Neurophysiology Coordinating Centre, responsible for the central reading of all neurophysiological measurements, and formed by all the neurophysiologists responsible for the neurophysiological measurements at study centres. The panel was based at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, but panel members were not involved in the conduction of the clinical trial. The protocol detailed the devices to be used, the test procedures and the environmental conditions required to obtain standardised study measurements. Neurophysiological variables recorded locally were transmitted to the Neurophysiology Coordinating Centre for reading, validation and data quality assurance. Measurements included motor NCV of the tibial and deep peroneal nerves, and sensory NCV of the sural nerve. The z scores of conduction velocity, latency, amplitude and F wave were also measured in all three nerves.</p></sec><sec id="d29e491"><title><italic>Pain</italic></title><p>Pain was assessed at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6.

FREMS had no significant effect on the NCV of the peroneal, tibial or sural nerves (the primary endpoint of the study), was safe and resulted in a significant reduction in both daytime and night-time pain in patients with symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy.</p><p>The effect of FREMS on the pain of diabetic polyneuropathy was notable, with significantly reduced VAS score at the end of all three FREMS treatment series for both night-time and daytime pain, compared with placebo. However, the beneficial effect on pain was not sustained, since the VAS score for both night-time pain and daytime pain had returned toward the baseline value 3 months after the end of the last FREMS treatment series, possibly suggesting the need for repeated treatments to maintain a clinically meaningful effect on pain over time. On the other hand, it should be emphasised that, compared with pharmacological treatment for neuropathic pain, FREMS shows a proportion of 50% responders, as high as the first-line drugs duloxetine and pregabalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with the advantage of having no relevant side effects, and requiring intermittent instead of daily treatment. In fact, although patients reported some perceptions at the site of electrode placement during treatment later revealed as FREMS, and this sensation was not perceived by patients randomised to receive placebo treatment, no real side effects were associated with FREMS. Moreover, although the dropout rate during the study was not negligible, it was not treatment related, as suggested by the fact that it was higher in the placebo arm than in the FREMS arm (35.7% and 27.8%, respectively) and caused by the burden associated with study participation.</p><p>This clinical trial confirms the efficacy of FREMS in reducing the pain of diabetic polyneuropathy, as previously reported, but replicates only in part the findings of the pilot study in which NCV, tactile sensation and vibration perception thresholds were also significantly improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In particular NCV, the primary endpoint of this study, is unchanged after FREMS treatment. These discrepancies are likely explained, at least in part, by the different severity of diabetic polyneuropathy in the two study populations. The participants in the early pilot study had severe peripheral diabetic neuropathy, with significantly reduced NCVs (motor NCV was 35&#x02013;36&#x000a0;m/s; sensory NCV was 27&#x02013;29&#x000a0;m/s) and many patients were without evocable potentials (motor NCV was measurable in 84%, sensory NCV in 48% of participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For participants to be eligible for inclusion in the present trial, NCV had to be measurable for all the three nerves investigated (deep peroneal, tibial and sural). This led to the selection of individuals with a less-severe diabetic neuropathy with only mild impairment of NCVs at baseline (mean NCVs in the range of 40.1&#x02013;43.8&#x000a0;m/s; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which, in turn, leaves a limited margin for improvement in response to an active treatment, thus requiring a higher number of patients to show significant differences. The relatively low proportion of patients taking specific medications for painful neuropathy at baseline, with few prescription changes during follow-up, also reflects a less-severe diabetic neuropathy in the patients enrolled in this study. Therefore, patients with severe neuropathy are likely to benefit from FREMS more than patients with milder impairment of NCV.</p><p>The effects of FREMS on thermal, vibration and tactile sensations were also inconclusive, with a significant improvement of cold sensation thresholds and non-significant effects on other variables.</p><p>FREMS, being based on TENS methodology, falls within the generic definition of TENS; nevertheless, the electrical stimulus in FREMS significantly differs from those commonly used in other known electrotherapies, mainly TENS apparatuses. FREMS provides sequences of biphasic electrical stimuli that vary simultaneously and automatically in frequency, pulse duration and amplitude, reaching relatively high intensity (300&#x000a0;V) in association with a very short duration (10&#x02013;100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s), maintaining electrical balance in the tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This feature is novel with respect to existing electrotherapies, which are normally based on &#x02018;geometrical&#x02019; waveforms characterised by lower peak intensity and higher pulse duration. Regarding FREMS, it should be emphasised that specific new mechanisms of action have been described, such as enhancement of microvascular blood flow measured by laser doppler flowmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], increase in vasomotor activity mediated by smooth cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and release of vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These reports collectively suggest a possible improvement in endoneural blood flow induced by FREMS to explain its effects on neuropathy. Due to lack of data, it is not known at present whether and to what extent the basic mechanism of FREMS is similar to or different from those underlying TENS and other electrotherapies; in fact, although the latter have long been investigated and used in clinical practice, the foundation of their therapeutic effect is unknown and largely assumed to be based on interference with the pain gate control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Future studies will hopefully clarify this important issue.</p><p>A relevant aspect to take into account when considering any new treatment is cost. In this context the cost of FREMS is similar to that of TENS and likely lower than that of the most expensive pharmacological treatments. However, proper cost-effectiveness studies of different treatments for diabetic neuropathy are still lacking and should be conducted in the future, as recently recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A strength of this study is its design, which included double-blind masking, a placebo arm, three repeated series of treatment and an overall follow-up period of almost 1 year. These design features are quite unique in the spectrum of the clinical trials testing electrotherapies for diabetic neuropathy. A limitation of our study is that the criteria for inclusion did select patients with relatively mild symptomatic painful neuropathy and, therefore, our finding may not apply to patients with more severe diabetic neuropathy.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study confirm that FREMS is safe and leads to pain relief and improvement in cold sensation threshold in diabetic patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="125_2012_2795_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><label>ESM Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(PDF 19&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="125_2012_2795_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><label>ESM Fig. 2</label><caption><p>(PDF 8&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="125_2012_2795_MOESM3_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><label>ESM Table 1</label><caption><p>(PDF 18&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Members of the FREMS European Trial Study Group panel for the measurement of electrophysiological variables were G.
