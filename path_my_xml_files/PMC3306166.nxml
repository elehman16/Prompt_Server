Patients with a definite non-RA diagnosis were excluded. The protocol of the aggressive group aimed for remission (DAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.6), with consecutive treatment steps: MTX, addition of adalimumab and combination therapy. The conventional care group followed a strategy with traditional DMARDs (no prednisone or biologics) without DAS-based guideline. Outcome measures after 2 years were SHS (primary), remission rate and HAQ score (secondary).</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> Eighty-two patients participated (60% ACPA positive). In the aggressive group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42), 19 patients were treated with adalimumab. In the conventional care group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40), 24 patients started with hydroxychloroquin (HCQ), 2 with sulfasalazine (SSZ) and 14 with MTX. After 2 years, the median SHS increase was 0 [interquartile range (IQR) 0&#x02013;1.1] and 0.5 (IQR 0&#x02013;2.5), remission rates were 66 and 49% and HAQ decreased with a mean of &#x02212;0.09 (0.50) and &#x02212;0.25 (0.59) in the aggressive and conventional care group, respectively. All comparisons were non-significant.</p><p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> In patients with early arthritis of two to five joints, both aggressive tight-control therapy including adalimumab and conventional therapy resulted in remission rates around 50%, low radiographic damage and excellent functional status after 2 years. However, full disease control including radiographic arrest in all patients remains an elusive target even in moderately active early arthritis.</p><p><bold>Trial registration.</bold> Dutch Trial Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/">http://www.trialregister.nl/</ext-link>, NTR 144.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>early arthritis</kwd><kwd>rheumatoid</kwd><kwd>TNF</kwd><kwd>treatment strategy</kwd><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>trial</kwd><kwd>STREAM</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The early and aggressive treatment of patients with RA is increasingly successful, particularly with combinations of DMARDs containing anti-TNF therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B1 ker355-B2 ker355-B3 ker355-B4 ker355-B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>]. Among the results are percentages of sustained remission of &#x0223c;40%, excellent functional status and nearly complete arrest of radiological damage progression. In an attempt to explain these better results than had been attained before in RA of longer duration, the concept of a window of opportunity was proposed, suggesting that early suppression of active inflammation produces long-term benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Intensive therapy, preferably with a combination of drugs, therefore, is a well-established treatment strategy for patients with early active RA. However, the optimal strategy for patients presenting with only a few inflamed joints is not yet clear. This category of patients is more difficult to study due to the problem of classifying these patients as having RA or undifferentiated arthritis (UA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B7">7</xref>]. In recognition of this issue, a combined task force of ACR and EULAR has developed new classification criteria for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B8">8</xref>]. One of the objectives of these criteria is to increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis RA in early UA in order to facilitate the conduction of clinical trials in this category of patients. Other aspects to consider in trials in this group of patients are that around half of patients with UA will remit within 1&#x02013;2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B9 ker355-B10 ker355-B11 ker355-B12 ker355-B13">9&#x02013;13</xref>], that it is inherently less possible to demonstrate a reduction of an already low disease activity, and finally that any toxicity of treatment is less acceptable since it is occurring in patients with only mildly active disease.</p><p>In a preceding study, we have shown that patients with more severe forms of UA are under-treated in comparison with patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B9">9</xref>]. One clinical trial has shown that UA patients treated with MTX <italic>vs</italic> placebo have less progression to RA (according to 1987 ACR criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B14">14</xref>]) and less progression of radiographic erosions, but these differences were confined to the subgroup of ACPA-positive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, in early RA good results can also be obtained with the milder drug hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B16">16</xref>]. The present 2-year trial [Strategies in Early Arthritis Management (STREAM)] investigated whether the approach of early aggressive therapy was also effective in arthritis patients presenting with only moderately active disease, i.e. in those patients who would not meet the usual inclusion criteria for trials in active RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years, with a symptom duration of &#x02264;2 years. In addition, they had to have two to five swollen joints and a total Sharp&#x02013;van der Heijde radiographic score (SHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B17">17</xref>] &#x0003c;5. Patients did not have to meet the 1987 ACR criteria for RA. Exclusion criteria were prior treatment with a DMARD, except for HCQ, the use of CSs in the last 3 months or an IA injection with CSs in the last month. In addition, patients with bacterial arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, PsA, ReA, OA or arthritis due to sarcoidosis or another systemic autoimmune disease other than RA, as well as pregnant patients and patients with a wish to conceive during the study were excluded. The patients were recruited from the rheumatology clinics of the Jan van Breemen Institute and the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The study was approved by the local institutional review board [Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie van Slotervaartziekenhuis en Reade (formerly Jan van Breemen Institute)] and all patients gave written informed consent. The trial registration number is NTR 144.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and treatment algorithm</title><p>The study was designed as analogous to the Behandel Strategie&#x000eb;n (BeSt) study of treatment strategies in early active RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B3">3</xref>], and compared two treatment strategies in a single-blind clinical trial. Whereas in the BeSt study the criterion for a change of therapy was a DAS &#x0003e;2.4, here we used a lower DAS threshold for a change of therapy of 1.6, as disease activity is inherently lower in this group of patients. Also, the goal of the intervention was to achieve and maintain remission, which is defined as a DAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The patients were randomized in blocks of 10 into one of two treatment groups: (i) aggressive therapy and (ii) conventional care. In the aggressive group, therapy was aimed at achieving and maintaining a DAS (44-joint score) of &#x0003c;1.6, which is considered to represent remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B18">18</xref>]. Every 3 months the DAS was performed by a research nurse who was blinded to the allocated treatment group. Treatment was started with oral MTX 15&#x02009;mg/week. If the DAS was &#x02265;1.6 at a given time point, the therapy was changed (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="ker355-T1">Table 1</xref>). The predefined steps were: increase in MTX to 25&#x02009;mg/week; MTX 25&#x02009;mg/week combined with adalimumab 40&#x02009;mg/2 week; MTX 25&#x02009;mg/week combined with adalimumab 40&#x02009;mg/week; a combination of MTX 25&#x02009;mg/week, SSZ 2000&#x02009;mg/day and HCQ 400&#x02009;mg/day; a combination of MTX 25&#x02009;mg/week, SSZ 2000&#x02009;mg/day, HCQ 400&#x02009;mg/day and prednisone 7.5&#x02009;mg/day; leflunomide (LEF) 20&#x02009;mg/day and i.m. gold 50&#x02009;mg/week. If the DAS was &#x0003c;1.6 at one time point the treatment remained unchanged. If the DAS was &#x0003c;1.6 at two consecutive time points the following actions were taken, depending on the treatment step where the patient was at that moment: MTX 15&#x02009;mg/week was decreased from 2.5&#x02009;mg/2 weeks to 0&#x02009;mg/week after 3 months; MTX 25&#x02009;mg/week was decreased from 2.5&#x02009;mg/2 weeks to 10&#x02009;mg/week after 3 months; adalimumab 40&#x02009;mg/2 weeks was stopped; adalimumab 40&#x02009;mg/week was decreased to 40&#x02009;mg/2 weeks; HCQ was decreased from 200&#x02009;mg/8 weeks to 0; if remission was sustained after 3 months SSZ was decreased subsequently from 500&#x02009;mg/4 weeks to 0; if remission was sustained after 3 months MTX was decreased from 2.5&#x02009;mg/2 weeks to 0; prednisone 7.5&#x02009;mg/day was decreased to 0&#x02009;mg in 7 weeks; LEF was decreased to 10&#x02009;mg/day; and if remission was sustained after 3 months LEF was stopped; gold was decreased to 50&#x02009;mg/2 weeks, if DAS remained &#x0003c;1.6; and gold was decreased to 50&#x02009;mg/4 weeks; if remission was sustained, gold was stopped. If at any time point the DAS was &#x02265;1.6 the last effective treatment was restarted. In case of intolerance to a DMARD, the highest tolerated dose was used and, if DAS was &#x02265;1.6 at the next visit, the patient went on to the next step.

The rheumatologist had access to the DAS, but was not prompted to make treatment decisions based on the DAS. In order to maintain a certain amount of homogeneity in the treatment of the conventional care group, and to maintain contrast between the groups in terms of therapy, the following order of drugs was suggested to the treating rheumatologist: HCQ, SSZ, MTX and LEF. Furthermore, the treating physician could only change therapy if the DAS was &#x0003e;2.4 at the 3-month assessment time points and after consulting the trial supervisor (D.vS.). During the course of the inclusion period (June 2004&#x02013;2007), the conventional care of RA became more aggressive in general. Therefore, from August 2005 onwards, after the inclusion of 25 patients, the treating physician was allowed to start therapy with MTX in the conventional care group if deemed necessary. IA CS injections were not regulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Every 3 months the DAS was assessed by a research nurse. Questionnaires for physical function, i.e. the HAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B19">19</xref>] and short-form 36 (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B20">20</xref>] were completed yearly. Side effects were documented and divided into adverse events or serious adverse events. Serious adverse events were defined as any adverse reaction resulting in any of the following outcomes: a life-threatening condition or death, a significant or permanent disability, a malignancy, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, a congenital abnormality or a birth defect. Radiographs of hands, wrists and feet were obtained at baseline, 1 and 2 years. All radiographs were read separately by two experienced rheumatologists, who were unaware of the identity of the patient and of the treatment group, and the mean values were used. The radiographs were read according to time sequence and scored according to the Sharp&#x02013;van der Heijde method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B17">17</xref>]. Before reading the trial radiographs, the two readers (D.vS. and Dr Pieter Prins) separately read 22 sets of radiographs of hands and feet from which an intra-class correlation coefficient of 95% was calculated. BMD of the femoral neck and spine was assessed by DXA at baseline and 2 years. The trial physician (I.C.vE.) verified adherence to the protocol every 3 months. All protocol deviations were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was the progression of radiographic joint damage at 2 years. Radiographic progression was assessed in two manners: the absolute difference in Sharp score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B21">21</xref>] and the development of new erosions between baseline and 2 years. Erosions were diagnosed if any individual joint incorporated in the SHS showed bone cortex disruption on radiographs of hands and/or feet in anteroposterior projection. Secondary endpoints included differences between the two treatment strategies after 2 years regarding DAS, the percentage of patients in clinical remission (DAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.6), HAQ and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>For the sample size calculation we looked at the appearance of new erosions in the first 2 years of treatment in 152 patients of the early arthritis clinic of the Jan van Breemen Institute who had two to five swollen joints and no erosions at their first visit in the period before the design of the study (1995&#x02013;2003). Since SHSs were not available for this group, we used the radiologist's report and found a frequency of 37%. We hypothesized a frequency of new erosions of 10% in the aggressive group and calculated a sample size of 80 (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, Zb&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.824, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38 per group leads to power 80%).</p><p>Missing data for the primary and secondary endpoints were treated as follows: absence of a radiograph of hand and feet or HAQ score at 2 years was defined as missing. If a patient developed erosions on radiographs at 1 year but the 2-year radiographs were missing, that patient was included in the analysis as erosion developer. If a DAS score at 2 years was lacking it was replaced by the DAS score at 21 months (the principle of last observation carried forward) if available, otherwise it was missing. All available data were included for intention-to-treat analysis. Six patients had follow-up radiographs at 1 year but not at 2 years. Of these, four had radiographs taken after 3 years, and these were unchanged in comparison with the radiographs at 1 year. Therefore the radiographic scores in these four patients were analysed as if the radiographs had been taken at 2 years. Data are expressed as mean (<sc>s.d.</sc>) or median (range) as appropriate. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare continuous normally distributed variables between groups. Non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney U tests were used when appropriate. For dichotomous variables, Pearson's chi-square test was used. A two-tailed probability value of <italic>P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.05 was considered statistically significant. <italic>P</italic>-values were not adjusted for multiple statistical tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Randomization of 82 patients created generally balanced groups (aggressive group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42, conventional care group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40), with a mean age of 47 years and a mean symptom duration of 6 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ker355-T2">Table 2</xref>). ACPA was present equally in both groups. In the aggressive group, there was a higher percentage of RF positivity and of fulfilment of the 1987 ACR criteria for RA, whereas in the conventional care group there was a higher mean DAS and CRP. Two patients in the aggressive group discontinued adherence to the protocol within 3 months after randomization (but were not lost to follow-up): one patient decided directly after randomization not to take any anti-rheumatic drugs and one patient stopped taking MTX after an episode of fever that required hospitalization and was ascribed to MTX use.

In the aggressive group, one patient was hospitalized for fever during MTX therapy, classified as drug-induced fever. Another patient was hospitalized twice: once for fever during adalimumab therapy and once for active RA and a rash based on acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, attributed to adalimumab. In the conventional care group, one patient was hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems, which were attributed to MTX therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this trial of an aggressive <italic>vs</italic> a conventional approach to early arthritis of two to five joints, most patients had an excellent outcome with respect to disease activity, functionality and radiographic damage regardless of the treatment group they were randomized to. A minority of patients in both groups experienced radiographic progression despite treatment with higher dose MTX and despite being in remission at most time points. There were also a substantial number of adverse events, especially in the aggressive group.</p><p>The radiological results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ker355-F2">Fig. 2</xref>) give rise to the expectation that the difference between the groups would have been significant (in favour of the aggressive group) if the sample size had been larger, thus suggesting a lack of statistical power. In addition, not all patients had radiographs at the 2-year point. In our view, the main reason for the lack of statistically significant differences in the outcome parameters between the groups is that the gradual intensification of the conventional care during the course of the study, including a higher number of CS injections in that group, led to less contrast in therapy between the groups and to a lower than originally expected rate of radiographic damage in the conventional care group (24% observed instead of 37% expected new erosions), whereas the aggressive group achieved a 13% rate of new erosions, which is near to the 10% that had been assumed for the power calculation. The general trend in the treatment of (rheumatoid) arthritis is towards earlier and more aggressive treatment. At the time the study was designed in 2003, both study arms were acceptable for the participating rheumatologists. During the study, however, the conventional care needed to be intensified to accommodate changing views, and presently even the aggressive arm is considered to be not so aggressive, since adalimumab therapy was postponed until 6 months in non-responders. Furthermore, although ACPA positivity was equal among the groups, the study was not designed to separately analyse ACPA-positive and -negative subgroups, which were less prominently seen as important subgroups during the design phase of the study.</p><p>There were some drawbacks to using DAS-steered treatment aiming for remission (DAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.6). Three patients had significant radiographic progression, although they were in DAS remission most of the time. As has been noted before, clinical remission is no guarantee for radiological remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B22">22</xref>], although a recent review showed that patients who achieve remission, defined in any way, will generally develop less radiological damage and deterioration of physical function compared with patients not reaching remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B23">23</xref>]. Secondly, it occurred a few times during the course of the study that patients without any swollen joints would proceed to the next step of high-dose MTX or adalimumab because they had a DAS &#x02265;1.6 due to a high value of the DAS component of patient-reported general health. In a number of cases, based on this, the treating physician refused to intensify treatment. In light of the intensity of treatment needed to achieve these results, the number of adverse events that occurred (in both groups, but more so in the aggressive group) calls to mind the task of the physician to weigh the possible benefits of treatment against the possibility of causing harm. A related issue is the value of the DAS as a measure of remission in RA; although the DAS can be &#x0003e;1.6 while joints are neither swollen nor tender, the opposite also occurs: a patient reaches DAS remission in the presence of tender and/or swollen joints. In this case, one might better speak of minimal disease activity rather than remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B24">24</xref>]. Although most patients treated with biologic therapies seem to experience a virtual halt of radiographic progression, regardless of disease activity, even with biologic agents, a slight progression of joint damage can be observed with increasing disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B26">26</xref>]. A problem is that current methods, such as the SHS, for identifying progression are insensitive in the setting of very low progression rates, since the smallest detectable difference is 5 SHS points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical methods are also unreliable in the setting of very low disease activity. Subclinical joint inflammation, which can be detected by US and MRI in patients in clinical remission can mostly explain any ongoing radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B27">27</xref>]. It therefore remains possible that the observed reduction in association between disease activity and radiological damage is in fact explained by subclinical synovitis. This brings up the question, what is <italic>real</italic> remission? For this purpose, the ACR and EULAR have recently constituted a committee charged with the task to redefine remission in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Other trials in early oligoarthritis or UA have noted some benefit from treatment with i.m. or IA CSs compared with placebo or NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B30">30</xref>], although a recent study observed that neither remission nor development of RA was delayed by i.m. glucocorticoid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B31">31</xref>]. Three months of infliximab did not prevent progression to RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B32">32</xref>] after 1 year, nor did abatacept monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B33">33</xref>], although abatacept had an impact on radiographic and MRI inhibition, which was maintained for 6 months after treatment stopped. MTX was successful in postponing the diagnosis of RA after 1.5 years, as well as in retarding radiological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B15">15</xref>]. The positive results of the latter study were confined to the subgroup of ACPA-positive patients. In these trials, adverse events were generally not a problem.</p><p>Since the present study has not demonstrated a functional or radiological benefit of aggressive over conventional treatment, we cannot recommend aggressive therapy in all patients presenting with two to five swollen joints. The benefit of aggressive treatment in early inflammatory arthritis is not as evident as it is in polyarthritis, and many patients achieved good results, including prevention of erosive disease, with HCQ only, as has been found before in early RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B34">34</xref>]. The treatment of oligoarthritis should ideally depend on an accurate prediction of prognosis. The most important prognostic factors are ACPA and radiographic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ker355-B35">35</xref>]. These data, combined with the results of the present study, may suggest that in patients with early inflammatory arthritis a radiographic-driven therapy may be superior to the widely used DAS-driven therapy in reducing structural joint damage, but more research is needed to further refine prediction and thus guide therapy at the individual level.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="ker355b1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Pieter Prins for reading radiographs and the research nurses Mrs Elleke de Wit-Taen, Mrs Veronique van de Lugt and Mrs Anne-Marie Abrahams for collecting clinical data.</p><p><italic>Funding</italic>: The study was financially supported by <funding-source>Abbott</funding-source>.</p><p><italic>Disclosure statement</italic>: B.A.C.D. has received research grants from Schering Plough, Abbott and Wyeth.
