This randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate the effects of integrative TCM conservative therapy for low back pain due to LDH. A total of 408 patients with low back pain due to LDH were randomly assigned to an experimental group with integrative TCM therapy and a control group with normal conservative treatment by the ratio of 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1. The primary outcome was the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS). The secondary outcome was the low back functional activities by Chinese Short Form Oswestry Disability Index (C-SFODI). Immediately after treatment, patients in the experimental group experienced significant improvements in VAS and C-SFODI compared with the control group (between-group difference in mean change from baseline, &#x02212;16.62 points, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in VAS; &#x02212;15.55 points, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in C-SFODI).

Introduction</title><p>Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common disease and a major contributing factor of low back pain [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although many studies have confirmed that surgery is more effective for LDH [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], conservative therapies have also been recognized for their therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Considering the fact that 20% of patients still have pain after surgery [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 7% to 15% of surgical patients may have failed back surgery syndrome [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and some patients are scared of surgery, conservative treatment is still one of the primary means for LDH.</p><p>In China, TCM is one of the main conservative treatments for LDH. Previous studies have confirmed that some TCM therapies have certain effects on low back pain due to LDH. These include acupuncture [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], oral administration of Chinese medicine [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], external application of Chinese medicine [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Chinese Tuina (massage) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and TCM-characteristic functional exercise [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Clinically, these therapeutic methods are not used alone but often in combination [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, the clinical pathway of treating LDH with integrative TCM therapy has attracted attention [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Shi's Traumatology Medical Center of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine is well recognized for its long-term commitment to the research on conservative treatment for LDH, coupled with a package protocol for LDH. However, high-quality research evidence is needed to support the effectiveness of the protocol.</p><p>This clinical trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of integrative TCM therapy for LDH and thus confirm its clinical effect. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Design</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of integrative TCM conservative treatment for patients with low back pain due to LDH. Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group by the ratio of 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 using computer-generated numbers. The randomized treatment assignments were sealed in opaque envelopes and opened individually for each patient who agreed to be in the study. The nurse, who had no role in the design and conduct of the study, prepared the envelopes. Patients in the experimental group were treated with integrative TCM therapy once a day, for two weeks, whereas patients in the control group were treated with a two-week normal conservative intervention. At baseline, immediately after treatment, one and six months after treatment, visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Chinese Short Form Oswestry Disability Index (C-SFODI) were used as outcome assessment. This trial is registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/en/proj/show.aspx?proj=63">ChiCTR-TRC-11001343</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Subjects</title><p>Patients were recruited from Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, and Yueyang Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between January 2011 and August 2012.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: (1) aging 20&#x02013;60 years; (2) having low back pain due to LDH (MRI scan confirmed lumbar disk herniation) and ruling out other relevant ongoing pathologies such as fractures, lumbar spondylolisthesis, tumor, osteoporosis, or infection; (3) willing to participate in this study and signing the informed consent.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: (1) having other pain syndromes; (2) experiencing a history of spinal surgery; (3) having neurological disease; (4) having psychiatric disease; (5) having serious chronic diseases that could interfere with the outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, or other disqualifying conditions); (6) scared of acupuncture; (7) pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study; (8) having other diseases that the researchers believe is not suitable for the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Treatment</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Experimental Group</title><p>Patients in the experimental group receive a two-week integrative TCM treatment. They were further divided into three subgroups (according to the duration from initial low back pain to getting treatment) for different treatment methods: acute stage (0&#x02013;14 days), subacute stage (15&#x02013;30 days), and chronic stage (&#x0003e;30 days).</p><p>

After the temperature cooled to 40~45&#x000b0;C, apply the back to the affected low back area for 30&#x02013;40 minutes, once a day. The hot compress can help circulate blood and resolve stasis.</p><p>
<italic>TCM Functional Exercise.</italic> The exercise is known as &#x0201c;Fei Yan Shi&#x0201d; (literally meaning <italic>&#x0201c;the flying swallow style</italic>&#x0201d;) in Chinese.</p><p>Method: Ask the patient to take a prone position, extend both hands backwards, lift the chest and lower limbs off the bed using the abdomen as a pivot, and then relax. Conduct this exercise once a day and repeat 4-5 times each time. </p><p>Functions: Strengthens the power of back muscles, increases the stability of the spine, and thus prevents relapses.</p><p>
<italic>Chinese Tuina (Massage).</italic> Ask the patient to take a prone position and find the tenderness spots on the low back. Then apply <italic>gun</italic>-rolling (10&#x02009;min), <italic>Anrou</italic>-pressing and kneading (10&#x02009;min), and <italic>Tanbo</italic>-plucking (5&#x02009;min) manipulation to the tenderness spots and surrounding areas.

Control Group</title><p>Patients in the control group receive a two-week normal conservative treatment [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Intervention measures include three sections, (1) health education. The patients were invited to receive LDH health education twice a week in outpatient; the health education was designed exclusively to inform patients about the natural course of their illness and the expectation of successful recovery, irrespective of the initial intensity of their pain, educate patients to avoid some bad habits that aggravate the disease, such as a sitting position for a long time and carrying heavy loads, and encourage patients to participate in social activities. (2) Rest: in addition to the normal sleep, the patients need to rest in bed for at least 1-2 hours a day. (3) Pain medication or physical therapy: after one week health education, if the patient's lower back pain without any relief or even aggravated, the prescription of pain medication was adjusted according to clinical guidelines [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], detailed records the type and dose of pain medication taken by patients. And if the patients do not want to take pain medication, then the patients were referred to a physiotherapist.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Measurements</title><p>All outcomes were assessed by observers unaware of the grouping, at baseline (M1), immediately after the last intervention (M2). The followup included the assessments at one month (M3) and six months (M4) after the last intervention.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the change in pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), scores range 0 to 100, and a higher score indicates a greater pain, 0 means no pain, and 100 means intolerable pain.</p><p>The secondary outcome measure was the change in the Chinese Short Form Oswestry Disability Index (C-SFODI), range 0 to 100%. The C-SFODI consists of nine questions, which come from Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); omit the sex life question in Section&#x02009;&#x02009;8, because this question is always unacceptable by Chinese. The C-SFODI calculation formula is actual cumulative score/45 &#x000d7; 100%, with higher percentage indicating more severe functional disability. And the study has shown that the C-SFODI has good reliability and validity [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Our pretrial power calculation indicated that 81 patients in experimental group were required to detect a difference in pain relief based on the preliminary experiment data at a significant level of 5% (a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test) with 80% power. In anticipation of a 20% attrition rate, we sought 102 patients at least in experimental group. Taking into account the poor effect of control therapy, 102 patients were included in the control group.</p><p>Between-group difference at baseline was analyzed using independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test or Chi-square test. Changes in continuous measures were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effects were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis (ITT), and participants who did not complete the followup period were considered not having any changes in scores. A two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) at M1 and as between-group difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) at M2, M3, and M4.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Quality Control</title><p>Before the beginning of the study, all researchers have to receive protocol training. A clinic research coordinator (CRC) was employed to assist researchers in each center. A monitor was also appointed to ensure the quality of the research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>Between January 2011 and August 2012, a total of 480 patients with low back pain due to LDH were recruited, 72 were rejected due to exclusion criterions, and 408 eligible patients were randomly assigned in accordance with the ratio of 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to the experimental group and the control group, 306 in the experimental group and 102 in the control group. Patients in the experimental group all completed a two-week treatment. In the control group, at the second week one patient in the control group was unwilling to continue to participate and withdrew his informed consent, and two patients took Fenbid (500&#x02009;mg for each dose, 2 doses a day) since the pain worsened during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

Adverse Events</title><p>One patient in the experiment group had mild fainting during acupuncture, remission by bed rest, and then completed the remaining treatment. Two patients in the control group were given Fenbid orally due to aggravated low back pain. No other adverse events were noted in either experimental group or control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Although the mechanism of low back pain caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is still not very clear, the prevailing view is that low back pain due to LDH was found to occur not only in response to mechanical stimuli but also to chemical irritation around the nerve root sheath and sinuvertebral nerve [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Different TCM therapies have different advantages in the treatment of LDH. Pain is the main symptom in the acute stage of LDH; acupuncture has good analgesic effect on low back pain due to LDH [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lumbar dysfunction is the main symptom in the remission stage; Chinese massage has good effect on improving dysfunction [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Oral Chinese herbal formulae [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], external use of Chinese medicine [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Chinese herbal injection [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also showed good effect in relieving pain and improving dysfunction caused by LDH. And one study also found that Salvia miltiorrhiza injection especially works better and faster for the acute stage when compared with mannitol [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the mechanism of acupuncture, Chinese massage, and traditional Chinese herbs in the treatment of LDH remains unclear, it is generally agreed that these treatment methods play a role by increasing local blood circulation, relieving nerve root edema, and speeding up the metabolism of the local inflammatory mediators. In recovery stage of the disease, the major task is to strengthen the muscles of the waist and abdomen to prevent relapse [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and TCM functional exercise has advantages in this regard and can subsequently increase the lumbar stability to prevent recurrence [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Treating LDH according to different stages has been more and more accepted. In China, LDH is mainly divided into three stages, including acute stage, subacute stage (or remission stage), and chronic stage (or recovery stage) [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies have proven that treating LDH according to different stages has obtained a good clinical effect [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, studies have also suggested that it can obtain a better effect than treatment without differentiating different stages [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>The past 20 years of clinical practice have witnessed the safety of the treatment regimens used in this study. At the same time, its efficacy has been preliminarily confirmed; however, high quality research evidence is still needed. In the treatment regimens, different TCM therapies were selected according to the characteristics of different stages. Specifically, acupuncture and Chinese herbal injections were used in the acute stage for fast pain relief, Chinese Tuina (massage) and external application of Chinese medicine were used in the subacute stage for improvement of the lumbar functions, and low back muscle exercise was used in the chronic stage to increase the stability of the spine and prevent relapses.</p><p>In China, nonsurgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation mainly uses drugs, physical therapy, or TCM treatment. TCM treatment used in the experimental group has been used in clinical routine and is considered to have good clinical efficacy; the efficacy of conservative treatment used in the control group is considered very weak, usually as auxiliary treatment of other therapies. Ethics Committee considers that in order to maximize the protection of the interests of the patients, it is necessary to let the patients have more opportunity to receive TCM treatment, so in this research the sample size of the experimental group and the control group is 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1.</p><p>The findings of this study have shown that immediately and one month after intervention, integrative TCM conservative treatment can significantly reduce the VAS scores and C-SFODI, and at six month after intervention, integrative TCM conservative treatment can also significantly reduce the C-SFODI, but two groups have no significant difference in reducing VAS score. VAS is an international general pain visual analog scale, and C-SFODI is the improved version of the ODI (Oswestry Disability Index), and it consists of 9 questions, a higher percentage indicating a more severe functional disability.</p><p>Regarding adverse events, one patient had mild fainting in the experiment group, two patients in the control group were given Fenbid oral due to low back pain aggravation, and no other adverse events were noted in either experimental group or control group. The mechanism of integrative TCM conservative treatment for LDH remains unclear, and it will be our future research orientation.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the short followup time.
