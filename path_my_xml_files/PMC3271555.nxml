Recent publications report rates of VAP as 10.4 cases per 1000 ventilator days after the introduction of multiple interventions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The introduction of an electronic dashboard for monitoring ventilator bundle compliance has reduced the incidence of VAP to 9.3 cases per 1,000 ventilator days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Alcohol-based hand rub and hand hygiene are also included as part of ventilator care bundle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Hand hygiene is an effective strategy for the prevention of HAIs. Hand rubs may be an alternative to hand washing,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and are the first choice according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Studies have shown that an alcohol-based antiseptic rub decontaminates hands effectively for a wide variety of organisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The objective of the present study is to assess the effect of alcohol-based hand rub on tracheobronchial colonization and VAP rate after elective neurosurgical procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was undertaken in the Neurosurgical Department of a 239-bed tertiary-level referral hospital in Kerala, India. This department has a bed strength of 50, which consists of a 37-bedded ward and a 13-bedded ICU, and performs approximately 1300 elective adult and pediatric neurosurgical procedures annually. Majority of these procedures are performed under general endotracheal anesthesia and the patients&#x02019; trachea are extubated in the operating room itself. However, some of these patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation and are cared initially in the NSICU and later transferred to the intermediate ICU/neurosurgical ward. Tracheal aspirate is sent for bacterial culture and sensitivity at the time of tracheal extubation or after 48 h of tracheal intubation. All mechanically ventilated neurosurgical patients are maintained on semirecumbent position (30&#x000b0;-45&#x000b0; elevation of the head end of the bed) unless contraindicated, stress ulcer prophylaxis using H<sub>2</sub> receptor blocking agent and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis measures. These patients also received chlorhexidine (0.2%) oral care twice a day. The anesthetists practice early weaning and early tracheal extubation. Nurses provide complete care to patients on mechanical ventilators. Nurses performed sterile endotracheal suctioning using single-use suction catheters, and used separate suction catheters for oral suctioning. Closed method of endotracheal suctioning was not in practice. Parenteral antimicrobial agents were started shortly before operation and discontinued after 2 days. In this department, health care workers used soap and water for maintaining hand hygiene, and the use of alcohol-based hand rub was limited to decontaminating hands before invasive procedures. The infection control nurse (ICN) of the institute maintained the concurrent record of VAPs by direct method of surveillance, based on CDC criteria.</p><p>The details of the infection control protocol implementation are reported elsewhere.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] To summarise, we inculcated the habit of using chlorhexidine/alcohol skin antiseptic with emollient and moisturizer before and after each patient contact through a series of lectures, demonstrations and hand hygiene promoting posters. The easy accessibility of alcohol-based hand rub at the bed side promoted its use by all the health care workers before and after each patient contact, including suctioning/manipulation of ventilator circuits. The implementation phase extended from October 2006 to December 2006.</p><p>VAP is defined as pneumonia in a patient intubated and ventilated at the time of or within 48 h before the onset of the event.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The VAP rate is defined as the number of VAP per 1000 ventilator days. In the present study, VAP was considered to be present when such a condition was diagnosed and treated based on clinical and chest X-ray criteria combined with positive culture of tracheal aspirate in neurosurgical patients who were on mechanical ventilator during the study period. The rest of the cases, where only the tracheal aspirate was positive, were considered separately as tracheobronchial colonization.</p><p>To determine the number of ventilator days, the CDC recommends that the data on number of patients receiving mechanical ventilation be collected daily at the same time each day by specific surveillance units. The specific time of day at which to determine the presence of a ventilator however is not given. In this study, 3 pm was taken as the monitoring time for calculating the number of patients on ventilator, taking into account the shift change of the nurses at 3 pm. The change of shift nurses&#x02019; record would indicate whether the patient was on mechanical ventilator or not. In addition, each patient's actual number of ventilator days was also calculated from the time of tracheal intubation to either tracheal extubation or discontinuation of positive-pressure ventilation, whichever is earlier. Ventilator days for patients whose trachea were reintubated during the same hospitalization were added together to avoid duplication of patients. The primary author did these calculations by referring each patient's medical records (anesthesia record, nurses&#x02019; record). Number of hospital days, post-operative days and ICU days were also calculated from the medical records. Positive-pressure ventilation for more than 48 h is considered as prolonged ventilation. The supply of alcohol-based hand rub to the NSICU was reviewed from the pharmacy supply records.</p><p>An observational study (before&#x02013;after design) was undertaken. The duration of the study extended from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2006 to 30<sup>th</sup> September 2007, excluding the infection control protocol implementation period from October to December 2006.</p><p>The patients in the before intervention group (control group) included all patients who were admitted to the NSICU and were on mechanical ventilator after neurosurgery during the 9 months between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2006 and 30<sup>th</sup> September 2006 before protocol implementation. The patients in the intervention group included all patients who were admitted to the NSICU and were on mechanical ventilator after neurosurgery during the 9 months between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2007 and 30<sup>th</sup> September 2007 after protocol implementation. We excluded the patients who had undergone neurosurgery during the transition period of protocol implementation (October&#x02013;December 2006).</p><p>The operating theater registers of the Department of Neurosurgery covering the study period were reviewed for getting the patients&#x02019; details like age, sex, diagnosis, type of surgical intervention and evidence of subsequent repeat surgery. The tracheal aspirate culture and sensitivity reports of these patients were reviewed from the records of the Department of Microbiology. HAI data maintained by the ICN were reviewed. The medical records of those patients whose tracheal aspirates were cultured were counterchecked for evidence of VAP, tracheobronchial colonization, calculating ventilator days, duration of ICU stay, post-operative stay, hospital stay and discharge status, as discussed earlier.</p><p>The <italic>t</italic> test, chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were carried out to assess statistical significance of the comparisons. For the VAP rates, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistics version 17.0 and OpenEpi version 2.3.1. A <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 or less was the criterion used to conclude statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 352 patients, 177 in the control group and 175 in the intervention group, who required mechanical ventilation.
