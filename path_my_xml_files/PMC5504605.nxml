Although there are many tools available to assess patients&#x02019; responses to illness and treatment, vital signs (VS) are the primary indicator of physiological status and the most common assessment technique employed in health care. If physiological signs of deterioration are missed, misinterpreted or mismanaged, then serious adverse events (SAEs) such as critical illness, cardiac arrest, unplanned intensive care admissions and death may result. Identification of abnormal VS can assist in the detection of at-risk patients minutes to hours before the occurrence of SAEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. VS measurement and escalation of care is fundamental to patient safety and the first step in patient rescue.</p><p id="Par32">International evidence highlights the severity of adverse outcomes when VS are not recognised as abnormal or responded to appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An Australian study found that the presence of three or more abnormal VS was associated with a 19-fold increase in mortality risk as compared to patients with a single abnormal VS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since 1995, Australia has led the way in system redesign, countering the morbidity and mortality associated with failure to rescue. One strategy, rapid response systems (RRS) and in particular medical emergency teams (MET) takes critical care expertise to the wards when predetermined activation criteria (VS and other measurements) are met. The success of MET and impact on patient outcomes depends on activation actually occurring when indicated. However, we have shown that this does not always occur with 3&#x02013;53% of patients meeting criteria for activation actually receiving a RRS call [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Failure to call the RRS for patients fulfilling activation criteria occurs despite the release of international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the prioritisation of Standard 9 (recognition and response to clinical deterioration in acute health care) as one of the ten National Quality and Safety Health Service (NQSHS) Standards required for Australian hospital accreditation from 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A significant gap between current evidence and practice exists.</p><p id="Par33">In our survey of 1688 patients in 10 acute care hospitals, the prevalence of patients fulfilling MET criteria in the 24&#x000a0;h prior to data collection was 5.3% and on the day of observation was 3.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Of the 55 patients who fulfilled the MET criteria, only 2 (3.6%) had a MET call activated within 24&#x000a0;h. Patients who fulfilled MET criteria at the time of vital sign acquisition were more likely to die in hospital (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 7.15) or within 30&#x000a0;days (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.64; 95% CI 1.37 to 5.11). Our research has also shown the incidence of patients fulfilling MET calling criteria to be 14.4% during their hospital admission, and of those patients, only 2.9% received a MET call. Further, patients who fulfilled MET activation criteria had double the hospital length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, timely and effective intervention is critical.</p><p id="Par34">Although a growing body of international evidence demonstrates the benefit of early recognition and management of deteriorating patients, suboptimal management has serious consequences and represents a research-practice gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One recent study further highlighted this gap in a sample of 422 patients; escalation was indicated on 109 occasions, yet contrary to hospital policy, only 58 (53%) were escalated appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This failure to escalate and manage patients concurs with our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and others internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is a need to understand the causes, mechanisms and strategies to overcome the problem using knowledge translation (KT) frameworks.</p><p id="Par35">One widely researched and used KT framework is <italic>the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services</italic> (PARIHS) Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which views implementation as a dynamic and multi-faceted process. The proposition is that successful implementation is a function of the nature and type of evidence, the qualities of the context in which the evidence is being introduced, and the way the process is facilitated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although many strategies are thought to be effective in promoting individual and organisational change, the change agent role is believed to be a key ingredient for KT. Additionally, systematic reviews have found educational outreach of practice facilitation in health care have improved patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par36">This knowledge translation study uses a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial (C-RCT) design, with process evaluation and cost consequence analysis, to measure the clinical effectiveness and costs of a facilitation intervention to improve nurses&#x02019; VS measurement, interpretation, treatment and escalation of patients with abnormal VS. We will compare outcomes and costs from standard implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to facilitated implementation of CPGs.

All are acute, major metropolitan teaching hospitals that have more than 400 beds, employ over 1300 nurses and cover both acute and specialist services. Sponsorship for the study was sought from the Executive Directors of Nursing and Chief Executive Officers of each hospital prior to the funding application. Within each hospital, eight to ten wards will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control groups; the intervention will be delivered at ward level. Each ward is considered a cluster for the purpose of analysis. Wards will be eligible for inclusion if they contain 18 or more beds and they receive support from the hospital&#x02019;s MET. Critical care, emergency, paediatrics, maternity, peri-operative and psychiatric areas will be excluded because they use an alternative response system for patient deterioration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample/participants</title><p id="Par48">All staff working within study wards and whose role is direct care delivery will be involved in the study. Each ward has a permanent staff, reducing the likelihood of contamination from staff movement. Nurse managers (NM) will recruit staff to participate in focus groups or individual interviews for the process evaluation; the RA will obtain consent. Medical records of patients from participating wards will be audited over three randomly selected 24-h periods during 1&#x000a0;week at three time points (baseline, immediately post-intervention and 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention) to identify all ward patients in a 24-h period who have abnormal VS. These cohorts of patients will be followed up for the duration of their hospital stay and analysed according to ward (intervention or control), irrespective of subsequent ward transfers that may occur using the principles of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par49">From a medical record review in one of the sites, the rate of adherence to escalation policy after abnormal VS measurement was 53% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sample size calculations are based on a 50% rate of adherence to escalation as per hospital policy. To detect a 20% improvement in adherence rate in the intervention group immediately following and 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention, 270 documented abnormal VSs per time point per study arm are required. Our sample size has been inflated to allow for a design effect of 1.5, accounting for within-patient autocorrelation and within ward clustering effect. Type I error is set at a 1% significance level accounting for multiple comparisons and study power is set to 90%. For secondary outcomes, we have 80% power to detect an odds ratio of at least 1.8 in post-intervention comparisons for an improved adherence rate in the intervention compared to the control group. For all other secondary outcomes, power calculations have been based on combining immediately following intervention and 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention data. For the unplanned ICU admission rate, a minimum of 0.3% difference (1.2 vs 0.9%); for MET call rate a minimum of 2.3% absolute difference (3 vs 0.7%); and at least 1.6&#x000a0;day (IQR&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) median absolute difference (12 vs 10.4) for hospital LOS is detectable at 80% power. Due to a low incidence of cardio-respiratory arrests and hospital mortality, a power analysis is based on combining mortality and code blue, resulting in 80% power to detect a minimum 2.3% absolute difference (3 vs 0.7%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par50">Random 1:1 block randomisation of wards within hospitals to intervention or control groups will be undertaken.

This will include information on the CPG, its availability online, as well as notification of the free online educational courses available to increase their knowledge and understanding about the identification and management of deteriorating patients. Information will be provided to each NM for dissemination to ward staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention group</title><p id="Par52">The intervention group ward staff will receive the standard implementation of CPGs as described above plus the facilitation intervention for practice improvement (FLIP). FLIP comprises individuals in facilitator roles using facilitation methods and processes in a flexible way to tailor implementation strategies to the local ward context, according to identified barriers and enablers.</p><p id="Par53">There will be two types of internal facilitator roles: hospital facilitators (HFLIP) and ward facilitators (WFLIP). A hospital facilitator will be appointed to cover four or five intervention wards in each of the four hospitals, acting as the overall facilitation lead and coordinator and mentor for the ward facilitators in each hospital. In each intervention ward, two ward facilitators will be appointed to support and enable ward nurses to implement the CPGs into practice (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;36). Each HFLIP will be prepared and supported by an external expert in facilitation (GH). Each HFLIP will work with eight to ten WFLIPs. The facilitation intervention is underpinned by the PARIHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and i-PARIHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] frameworks.</p><p id="Par54">Training and a toolkit of methods and techniques will be given to all FLIPs to promote the transfer of CPGs into daily practice. The intervention wards will receive 5&#x000a0;h per week support from the HFLIP for 6&#x000a0;months, reviewing barriers and enablers to implementing CPGs into practice prior to intervention commencement and in discussion with the WFLIPs. The HFLIP will provide face to face interactive education, including small group work, case presentations and role play, as well as review ward specific systems, processes, routines and audit practices in order to align systems of care to enable implementation of CPGs into daily practice. At ward level, the two WFLIPs will work with the HFLIP to audit practice, identify barriers, strategies and goals for improvement. They will provide cover for each other during leave and support ward staff during practice hours, receiving one day per fortnight of protected time for conducting audits, facilitation of ward nurses and meeting with the HFLIP to agree on strategies to improve adherence to guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Recruitment and selection of facilitators</title><p id="Par55">HFLIP positions will be advertised on the hospitals&#x02019; intranet and through a snowballing technique, to identify interested staff. Local staff will be interviewed and selected to build capacity within the participating organisations at a clinical leadership level. HFLIPs should have some prior experience (e.g. in practice development or an education role) so that they can support and mentor the WFLIPS and deal with the more challenging contextual barriers that may arise. Selection of all FLIPs will be based on the following characteristics: knowledge of and interest in NSQHC Standard 9; knowledge of colleagues, ward, and organisation; holds a clinical leadership role; and possesses good communication skills. Nurse managers will be asked to identify two WFLIPs for their wards based on the above criteria. All potential WFLIPs will be asked to consent to participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Training and intervention fidelity</title><p id="Par56">Research assistants (RAs) and facilitators will undergo onsite training to ensure consistency across all sites. Training will be tailored to the type of RA (outcome, process or economic assessor) or facilitation role (WFLIP or HFLIP) and be focused on consistency/fidelity. Standardised procedure manuals will be provided to all RAs and facilitators with specific detail on roles and responsibilities.</p><p id="Par57">HFLIPs will receive training for 3&#x000a0;days from two experts in recognition and response to deterioration and advanced facilitation skills. HFLIPs will receive mentoring and ongoing support throughout the trial in a monthly teleconference with an external facilitator and Project Manager, as well as opportunities to teleconference at any time should questions or issues arise. One face to face HFLIP meeting and site visit will be conducted during the intervention. HFLIPs will receive contact details for other HFLIPs to encourage communication across sites, share learnings and troubleshoot barriers to facilitation. Ward FLIPs will receive training for a single day including knowledge on recognition and response to deterioration, beginner facilitation skills, and will receive mentoring and ongoing support during the trial. Support for WFLIPs will be provided by HFLIPs during the trial in the time allocated to each ward and via phone or email at other times. All interactions with WFLIPs will be captured by HFLIPs using electronic activity logs. Education modules, developed and used previously in research will be employed, including the following: using evidence in professional practice, implementing guidelines into practice, identifying and managing deteriorating patients, and facilitating and auditing. The intensity of the intervention will be monitored across sites. All HFLIP activities will be recorded on electronic activity and communication logs. HFLIPs will also audit ward practice 1&#x000a0;week each month for the duration of the intervention period. Audits will include half the occupied beds in each ward (every second bed). Audit data will be collected electronically and then formatted into feedback graphs and text. Text will contain a main message arising from the data. Feedback will be delivered to each WFLIP for discussion at ward meetings or individually to ward staff. WFLIPS will be taught the audit process to assist with their understanding of ward practices in relation to recognition and management of patient deterioration and for practice sustainability at the completion of the trial.</p><p id="Par58">Research assistants performing data extraction from medical records will be given training on the electronic data collection tool and accompanying data dictionary. Inter-rater reliability testing will be established by independent double auditing across sites until Kappa &#x0003e;0.95 is achieved, with a minimum of 10 medical records audited per research assistant. In addition, a study monitoring audit will be conducted by the project manager on a random sample of 100 patient charts across four sites to ensure continued accuracy of data extraction by research assistants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par59">All RAs will be blinded to group allocation. Success of blinding will be assessed at study end using the James Blinding Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although facilitators will not be blinded and nurses will be aware of the FLIP, ward nurses will be unaware of the comparator. Patients will be unaware of the intervention.

At each time point, the medical records of all inpatients admitted to study wards will be reviewed by a RA (blinded to group allocation) to determine if abnormal VS were present, and if so, the rates of escalation as per hospital policy, HLOS, unplanned ICU admissions and unexpected inpatient mortality. Data collection days will be randomly selected. RAs will be trained in data entry. Prior to RAs collecting data independently, inter-rater reliability will be evaluated by the project manager who is a registered nurse with specialist intensive care qualifications. Independent data extraction will be conducted until &#x0003e;95% agreement is obtained. The secure data entry system will not allow invalid values; data backup measures will be installed.

Main and secondary outcome analysis will be based on all randomised wards and selected participants (intention-to-treat analysis). To account for within-patient correlation, due to multiple measurements from the same patient during assessment days, we will implement generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with binary outcome and logit link for all rate outcome comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare proportions. Clustering effects for wards will be evaluated by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients and, if necessary, a fixed effect nominal factor will be included in GEEs to account for ward impact. A series of exploratory analyses will be conducted on subgroups and the impact of covariates on estimates of the effect of the intervention. A nonparametric median test will be used for HLOS comparison. In supportive analysis, HLOS will be considered as time to event data. Survival rates will be calculated and illustrated by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and further analysed by the log-rank test for univariate analysis (stratified by wards). Variables that reveal prognostic or effect modifying potential on the outcome as suggested by univariate analysis will subsequently be evaluated by the proportional Cox regression for multivariate analysis. Hazard ratios with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported. A <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.

All patients admitted to the study wards during the 6-month study period will be included in the analysis of mean total cost, HLOS and ICU LOS for intervention and control wards in each hospital. Only complete admissions will be included (patients admitted to a study ward and discharged from the hospital within the study period); and patients will be analysed based on their admission ward. Mean costs and HLOS for each patient in each ward will be compared to costs and HLOS for patients admitted to the same wards in the 6&#x000a0;months prior to the study period. Difference in difference analyses will be undertaken to compare the mean cost and HLOS difference between pre-intervention and intervention periods, and between intervention and control wards across hospitals. Costs will be attributed to the FLIP intervention based on the additional costs of the implementation process (staff time) over standard in-hospital CPG training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Process evaluation</title><p id="Par67">In order to determine how the implementation of the intervention contributes to the observed outcomes, data will be collected in four domains: intervention implementation, the recipients of the intervention perceptions and views of the evidence and implementation, responses of the staff implementing (or supporting implementation) of the CPG recommendations and the contextual influences mediating implementation. Interviews, field observations and focus group transcripts will be subject to thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Analysis will be iterative, refining emerging themes, then comparing themes and relationships through a process of pattern matching to examine for data consistency. Themes and relationships will be re-examined and recoded by two members of the research team.

Critical illness, cardiac arrest, unplanned intensive care admissions and death may result if physiological signs of deterioration are missed, misinterpreted or mismanaged. These serious events occur multiple times daily in hospitals and frequently result from communication failures during changes in a patient&#x02019;s clinical status. The consequences for the patient can be catastrophic and the costs to the community are significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">Despite the existence of international guidelines that recommend early recognition and response to deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], a research-practice gap remains. Much of the focus has been on disseminating decision support tools in organisations rather than enabling change in clinician behaviour. These factors along with calls for more theory-informed interventions, using robust and methodologically sound research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], have prompted the development of this facilitation intervention. The study design focuses on testing the effectiveness of a facilitation intervention to implement clinical practice guidelines on the recognition of and response to clinical deterioration by ward nurses. This study evaluates a networked approach to facilitation, creating an organizational infrastructure and building capacity in the skills and knowledge required for translating evidence into clinical practice. Facilitators use facilitation skills and knowledge to help individuals, teams and organisations apply evidence into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This research will investigate the relationship between facilitation and the impact on evidence use and patient outcomes, as well as contextual factors that influence implementation processes.</p><p id="Par73">This study uses an innovative and novel approach to deliver a networked approach to facilitation to enable knowledge translation. It will inform knowledge translation measurement approaches using process evaluation and health economic techniques. If successful, the facilitation methodology has the potential for translation to other health care standards such as medication safety, falls and pressure injury prevention; all high-risk areas for health services and important issues for patients and their families.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANZCTR</term><def><p id="Par5">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHEERS</term><def><p id="Par6">Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMH</term><def><p id="Par7">Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPGs</term><def><p id="Par8">Clinical practice guidelines</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-RCT</term><def><p id="Par9">Cluster-randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eACL</term><def><p id="Par10">Electronic activity and communication log</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EAG</term><def><p id="Par11">Expert Advisory Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eCRF</term><def><p id="Par12">electronic case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FLIP</term><def><p id="Par13">
