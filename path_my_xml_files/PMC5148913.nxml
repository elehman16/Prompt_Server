International guidelines recommend a step-wise approach to treat asthma, which is linked to increasing severity of the condition and the need to achieve disease control. According to this approach, if asthma is not adequately controlled on current therapies, treatment should be stepped up until control is achieved. The preferred treatment at step 4 is to combine a medium/high dose of ICS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA when control cannot be achieved with a medium dose of ICS combined with LABA, or with a high dose of ICS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ginasthma.com/">http://www.ginasthma.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>A pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) extrafine formulation containing a fixed combination of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BDP and 6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g FF is currently available for the treatment of asthma where use of an ICS/LABA combination product is appropriate. With this combination, the usual recommended regimens are one or two inhalations twice daily [thus providing a medium total daily dose of ICS, according to The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines], and this schedule has been demonstrated as effective as other ICS/LABA combinations in improving symptoms and pulmonary function in asthmatics not adequately controlled with ICS monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or in maintaining asthma control in patients already treated with ICS/LABA combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the effort to provide caregivers more flexibility to adapt treatments to specific patients&#x02019; condition, a high strength of extrafine pMDI BDP/FF containing a higher dose of BDP (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/actuation) and the same dose of FF (6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/actuation) has been developed. This new fixed dose combination, like the medium strength (100/6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) is characterized by an extrafine [i.e. mean mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m] formulation of both active ingredients.

During each measurement session, a series of messages were displayed on the device to guide the patient and ensure a high quality test as follows: i) &#x0201c;Blow-out faster&#x0201d;: if the time to PEF was &#x0003e;120&#x000a0;msec; ii) &#x0201c;Do not cough&#x0201d;: if a cough was detected in the first second of the test; iii) &#x0201c;Blow again&#x0201d;: if the test was not within 40&#x000a0;L/min of the best PEF (to ensure repeatability). The quality criteria were based on the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for standardisation of spirometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Assuming a mean difference of 15&#x000a0;L/min between treatments and a standard deviation of 40&#x000a0;L/min, it was calculated that 151 evaluable patients per treatment group would assure 90% power to demonstrate the superiority, with a two-side significance level of 0.050.

When the endpoint was a measure of the entire treatment period, the change from baseline was analysed using the same ANCOVA analysis applied for the primary endpoint.</p><p>The primary analysis has been performed in the intention to treat (ITT) population (all randomised patients who received at least one administration of the study drug and with at least one available evaluation of efficacy after baseline) and the per-protocol (PP) population (all patients from the ITT population without any major protocol deviations), while the secondary endpoints were analysed in the ITT population only.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis of the change from baseline to each visit and over the treatment period in pre-dose morning FEV<sub>1</sub> was also performed considering the reversibility before randomisation [change in FEV<sub>1</sub> (mL) from pre-salbutamol] as factor.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were: evening pre-dose PEF, PEF daily variability, pre-dose clinic FEV<sub>1</sub>, rescue medication use, day-time and night-time symptom score, asthma control days percentage, ACQ and moderate/severe exacerbation rate. Daily PEF variability was calculated for each day using the following formula: 100x [(best PEF evening-best PEF morning)/(best PEF evening&#x02009;+&#x02009;best PEF morning)/2].</p><p>Safety variables have been descriptively analysed.

</p><p>No clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or blood chemistry parameters were reported during the study.</p><p>With the exception of 1 patient in the BDP group, for whom the ECG reading was abnormal at the end of the treatment period, ECG readings were considered normal or not clinically significant abnormal. Overall, QTc abnormalities were infrequent and observed in a similar percentage of patients in the two treatment groups (change from screening in QTcF between 30 and 60&#x000a0;msec observed for 7 (3.7%) and 7 (3.9%) patients in the BDP/FF and BDP groups, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary efficacy analysis showed that BDP/FF was superior to BDP in terms of change from baseline to the entire treatment period in average pre-dose morning PEF; the target population was a group of patients with party or uncontrolled asthma despite their medium dose of ICS/LABA or high dose of ICS, which could benefit from a step up pharmacological approach. The mean difference vs. BDP was 19&#x000a0;L/min, which is in line with the mean value reported in the reviews of Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (17.9&#x000a0;L/min) and Cochrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (19.6&#x000a0;L/min) and with the minimal patient perceivable improvement differences (MCID) of 18.8&#x000a0;L.min<sup>-1</sup> which was reported by Santanello et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in a similar asthma population.</p><p>The observed difference in morning PEF between BDP/FF and BDP is consistent with that observed in clinical studies when fluticasone/salmeterol high dose (500/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g bid) was compared to high dose of fluticasone (500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g bid) as observed by Aubier et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], Boyd et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Van Noord et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (22, 21 and 23&#x000a0;L/min, respectively). This is due to the fact that a dose of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salmeterol twice daily (as in fluticasone/salmeterol combination) is comparable to 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g formoterol twice daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>For the budesonide/formoterol (combination, the difference in morning PEF between high dose budesonide/formoterol and high dose of budesonide observed by Jenkins et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Peters et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were higher than those observed in this study (33 and 34&#x000a0;L/min, respectively). However, the total daily dose of formoterol which is used in high strength budesonide/formoterol was 48&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, that is twice than that used in BDP/FF and dose-response studies have shown that the degree of bronchodilation is related to the dose of inhaled FF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, data from high strength budesonide/formoterol are difficult to be compared with BDP/FF and may explain the larger differences in morning PEF which have been reported by budesonide/formoterol studies. Importantly, it should be noted that in the present trial the vast majority of patients were already on a fixed dose ICS/LABA combination at screening (i.e. &#x0003e; 90%, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which is significantly more than in similar studies with other combinations, and this might have reduced the room for improvement.</p><p>Overall, compared to BDP, BDP/FF resulted in a greater and statistically significant improvement of other lung function parameters: average pre-dose morning PEF (from baseline to each inter-visit period), average pre-dose evening PEF and daily PEF variability.</p><p>In addition, treatment with BDP/FF showed an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to each visit and throughout the treatment period compared to BDP with an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> at the end of the study period which was more than 200&#x000a0;ml, a cut off used to define airway reversibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>There was a difference of 0.071&#x000a0;L in favour of BDP/FF very close to statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.058) and this result is in line with previous studies comparing the superiority of fixed combination vs. ICS in patients with asthma ranging in severity from mild to moderate to severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is interesting to note that after using FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility to salbutamol as covariate in the statistical model, the change from baseline to the overall treatment period was statistically significant and the observed difference of ~0.09&#x000a0;L is the same as the mean value reported in the review of Lin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and also by some budesonide/formoterol data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Overall, BDP/FF and BDP resulted in a similar improvement of symptom-based parameters and of the use of rescue medication. Again, these results were in part expected when looking at high dose fluticasone/salmeterol data. Aubier et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showed that combination therapy and fluticasone alone all increased the mean percentage symptom-free days, symptom-free nights, rescue-free days and rescue-free nights over weeks 1&#x02013;12. However, there was no significant difference between the combination and concurrent therapies for any of these measurements over 12&#x000a0;weeks. Our results are in line also with the data from mometasone/FF high strength. Weinstein et al. performed a study in patients who were uncontrolled with high dose of ICS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At 12&#x000a0;weeks, the difference between mometasone 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g /FF 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g bid and mometasone 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g bid in ACQ was less than 0.5, thus not clinically relevant. At week 12, there were no significant between-group differences in the mean change from baseline in AQLQ(S) total score.</p><p>A possible further explanation of the similar magnitudes of asthma control between treatments may be the highly uncontrolled disease in this cohort, with the high ACQ scores.</p><p>BDP/FF and BDP showed a comparable safety profile, with no adverse events of clinical concern observed with either treatment. Overall, TEAEs and treatment-emergent ADRs were reported with low frequency in both treatment groups. In addition, all events were mild or moderate and the large majority resolved by the end of the study. Only one TEAE leading to discontinuation was reported during the study (asthma exacerbation in the BDP group which was not related to the study drug); that event was considered as not related to the study drug and resolved by the end of the study. Of note, no serious TEAEs, serious treatment-emergent ADRs or TEAEs leading to death were reported during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the study successfully demonstrated its primary objective i.e. that BDP/FF is superior to BDP alone in improving lung function in uncontrolled asthmatic patients with an acceptable safety profile. Because pulmonary function is still considered the primary outcome of all short-term studies assessing the efficacy of bronchodilator treatment in asthma, this study confirm that this new extrafine BDP/FF combination may represent a useful option in the management of moderate/severe asthma.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional file</title><p>
