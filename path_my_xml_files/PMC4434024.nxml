bearing of patients with hemiplegia resulting from a stroke. [Subjects] Thirty hemiplegic
patients participated in this experiment and they were randomly allocated to an
experimental group and a control group. [Methods] Both groups received neuro-developmental
treatment for four weeks and the experimental group additionally received auditory
feedback during gait training. In order to examine auditory feedback effects on weight
bearing during gait, a motion analysis system GAITRite was used to measure the duration of
the stance phase and single limb stance phase of the subjects. [Results] The experimental
group showed statistically significant improvements in the duration of the stance phase
and single limb stance phase of the paretic side and the results of the Timed Up and Go
Test after the training. [Conclusion] Auditory feedback during gait training significantly
improved the duration of the stance phase and single limb stance phase of hemiplegic
stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Auditory feedback</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegic patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hemiplegic patients&#x02019; amplitude of postural sway is twice as large as that of healthy people

for the neurological system.</p><p>Gait assessments during rehabilitation programs for hemiplegic patients are important for
evaluating their motor function recovery. In order to improve gait, weight bearing training
should be given importance. Biofeedback training is known to be very effective in the
treatment of neurological system disorders. In the clinical field, various biofeedback
systems are in use. However, existing systems are limited because they cannot be applied to
dynamic gait. Accordingly, this study clarified the effects of providing auditory feedback
during gait training on hemiplegic patients&#x02019; weight bearing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 hemiplegic patients who had been diagnosed as having a

Daejeon. Before participation, the procedures, risks, and benefits were explained to all the
participants, who gave their informed consent. The participants&#x02019; rights were protected
according to the guidelines of the University of Daejeon.</p><p>A GAITRite (CIR system Inc, USA) was employed to measure the stance phase and single limb
stance phase of the paretic lower limb during gait. The collected data was processed using
GAITRite GOLD, Version 3.2b (CIR system Inc, USA). The gait mat was placed at the middle of
10-meter walkway, and the measurer trained the subjects to walk the determined section at
their most comfortable speed. Measurements were taken three times and their average values
were used in the data analysis.</p><p>In the present study, the training period was a total of four weeks and neuro-developmental
treatment was conducted for both the groups. The experimental group additionally received
auditory feedback during gait training. In order to collect information on hemiplegic
patients&#x02019; weight bearing during gait with auditory feedback, a pressure gauge PedAlertTM120
(ORBITEC, USA) was employed. The gauge was set to emit a beep sound, when it exceeded 50% of
an individual subject&#x02019;s weight. When a beep sound was made after weight had moved to the
paretic side during gait, the subject stepped forward with the non-paretic side leg.</p><p>The data collected in the present study was statistically processed using SPSS version
19.0. Frequency and cross analyses of the subject&#x02019;s general characteristics were conducted
using descriptive statistics and the independent t-test. In order to compare differences
between prior to and after the intervention in each group, the paired t-test was performed
and in order to compare changes between the two groups after the intervention, the
independent t-test was performed. A significance level of 0.05 was chosen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In order to examine changes in weight bearing elicited by auditory feedback training, the

hemiplegic patients gait ability. Shumway-Cook<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that biofeedback training decreased the asymmetric posture of
hemiplegic patients, and that it was more effective than traditional physical therapy. Many
studies have used force plates and visual feedback training for hemiplegic patients and
verified that such training is effective at improving their weight-bearing symmetry and
dynamic stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Feedback is known to be
a valid tool in neurological physical therapy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, research involving biofeedback systems and stroke
patients has not been sufficient enough to draw conclusions about their effects on gait, and
additional research is necessary. Accordingly, this study was conducted in order to clarify
the effects of the provision of weight-bearing information through auditory feedback on
hemiplegic patients.</p><p>In order to evaluate changes in weight bearing elicited by auditory feedback during gait,
the duration of the stance phase and single limb stance phase of the paretic side lower limb
were measured and compared. In a comparison of gait cycle of hemiplegic patients and healthy
people, the duration of the swing phase of the paretic side was relatively higher than that
of the non-paretic side and the duration of the stance phase of the paretic side was
relatively lower than that of the non-paretic side<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the results of present study, the duration of the
stance phase of the paretic side significantly increased by 6.9% from 63.6% to 70.6%.</p><p>Many studies have reported that hemiplegic patients have difficulty in supporting weight
and maintaining balance with their paretic side lower limb, and therefore the duration of
their single limb stance phase becomes short<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The results of the present study show that the duration of the single limb stance phase of
the experimental group&#x02019;s paretic side limb significantly increased by 3.1% from 26.1% to
29.2%. To sum up the results of the present study, auditory feedback provided during gait
training conducted for hemiplegic stroke patients elicited the significant improvements in
the duration of the stance phase and single limb stance phase of the paretic side.</p><p>There are some limitations to the interpretation of the present study&#x02019;s result. First, the
number of subjects was small making generalization of the results to all hemiplegic patients
difficult. Second, the overall physical characteristics of individual patients, such as
muscle strength and muscle tone of their paretic side lower limb, were not taken into
account.</p><p>Auditory feedback provided during hemiplegic patients&#x02019; gait training significantly enhanced
the duration of their paretic side stance phase and single limb stance phase. Thus, its
efficacy as an intervention program was verified, and it should be useful as a method for
improving the duration of the stance phase and single limb stance phase of the paretic side
of hemiplegic stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work (Grants No. C0142214) was supported by Business for Cooperative R&#x00026;D between
