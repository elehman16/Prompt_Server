We compared the results 1 month before aromatherapy massage as a waiting control period with those during aromatherapy massage treatment and 1 month after the completion of aromatherapy sessions. The patients received a 30 min aromatherapy massage twice a week for 4 weeks (eight times in total). The results showed that anxiety was reduced in one 30 min aromatherapy massage in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and also reduced in eight sequential aromatherapy massage sessions in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) test. Our results further suggested that aromatherapy massage ameliorated the immunologic state. Further investigations are required to confirm the anxiolytic effect of aromatherapy in breast cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>aromatherapy massage</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aromatherapy is one of the complementary and alternative medicines used to treat various diseases and symptoms, because essential oils have many kinds of pharmacologic actions including anti-microbial, sedative, analgesic, spasmolytic and estrogen or steroid hormone-like effects, etc. Since various kinds of essential oils such as true lavender, rose, mandarin, sweet orange, sandalwood, geranium, etc have anxiolytic activity, aromatherapy has been used for the relief of depression and anxiety. We have clarified that aromatherapy massage reduced anxiety and depression in healthy subjects and that it increased CD8-positive and CD16-positive lymphocytes in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Furthermore, we found that aromatherapy massage improved mild depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Patients with cancer tend to be very anxious about the recurrence of cancer, even after complete remission. This anxiety in turn might reduce immunologic activity, resulting in an increase in the probability of recurrence.</p><p>Several studies have centered on this anxiety in cancer patients. Fellowes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) concluded in a systematic review that aromatherapy massage conferred short-term benefits on psychologic well being, with the effect on anxiety supported by limited evidence and that effect on physical symptoms might also occur. Corner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) evaluated the use of massage and essential oils on the well being of cancer patients. The results showed that anxiety scores reduced significantly over time only for the essential oil massage group. Concerning effectiveness for pain, mobility, ability to work and communication with family, the essential oil group performed better than the control group. Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) also evaluated aromatherapy massage in palliative care in a randomized control study involving full body aromatherapy massage or carrier oil massage three times a week. For the aroma group, significant improvements were found for physical, psychologic, quality of life and severe physical and psychologic subscales of the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), pre- to post-test. For the massage group, there were no differences in any RSCL subscales, from the pre- to post-test. For the whole group and each group, significant improvements in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-state were noted pre- to post-test for each massage. Kohara <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) also reported that combined modality treatment consisting of aromatherapy, soaking the feet and reflexology appears to be effective for alleviating fatigue in terminally ill cancer patients.</p><p>Few studies have examined the psychologic and immunologic effects of aromatherapy on breast cancer patients. Since immunologic activity is a critical factor in determining a patient's prognosis, it is very important to examine the effect of aromatherapy on immunologic activity. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the psychologic and immunologic parameters of aromatherapy massage for breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was performed between 2003 and 2005.

In our investigation, we gave aromatherapy massage to breast cancer patients to see if and how it ameliorated anxiety and depression and enhanced the immunologic state.</p><p>First, we examined psychologic responses to aromatherapy massage using STAI, POMS and HADS. State anxiety scores of STAI are adequate to determine the short-term effects of aromatherapy. Especially, in STAI, state anxiety scores significantly decreased after each aromatherapy massage session. This result is in accordance with those of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and those of Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, trait anxiety using STAI and HADS, which are appropriate for the determination of long-term effects, gradually reduced over the sessions. That is, there was a significant decrease in trait anxiety scores between 1 month before and after massage., HADS also showed that the anxiety gradually reduced over time, while there were no significant differences in the depression scores. Coinciding with our results, Corner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) also reported that aromatherapy massage significantly reduced anxiety. Although other investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>) did not find that aromatherapy had an anxiolytic effect in patients with cancer, we found that aromatherapy massage had both short- and long-term effects on anxiety reduction in breast cancer patients.</p><p>Immunologic, CD16-positive lymphocytes (natural killer cells) were reduced significantly after aromatherapy massage and there was a significant difference between the numbers immediately before the first and eighth massage. However, CD4-CXCR3-positive lymphocytes (type 1 helper T cells) increased significantly after the eighth aromatherapy massage, as compared with before the eighth massage. CD4-CCR4-positive lymphocytes (type 2 helper T cells) also increased significantly by aromatherapy sessions. Although it is hard to interpret these results theoretically, it is possible that aromatherapy massage affects the immune system. In our previous study of healthy subjects, CD8-positive and CD16-positive lymphocytes increased significantly after a 30 min aromatherapy session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The behavior of CD16-positive lymphocytes, however, was different from that of this investigation and we are as yet unable to explain this difference.</p><p>No significant changes in the waiting control period and significant decreases of anxiety both in the short-term and long-term show that aromatherapy massage holds promise as an effective therapy for breast cancer patients. Further investigations with an increased sample size and improved study design, including a control group, are required to confirm our results. To do this, it will be important to find a therapy suitable for the control.</p><p>Outside psychologic therapies, anxiolytic drugs and anti-depressants, conventional medicine offers no effective interventions to reduce anxiety concerning recurrence and/or metastasis. Our results suggest that aromatherapy massage is a viable complementary therapy that significantly reduces anxiety in breast cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms Yayoi Nishiura for skillfully performing massage, and Hyperplants, Co.
