Particularly lacking is evidence about how to maintain breastfeeding rates in countries which already have a high initiation of breastfeeding. This study aims to determine whether mid-pregnancy breastfeeding education, with a focus on either attitudes to breastfeeding or on technical aspects of breastfeeding, has an effect on rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration. Secondary aims of the study are to: explore what factors might affect the duration of breastfeeding and evaluate the interventions from the participant and childbirth facilitator perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used. Women having their first baby, and planning to give birth as public patients at the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH), Melbourne, will be approached at 18&#x02013;20 weeks of pregnancy and invited to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to a control group or one of two group interventions: a previously designed and trialled tool to teach practical aspects of breastfeeding or an exploration of family attitudes to breastfeeding. The latter was developed and piloted by the investigators in conjunction with the group facilitators, prior to trial commencement. The interventions are planned to take place at 20&#x02013;25 weeks. Data will be collected by questionnaire at recruitment, at interview in hospital after the birth and by telephone interview six months later. Medical/obstetric outcomes will be obtained from the medical record. The sample size (972) was calculated to identify an increase in breastfeeding initiation from 75 to 85% and an increase from 40 to 50% in breastfeeding at six months.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is widely accepted that breast milk is the ideal infant food and superior to all forms of artificial feeding. In acknowledgement of the benefits of breastfeeding, the WHO recommends that all infants should be exclusively breastfed from birth to six months of age. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] In Australia this has been recognised by health policy makers who support the WHO recommendations. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]</p><p>Victorian breastfeeding statistics for 1994&#x02013;95 show a dramatic decline from hospital discharge to six months after the birth. At discharge from hospital, 73.9% of new mothers are breastfeeding decreasing to 69.5% at two weeks, 53.9% at three months and 40% at six months. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]</p><p>Both State and RWH (Melbourne) data suggest that at hospital discharge, breastfeeding rates are close to the Commonwealth target initiation rate of 75%. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] When the figures from the RWH are examined more closely, there is considerable difference by subgroup of women. The figures at discharge from hospital (fully breastfeeding or express breasted milk) at the time of the initial NHMRC grant application were greater than 90% for women delivering in the Family Birth Centre, 82% in the private postnatal units and 70% in the public units (Harris 1996, personal communication). An audit of 700 medical records was undertaken in 1998, excluding women who would be ineligible for ABFAB, that is non-English speaking, multiparous women and those whose babies had died, and found that the discharge breastfeeding rate (fully breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk) of publicly booked women who met ABFAB inclusion criteria was 75.3%. The RWH findings are consistent with reports that women who breastfeed are older, have more education, greater income and more social support. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] This is typical of the women accessing the family birth centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and private units within the hospital. Public patients, including those of non-English speaking background and lower socioeconomic means have lower average breastfeeding rates than the State and hospital mean. There seems to be good rationale for paying more attention to breastfeeding promotion in this group of women.</p><p>Although breastfeeding rates at discharge from hospital approximate Commonwealth target rates, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] State figures reveal that breastfeeding rates decline rapidly after discharge. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is also the case at the RWH (Harris 1996, personal communication) and is supported by other Australian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and international studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] A recent Australian study using the 1995 National Health Survey data estimated the proportion of children breastfed at discharge from hospital, three and six months of age during the period 1992&#x02013;1995. The findings indicate that 82% of mothers are breastfeeding when they leave hospital, but by three months only 57% of infants are breastfed and by six months only 46% of infants are continuing to breastfeed, either exclusively or partially. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Breastfeeding duration rates are not reaching set goals as stated by Lund-Adams &#x00026; Heywood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and are unlikely to meet those targets by the year 2000. This highlights the need for action to support the promotion of continued breastfeeding.</p><p>Several studies have identified maternal characteristics that are associated with increased breastfeeding duration. These factors include attitudes to breastfeeding such as prenatal intention to breastfeed, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] maternal commitment to breastfeeding, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] beliefs about breastfeeding, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] planned duration of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and social learning. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] Cox and Turnbull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] identified that women who knew their own breastfeeding history and were themselves breastfed were more likely to breastfeed than women who were unaware.</p><p>Other factors were related to maternal confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and social support. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] Some of these factors may be amenable to change through an antenatal intervention. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]</p><p>Randomised controlled trials have been used to evaluate antenatal interventions that aimed to promote breastfeeding. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] Two of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] utilised an antenatal intervention providing information about the health benefits and technical aspects of breastfeeding in either one antenatal class or a one on one education session. The interventions were evaluated in small randomised controlled trials, with samples drawn from specific ethnic and low-income groups identified as having low breastfeeding rates. The women participating in these trials had all indicated that they intended to breastfeed. Kistin <italic>et al., </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] concluded that additional prenatal support increased the breastfeeding initiation rate in low-income urban black women, although the effect on breastfeeding duration was unclear. Wiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] measured maternal perception of the infant and perception of breastfeeding success and concluded that the intervention contributed to a successful breastfeeding experience. Neither of these studies could answer the question of whether an antenatal intervention could increase the duration of breastfeeding. However, an antenatal hands-on breastfeeding skills group provided to 59 primiparous Chilean women resulted in an increase in breastfeeding rates at six months postpartum to 94% compared with 67% in the control group, who attended an educational breastfeeding promotion session. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] A recent Australian randomised controlled trial involving 70 primiparous women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] has also reported an increase in breastfeeding duration following an antenatal intervention with a hands-on focus teaching technical breastfeeding skills. Redman et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] trialled a combination of antenatal and postnatal interventions (using alternate allocation), in Newcastle (NSW), and found that although the women liked the interventions, and although most women received all components of the intervention, there was no difference in breastfeeding duration.</p><p>Other studies aiming at increasing women's knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding did not increase breastfeeding duration. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] Dix, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] for example, reported that whilst most women agreed that breastfeeding is better for their baby than artificial feeding, this knowledge is not a strong incentive to breastfeed when compared with their own needs and responsibilities.</p><p>Researchers have also examined the effect of postpartum interventions on breastfeeding duration, although the findings of these studies are not consistent. Grossman <italic>et al., </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]and Schy <italic>et al., </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] did not have the statistical power to demonstrate a difference in duration of breastfeeding with in-hospital lactation counselling. Frank <italic>et al., </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] combined in-hospital lactation counselling with ongoing telephone counselling, and again found no effect, although this study too was underpowered. Jones &#x00026; West [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] reported an increase in breastfeeding at four weeks with a lactation visit and support in-hospital and at home. A trial is underway in Perth, Western Australia, comparing routine postnatal care with increased breastfeeding support during and after the postnatal hospital stay. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]</p><p>A recent systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote breastfeeding initiation concluded that breastfeeding initiation rates in developed countries were increased by "informal, small group...education delivered during the antenatal period" and "one to one health education", and that "peer support programs...delivered in the ante- and postnatal periods&#x02026; [increased] both initiation and duration rates of breastfeeding among women on low incomes, and particularly among women who have expressed a wish to breastfeed". [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], pv] The authors also found "packages of interventions" to be effective at increasing initiation and usually duration of breastfeeding as well, such as a "peer support program and/or a media campaign combined with structural changes to the health sector" (pvii). Many of the included randomised controlled trials had small numbers, and although the participants came from a diverse range of backgrounds, many of the women were of low income and specific ethnic groups. However, this review is of limited relevance when considering increasing breastfeeding duration in Australia as breastfeeding initiation is much higher here that in most of the countries where the included trials were carried out.</p><p>Some of the principles and practices of postnatal support for lactating women have been incorporated into modern maternity care, and may be effective. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] Strategies such as the employment of lactation consultants, a mother-baby lactation day unit and 24-hour telephone counselling service are current practice at the RWH in Melbourne. Although these measures appear to have been effective in supporting women with their lactation, other interventions may be required to increase breastfeeding rates to the target level.</p><p>Our conclusion from reviewing the literature was that general information about breastfeeding does not seem to be as effective as caregivers would hope. There is some evidence that a hands-on approach, teaching technical breastfeeding skills is effective, and that attitudes to breastfeeding, as well as support, are important. There are few randomised controlled trials of reasonable size addressing these issues.</p><p>An antenatal intervention was designed for the trial to address attitudes to breastfeeding by providing an educational session based on group discussions and exploration of family attitudes towards breastfeeding. We are also testing the effect of a simple educational intervention focusing on the technical aspect of attachment to the breast using a previously designed tool. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aims to determine whether breastfeeding education in the middle of pregnancy, with a focus on either attitudes to breastfeeding or on technical aspects of breastfeeding, has an effect on the breastfeeding rate at hospital discharge, and on the duration of breastfeeding.</p><p>Secondary aims of the study are:</p><p>- To explore what factors might affect the duration of breastfeeding;</p><p>- To evaluate the interventions from the participant and childbirth facilitator perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>Increasing breastfeeding duration in Australian women will ensure that more children in our community will be exposed to the benefits of optimal nutrition. The protective effects of breastfeeding against illness will result in healthier children and have the potential to deliver large cost savings to the health care industry. Breastfeeding is also cost saving for women. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]</p><p>In spite of extensive evidence demonstrating the benefits of breastfeeding, there is limited knowledge about what interventions are effective in increasing the breastfeeding rate. Many studies on breastfeeding are published but very few are randomised controlled trials aimed at evaluating specific procedures. Whilst a recent systematic review of breastfeeding interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] did show the benefit of some 'packages' of interventions, it is arguably of limited relevance when considering increasing breastfeeding duration in Australia and other countries where breastfeeding initiation rates are higher. This study will increase our knowledge about the effects of antenatal interventions focusing on attitudes and technical breastfeeding skills and will provide information that will guide the clinical practice of midwives, medical practitioners and other health professionals involved in breastfeeding education and antenatal care.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>1.

Ideally these calculations should be based on data from primiparae in public care. However, statistics by parity and model of care were not available, except for the 1995 breastfeeding rates at discharge from the RWH (Harris 1996, personal communication) which were presented for public and private patients separately. These figures were 70% (full breastfeeding and expressed breast milk combined) in public patients and 82% in private patients.</p><p>It was assumed that the antenatal intervention would increase the breastfeeding rate at discharge to the level of private patients, from 70% to 82%. In order to detect such a difference (80% power, 95% confidence) 214 women each group would be required.</p><p>In the state of Victoria (1994&#x02013;1995), the breastfeeding rate decreased from 74% at discharge to 54% at three months and 40% at six months postpartum, corresponding to a reduction of 27% and 46% respectively. A corresponding decrease in the group of public patients at the RWH would result in a breastfeeding rate of 51% at three months and 38% at six months.</p><p>Two hundred and eight women per group would be required to identify with confidence an increase in the breastfeeding rate at three months from an estimated 51% in the control group to 65% (a balance between the 60% target of the Australian Government and 80% of the WHO) in the intervention groups. This sample would have the power to detect an increase at six months from estimated 38% in the control group to 52.1 % in the intervention groups.</p><p>Taking into account an estimated loss to follow-up of 20% at the six-month telephone interviews, a final sample of 268 women per group (214 + 20%) would be required for the study. By hypothesising that the two interventions have similar effects, the final sample was calculated as 804 women (268 multiplied by 3).</p><p>In 1999, sample size and power calculations were re-evaluated following a medical record audit, which demonstrated that the RWH breastfeeding initiation rate had increased to 75.3%. The review also considered the fact that women who did not speak and write English fluently would not be included in the trial, and that this group had lower breastfeeding rates than Australian born women. The new sample size estimate was calculated with the aim of increasing the breastfeeding rate from 75% to 85%, (95% confidence and 80% power) with the required sample size being 270 per group. Allowing for 20% loss to follow up, the sample size required for each group was 324 (ie total sample of 972).</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment to the trial will take place in the Ultrasound Department when women attend for their mid-trimester scan. By recruiting women in weeks 18&#x02013;20, it is envisaged that there will be very few women recruited who subsequently have a miscarriage or an intra-uterine death. It is also the one place and appointment that almost all women booking at the hospital for birth attend, apart from the initial booking visit.</p><sec><title>Assessment of eligibility</title><p>Research midwives will liaise with staff in the Ultrasound Department to obtain daily ultrasound lists, then as much as possible, cross check this list with a hospital database to assess parity. At this point the database will also be utilised to verify that the scan is a routine mid-trimester scan and not another type.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment protocol</title><p>Recruitment is scheduled to take place at the routine ultrasound examination, around the 18<sup>th </sup>gestational week. It is thought that women might be more motivated to attend classes after 18 weeks gestation than before, and after having had a scan confirming the viability of the fetus. Piloting demonstrated that in practice women will need to be approached immediately prior to the ultrasound scan, as most women left the ultrasound department very quickly following their scan, and did not have time to talk to the research midwife. Partners are often present at the ultrasound examination, which may facilitate women's recruitment to the study. Recruitment is scheduled close to the intervention, which takes place as soon as possible after the scan.</p><p>Research midwives will follow the recruitment guide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix 1) after determining that a woman is potentially eligible. The research midwife will explain the study and ask for consent to participate in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant information</title><p>Women will be sent written information (a brochure) about the study when they ring to book into the hospital for their pregnancy care (for brochure wording see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix VIII).

The hospital records will be checked before approaching women after the birth, and in this way women who have experienced a fetal death, an early neonatal death, those who have a seriously ill baby or who are seriously ill themselves are not approached.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] Only one class is offered, between approximately 20 and 25 weeks gestation, and class size aimed to not exceed eight women. The classes are conducted by midwives or health educators with specific training in childbirth education. The session focuses entirely on the technical aspects of breastfeeding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix III). The technique of attachment of the baby to the breast is explained and demonstrated using dolls and knitted 'breasts'. Breastfeeding complications are discussed and advice given about how to manage breastfeeding problems. Partners are not included in this intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of 'family' intervention</title><p>The second intervention ('Family') is focused on changing attitudes to breastfeeding. Two classes are offered between 20 and 25 weeks gestation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix IV). The number of participants per class should not exceed eight women plus their partners or significant others. This intervention was designed specifically for the trial, by the investigators, in conjunction with the class facilitators. The content of the first class includes information about the advantages of breastfeeding, as well as an exploration of the expectant parents' views and attitudes on breastfeeding and their perceptions of the views of their family and friends. Community attitudes are also explored. As a preparation for the next class each participant will be encouraged to interview her own mother and her partner's mother about how they fed them as babies, and about the mother's present attitudes to breastfeeding. The second class is a group discussion based on these interviews and participants' reflections, as well as a discussion of resources available for breastfeeding women and encouragement to develop a breastfeeding plan.</p><p>The difference in the number of classes offered in the two interventions was motivated by a belief that more time and participant involvement (interviewing mothers, group discussions) is required to influence attitudes to breastfeeding than to learn about technical skills, whereas a small previous study suggests that only one session about how to attach the baby to the breast can affect duration of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A crucial part of the family attitudes intervention is that the woman and her partner or significant other explore the attitudes of their families and friends and then have the opportunity to reflect on these with other participants and the group leader.</p><p>The timing of the interventions, before 25 weeks gestation, was motivated by a widespread view among childbirth educators that women attending ordinary childbirth classes at the end of pregnancy (usually after 30 weeks gestation) are focused on the birth itself, and that they are less interested in events after the birth, such as breastfeeding. By conducting the classes earlier in pregnancy, we plan not to compete with the regular programs, and the expectant parents still have the opportunity to participate in such classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Process evaluation</title><p>A number of strategies are in place to monitor intervention uptake and assess adherence to protocols.</p><sec><title>Measures of intervention attendance</title><p>Facilitators for each class will record class lists (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix XI), and this information will be cross-referenced with the trial database to measure intervention attendance. Women will also be asked what classes they attended at the subsequent interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Adherence to protocols</title><p>Facilitators for each class will be required to complete an evaluation form at the completion of class including if and where the class deviated from the protocol (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>: Appendix IX).</p></sec><sec><title>Facilitator meetings</title><p>Each group of facilitators will meet together, with the research team, on a regular basis (approximately six monthly) to discuss classes, adherence to protocols, and to receive feedback on participants' evaluations. Facilitators will be involved in only one arm of the trial, and 'attach' and 'family' facilitators will meet separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention evaluation by participants</title><p>The views of the women and their partners or support people regarding the classes will be evaluated at the completion of each class.
