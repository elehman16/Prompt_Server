Two sites in each subject were randomly assigned into each of the following experimental groups; test group: AM with bone graft and control group: Bone graft only. Clinical parameters included recording site-specific measures of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). The levels of interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) and human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from the test and control sites were measured by using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits.

Primary outcome measures were the antiinflammatory and antiinfective properties of AM based on the changes in inflammatory and antimicrobial peptide biomarkers. Improvements in the measures of periodontal disease as measured clinically and radiographically were the secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>As the trial's primary outcome measure was a difference in levels of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-dependent biomarkers, sample size was calculated and validated as follows: Proportional power calculation was used to determine the sample size and according to the analysis, a minimum of 26 subjects were needed to detect a sensitivity of 0.90 using the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-1&#x003b2;/hBD-2 kits when the power of the test is 0.80 at a significance level of 0.05. Once the data were obtained from both the tests from 26 subjects, the exact binomial test estimated the sensitivity of the test to be 0.892 and 0.919 at 95% confidence interval for the IL-1&#x003b2; and hBD-2 kits, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Source of data</title><p>A total of 30 subjects (16 males; mean age: 40.27 &#x000b1; 9.66) were selected from the outpatient section of the Department of Periodontology, SVS Institute of Dental Sciences from March 2012 to February 2013. Systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients within the age group of 30-55 years having at least two periodontal pockets &#x02265;5 mm with at least one pocket in each quadrant showing radiographic evidence of vertical bone loss were included in the study. Assessment of suitability for GTR membrane placement was confirmed by transgingival probing to verify the presence of two well-contained interdental bone defects in as many quadrants. Approval from the Institutional Review Board (no: SVS031101) was obtained and the study is listed on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02033226). Smokers, medically compromised patients, pregnant women and lactating mothers and subjects receiving periodontal therapy in the 24 weeks period leading to the study were not included. All the included subjects received an initial treatment of SRP and occlusal therapy if required. Sites selected for surgery in these subjects had to demonstrate an absence of bleeding on probing on the day of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design including randomization and blinding</title><p>The study was designed as a split-mouth, double-blind, and randomized controlled clinical trial. Randomization and blinding included computerized generation of the allocation sequence in random permuted blocks (Saghei's block randomization) and blinded disbursement of medication. Allocation was performed by assigning the block of sites to study groups according to the specified sequence. Based on the sequence, the first operator (AN) selected two sites for each of the following experimental sites; the test site, in which AM with the graft was placed and the control site, which was treated by graft placement only. All the surgeries were performed by a designated operator (AK) for the sake of uniformity, whereas the relevant readings were recorded by a set of calibrated operators (AAR, BHR and CR) who were blinded to the nature of the site. The blind was not broken until this clinical trial was completely finished. A total number of 30 subjects were recruited, in which, three subjects were lost during follow-up, limiting the statistical analysis to 27 subjects and 54 teeth (27 sites each in the test and control group).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study protocol</title><p>After the prospective interdental areas were probed buccally and lingually/palatally, the site was considered for the study if the average PPD was &#x02265;5 mm. All baseline values were recorded before the surgical procedure. GCF samples for IL-1&#x003b2; were taken at baseline and 1 week and for hBD-2 were taken at baseline, 1 week and 4 weeks. Noninvasive site-specific measures of plaque index (PI) and modified gingival index (MGI) at baseline, 1, 12, and 24 weeks were recorded. PPD and CAL were recorded at baseline and at the end of 12 and 24 weeks using a UNC-15 color-coded periodontal probe. A custom acrylic stent limited to the occlusal 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the clinical crown was prepared from a cast obtained from an alginate impression. A groove was prepared in the stent to standardize the probing angulation throughout the procedure and also during the follow-up visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Radiograph standardization</title><p>Standard digital radiographs were taken at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks by the paralleling/long-cone technique at preset parameters using a commercially available RVG system (Kodak RVG 5100<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Digital Radiography System, Carestream Health, Rochester, USA). After the imaging plate was placed in the film holder for paralleling technique (XCP Kits for Digital Sensors<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BlueDent, Chennai, India), addition silicon impression material (Elite HD + Regular Body Normal Set<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Zhermack, Badia Polesine, Italy) was added around the biting surface and allowed to set. This arrangement ensured standardized alignment of the aiming device and the holder ensuring correct positioning of the collimator in subsequent radiographs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Collection of gingival crevicular fluid samples</title><p>After isolation, 6 mm diameter filter paper circles (Medium flow filter paper, Whatman<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Mumbai, India) were used for collecting samples by the intra-crevicular method. The fluid seeping out of the sulcus was collected and any paper contaminated with blood or saliva was discarded, and collection was repeated after 30 min. GCF samples were eluted from the strips by placing them in Eppendorf tubes that contained 500 &#x003bc;L of buffer (Trizma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, Hyderabad, India) and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for interleukin-1&#x003b2; and human beta-defensin-2</title><p>Commercially available ELISA kits were used to quantify GCF levels of IL-1&#x003b2; (Bender MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria) and hBD-2 (BD-2 ELISA Kit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Life Technologies, New Delhi, India). All assay procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions and in both the tests, 100 &#x003bc;l of the samples or standards were added into the respective wells in duplicate. Color development was stopped using 1% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and absorbance of the entire plate was measured within 30 min by an ELISA reader (Multiskan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Vapi, Gujarat, India) at 450 nm. The amounts of IL-1&#x003b2; and hBD-2 were calculated based on the dilutions, and the results were expressed as pg/30 s and pg/site in the 30 s GCF sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Amniotic membrane</title><p>Lyophilized and irradiated AM (3 &#x000d7; 3 cm) was obtained from a commercial tissue bank (Tata Memorial Hospital-Tissue Bank, Mumbai, India).

The tissue conforms to the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations and the Asia Pacific Association of Surgical Tissue Banks standards. AM is stable and can be stored at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Surgical phase</title><p>All surgical procedures were performed by one clinician. After recording relevant parameters, and following routine local anesthesia, sulcular incisions were given, and a full thickness Kirkland flap was elevated for defect access. Thorough degranulation of the bone defect was done and root planning was done by using appropriate site-specific curettes.</p><p>The test site was treated as follows; after placement and proper condensation of natural Hydroxyapatite (HA) graft (G-graft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Surgiwear, Shahjahanpur, India) in the defect, hydrated AM was cut based on defect anatomy of surgical site and then adapted over the bone graft and alveolar bone extending from the base of the flap reflection to the tooth surface. Flap was approximated and stabilized by placing direct loop sutures. Periodontal dressing was placed subsequently. For the control site, the procedure was identical except that the membrane was not placed. Patients received postoperative instructions and were prescribed medication. The silk sutures were removed at 1 week postsurgery and subsequent measures were recorded. All the patients received a uniform course of antibiotics and analgesics during the interim 1 week period leading to suture removal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Radiographic assessment</title><p>A single operator (RVC) evaluated the bone fill by using digital subtraction technique and morphometric area analysis by using specific tools in two image processing software.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Digital subtraction technique</title><p>The radiographs obtained at 12 and 24 weeks were subtracted from the radiograph taken at the baseline by using commercially available image processing software (Adobe Photoshop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 6.0, Adobe Systems, San Jose, USA).

There are three representative forms of AM available; fresh, cryopreserved and dried AM. Studies seem to indicate that freeze dried-air preserved AMs show no qualitative changes in growth factor and cell contents even after 5 years of storage as compared to the other two types.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In any form, the membrane is easy to handle as an oral-dressing material and adheres well to the bare connective and osseous tissue.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Mechanical properties such as permeability, stability, elasticity, flexibility, plasticity, and resorbability,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] makes it a promising barrier material in GTR.</p><p>AM demonstrates a direct suppressive effect on IL-1&#x003b2;[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has an upregulatory effect on the expression of hBD-2.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The significant reduction of GCF IL-1&#x003b2; levels in sites treated with AM seems to indicate that AM has a significant anti-inflammatory effect on periodontal tissues. However, this reduction in IL-1&#x003b2; did not show a considerable impact on gingival inflammation as there was no difference in the GI scores between the AM and the control group. This can have important clinical implications as results of flap surgery are largely dependent on the reduction of inflammation caused by periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] During infections, AMs represent a mechanical and immunological barrier against infection by secreting defensins.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Increased hBD-2 may play an important role in defense from periodontopathogens in human gingival tissues.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In this study, there was a minimal insignificant increase in the hBD-2 levels in sites treated with AM. IL-1&#x003b2; results in an up regulation of hBD-2[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] expression and the significant reduction in the IL-1&#x003b2; levels must have resulted in the relatively modest rise in the hBD-2 levels. The PI scores between the two groups was not significant which is in agreement with the observation of Tehrani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and others[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] who stated that antibacterial property is a sum function of the amniotic cells and the other components of extracellular matrix such as defensins, elafin, and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor. To what extent the reduction of hBD-2 expression affects the overall antimicrobial properties of AM properties must be further investigated.</p><p>AM showed a marked impact on periodontal clinical parameters including PPD, CAL and bone fill as compared to the control site which is an agreement with the previous studies supporting the use of chorioamniotic membranes in periodontal pocket therapy.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] This can be attributed to various factors. It's thin, self-adherent nature does not compromise blood flow and AM does not displace from underneath the flap thus oblivating the use of sutures or tacks.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Collectively, AM's unique biological and physical attributes reduce the complexity in trimming, suturing, and placement of barriers effectively minimizing the chances of postoperative complications.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] AM also contributes to periodontal regeneration through the presence of intense concentrations of growth factors[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and laminins,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] a strong anti-adhesive property that induces an arrest in tissue proliferation,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] its lack of immunogenicity[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and through its ability to decrease the host immunologic response via mechanisms such as localized suppression of polymorphonuclear cell migration.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, bone fill was greatest for the AM group; this correlates to previous studies demonstrating new bone formation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The bone inductive potential of AM is primarily due to the existence of mesenchymal progenitor cells which demonstrate osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] At the same time, AM shows excellent acceptability with bone grafts by demonstrating excellent containment of the material and resorbs without the formation of voids and detritus.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] The role of some unknown mechanism in inducing bone formation cannot be discounted as well.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>However, this study has some limitations. Limited literature exists on the resorption dynamics of AM, although general literature seems to suggest that AM completely resorbs into the wound in about 2-4 weeks.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The resorption rate is important as GTR membranes must function for a period of 4-6 weeks to achieve ideal periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Thus, we had to limit the observation period for IL-1&#x003b2; and hBD-2 to a maximum period of 4 weeks to account for changes before the anticipated resorption of AM. However, one study has stated that AM may induce rapid epithelialization and acceptable collagen formation in as early as 10 days, suggesting that AM transplantation may promote rapid gingival wound healing.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] While radiographic findings at 12 and 24 weeks demonstrated significant bone gain with AM, the mechanism can be further explored and studied at a histologic level to better explain the findings. In addition, image subtraction was done in commercially available image analysis software by using a modification of a method described by Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The tool, while exhibiting good sensitivity to bone fill,[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] is not specific for digital subtraction and can be affected by the competency of the evaluator especially during the demarcation of the excluded bone fill slice. This study compared a GTR versus non-GTR intervention and no attempt was made to compare AM with commonly used GTR materials such as collagen membranes.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] As an example, the data for collagen is very contradictory with some studies indicating that collagen placement either elicits a pro-inflammatory reaction[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] or exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory activity.[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] As comparable GTR material could not be utilized, HA bone graft was placed as it may result in improved clinical outcomes compared with those achieved with flap-debridement alone.[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] At the same time, AM is very thin and may collapse into the defect when placed in a site with nonsupportive anatomy; this necessitated using a dense graft such as HA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, AM demonstrated a marked anti-inflammatory effect and its use resulted in an improvement in periodontal parameters. Newer GTR materials are expected to display biological and biomechanical properties vastly superior and complementary to &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; GTR materials. AM has the potential to function as a barrier for GTR and the unique properties associated with this material can augment its potential as a matrix for periodontal regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. R.
