We undertook a randomized controlled feasibility (pilot) study aimed at extending HIIT into a real world setting by recruiting overweight/obese, inactive adults into a group based activity program, held in a community park.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were allocated into one of three groups. The two interventions, aerobic interval training and maximal volitional interval training, were compared with an active control group undertaking walking based exercise. Supervised group sessions (36 per intervention) were held outdoors. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using VO<sub>2</sub>max (maximal oxygen uptake, results expressed in ml/min/kg), before and after the 12 week interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>On ITT (intention to treat) analyses, baseline (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;49) and exit (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0083256.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> was 25.3&#x000b1;4.5 and 25.3&#x000b1;3.9, respectively. Participant allocation and baseline/exit VO<sub>2</sub>max by group was as follows: Aerobic interval training N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 16, 24.2&#x000b1;4.8/25.6&#x000b1;4.8; maximal volitional interval training N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16, 25.0&#x000b1;2.8/25.2&#x000b1;3.4; walking N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17, 26.5&#x000b1;5.3/25.2&#x000b1;3.6. The post intervention change in VO<sub>2</sub>max was +1.01 in the aerobic interval training, &#x02212;0.06 in the maximal volitional interval training and &#x02212;1.03 in the walking subgroups. The aerobic interval training subgroup increased VO<sub>2</sub>max compared to walking (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). The actual (observed, rather than prescribed) time spent exercising (minutes per week, ITT analysis) was 74 for aerobic interval training, 45 for maximal volitional interval training and 116 for walking (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 0.001). On descriptive analysis, the walking subgroup had the fewest adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In contrast to earlier studies, the improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in a cohort of overweight/obese participants undertaking aerobic interval training in a real world setting was modest. The most likely reason for this finding relates to reduced adherence to the exercise program, when moving beyond the research clinic setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTR.org.au <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/trialview.aspx?ID=335354">ACTRN12610000295044</ext-link>

Barriers to achieving a regular physical activity program include lack of time, lack of access to exercise facilities and lack of motivation <xref rid="pone.0083256-Sherwood1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Korkiakangas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The &#x02018;lack of time&#x02019; barrier has been addressed recently both in patients with chronic conditions and also in those at risk of cardiometabolic disease by the introduction of high intensity activity programs, which reduce the time required to exercise compared to low intensity programs <xref rid="pone.0083256-Gibala1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Gibala2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A common model for studies using HIIT (high intensity interval training) in populations with or at risk of cardiac disease is an AIT (aerobic interval training) prescription of 4 or 5 work bouts each of 3 to 4 minutes duration, done at around 85% to 90% of maximal heart rate, followed by a recovery period. In addition to AIT another form of HIIT, maximal volitional interval training (MVIT) has also been well described. MVIT, or low volume high intensity training, involves repetitions of &#x02018;all out&#x02019; maximal volitional effort, typically for 30 seconds, followed by a recovery period. The optimal prescription for the recovery periods following both of these high intensity activities is unknown, both in terms of time interval and also exercise intensity, however a bout of high intensity activity is typically followed by 3 to 4 minutes recovery at around 60% to 70% maximum HR (heart rate).</p><p>Two preliminary HIIT studies in inactive adult participants, one laboratory based and one in young males, measured change in maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), an objective and reproducible measure of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) <xref rid="pone.0083256-American1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and a predictor of morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0083256-Blair1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as their primary outcome <xref rid="pone.0083256-Tjonna1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Nybo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Results from both studies were positive. We chose to base our AIT exercise intervention on the study by Tjonna <xref rid="pone.0083256-Tjonna1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which used 4 minute intervals at 90% maximal HR, followed by three minutes of active recovery at 70% maximal HR.</p><p>Although multiple studies on selected populations in controlled settings have shown HIIT to be an effective method of improving markers of cardiometabolic fitness <xref rid="pone.0083256-Gibala2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Whitehurst1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, HIIT has yet to be applied to a real world community setting using moderately unselected participants. The purpose of the current study was to extend and translate the HIIT concept into a real world community setting, by undertaking a randomized controlled trial (RCT) feasibility study. In keeping with the real world objectives of the study, participants were selected because they were at high risk of cardio-metabolic disease and the study environment was specifically chosen to be low cost. Also a clinically meaningful primary end point, change in VO<sub>2</sub>max, was measured at entry into and exit from this 12 week study.</p><p>The hypothesis of this pragmatic study was that interval training using either a) four minute repetitions of aerobic interval training aiming to get to 85 to 95% of maximal heart rate, or b) maximal volitional exercise using 30 seconds of &#x02018;all out&#x02019; exercise, could reduce the amount of exercise time required to achieve an improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max when compared to steady walking, in previously inactive, overweight and obese adults exercising in a community park setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083256.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083256.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Recruitment was undertaken through advertising in the community and also at the researchers' host institutions.

The AIT exercise prescription was designed to be isocaloric when compared to WALK and was based on a protocol previously shown to improve VO<sub>2</sub>max in heart failure patients over a 12 week period <xref rid="pone.0083256-Wisloff1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The MVIT program was based on the protocol developed by Burgomaster <xref rid="pone.0083256-Burgomaster1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which used a lower calorie expenditure than either WALK or AIT. The original six week Burgomaster protocol was modified for the current study to take into account its longer (12 week) duration. Further detail about the three exercise prescriptions is discussed below.</p><p>There were three scheduled group exercise sessions per week over the twelve weeks of study, giving a total of 36 scheduled sessions. All three exercise prescriptions were designed to maintain a progressive overload over the twelve weeks of study. WALK and AIT were HR (heart rate) based and submaximal, thus as participants improved their fitness they had to work harder to maintain their HR within the required HR zone. For the MVIT group, progression was provided by an increase in the number of repetitions and duration of each repetition though the course of the study. The time duration of each MVIT repetition was however too short to allow meaningful HR monitoring in this subgroup. WALK was a walking based prescription of a 33 minute walk which aimed to achieve a HR of 65&#x02013;75% HR<sub>max</sub> (maximum heart rate). The AIT group undertook 4 minutes high intensity exercise, either fast walking or jogging depending on fitness, followed by 3 minutes at walking pace over four repetitions. The aim of the 4 minute high intensity repetitions was to achieve a HR of 85&#x02013;95% HR<sub>max</sub> and this typically required a period of 10&#x02013;20 seconds at the start of the 4 minute repetition, before the HR rose to the target zone. The MVIT group's exercise prescription was designed to progress, so that exercise overload was maintained during the course of the 12 week study. Participants started with 30 second repetitions of volitional maximal intensity walking or jogging up a slope, followed by a recovery period of four minutes walking. Initially this repetition was undertaken three times but participants were encouraged to increase the duration and number of repetitions over the 12 week study, aiming for up to six repetitions of 45 seconds of maximal volitional activity.</p><p>All participants completed a 10 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down at every supervised exercise session. When warm up and cool down periods were included in the exercise prescription, the WALK group prescription was therefore for 48 minutes of exercise per session, which is consistent with the recommendation that adults exercise for at least 150 minutes per week <xref rid="pone.0083256-Haskell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The AIT group prescription was for 40 minutes. The duration of the MVIT sessions was designed to increase gradually over twelve weeks, starting at 24.5 minutes per session and aiming for a maximum duration per session of up to 40 minutes in the final week.</p><p>In summary exercise time per session (minutes) was allocated as follows: WALK [10 warm up + 33 moderate walk + 5 cool down] 48 minutes; AIT [10 warm up + 4 high intensity +3 recovery +4 high intensity +3 recovery + 4 high intensity +3 recovery + 4 high intensity + 5 cool down] 40 minutes; MVIT (beginning sessions) [10 warm up + 0.5 &#x02018;all out&#x02019; exercise + 4 recovery + 0.5 &#x02018;all out&#x02019; exercise + 4 recovery + 0.5 &#x02018;all out&#x02019; exercise + 5 recovery/cool down] 24.5 minutes.

Prior to study onset, it was determined that the exercise prescription would be reviewed and potentially modified if two or more participants in an exercise group developed injuries related to exercise intensity or duration.

The park is predominantly flat and grassed but has a small artificial slope with a 15% incline, used for some MVIT group activities. Two experienced applied exercise physiology students (&#x02018;exercise group leaders&#x02019;) led each exercise session for each group. These six exercise group leaders were in turn trained and supervised by two senior exercise physiologists (HM and ND). The exercise group leaders supervised only their allocated group of participants throughout the study. If participants were unable to attend any of their 36 scheduled group sessions, they were offered &#x02018;catch up&#x02019; sessions at the public park with their allocated group, once a week. If unable to attend this, participants were then asked to undertake individual unsupervised exercise sessions, at a time and venue convenient to the participant.

Participants attended the research clinic after a minimum of an eight hour overnight fast, for clinical and anthropometric measurements related to the secondary outcome measures; change in BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity (%S) and fasting lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). Venous samples were taken from the antecubital fossa, spun on site in a refrigerated centrifuge then plasma stored at minus 20&#x000b0; centigrade for later batched analysis at an accredited laboratory. These secondary measures and further ancillary measures such as the SF36 quality of life questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0083256-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, food diary and incidental physical activity measured using a pedometer, were assessed to ensure that any apparent health benefits associated with improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max were not counteracted by changes in related parameters. Hemoglobin and hematocrit was also assessed, in part to exclude any participant with overt anemia and in part because of the impact of changes in hematocrit on VO<sub>2</sub>max. Further detail about the measurement of the above variables is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083256.s004">Text S1</xref>.</p><p>The primary outcome, VO<sub>2</sub>max, was measured in the exercise laboratory, typically on the same day as the research clinic visit for the abovementioned biochemical and anthropometric measures. VO<sub>2</sub>max was assessed using a maximal treadmill test based on the modified Bruce protocol <xref rid="pone.0083256-Lerman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, with online gas analysis (Metalyser, Cortex, Biophysik, Leipzig, Germany). The analyzer was turned on for at least 45 minutes before calibration and testing. Pressure was calibrated via electronic barometer (GPB300 Greisinder electronic Germany) and flow volume was calibrated via Hans Rudolph 3 Litre calibrated syringe. Gas calibration was done using a two step calibration process; room air at 20.93% and 0.03% CO<sub>2</sub> and alpha standard calibrated gas bottle with concentrations of 15.80%&#x000b1;0.08 O<sub>2</sub> and 4.98%&#x000b1;0.02 C0<sub>2</sub> (BOC New Zealand). Criteria for achieving VO<sub>2</sub>max were at least two of the following: A leveling off of oxygen uptake, a respiratory exchange ratio &#x0003e;1.15 and a HR within 10 beats per minute of age-predicted maximum.</p><p>All measurements were undertaken by trained researchers using calibrated equipment.

Further detail about blinding of clinical assessors is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083256.s004">Text S1</xref>. Participants were booked for their baseline VO<sub>2</sub>max measurement by an on-site exercise physiologist (HM), who was blind to the block randomization process. Raw exercise treadmill data were transferred electronically for interpretation by a single off site exercise physiologist (JC), who was responsible for determining all study VO<sub>2</sub>max values. This exercise physiologist then relayed VO<sub>2</sub>max results to the off-site biostatistician (CF), who randomly assigned the participant to one of the three exercise groups using baseline VO<sub>2</sub>max for stratification. Assignment was notified to the supervising exercise physiologists 24 hours prior to the first booked exercise session.

This study was designed as a non-inferiority study whereby if either MVIT or AIT could be shown to be non-inferior with respect to VO<sub>2</sub>max improvements over 12 weeks then the advantages they proffer in terms of reduced exercise time would indicate they would be attractive potential options for physical activity programs. Assuming a standard deviation of the change in VO<sub>2</sub>max of approximately 3 ml/kg/min <xref rid="pone.0083256-Tjonna1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, a sample size of 16 in each group would enable non-inferiority to be concluded if the reduction in VO<sub>2</sub>max improvement was not more than 3 ml/kg/min, (two tailed &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05, 80% power).

Analyses of these other outcome measures were undertaken using an ITT approach. Participants were pre-defined as following the intervention i.e. PP, if they remained in active contact with the exercise team and undertook the final treadmill testing and, if unable to attend group exercise sessions in any given week, undertook unsupervised exercise sessions in their own time so that in total they completed more than 70% of their prescribed program.

Up until this time point in the study, the MVIT protocol appeared to work well for participants.</p><p>Ten participants did not complete the study and did not return for exit evaluations and a further 7 completed less than 70% of the physical activity program. Consequently, the PP analysis included 32 participants; 14, 9 and 9 participants from the WALK, AIT and MVIT groups respectively. Baseline and exit results for VO<sub>2</sub>max and secondary outcomes for the entire cohort are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t003">Table 3</xref>. Baseline characteristics suggest that many participants had features of the metabolic syndrome. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t004">Table 4</xref> shows the same baseline and exit results by allocated group. Regarding the primary outcome, the AIT and MVIT groups showed non-inferiority to the WALK group on both PP and ITT analyses of the VO<sub>2</sub>max changes and hence were examined for possible superiority using both PP (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32) and ITT (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;49) analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t005">Table 5</xref>).

On review of raw data, the different levels of significance between the ITT and PP analyses related primarily to three participants in the ITT analysis who showed large changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max but were not eligible for inclusion in the PP analysis: One WALK participant dropped their VO<sub>2</sub>max by 3.89 ml/min/kg and in the AIT group there were rises in VO<sub>2</sub>max of 2.73 ml/min/kg and 3.77 ml/min/kg, respectively.

When considering the group as a whole, there continued to be no significant overall change in VO<sub>2</sub>max, either on ITT (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39) or PP (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32) analyses. However, when considering the change in AIT VO<sub>2</sub>max (L/min) relative to WALK VO<sub>2</sub>max (L/min) (see also the subgroup comparisons used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t005">Table 5</xref>), there was a significant difference favouring AIT on both ITT analysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and also on PP analysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). Comparison of MVIT with WALK continued to show non-significant changes.</p><p>As discussed above, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t003">Table 3</xref> compares secondary outcome measures at baseline and also exit for all participants, using both ITT and PP analyses. Although there was no significant change in body mass and only a small non-significant fall in self-reported calorie intake, waist circumference fell by 3&#x02013;4 cm and total body fat fell by an amount equivalent to a 1.0 kg loss in fat mass. Additional beneficial effects of the exercise program included a fall in total cholesterol and blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure may however have been partly related to a reverse &#x02018;Hawthorne effect&#x02019;, whereby possible initial anxiety about the study was associated with a blood pressure increase at entry into study, which subsequently settled and was not present at the time of exit examination.</p><p>The main reason for measuring and comparing secondary outcomes by group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t004">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t005">5</xref>) was to determine whether any apparent benefit of an intervention that seemed to improve VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to the WALK group, might be offset by negative health changes. Apart from the observation that the WALK group's total cholesterol improved more than that of the AIT and MVIT groups, no negative consequences of AIT (or MVIT) were observed. These differences in total cholesterol should be interpreted in the context of a small change in recorded energy intake between WALK and the other two groups, with WALK showing a larger decline over the study period. There are two additional measures not included in the Tables, hematocrit and total SF 36 score. Neither measure changed following the interventions (hematocrit mean pre&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.43 and mean post&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.42). Median time interval between last exercise session and exit VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment at the exercise laboratory was one day. Median time interval between last exercise session and fasting data collection at the research clinic was 3 days. There were no statistically significant between group differences in these time intervals.</p><p>The time spent exercising per session was fixed for the WALK and AIT groups but the session time increased during the 12 week study for the MVIT group as fitness improved (see Methodology section). Although there was only a small difference in the time duration of prescribed exercise between the AIT and WALK groups at 120 and 144 minutes a week respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t006">Table 6</xref>), the high attrition rate in the AIT group compared to the WALK group meant that the actual average exercise time by group, when considering data on all 49 participants (i.e. on ITT analysis), differed considerably as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t006">Table 6</xref>. Thus over the duration of the study the AIT and MVIT groups spent on average 36% less time (74 minutes/week) and 61% less time (45 minutes per week) exercising than the WALK group (116 minutes/week); p&#x0003c;0.001 for both comparisons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083256-g003">Figure 3</xref> compares change in VO<sub>2</sub>max with time spent exercising per week, over the 12 weeks of study. Results from the downloadable HR monitors showed that target HR was achieved by WALK participants 87.7% of the time and AIT participants 73.4% of the time. The maximum achieved heart rate during the MVIT sessions averaged 88.6% of HR<sub>max</sub> at week 6 and 85.1% of HR<sub>max</sub> at week 11. The amount of incidental exercise being undertaken outside the formal sessions during the 12 weeks of the study, as measured by pedometer steps, was not significantly different between the groups (WALK, weeks 5 to 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5364, weeks 11 to 12&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4739; AIT weeks 5 to 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5021, weeks 11 to 12&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4890; MVIT weeks 5 to 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5693, weeks 11 to 12&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4969).

This study therefore extends the positive findings from previous efficacy studies of HIIT in participants at risk of cardiometabolic disease, which have typically taken place in either an exercise facility and/or using individually supervised exercise sessions <xref rid="pone.0083256-Tjonna1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083256-Nybo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The study also demonstrated that it was possible to maintain rigorous blinding procedures whilst undertaking an exercise study in a community setting. An ancillary analysis showed that, when considering the group as a whole, body composition, total cholesterol and blood pressure improved. The magnitude of anthropomorphic change seen in the current study was similar to that seen in another recent high intensity intermittent exercise study, also of twelve weeks duration <xref rid="pone.0083256-Heydari1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The cardiorespiratory benefits seen in this real world study were however modest, with the largest change in VO<sub>2</sub>max, seen in the AIT group on ITT analysis, being equivalent to around a 10% increase in comparative fitness on age/gender centile charts. There are multiple possible reasons for the small observed change in VO<sub>2</sub>max, both between and within groups. Firstly, although overall adherence to the exercise program was in keeping with similar exercise intervention studies <xref rid="pone.0083256-Linke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it was low in both the AIT and MVIT groups, even in those participants able and willing to undertake an exit VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t006">Table 6</xref>). This low level of adherence will impact on group change in VO<sub>2</sub>max. Secondly, participant numbers were small, thus the confidence interval around group differences in VO<sub>2</sub>max was wide (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t005">Table 5</xref>). Thirdly, one inclusion criterion was a history of inactivity. Physical inactivity has genetic determinants <xref rid="pone.0083256-Bauman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The recruitment strategy may have biased recruitment towards inclusion of exercise non responders <xref rid="pone.0083256-Bouchard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as some participants may have been inactive because previous attempts at exercise failed to produce positive reinforcement through a feeling of increased fitness. Fourthly, although a twelve week intervention has been reported to be sufficiently long to observe changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max <xref rid="pone.0083256-Tjonna2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083256-Murias1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, a longer duration study may have shown further improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max <xref rid="pone.0083256-Murias1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Fifthly, the maximal pulse rate achieved on VO<sub>2</sub>max testing was less at exit than at baseline. Although participants fulfilled the standard criteria for achieving VO<sub>2</sub>max both at baseline and at exit (see Methodology section above), there may have been subtle differences in participant's maximal exertion between these two measures, that resulted in a slight attenuation of the measured exit VO<sub>2</sub>max values. The maximal achieved heart rate for the 39 participants who undertook the exit VO<sub>2</sub>max was 172 beats per minute (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083256-t004">Table 4</xref>), which was nevertheless consistent with the age-predicted average maximum heart rate. There were however no between group differences in maximal achieved pulse rate during the exit VO<sub>2</sub>max, which suggests that the effort exerted when undertaking the exit VO<sub>2</sub>max was similar between groups.</p><p>The time saving benefits of high intensity activity have received much emphasis. The time saved by those adhering to the AIT exercise prescription was however modest, when compared to the duration of the exercise sessions for WALK. This was in part because the recovery phase of the interval training (3 minutes) was quite long. It may be possible to shorten the rest interval without any loss in fitness <xref rid="pone.0083256-Edge1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Another feature of the overall study design, incorporated to reflect best practice, was a warm up and cool down period totaling 15 minutes per exercise session. The optimal prescription for warm up and cool down is unknown <xref rid="pone.0083256-Woods1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Future studies may therefore be able to shorten both the recovery phase in AIT and MVIT exercise prescriptions and also the warm up and cool down phases undertaken by all participants, thereby undertaking shorter duration exercise sessions. This could hopefully be achieved without an increase in injury or similar harms.</p><p>As discussed above, extending observations from the controlled environment of the exercise laboratory to a health outcomes effectiveness study in a real world community setting, inevitably increases study complexity <xref rid="pone.0083256-Courneya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. One aspect of this increased study complexity relates to non-adherence, which in this study was due to a mix of illness and injury, as well as behaviorally related reasons for non-adherence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083256-g001">Figure 1</xref>). How best to analyze a study when some participants will inevitably be unable or unwilling to adhere to the exercise prescription or complete the exercise program? The usual approach to the problems of non- adherence and missing outcome data is to undertake an ITT analysis and this has traditionally been seen as the most conservative of approaches. This view has however been challenged and an alternative approach that includes information on adherence and efficacy has been advocated <xref rid="pone.0083256-Feinman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Details of both ITT and PP analyses, as well as details on study adherence, are therefore included in the current paper.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Features that may limit the generalizability of this study</title><p>The screen failure rate was high but was similar to that of other exercise studies using community recruitment <xref rid="pone.0083256-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083256-Church2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The screening process did not however impede recruitment of a high proportion of participants with chronic health problems, as judged by the number of participants with a positive response to the PAR-Q (physical activity readiness questionnaire) and high percentage use of long term medications. Participants were asked not to change their diet during the study, to better study the effect of a single type of intervention, however a dual strategy of combined exercise and dietary interventions are of greater health benefit than either intervention alone and as such form the basis for the majority of evidence based healthy lifestyle recommendations. Finally, although the higher intensity activity groups in the current study reported a trend to increased injury compared to walking, the adverse outcomes in this study may in part reflect site specific features such as the quality of both the training surface and also artificial illumination.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Additional limitations of this study</title><p>Undertaking parallel contemporaneous interventions in a group setting resulted in multiple participants exiting the study at the same time, which in turn produced logistic challenges for both the participants and the assessors in relation to obtaining exit assessments, immediately after the last exercise session. Results from the current study are therefore likely to reflect chronic rather than acute metabolic changes that might occur following the introduction of exercise.</p><p>In summary, this feasibility study's small change in VO<sub>2</sub>max contrasts to that seen in previous HIIT studies and highlights aspects of study methodology that, whilst they have been shown to work well in laboratory based efficacy studies, appear to work less well in a real world environment. Consideration should therefore be given to modifying these aspects of study design in future studies. As an example, use of submaximal VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, rather than the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment as used in the current study, might allow participants with minor illness or injury that precludes exercising to maximal intensity, to complete an exit assessment. Some participants in the current study experienced minor exercise related injuries (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083256.s003">Table S1</xref>) and were therefore asked to reduce exercise intensity for a short time, thus their adherence to the exercise intervention was reduced. Minor injuries may have been minimised by the use of a different exercise venue, a more gradual increase in training intensity and also a greater variation in activities. In laboratory based efficacy studies, behavioural support is usually minimal <xref rid="pone.0083256-Courneya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Behavioural support in the current study was modest when taking into account participants' history of inactivity. The challenge for future effectiveness studies aimed at determining how HIIT is best used in real world settings therefore relates not just to the details of the exercise prescription, but to the retention of important real world elements of study design such as low cost and recruitment of at risk participants, whilst at the same time aiming for a high rate of adherence to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This community based feasibility study extends the findings of earlier studies by showing that it is possible when undertaking high intensity interval training in a real world setting, to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight, inactive participants and at the same time reduce the duration of the exercise sessions, compared to walking. The overall change in VO<sub>2</sub>max was however less than the changes previously observed in more structured research settings. In the real world setting of the current study, non-adherence to the exercise program is likely to be the main reason for the small observed changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083256.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0083256.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083256.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0083256.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083256.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Number (description) of participants experiencing an adverse event by exercise group allocation. <sup>a</sup>Event of sufficient severity that participant exited study early. <sup>b</sup>Event of sufficient severity that participant did not undertake exit <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0083256.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2max</sub>.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0083256.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083256.s004"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Ancillary methodological details.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0083256.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Simon Fryer, James Glasson, Derlinder Kaur, Areender Kaur, Sarah Tabak and Jill Hamilton for supervising the exercise sessions, Cecileah Inns for undertaking the dietary analyses and Mary Martin Smith, Deborah Kendall, Sharon Mackay and Victoria Halliday for their help with data collection.
