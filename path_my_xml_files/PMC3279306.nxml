It is possible to avoid axillary dissection in selected patients (T1N0) using the sentinel lymph node technique. However, in the majority of cases, axillary lymphadenectomy is not avoidable and still has complications, in particular seroma formation (15%-81%), which can delay the patient's discharge, healing, and supplementary radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of seroma has not been fully understood. Seroma is formed by acute inflammatory exudates in response to surgical trauma and acute phase of wound healing. Extensive dissection in mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy damages several blood vessels and lymphatics with subsequent oozing of blood and lymphatic fluid from a larger raw surface area when compared with breast-conserving procedures leads to seroma formation. Fluid accumulation elevates the flaps from the chest wall and axilla thereby hampering their adherence to the chest wall bed and delay healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Petrek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in a prospective randomized trial showed that the most significant influencing factors in the causation of seroma were the number and the extent of axillary lymph node involvement. However, Gonzalez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Hashemi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that the only statistically significant factor influencing the incidence of seroma formation was the type of surgery. They reported higher seroma rate in modified radical mastectomy than following wide local excision and axillary dissection due to larger dead space found after mastectomy.</p><p>Although a number of factors have been correlated with seroma formation, there was no risk factor supported by strong evidence. However there was moderate evidence (grade B) to support the increased risk of seroma formation in individuals with heavier body weight, extended radical mastectomy as compared with simple mastectomy, and a greater initial three day drainage volume and reduced seroma formation when SLNB replace axillary dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Present evidence correlate increase in the incidence of postoperative seroma to electrocautery because of increased thermal trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The influence of this factor was abolished in this study, as all mastectomies in both groups were performed by one surgeon using the same technique and used electrocautery in all cases.</p><p>In assessing the severity of seroma, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 grades seroma as; grade 1 if asymptomatic, grade 2 if symptomatic (medical intervention or simple aspiration indicated), and grade 3 if symptomatic (interventional radiology or operative intervention indicated). According to this definition, the majority of seromas documented would be categorized as grade 2, and as grade 3 in rare cases; however, grade 1 have so far been underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In terms of the methods of reducing seroma magnitude, there have been numerous reports of conflicting results in literature of the benefits of using an external compression dressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], immobilization of the arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the use of fibrin glue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], excessive use of the electric scalpel compared to ligature of the lymphatic branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], benefits of multiple drains, and the type of suction (high or low pressure) applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Several preliminary or retrospective studies, and prospective studies, as well as RCTs have found it useful to close the dead space by securing the flaps to the chest wall with sutures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Larsen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported that this method allowed smoother, more prompt recovery, and less disability after mastectomy. Similarly, this technique significantly reduced the incidence of seroma formation, breakdown of wound edges, and prolonged serous discharge, and did not lead to a reduced functional range of shoulder motion among patients who underwent conventional mastectomy. Moreover, it allowed the early and safe removal of drains at 48 hours or 72 hours after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to note that in the RCT by Purushotham <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], breast surgery without drainage did not increase surgical or psychological morbidity including seroma formation if flaps were fixed with sutures, and early discharge as a consequence of avoiding wound drainage resulted in an overall reduction in cost. Similarly, the axillary flap fixation with sutures was useful to avoid axillary drainage in patients undergoing BCS and conventional axillary lymph node dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In our study; the clinical incidence of seroma was 25% (10/40), most of them are grade 2 (90%). Four more cases were detected by ultrasonography, increasing the overall incidence to 35% (14/40), the 4 cases were grade 1 minor seromas that are clinically asymptomatic and not detected by the patient. This is the first study to use chest wall ultrasonography for diagnosis of seroma. Our overall incidence of seroma falls within the range of incidence reported by most authors that varies widely between 15 and 81% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>By comparing the results of the two groups of our study, we found that; flap fixation technique is associated with a lower incidence of seroma (10%) after mastectomy as compared to the control group (40%) with P-value = 0.028. Several investigators have also found that flap fixation technique is useful in decreasing seroma formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is more concern over the incidence of seroma, than the more important quantity of serum lost and duration of drainage. Although not always measured, drainage volumes can exceed 2 L, and volumes up to 3.7-5 L are on record. More than 30 aspirations over periods of 2-3 months have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Published reports focused on studying the effect of obliteration of the dead space on seroma formation but, did not address the effect on the amount of drained fluid and drainage period. Up to our knowledge; studying this relation in our work had never been mentioned in literature before.</p><p>In this study, we found that; the flap fixation technique significantly decreases the total amount of fluid drained with mean drainage volume of 524 c.c. in the flap fixation group versus 2017 in the control group (P value &#x0003c; 0.001). It has been reported by some authors that the total drainage volume may reach up to 5 liters if the technique of flap fixation was not used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>We found that, this technique significantly decrease the drainage period. The mean duration of drainage is 5 days in the flap fixation group versus 13.4 days in the control group (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Most surgeons tend to remove the drain when the drainage volume is less than 50 mL in the preceding 24 h and this usually take up to 10 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In our series, the overall complications rate is 15% (6/40) of cases with no mortality. This rate is less than that reported in most studies. Reported studies document that surgical morbidity from breast and/or axillary wound occur in up to 30% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Additionally, in the group with flap fixation only 2 cases (10%) developed cellulitis that was treated medically, while in the control group 2 cases developed cellulitis and 2 cases developed partial flap necrosis, this mean that the morbidity is less with flap fixation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of the literature review and based on our experience, it is suggested that the flap fixation technique is a valuable procedure that significantly decrease the total amount of drained fluid, allowing the earlier removal of the drains as well as decreasing the incidence of seroma formation, and the need for frequent visits for seroma fluid aspiration after mastectomy.
