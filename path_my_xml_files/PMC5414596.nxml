Temporal bone studies have associated the disease with endolymphatic hydrops, leading to speculation that it may arise from disruption in the balance between endolymph production and absorption (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>There is no cure for M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease. The disease may eventually result in irreversible sensorineural hearing loss at all frequencies in the affected ear and seriously impair a patient's quality of life (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Treatments for the disease tend to focus on relieving vertigo, the most debilitating symptom associated with the disease. A reduction in inner ear fluid volume may reduce hydrops and associated clinical symptoms, which is why physicians routinely prescribe low-salt diet and diuretics (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Treatments addressing symptoms may include systemic medications (anticholinergics, antihistamines, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids), surgical treatments (endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular neurectomy, labyrinthectomy), non-surgical partial ablation (intratympanic [IT] gentamicin), or low-pressure devices. Administration of aqueous corticosteroid formulations via repeat IT injections (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) has been associated with clinical improvement in patients with M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease.</p><p>OTO-104 is a suspension of dexamethasone in a buffered solution containing the thermoreversible glycol polymer, poloxamer 407. It is intended for IT application over the round window niche, gels within seconds at body temperature, and is designed to provide a sustained-exposure of dexamethasone to the inner ear. In preclinical studies, IT injection of dexamethasone solution showed limited perilymph exposure while OTO-104 provided sustained perilymph dexamethasone exposure (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In a Phase 1b trial in 44 patients with M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease, a single IT injection of OTO-104 was found to be well tolerated and associated with a reduction in change from baseline in vertigo rate 3 months after treatment compared with placebo (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This report presents the assessment of safety and efficacy in a larger Phase 2b study of OTO-104 in patients with unilateral M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease.</p><sec sec-type="materials"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 20-week Phase 2b study conducted in North America (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT01412177).

Otoscopic examinations were performed in both ears at all visits. Audiometry assessments (range 250&#x02013;8000&#x0200a;Hz) included air- and bone-conduction thresholds and pure-tone averages (PTAs) for bone and air conduction (500, 1000, and 2000&#x0200a;Hz frequencies) in accordance with the American-Speech-Language-Hearing Association Guidelines (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Word recognition tests were conducted in both ears using a standardized 50 word protocol with Northwestern University Auditory Test Number Six (NU-6) compact disc.

The full model contained fixed effects for randomized treatment group (OTO-104 versus placebo), study month treatment group by study week interaction, and baseline vertigo frequency. Primary analysis consisted of a linear contrast of the simple effect among the adjusted change from baseline means (change from baseline least squared [LS] means) between OTO-104 and placebo at Month 3 at the 2-tailed 0.05 alpha level. Secondary efficacy endpoints examining vertigo frequency at Months 1, 2, and 4 were from the same primary analysis conducted for the primary endpoint using linear contrasts for each of these other time points.

While the primary efficacy analysis did not achieve statistical significance, multiple prospectively defined secondary vertigo endpoints (number of definitive vertigo days, vertigo severity, average daily vertigo count) were statistically significant at Months 2 and 3 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Definitive vertigo days and vertigo severity appear to be the most sensitive measures that reflect a potential treatment effect of OTO-104. These results are consistent with the previously reported Phase 1b study with OTO-104 (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and provide further evidence that intratympanic steroids can provide reductions in vertigo (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The observation that statistically significant improvement in SF-36 subscales following OTO-104 dosing is notable given the quality of life challenges experienced by patients with M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Animal models have shown that a single IT injection of OTO-104 may have advantages over IT corticosteroid solutions (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The poloxamer-based formulation has both sustained-release and muco-adhesive properties that provides a sustained inner ear dexamethasone concentration. In guinea pigs and sheep (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), for example, it has been shown that a single middle ear injection of OTO-104 achieves significant inner ear drug levels for 2 to 3 months. We hypothesize that after IT injection, the thermosensitive poloxamer positions and maintains dexamethasone microparticles at the round window niche, providing a depot for sustained drug diffusion into the inner ear. This is in contrast to the high variability and transient exposure of steroid concentration in the inner ear observed following IT injection of solution-based formulations in patients (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). It is estimated that poloxamer, based on tracer studies, is eliminated within 2 weeks after injection (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>There were no statistical or clinically meaningful treatment differences on otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry, word recognition, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations or the C-SSRS. The safety assessments in this study support the position that intratympanic administration of corticosteroids are well tolerated and no new risks were identified (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Persistent tympanic membrane perforations were observed in two OTO-104 treated patients (2.7%) at the end of study, consistent with perforations seen following IT administration of an aqueous solution of a glucocorticoid steroid (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, no changes were observed in tinnitus loudness or THI-25 between OTO-104 and placebo, unlike what was observed in the Phase 1b study (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) where an OTO-104 treatment effect was observed with THI-25. The reason for this is unclear, but in general, patients were less impaired from a tinnitus perspective in the current study than what was seen in the Phase 1b study.</p><p>OTO-104 may provide advantages over steroid solutions that are not FDA-approved for M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease. Following administration of OTO-104, patients were able to sit upright immediately and did not need to remain laterally recumbent for up to 30&#x0200a;minutes with no talking or swallowing as is generally required following administration of solution. This offers patient acceptance and convenience advantages over current clinical practice which frequently includes multiple IT injections of steroid solution per course of treatment.</p><p>Like all studies, this large Phase 2 trial had limitations. Vertigo and tinnitus endpoints were monitored as efficacy endpoints, while hearing function and tympanometry were measures of safety. While it would be of interest to assess whether hearing function was improved in the OTO-104 treatment group compared with placebo, the study design did not enable this comparison. A stratification design that balances treatment groups on the basis of low frequency hearing function would be ideal, however, the fluctuating nature of this measure in Meniere's disease patients would require a significantly larger study than the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, data from this clinical trial suggest that a single IT injection of OTO-104 reduces certain vertigo outcome measures after 3 months in patients with M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease. These findings support advancing OTO-104 into Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the patients and their caregivers, the clinical trial site staff members, trial coordinators, nursing and supporting staff, the Rho, Inc. project managers, trial monitors, statisticians, and remaining members of the trial teams for their participation in this trial.</p><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to the following principal investigators who participated in the trials:</p><p>Ansley, J., Carolina Ear, Nose and Throat Center, Orangeburg, SC.</p><p>Antonelli, P., University of Florida Health, Gainesville, FL.</p><p>Bryarly, R., Lovelace Scientific Resource, Austin, TX.</p><p>Carey, J., John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.</p><p>Chan, E., Michigan Ear Institute, Novi, MI.</p><p>Crawford, J., Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA.</p><p>DeVenecia, R., Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MD.</p><p>Douglis, F., Douglis Medical Research, Conroe and Spring, TX.</p><p>Gantz, B., University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.</p><p>Gluth, M., University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.</p><p>Gold, S., Charlotte Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat Associates, Charlotte, NC.</p><p>Hammerschlag, P., New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY.</p><p>Kaylie, D., Duke Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Clinic, Durham, NC.</p><p>Kim, H-O., The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, New York, NY.</p><p>Kutz, W., UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.</p><p>Labadie, R., Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.</p><p>Lalwani, A., Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.</p><p>Lambert, P., Medical School of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.</p><p>Lanier, B., Central California Clinical Research, Fresno, CA.</p><p>Lansford, B., NEA Baptist Clinic, Jonesboro, AR.</p><p>Major, S., Advanced Research Institute, Ogden, UT.</p><p>Manthei, S., Westfield Nevada Eye and Ear, Henderson, NV.</p><p>Mattox, D., Emory University, Atlanta, GA.</p><p>Maxwell, K., Piedmont ENT Associates, Winston-Salem, NC.</p><p>McElveen, J., Carolina Ear &#x00026; Hearing Clinic, Raleigh, NC.</p><p>McFeely, W., North Alabama ENT Associates, Huntsville, AL.</p><p>Micco, A., NMFF Otolaryngology, Chicago, IL.</p><p>Mikulec, A., St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO.</p><p>Miller, S., Intermountain Ear Nose &#x00026; Throat Specialist, Salt Lake City, UT.</p><p>Mitskavich, M., Coastal ENT, Neptune, NJ.</p><p>Moss, J., Charlotte Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Associates, Matthews, NC.</p><p>Munzer, E., ENT and Allergy Associates, New Windsor, NY.</p><p>Nguyen, Q., University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA.</p><p>Nguyen-Huynh, A., Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University, Portland, OR.</p><p>Novak, M., Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana, IL.</p><p>Roebuck, J., South Texas Ear Nose and Throat, Beaumont, TX.</p><p>Romett, J., Colorado ENT &#x00026; Allergy, Colorado Springs, CO.</p><p>Rosenbloom, J., Alamo ENT, LLC, San Antonio, TX.</p><p>Samy, R., University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH.</p><p>Shohet Ear Associates, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, CA.</p><p>Silverstein, H., Silverstein Institute, Sarasota, FL.</p><p>Staecker, H., University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.</p><p>Strasnick, B., EVMS Otolaryngology, Norfolk, VA.</p><p>Vambutas, A., NS-LIJ Health System, Hearing &#x00026; Speech Center, New Hyde Park, NY.</p><p>Welsh, D., Advanced ENT and Allergy, Louisville, KY.</p><p>Wetmore, S., West Virginia University Hospitals, Morgantown, WV.</p><p>Widick, M., Ear, Nose and Throat Associates of South Florida, Boca Raton, FL.</p><p><bold>Medical Writing support:</bold> The authors thank Donna Simcoe of Simcoe Consultants, Inc. funding provided by Otonomy, Inc. for development of an early draft of the manuscript based on conversations with the authors.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>P.L., J.C., and A.M. have received financial compensation from Otonomy, Inc., in the past but not related to their roles as investigators in this study.
