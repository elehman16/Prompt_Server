A recombinant factor H binding protein (fHBP) vaccine (Trumenba<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; bivalent rLP2086) was recently approved in the United States in individuals aged 10&#x02013;25 years. Immunogenicity and safety of 2- or 3-dose schedules of bivalent rLP2086 were assessed in adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Healthy adolescents (11 to &#x0003c;19 years) were randomized to 1 of 5 bivalent rLP2086 dosing regimens (0,1,6-month; 0,2,6-month; 0,2-month; 0,4-month; 0,6-month). Immunogenicity was assessed by serum bactericidal antibody assay using human complement (hSBA). Safety assessments included local and systemic reactions and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Bivalent rLP2086 was immunogenic when administered as 2 or 3 doses; the most robust hSBA responses occurred with 3 doses. The proportion of subjects with hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 after 3 doses ranged from 91.7% to 95.0%, 98.9% to 99.4%, 88.4% to 89.0%, and 86.1% to 88.5% for MnB test strains expressing vaccine&#x000ad;-heterologous fHBP variants A22, A56, B24, and B44, respectively. After 2 doses, responses ranged from 90.8% to 93.5%, 98.4% to 100%, 69.1% to 81.1%, and 70.1% to 77.5%. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were highest among subjects receiving 3 doses and similar between the 2- and 3-dose regimens. After 2 doses, GMTs trended numerically higher among subjects with longer intervals between the first and second dose (6 months vs 2 and 4 months). Bivalent rLP2086 was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bivalent rLP2086 was immunogenic and well tolerated when administered in 2 or 3 doses. Three doses yielded the most robust hSBA response rates against MnB strains expressing vaccine-heterologous subfamily B fHBPs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bivalent rLP2086</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>functional immunogenicity</kwd><kwd><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup B</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup B (MnB) causes most meningococcal disease in Europe and approximately one third of cases in the United States [<xref rid="PIV039C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MnB infection is more common among adolescents and young adults than the general adult population [<xref rid="PIV039C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MnB polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic, likely due to cross-reacting epitopes of MnB capsular polysaccharide with polysialic acid structures on human neuronal cells [<xref rid="PIV039C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vaccines produced from MnB outer membrane vesicles have shown clinical efficacy in children older than 4 years, against MnB strains bearing antigens homologous to those in the vaccine, but not against strains expressing antigens heterologous to the vaccine [<xref rid="PIV039C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV039C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, alternative approaches based on conserved MnB protein antigens have been pursued to provide protection against diverse strains causing endemic and epidemic invasive MnB disease. A recombinant, multicomponent MnB vaccine (Bexsero, Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy) has been licensed in the European Union, Canada, Australia [<xref rid="PIV039C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV039C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and, more recently, in the United States [<xref rid="PIV039C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another multicomponent vaccine candidate, bivalent rLP2086 (Trumenba<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), was recently approved in the United States to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused by MnB in individuals 10 to 25 years of age [<xref rid="PIV039C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The target antigen for this vaccine, LP2086, was identified using a combined biochemical and functional immunologic screening approach [<xref rid="PIV039C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>LP2086 is a bacterial, surface-exposed virulence factor that binds human factor H, also known as factor H binding protein (fHBP) [<xref rid="PIV039C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a comprehensive survey of 1837 MnB strains isolated from patients with invasive disease in the United States and Europe, the LP2086 gene was present in all isolates [<xref rid="PIV039C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], although in rare cases, invasive disease-causing MnB strains may lack a functional LP2086 gene [<xref rid="PIV039C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. LP2086 protein sequences can be grouped into 2 genetically and immunologically distinct subfamilies, designated A (30% of isolates) and B (70% of isolates) [<xref rid="PIV039C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The bivalent vaccine contains recombinant lipidated proteins from each LP2086 subfamily (bivalent rLP2086), because this formulation was shown to be most effective at inducing broadly protective serum bactericidal antibodies. In phase 1 and 2 studies, immune sera elicited by bivalent rLP2086 demonstrated bacterial killing activity, measured in serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBAs), against diverse MnB strains bearing fHBP variants of both subfamilies and heterologous in sequence to those in the vaccine [<xref rid="PIV039C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV039C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For immunogenicity evaluations, 4 MnB test strains were selected to reflect the epidemiology, breadth, and global distribution of MnB strains. Each hSBA test strain expresses an fHBP variant that is different from vaccine components, thus allowing an objective assessment of functional and protective bactericidal immune responses against invasive disease-associated strains in circulation [<xref rid="PIV039C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>This study evaluated the immunogenicity, tolerability, and safety of bivalent rLP2086 administered in 3-dose or 2-dose regimens in healthy adolescents aged 11 to &#x0003c;19 years at enrollment. The immune response measured by hSBA was evaluated 1 month after dose 2 or 3 and included the percentage of subjects achieving hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8, a more conservative indicator of potential seroprotection than the recognized correlate of protection, an hSBA titer &#x02265;1:4 [<xref rid="PIV039C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Subjects were judged healthy by the investigator and agreed to practice an effective form of contraception. Key exclusion criteria were previous vaccination with any MnB vaccine; previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccine-related component; history of culture-proven <italic>N meningitidis</italic> or <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> disease; pregnancy or nursing; current chronic use of systemic antibiotics; bleeding diathesis or condition that would contraindicate intramuscular injection; known or suspected disease of the immune system or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy; any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition; and receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin, within 6 months before the first study vaccination.</p><p>Subjects were randomized 3:3:3:2:1 corresponding to a 0,1,6-month, 0,2,6-month, 0,6-month, 0,2-month, and 0,4-month bivalent rLP2086 dosing schedule, respectively (groups 1&#x02013;5) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PIV039TB1">1</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PIV039F1">1</xref>). The unequal randomization schedule reflects the comparisons of interest for this study. The first 3 groups (randomized 3:3:3) were assigned to meet the hypothesis testing objectives; the remaining 2 groups (randomized 2:1) were descriptive and were used to explore different rLP2086 dosing schedules. Subjects were randomized using an interactive voice- or web-based response system. Enrollment was stratified by age (11 to &#x0003c;14 and 14 to &#x0003c;19 years) to ensure that all ages were adequately represented in the study. Each subject received 4 study injections, with administration of 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 according to the aforementioned dosing schedule; saline was administered when bivalent rLP2086 was not scheduled. Participants were blinded to their assigned dose regimen. All laboratory staff were blinded to subject, visit, and treatment (ie, randomization group), but investigators and sponsor knew the allocation of subjects throughout the study.

Vaccination against non-B meningococcal serogroups (ACWY) has proven efficacious in all age groups, particularly in adolescents who are at high risk for meningococcal disease [<xref rid="PIV039C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The need for an effective MnB vaccine is underscored by recent outbreaks on US college campuses and by endemic infections worldwide [<xref rid="PIV039C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV039C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The low basal immunity to meningococcal B strains in this study emphasizes the vulnerability of adolescents to infection and disease caused by <italic>N meningitidis</italic> serogroup B.</p><p>In this study, all 5 bivalent rLP2086 vaccination regimens, regardless of schedule or frequency, were immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy adolescents. The 2-dose and 3-dose regimens elicited robust immune responses. Considering that hSBA titers &#x02265;1:4 are an accepted correlate for protection against invasive meningococcal disease [<xref rid="PIV039C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and that seroprotective responses in this study were defined using more stringent criteria of hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8, bivalent rLP2086 has demonstrated a substantial and broad immune response after 2 doses and a more robust response after 3 doses, when administered across a range of dosing schedules. This study also allowed assessment of hSBA responses after 1 dose of bivalent rLP2086. After a single vaccination, increased seroprotective responses compared with baseline against all MnB test strains were observed.</p><p>Among recipients receiving 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086, the timing of the second vaccination, whether 1 or 2 months after initial vaccination, had no discernable effect on immunogenicity. Nonetheless, the ability to elicit robust responses after 2 doses 1 month apart may be valuable during outbreaks when timely protection is critical. Immune responses after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 were substantial and indicative of a broad immune response to the MnB test strains that were selected to represent epidemiologically and antigenically relevant invasive MnB strains. Immunogenicity generally increased in the 2-dose schedules when there was a longer interval between the first and second dose, as seen by the higher GMTs and generally higher proportion of subjects with hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 after dose 2 in the 0,6-month dosing regimen compared with the other dosing schedules. Similar observations were described for quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination [<xref rid="PIV039C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In these studies, increasing the interval between doses 2 and 3 from 4 to 10 months resulted in higher antibody titers against all 4 human papillomavirus types examined.</p><p>Similar to other clinical studies of bivalent rLP2086 in adolescents and adults [<xref rid="PIV039C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="PIV039C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the majority of safety events observed in this study were local reactions and systemic events that were mild or moderate in severity, transient, and without potentiation at subsequent dosing. Approximately two thirds of subjects did not report any AEs during the study. Overall, 90.6% of subjects were able to complete their vaccination series, indicating that vaccinations were well tolerated in adolescents and that any safety events, such as injection-site pain, were not an impediment to vaccination. Safety events were not increased in subjects receiving a third dose of bivalent rLP2086.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 were immunogenic and well tolerated. The 2-dose regimens provided substantial hSBA responses against diverse MnB strains expressing fHBP variants heterologous to vaccine antigen. However, the 3-dose regimens yielded the highest seroconversion rates against subfamily B strains and a higher level of hSBA antibodies as measured by GMTs. The convenience of a 2-dose schedule and the potential benefit of higher level of protective antibodies after a 3-dose schedule should be carefully considered for future MnB immunization schedules.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all the parents and guardians of all participants and the many investigators and study staff for their individual contributions to this study.
