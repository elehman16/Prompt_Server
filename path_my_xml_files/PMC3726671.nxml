In this study, NMR and LC-MS untargeted metabolomics has been used as an approach to explore the impact of TFA intake on plasma metabolites.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In a double-blinded randomized controlled parallel-group study, 52 overweight postmenopausal women received either partially hydrogenated soybean oil, providing 15.7 g/day of TFA (<italic>trans</italic>18:1) or control oil with mainly oleic acid for 16 weeks. Subsequent to the intervention period, the subjects participated in a 12-week dietary weight loss program. Before and after the TFA intervention and after the weight loss programme, volunteers participated in an oral glucose tolerance test. PLSDA revealed elevated lipid profiles with TFA intake. NMR indicated up-regulated LDL cholesterol levels and unsaturation. LC-MS profiles demonstrated elevated levels of specific polyunsaturated (PUFA) long-chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and a sphingomyelin (SM) which were confirmed with a lipidomics based method. Plasma levels of these markers of TFA intake declined to their low baseline levels after the weight loss program for the TFA group and did not fluctuate for the control group. The marker levels were unaffected by OGTT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study demonstrates that intake of TFA affects phospholipid metabolism. The preferential integration of <italic>trans</italic>18:1 into the sn-1 position of PCs, all containing PUFA in the sn-2 position, could be explained by a general up-regulation in the formation of long-chain PUFAs after TFA intake and/or by specific mobilisation of these fats into PCs. NMR supported these findings by revealing increased unsaturation of plasma lipids in the TFA group. These specific changes in membrane lipid species may be related to the mechanisms of TFA-induced disease but need further validation as risk markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Registered at clinicaltrials.gov as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0065590">NCT00655902</ext-link>

Partially hardened oils are appealing for food industry owing to their properties such as long shelf life, their stability during deep-frying and their semi-solidity. However, consumption of TFA in the human diet has been associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0069589-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069589-SoaresMiranda1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, diabetes <xref rid="pone.0069589-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and sudden death from cardiac causes <xref rid="pone.0069589-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. TFA has now been banned in a few countries, including Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Sweden, and Switzerland as well as in California and in the New York municipality in the USA. Denmark was the first country where the background level of TFA exposure was minimized because the industry after the ban in 2004 succeeded in removing these fats from more than 90% all marketed products. However, this is not the situation in many other countries and studies to further document and understand the causes of TFA mediated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk are therefore still needed. This risk has been linked to the impact of TFA on lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial function <xref rid="pone.0069589-Mozaffarian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It has been well documented that TFA intake increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, reduces high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0069589-Mensink1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069589-Flock1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Nevertheless, the incidence of CHD reported in prospective studies as a result of TFA exposure has been greater than that predicted by increased serum lipids or inflammation alone. Thus, the observed associations between TFA consumption and cardiovascular disease events cannot be explained only by changes in lipoprotein levels, triglycerides, apolipoprotein (Apo) B/ApoAI ratio and C-reactive protein <xref rid="pone.0069589-Mozaffarian2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, implying that the mechanisms behind the adverse effects of TFAs are not fully understood. TFA exposure has also been associated with a higher risk of fatal ischemic heart disease <xref rid="pone.0069589-Yaemsiri1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and sudden cardiac death <xref rid="pone.0069589-Lemaitre2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although the potential mechanism between TFA and sudden cardiac death is unclear, some have suggested that TFA may modulate cardiac membrane ion channel function <xref rid="pone.0069589-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or have proarrhythmic properties, affecting cardiovascular electrophysiology <xref rid="pone.0069589-SoaresMiranda1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Some evidence also pointed to a possible effect of TFA on obesity. A dietary 16-week intervention study was conducted here in 2008 by Bendsen et al. <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> to examine the effect of a high intake of industrially produced TFA (<italic>trans</italic>18:1) compared to the <italic>cis</italic> analog (<italic>cis</italic>18:1) on central obesity and insulin sensitivity. The low TFA background in Denmark made it feasible to conduct a TFA intervention against a clean background in the control group to unambiguously assess any shorter-term effects on central fat deposition or other risk markers of CHD. However, the study did not provide evidence for effects on obesity development. In order to search for new hypotheses and fill the gap between TFA intake and its detrimental health impacts, we selected an untargeted metabolomics approach to profile plasma samples from this study.</p><p>Metabolic profiling allows semiquantification of hundreds of metabolites in blood samples and might provide a unique insight into the potential underlying mechanisms. Many studies have demonstrated metabolomics as a powerful tool to understand responses of individuals with respect to their gene expression or alterations in their lifestyles and diets <xref rid="pone.0069589-Oresic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The application of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in metabolomics for measurement of a wide range of metabolites in various biofluids has been well established. NMR provides high reproducibility and is a powerful tool in terms of quantification, whereas LC-MS is more sensitive, allowing detection of a larger number of chemical compounds, albeit with lower reproducibility.</p><p>Our results from the untargeted metabolomics analysis of the TFA intervention study revealed an increased presence during TFA intake of membrane-derived, specific long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing PCs and a SM, suggesting the possibility of using these compounds as individual markers of TFA integration into plasma membranes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 64 volunteers were assessed for eligibility and 52 healthy, moderately overweight (body mass index between 25 and 32 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), normolipidemic (LDL-C below 6 mmol/L) postmenopausal women, between 45 to 70 years of age, were recruited in this study.

The clinical trial protocol is given as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069589.s002">Protocol S1</xref>). The subjects were randomized by strata of waist circumference with a cut-off at 96 cm to assure that both strata were equally represented in the two groups. Randomization numbers from a pre-defined list were provided by a third party to the kitchen who delivered bread rolls differing in their TFA content to the subjects. Subjects were given 26 g/d of partially hydrogenated soybean oil with approximately 60% <italic>trans</italic> fats (TFA group; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25) or 50/50% mix of palm oil and high oleic sunflower oil as the control oil (CTR group; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;27) for 16 weeks. Both test oils were supplied by Aarhus Karlshamn, Aarhus C, Denmark. The fatty acid composition in the oils has been described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Briefly, the two fats differed in the content of TFA (18:1 <italic>trans</italic>-9, 18:1 <italic>trans</italic>-8, 18:1 <italic>trans</italic>-7), palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1 <italic>cis</italic>-9) and linoleic acids (18:2 <italic>cis</italic>-6). The fats were incorporated into bread rolls providing a total of 600 kcal/d (41 E% from fat), equivalent to 28% of the subjects' energy requirements on average. Frozen rolls were handed out to the subjects every 1&#x02013;4 weeks from the department for consumption at home.</p><p>The women visited the department for four examinations during the intervention: at screening (1&#x02013;8 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (w0), mid-intervention (week 8) and at the end of treatment (w16). In addition, the subjects attended the department for control weighing at weeks 4 and 12. Subjects were instructed to maintain their habitual activity level throughout the dietary intervention period. Subsequent to the dietary intervention period, the subjects participated in a 12-week (w28) dietary weight loss program. The blood samples for metabolomics analysis were collected only at w0, w16 and w28.</p><p>Dietary intake was measured using 3-day weighed food records at baseline and in the last week of the intervention. The only significant dietary differences between diet groups during the intervention were the contributions of energy from monounsaturated cis-fatty acids (MUFA) and TFA, indicating that the diets were overall comparable apart from the <italic>cis/trans</italic> fatty acid composition. The intake of TFA was higher (7.0&#x000b1;0.2 E% [mean &#x000b1; SEM] vs. 0.3&#x000b1;0.0 E%) and the intake of cis-MUFA was lower (10.3&#x000b1;0.4 E% vs. 13.4&#x000b1;0.8 E%) in the TFA group compared with the CTR group <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The study was carried out at the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sport, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, between April 2008 and March 2009 and was approved by the Municipal Ethical Committee of The Capital Region of Denmark in accordance with the Helsinki-II declaration (H-B_2007-089). A copy of the document issued by ethical committee, confirming your study was considered and approved was included as supporting information (Document S1). Subjects received 900 US$ as compensation on completion of all the tests. This level of compensation is customary in Denmark for participation in longer-term demanding trials to cover transportation, discomfort, and the time spent but is taxed at a level of approximately 50%. The overweight volunteers were further offered a free 3-months weight loss programme. With the weight loss programme we aimed to reverse the putatively unbeneficial effect of the <italic>trans</italic>-fat, and thereby we anticipated that the subjects would be healthier after than before participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Prior to each visit, the subjects were told to fast for at least 10 hours (except for 0.5 L water).

Body weight and height were measured by standard procedures.</p><p>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by use of frequent sampling 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) where subjects ingested a solution of 75 g glucose dissolved in 300 mL water. Venous blood samples were collected before and during the OGTT at &#x02212;10, 30 and 120 minutes into 4 mL EDTA-coated tubes (BD Medical, Albertslund, Denmark).

An ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to quadruple time-of-flight (Premier QTOF) mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) was used for sample analysis. The mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in 70% acetonitrile and 30% methanol (B). Five &#x000b5;L of each sample were injected into a HSS T3 C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000d7;100 mm, 1.8 &#x000b5;m) coupled with a VanGuard HSS T3 C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000d7;5 mm, 1.8 &#x000b5;m) operated for 7.0 min. The eluate was analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-QTOF-MS (Premium QTOF, Waters) in positive and negative mode, applying a capillary voltage of 3.2 kV and 2.8 kV, respectively and cone voltage of 20 kV. Ion source and desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperatures were set at 120 and 400&#x000b0;C, respectively. More detailed UPLC-QTOF analysis conditions were explained previously <xref rid="pone.0069589-Barri1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Blanks (5% of acetonitrile&#x02236;methanol 70&#x02236;30 v/v in water) and external metabolomics standard mixtures were injected every 30 plasma samples throughout each analytical batch.</p><p>In order to identify relevant metabolites, MS/MS fragmentation analyses were performed by post-column infusion experiments conducted as follows: a 1.6 mM solution of lithium formate dissolved in water-propanol (1&#x02236;1) was infused at 4 uL/min using a Waters built-in syringe pump. Both flows, from the UPLC column and the infusion pump, were combined using a zero-dead-volume &#x02018;T&#x02019; union and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The MS/MS experiment was conducted in positive ion mode operating in product ion scan. The collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy was set at 25 eV and the MS/MS scan range at m/z 100-850. All other parameters were set to the same values with the MS experiment.</p><p>In order to verify the findings of lipophilic markers, we performed a lipidomics analysis of 12 samples from each treatment group at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Each sample was added with the internal standards, PC(17:0/0:0), PC(17:0/17:0), PE (17:0/17:0), PG(17:0/17:0), Cer(d18:1/17:0), PS(17:0/17:0), PA(17:0/17:0), racemic MG(17:0/0:0/0:0), racemic DG(17:0/17:0/0:0) and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0) . The concentration of each standard was approximately 0.1 &#x000b5;g/sample. The samples were extracted as described previously <xref rid="pone.0069589-Grdeniz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but an additional extraction with 200 uL chloroform&#x02236;methanol (2&#x02236;1 v/v) was performed on the Sirocco<sup>R</sup> filter support by gentle shaking with the precipitated protein for 5 min followed by opening of the valves to collect the additional extract. The combined extract was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 190 uL water-saturated chloroform-methanol (2&#x02236;1). Before injection 0.1 &#x000b5;g of the following additional standards were added in 10 &#x000b5;L of the same solvent: PC(16:1/0:0-D3), PC(16:1/16:1-D6), and TG(16:0/16:0/16:0-13C3), as described by Nygren et al (2011). The samples were injected on the UPLC-QTOF system using a HSS T3 C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000d7;100 mm, 1.8 &#x000b5;m) coupled with a VanGuard HSS T3 C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000d7;5 mm, 1.8 &#x000b5;m). Solvent A was 1% 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Ac and 0.1% HCOOH in water and solvent B was acetonitrile:2-propanol (1&#x02236;1, v/v), 1% 1 M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH. A 6 min gradient from 100% A to 100% B was used. A gradient in flow was also applied starting from 0.2 mL/min, increasing to 0.5 mL/min over 3 min and going back to starting conditions at 10 min with 2 min re-equilibration time before the next injection.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Identification of lipids</title><p>Authentic standards PC(18:0/18:2), PC(<italic>cis</italic>18:1/<italic>cis</italic>18:1), PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/<italic>trans</italic>18:1), PC(18:0/18:2), PC(18:0/20:4), and PC(18:0/22:6) were analysed by LC-MS with sample analysis instrumental conditions. As it was not possible to purchase the standard compound for each PC and SM, we developed a simple algorithm to identify the various PCs and SMs by their retention time and m/z. An increased number of carbon atoms results in decreased polarity and increased retention time. In addition, for a PC, SM or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) with a specific carbon number, an increasing number of double bonds in the fatty acyl chain reduces the retention time. Since each of the lipid species appear with its Na<sup>+</sup> adduct, this information is utilized to remove irrelevant matches for positive mode data. The samples were analysed two years prior to the authentic standards which resulted in +0.1 min linear shift in retention time. Thus, 0.1 min was added to the retention time of each compound in the data set. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069589-g001">Figure 1</xref> for PCs, the retention times of authentic standards were matching almost precisely with the predicted ones (+0.1 min), thereby validating the model. Equally good matching was observed for retention times of authentic standard of SM (36:2) and the observed SM (36:2) (not shown).

PC(18:1/22:6) is annotated by the algorithm whereas SM(18:1/18:2) was characterised by MS/MS analysis using Li infusion. Further information about spectral fragmentation patterns (MS/MS) of the PC(18:1/20:3), PC(18:1/22:5), PC(18:1/22:6) and SM(18:1/18:2) is explained in detail as follows.</p><p>The product ion spectrum of lithated [M+Li]+ ions for PC(18:0/22:6) and PC(18:0/20:4) standards were comparable with the product ion spectrum of lithated [M+Li]+ ions in samples. A few PCs appeared as two isomers, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069589-g001">Figure 1</xref>, corresponding to structural differences of naturally occurring isomers. The ions arising from loss of trimethylamine [M-59], ethylene phosphate [M-183] and lithium ethylene phosphate [M-189] were common fragments for CID spectra of PCs and SMs. The earlier eluting isomer of PC(38:4) gave rise to the fragment ions 504.3, 528.3 and 534.3, matching with the potential fragmentation pattern of PC(18:1/20:3). The ions 504.3 and 528.3 represents the neutral loss of the sn-2 fatty acyl substituent as a lithium salt [M+Li-R2CO2Li]+ and as a ketene [M+Li-R2&#x02032;CHCO]+, respectively <xref rid="pone.0069589-Ivanova1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069589-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, the loss of sn-1 fatty acyl as a free fatty acid yielded the ion 534.3 corresponding to ([LPC(20:3)-H2O+Li]+). The later eluting isomer of PC(38:4) coeluted with our standard, PC(18:0/20:4). MS/MS spectra of the earlier eluting isomer of PC(40:6) implied contribution of two species (PC(18:1/22:5) and PC(20:2/20:4)) to a single chromatographic peak. The ions 552.3 and 526.3 resulted from loss of the sn-1 acyl group as a lithium salt from PC(18:1/22:5) and PC(20:2/20:4), respectively. The most abundant fragment was arising from the removal of the sn-1 substituent as a ketene. The later eluting isomer of PC(40:6) coeluted with our standard, PC(18:0/22:6). MS/MS fragmentation of PC(40:7) lead to its identification as PC(18:1/22:6) based on the fragment ions 550.3 ([M+Li-R1&#x02032;CHCO]+) and 556.3 ([M+Li-R1CO2Li]+). MS/MS fragmentation of the pseudomolcular ion of PC(40:7) [M+H] on a Waters Synapt supported its identity with fragments 445.3 ([LPC(18:1)-OH]+), 504.3 ([M+H-R1CO2H] +), 568.3([M+H-R1&#x02032;CHCO]+) and 522.3 ([M+H-R2&#x02032;CHCO]+). However, the CID spectrum of SM(36:3) did not reveal any abundant ions that identify the fatty acyl substituents.</p><p>We putatively characterized PC(44:9), which is observed only as its potassium adduct, and we could therefore not include it into our prediction model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069589-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

Another outcome from NMR was elevated unsaturated lipid signals for the TFA group, which can be attributed to an increased level of unsaturated fatty acyl side chains in lipid species.

Their results did not reveal any significant alteration between the CTR and TFA groups with respect to the PUFA (or monounsaturated) fatty acid levels, except for a different content of TFA. Thus, this difference may be arising from unsaturation of other lipid groups such as triglycerides in the lipoproteins. Similarly, an elevated unsaturation in the NMR spectrum (&#x003b4; 5.3&#x02013;5.4 and &#x003b4; 1.9&#x02013;2.5) of HepG2 cell extracts exposed to TFA was mentioned by Najbjerg et al. <xref rid="pone.0069589-Najbjerg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in which they concluded disturbed lipid storage efficiency with TFA intake.</p><p>The LC-MS profiles demonstrated elevated levels of a limited number of polyunsaturated long chain PCs (PC(40:7), PC(40:6), PC(38:4)) and of SM(36:3), which has the longest chain and the highest unsaturation among all detected SMs. Increased double bond formation was also supported by the NMR results. None of these markers were affected by the OGTT test, revealing that they are not necessarily only fasting state markers. TFA intake did not seem to have long term effects on the composition of plasma lipids, as their levels at w28 after intervention (after the weight loss period) were comparable to baseline (w0) levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069589-g007">Figure 7</xref>. We observed here SM(36:3) as a marker of TFA intake. This SM was present at very low levels in the non-TFA group indicating that it represents an unusual structure. An increased level of total plasma SMs has been associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0069589-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069589-Schlitt1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> although the consequence in terms of cardiovascular risk has been debated <xref rid="pone.0069589-Yeboah1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this study we observed an increase in only a single, minor SM having two C18 chains with one and two double bonds, respectively, either SM(d18:2/18:1) or SM(d18:1/18:2). The configuration (<italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>) around the double bonds in these markers is unresolved and the atherogenic potential of this specific SM will need further investigation. There was no correlation between the concentration of this SM and any other SMs. We speculate that the marker observed here has a &#x00394;9 or &#x00394; 11 <italic>trans</italic>-fatty sphingosine chain containing a <italic>cis</italic>-double bond in the 3-position. This would result from &#x00394;7 or &#x00394;9- and other <italic>trans</italic>-hexadecanoic acids being a substrate for the slightly promiscuous serine palmitoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.50) <xref rid="pone.0069589-Merrill1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> to form a 3-ketodehydrosphingosine, which would then be reduced and acylated by oleyl-CoA followed by desaturation to form Cer(d18:2/18:1). This ceramide would act as a precursor to the SM(d18:2/18:1) formed by SM synthase (EC 2.7.8.27). We are not able to see the less polar products postulated here, not even by lipidomics, but the consequence of this hypothesis would be that after intakes of <italic>trans</italic>16:1 fatty acids it would be possible to observe the formation of a whole series of sphingolipids containing the unusual &#x00394;9 or &#x00394;11- <italic>trans</italic>- &#x00394;3-<italic>cis</italic> C18:2 and other similar sphingosines with the <italic>trans</italic> double bond in other positions. In the current study <italic>trans</italic>16:1 was below the detection limit in the diet but it is likely that it is formed by &#x003b2;-oxidation of &#x00394;9 or &#x00394; 11-<italic>trans</italic>-18:1. In a study of 16:1 ruminant TFAs, the &#x00394;9 was the dominating isomer but <italic>trans</italic> double bond isomers with the double bond at any carbon from position 3 up to 14 also existed <xref rid="pone.0069589-Precht1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The identity of our SM(d18:2/18:1) marker needs to be finally proven in separate studies, and if the assignment is correct the biological and especially neurological consequence of changing the usual <italic>cis</italic>-&#x00394;3-sphingosines by an aberrant backbone must be elucidated.</p><p>We succeeded in identifying several PCs based on authentic standards and by a systematic pattern of RTs depending on chain length and saturation. Based on this pattern we could identify two PC's, PC(40:6) and PC(40:7), which were specifically increased in plasma following dietary TFAs, and PC(38:4), which tended to be increased as well. These PCs carry a C18:1 acyl side chain in one position and a long-chain PUFA chain in the other based on their CID fragmentation patterns. Since C20 and C22 acyl side chains in PCs are almost exclusively found in the sn-2 position in humans <xref rid="pone.0069589-Marai1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, it is most likely that the 18:1 is found in the sn-1 position. TFAs, including <italic>trans</italic>-vaccenic acid (&#x00394;11-<italic>trans</italic>-18:1), sterically resemble saturated fatty acids and might therefore substitute for these in the sn-1 position. In agreement, the preferential incorporation of elaidic acid to the sn-1 chain of phospholipids has been reported in hepatocytes by Woldseth et al. <xref rid="pone.0069589-Woldseth1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In accordance, Wolf and Entressangles <xref rid="pone.0069589-Wolff1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> showed that phospholipids from rat liver mitochondria modified <italic>in vivo</italic> had large quantities of elaidic acid esterified at the sn-1 position. We therefore propose that the species observed here are PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/22:5), PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/22:6) and PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/20:3). This hypothesis is supported by the previously reported elevated <italic>trans</italic>-18:1 residue levels in red blood cell phospholipids in the TFA group <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>It is well known that TFA incorporate membrane phospholipids into plasma altering the packing of phospholipid and influencing the physical properties and responses of membrane receptors <xref rid="pone.0069589-Clandinin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069589-Roach1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. TFA produce membrane properties more similar to those of saturated chains than those of acyl chains containing <italic>cis</italic> double bonds <xref rid="pone.0069589-Roach1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. When incorporated into membrane phospholipids, TFA either replace existing saturated or <italic>cis</italic> unsaturated acyl chains. Harvey et al. <xref rid="pone.0069589-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> showed that both elaidic and linoelaidic acid integrated into phospholipids, mainly at the expense of myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids, without causing any net gain in total fatty acid levels. In our study, the published membrane phospholipid levels <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> revealed significantly decreased stearic acid (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04) and oleic acid (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) abundance in the TFA group compared to CTR, suggesting replacement of those with elaidic acid. Although LC-MS based metabolomics did not show any decrease in PCs having one saturated fatty acyl chain, elaidic acid-containing specific PCs potentially increased in the TFA group. Many other researchers have investigated the variation of fatty acid composition in red blood cell PCs after TFA intake; however none of them reported the effect of TFA intake on specific PCs. Here, LC-MS based metabolomics demonstrated up-regulation of specific PCs with TFA. Moreover the inter-individual variation in the plasma level of these markers indicates that a variable response to the same dose of TFA may exist although any relation of our current markers to CVD risk needs confirmation in observational studies.</p><p>The TFA markers, PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/20:3), PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/22:4) and PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/22:5), preferentially integrated into PCs all contain PUFA in the sn-2 position. There was no difference in the dietary intake of PUFAs in the two diet groups <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, so the preferred presence of these specific acyl chains together with <italic>trans</italic>18:1 would need an explanation. The two minor markers have peaks with a RT slightly different from the main, 18:0 containing PC(40:6) and PC(38:4) peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069589-g001">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that they may be detectable due to better signal-to-noise ratio for these specific compounds, but the more prominent PC(40:7) marker is actually dominating the only PC(40:7) peak observed and the level in the non-TFA group is quite low. This is not surprising since this compound in general would be a minor PC because it violates the general rule of saturated sn-1 and unsaturated sn-2 acyl chains and because no C22 fatty acid with seven double bonds exists in human lipids. Other minor TFA-containing PCs may therefore exist but with RTs that fall on top of major PCs so that they are not detected as markers. However, it is still noticeable that PC(40:7) is so abundant. It forms a large peak comparable to other major PCs, indicating a facilitated formation. We also found evidence for the presence of the even longer PC(44:9). These observations could either indicate that there is a general up-regulation in the formation of long-chain PUFAs after TFA intake and/or that these fats are specifically mobilised into PC as a result of TFA exposure. It has been shown that the acyl chain distribution is very similar in plasma and erythrocyte membranes, indicating that plasma PCs may be a surrogate marker for membrane composition. Indeed, most plasma PCs may be abstracted from the membranes in contact with blood. Increased formation of long-chain PUFAs has been observed in adipose tissue membranes in overweight individuals <xref rid="pone.0069589-Pietilainen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, resulting from increased elongase and desaturase activities. This phenomenon is likely due to compensation for the increased fat load in the adipocytes in order for them to remain functional, despite their enlargement during weight gain <xref rid="pone.0069589-Pietilainen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. TFA resembling saturated fatty acids may therefore negatively affect adipose tissue function leading to a response similar to that seen during weight gain with increased formation of long-chain PUFA's. This is supported also by an increased unsaturation in the NMR spectra for the TFA group, yet the FA composition of red blood cell phospholipids did not show any overall significant increase in PUFA <xref rid="pone.0069589-Bendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Further investigation of the PUFA distribution among specific membrane PCs is therefore needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>As previously mentioned, phospholipids containing TFA behave similar to saturated fatty acids rather than to their <italic>cis</italic> monounsaturated isomers. It has been reported that <italic>trans</italic>-acyl chains adopt extended configurations similar to saturated acyl chains, allowing better interaction with the cholesterol molecule compared with their <italic>cis</italic> analogs <xref rid="pone.0069589-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. These effects could be contributing factors in modulating cholesterol homeostasis, and as such, may be part of the explanation of the elevation of LDL cholesterol by a TFA-rich diet <xref rid="pone.0069589-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> which was demonstrated by NMR. Although TFA has properties similar to those of saturated fatty acids and also substitute for saturated fatty acids in membrane lipids, it has been confirmed in a meta-analysis that TFA raises levels of LDL more than an equal amount of saturated fatty acids. This demonstrates the effect on LDL levels is much larger when TFAs are compared with their <italic>cis</italic> analogs <xref rid="pone.0069589-Mensink1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study was established to investigate the effect of 18:1 TFA intake on plasma metabolites using an untargeted approach. As results demonstrate specific lipid molecular species in plasma were formed as a result of TFA exposure and all belong to the SM and PC polar lipids that exist in plasma in equilibrium with the plasma membranes. From those, SM(d18:2/18:1) and PC(<italic>trans</italic>18:1/22:6) may be a general plasma marker of exposure to TFAs. We observed a variable individual marker response to the same TFA dose and the consequence of this response variation should be tested in further studies. We could also confirm that TFA exposure leads to increased plasma LDL. Further studies with other specific exposures to 16:1 and 18:2 TFAs would give further insight into the general and specific lipid markers of TFA exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0069589.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
