Continuous (thoracic) epidural analgesia (CEA) is routinely practiced for major abdominal surgery, but evidence is conflicting on its benefits in this setting. Potential disadvantages of epidural analgesia are a) perioperative hypotension, frequently requiring additional intravenous fluid boluses or prolonged use of vasopressors; b) relatively high failure rates, with periods of inadequate analgesia; and c) the risk of rare but serious, at times persistent, neurologic complications (hematoma and abscess). In recent years, continuous (subfascial) wound infiltration (CWI) plus patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been suggested as a safe and reliable alternative, which does not have the previously mentioned disadvantages, but evidence from multicenter trials targeting a specific surgical population is lacking.

Our primary endpoint is the Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS), a composite endpoint of pain intensity, opioid-related adverse effects and patient satisfaction, during postoperative days 1 to 5.

Effective analgesia may prevent complications such as pneumonia, thromboembolic events, and anxiety among patients. Effective analgesia can facilitate early mobilization and hence may result in earlier recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Continuous (thoracic) epidural analgesia (CEA) is routinely practiced for pain prevention after elective laparotomy, including hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery. This is supported by a recent Cochrane review, which showed statistically but not clinically relevant better analgesia with CEA compared to patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although CEA is sometimes promoted as part of fast-track or enhanced-recovery programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], evidence is conflicting on its benefits in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Potential disadvantages of CEA include a) perioperative hypotension, frequently requiring additional intravenous fluid boluses with risk of hypervolemia or prolonged use of vasopressors; b) relatively high failure rates (up to 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]), with periods of inadequate analgesia; c) the risk of rare but serious and sometimes persistent neurologic complications (hematoma and abscess)(approximately 1 in 5,700 for thoracic epidurals in surgical patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; and d) the need for indwelling urinary catheters. For these reasons, alternatives have been explored.</p><p>Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is rapidly gaining ground. The perceived benefits of PCEA compared to CEA are lower incidences of motor block, smaller infused volume of local anesthetic, and patients being less likely to require unscheduled anesthetic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Not all have switched, however, because PCEA and CEA have a similar safety profile, and randomized trials are lacking.</p><p>A promising alternative for (P)CEA is continuous (subfascial) wound infiltration (CWI) plus PCA. In several high volume centers for hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery, CWI+PCA has become the routine analgesic approach for all laparotomies. CWI involves the placement of two to three percutaneous catheters by the surgeon prior to closing of the laparotomy in the preperitoneal space. Continuous infusion of local anesthetics is started via these catheters. This technique potentially lacks the described downsides of (P)CEA. One of the disadvantages of CWI is potentially inferior pain control during the first 24&#x000a0;h requiring PCA with subsequent short-term higher opiate use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, CWI+PCA requires the use of two to three extra infusion pumps per patient.</p><p>The only randomized controlled trial with hospital stay as primary endpoint concluded that patients fulfilled the discharge criteria faster with the use of wound infiltration compared to epidural analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although various studies have shown promising results of CWI+PCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a widespread implementation of this technique has not yet been realized. One of the reasons could be the lack of randomized controlled trials, especially trials that focus on specific subsets of abdominal surgical procedures. This study focusses specifically on hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>To test the hypothesis that CWI+PCA is noninferior in terms of OBAS compared to (P)CEA for patients undergoing elective hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery via laparotomy with fewer side effects compared to (P)CEA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This trial is designed as a randomized controlled, parallel group, open-label, noninferiority, multicenter trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>This is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled noninferiority multicenter trial.

Compared to other local anesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly cardiotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when the bupivacaine is administered correctly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be per protocol. Secondary analyses will include an intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics will be presented using descriptive statistics. Continuous data will be assessed using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test if they are normally distributed or a Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test if otherwise. Categorical data will be analyzed using a Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. The mean difference between the two groups will be presented together with the higher bound of the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval. If, in the per-protocol analysis, the higher bound of the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval is lower than +3 OBAS point difference and the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval does not include the inferiority limit, noninferiority is considered proven. Additionally, the difference between the two groups will be assessed with a one-sided Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or a Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as appropriate.</p><p>Data on the primary and secondary endpoints that are missing will be categorized as no event. For other analyses, data will be considered missing at random. A sensitivity analysis excluding non-patient-controlled-CEA will be performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample size</title><p>A difference in a mean OBAS score of less than three points is considered noninferior. Therefore, the study must have the power to detect a difference of three points to reject the null hypothesis that CWI is inferior compared to (P)CEA. Using a one-sided alpha of 0.05, a standard deviation of 5 and a power of 90&#x000a0;%, 48 patients are necessary in each group. With an expected loss to follow up of 5&#x000a0;%, the total number of patients to randomize is 102. We aim to complete inclusion within a 12-month period because we have a recruitment pool of 180 laparotomies for hepato-pancreato-biliary conditions per year in both centers combined and expect 60&#x000a0;% of the patients to be both eligible and willing to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>For dichotomous data, frequencies will be presented. Continuous data will be presented as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range. Baseline characteristics (all prior to randomization) are as follows: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, smoking/non-smoking, indication for surgery, type of surgery/incision, preoperative pain (as VAS) and use of analgesics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>The trial&#x02019;s results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal regardless of the outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>Benefits</title><p>Both CEA and CWI+PCA have been described as effective methods to provide postoperative analgesia after midline or subcostal laparotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but (P)CEA is current routine practice in most centers worldwide. We hypothesize that the use of CWI+PCA is noninferior to CEA as measured by OBAS and has fewer potential disadvantages than described for CEA. In our opinion, the OBAS score is superior to VAS for evaluating the true effectiveness of analgesic therapy because OBAS is a composite endpoint combining pain score, opiate side effects and patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This is unlike all other previous studies, which focused primarily on pain scores or cumulative opioid consumption. These endpoints are also collected in this study.</p><p>A recent large retrospective study suggested equivalent pain scores and a reduced cumulative opioid consumption with the use of the exact same method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides that, in a systematic review, different variants of the method have proven to provide a similar analgesic effect compared to CEA measured by pain scores on a visual analog scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A secondary benefit of CWI+PCA is the broader field of application outside this clinical trial. The technique can be applied in patients with anticoagulant therapy, coagulopathies, and after refusal of epidural analgesia. It may also be used when laparoscopy is converted to laparotomy and in case of emergency surgery. CWI appears to be less invasive in nature and safer because of the absent risk of epidural hematoma and abscess. The placement under general anesthesia can be considered an advantage as well as a disadvantage. When not functioning, replacement is not possible outside the operating room, but an epidural analgesic technique would be possible in that case. Earlier removal of the indwelling urine catheter is possible because there is no additional risk of urinary retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CWI could require less supervision on the ward by the medical staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although this is heavily dependent on the local situation.</p><p>In contrast to other trials, where relatively expensive wound catheters were used that had costs sometimes as much as 280 euro per device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the extra cost of the materials used in our study is around 50 euro per patient. This is because we use the standard three-hole epidural catheter instead of the various variations of wound catheters with up to eight or sixteen holes. Since the location is subfascial, diffusion through the whole preperitoneal space is hypothetically possible; therefore, we do not expect advantages with the use of catheters with more side holes. This hypothesis is in line with the results of the previous mentioned retrospective study where the three-hole catheters as well as the same location were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our study is the first randomized trial to focus on practice-related benefits like hospital stay, indwelling urinary catheter use, hypotension, PACU/ICU stay and post-surgical pain as well as long-term analgesia dependency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Limitations</title><p>This is an open-label study. Since patient satisfaction is an important parameter for the OBAS, this design could be of influence. However, since our goal is to pragmatically investigate the entire effect of both treatment strategies and because patients are not blinded in daily practice and multiple placebo catheters (that is, CWI) might influence patient satisfaction, this might be of preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We chose noninferiority because superiority is not likely to be achieved for the primary outcome parameter. Furthermore, superiority was not considered necessary because of the previously mentioned advantages of CWI+PCA. A limitation of the study is that the patients in one center are treated with non-patient controlled CEA instead of PCEA. We expect this to apply to 20 to 25&#x000a0;% of all recruited patients. A benefit is that we can compare these groups afterwards. A sensitivity analysis will be performed regarding non-patient controlled CEA. One might argue that the addition of PCA to CWI is not necessary. However, previous studies have demonstrated that pain control in the first 24&#x000a0;h after surgery is less with CWI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and patients presumably benefit in particular at that time from PCA. In contrast to other studies, we added an additional bolus at the start of the procedure (the bupivacaine bolus of 30&#x000a0;ml total immediately after laparotomy on the final catheter sites). This is meant to compensate for the perioperative use of the epidural that might be the reason for the reduced pain control in the first 24&#x000a0;h. The solution of the epidural consists of local anesthetic combined with an opiate and CWI only provides a local anesthetic. Due to a shortage of morphine receptors in the abdominal layers, the local effect would be negligible and is therefore not indicated in CWI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the addition of opiates though PCA might be seen as logical. Another option was to opt for a more pure model by removing sufentanil from the epidural in the control group and also to equip them with PCA. However, because of the pragmatic approach of our trial, as well as our preference to treat the control group according to our current best practice, we chose not to remove sufentanil.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was randomized on 20 January 2015 with planned completion in February 2016.
