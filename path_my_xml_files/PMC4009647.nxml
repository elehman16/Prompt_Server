Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of 0.5% ropivacaine (made hyperbaric by the addition of desired dose of dextrose from autoclaved 10 ml ampoule of 25% dextrose) with commercial hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine using equal doses (15 mg) of almost similar specific gravities and to assess the suitability of ropivacaine as an alternative to lignocaine for intermediate duration of surgeries under SA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A pilot study was conducted on 10 patients receiving intrathecal 3 ml of hyperbaric 0.5% ropivacaine (83 mg/ml dextrose). Autoclaved ampoules of 25%, 10 ml dextrose were used for each patient to maintain sterility for mixing with commercially available sterile isobaric ropivacaine for intrathecal use. Samples of hyperbaric 0.5% ropivacaine (containing dextrose 83 mg/ml) were sent to the laboratory to test the specific gravity and for culture sensitivity. Another ten patients received intrathecal 3 ml of commercial hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine, and these samples were also tested for specific gravity in the same laboratory. The mean specific gravity of hyperbaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine noted. All patients were observed for block parameters, hemodynamic changes and for complications following SA. Following a pilot study, eighty patients gave written informed consent for the prospective double blind study, which was approved by the local research ethical committee. Patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I-II undergoing lower-abdominal, perineal or lower-limb surgery under SA were enrolled for the study. Eighty sealed envelopes labeled inside for Group R (<italic>n</italic> = 40) and Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 40) were mixed together. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized in double blind fashion by picking up the sealed envelope to receive 3 ml of ropivacaine 5 mg/ml (with dextrose 83 mg/ml) in Group R or 3 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml (containing dextrose 80 mg/ml) in Group B [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. For anxiolysis oral diazepam, 5-10 mg at night before surgery was given. On arrival in the anesthetic room, continuous monitoring with electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure and pulse oximetry were started. Intravenous (IV) infusion was given with 8 ml/kg of ringer lactate over 20 min before SA. Pre-medication in the form of (IV) glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and anti-aspiration prophylaxis with 10 mg metoclopramide and 50 mg ranitidine IV was given. Patients were placed in the left lateral position for lumbar puncture, and SA was performed using a midline approach at the L3-4 or L4-5 intervertebral space. A 25-Guage Quincke needle (Becton Dickinson S.A, Madrid, Spain) was inserted with the distal port facing laterally and the appropriate LA drug was injected over 10-15s. The hyperbaric ropivacaine solution was prepared aseptically (by an anesthetist who was not one of the investigators), immediately before injection by adding 1 ml (250 mg) of autoclaved 25% dextrose ampule (10 ml)to 2 ml of commercially available sterile preservative free isobaric solution of 0.75% ropivacaine (Ropin Neon). The bupivacaine 0.5% solution used was commercially available in India (Anawin Heavy, Neon). Patients were placed supine immediately after injection. The development of the block was recorded by an investigator who was blind to the nature and type of solution injected. The extent of sensory block (analgesia to pinprick), degree of lower limb motor block(with James modified Bromage Scale as used by Fettes <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]: 0 = full movement; 1 = inability to raise extended leg, can bend knee; 2 = inability to bend knee, can flex ankle; 3 = no movement), arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at 2 min interval for first 10 min post-injection and at 5 min intervals thereafter until two consecutive levels of sensory block were identical to consider it as fixation of the level, after which assessment was performed every 15 min interval until regression to T10 and then at 30 min intervals thereafter until complete regression of the sensory level at S2 and motor blockade of grade 0 on bromage scale was observed. Hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic pressure &#x0003e;30% from baseline, was treated with IV bolus of 5ml/kg ringers lactate and if needed phenylephrine 50 mcg. Fluids were administered to replace intraoperative losses. Bladder catheterization was performed only if surgically indicated. After surgery, patients were encouraged to mobilize under supervision only when the sensory block had regressed beyond L1 and the time of first micturition was noted. All patients were visited at 24 h and telephoned twice in a week later to identify any adverse sequelae.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-30-238-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To evaluate the block characteristics with intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine duration of sensory block observed during a pilot study was considered to select the sample size.

We used readily available 25% 10 ml dextrose ampoules, autoclaved to prevent the risk of bacterial contamination. It is known that ropivacaine is 30-40% less potent and effects are short lived than bupivacaine making it advantageous for short to intermediate duration of surgeries or ambulatory surgeries.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We observed that ropivacaine significantly produced slower onset but shorter time to peak effect (4.5 min, 13.5 min) than bupivacaine (3.2 min, 15 min); however, the level of sensory block achieved was similar and the duration of sensory block was significantly lesser with ropivacaine. The findings were similar to the study carried out in elective surgeries under SA by Whiteside and others[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] who observed onset time of 5 and 2 min with 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine in 5% and 8% glucose respectively.</p><p>We observed that ropivacaine has a less potent effect on motor nerves and the degree of sensory-motor separation is more as compared with bupivacaine, but can produce reliable SA, which has been supported by similar observations of other studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The findings were similar to the study carried out by Whiteside and others,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] who observed mean onset time of motor blockade of 15 min and 10 min and total duration of around 90 min and 180 min with similar dose of hyperbaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine respectively. Luck <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Also observed less degree and duration of motor blockade, lower incidence of bromage score of grade III in 63% with hyperbaric 0.5% ropivacaine as compared to 90% with 0.5% bupivacaine, with the similar dose of 3 ml with 30 mg/ml of glucose. We also observed grade III bromage score in 70% and 90% of patients receiving intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine respectively. Lee <italic>et al</italic>. studied intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine in different concentrations (2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 mg) for lower limb surgeries and found 100% successful anesthesia with the dose of 14 mg of ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We also noted that compared to bupivacaine ropivacaine group had good sensory blocks, favorable recovery profile of sensory/motor blockade and shorter time to first micturition. These features of ropivacaine are beneficial for ambulatory surgery. Hyperbaric lignocaine 5% has been used as a short-acting agent for ambulatory SA, but currently its use is restricted due to a high incidence of TNS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We found no evidence of any late sequelae such as backache or other transient symptoms in this study as with previous studies of ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hence, ropivacaine can be a safer alternative for ambulatory surgeries.</p><p>It is now, well-established that physical properties such as specific gravity, density and baricity of drug related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) determines the intrathecal spread of the drug, compared with plain solutions. Khaw <italic>et al</italic>. compared plain and hyperbaric ropivacaine for cesarean delivery in a dose of 25 mg with or without glucose 8.3% intrathecally. They observed faster onset and recovery, extensive spread and greater success rates with hyperbaric ropivacaine. They observed specific gravity of plain ropivacaine 1.0092 and that of hyperbaric ropivacaine to be 1.0345 at 37&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] We observed mean specific gravity of hyperbaric 0.5% ropivacaine (with 8.3% dextrose) to be1.0300 at 27&#x000b0;C, which is comparable to the specific gravity of 1.0250 with that of commercial heavy bupivacaine 0.5% (with 8% glucose) when tested in our laboratory. Schiffer <italic>et al</italic>. studied the influence of CSF density on the extent of plain bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia and has shown that with a higher CSF density, a higher spinal block level could be expected.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Wille reviewed various studies on isobaric and hyperbaric ropivacaine compared with bupivacaine. He concluded that intrathecal administration of isobaric ropivacaine is supported with evidence for the safe use of hyperbaric ropivacaine by the addition of 3-8% glucose for surgeries under SA including cesarean section and day care surgeries.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>There are few limitations with our study, due to non-availability of standard densitometer, exact density or baricity of hyperbaric ropivacaine was not estimated and hence, only specific gravity was tested during a pilot study. The specific gravities/densities of hyperbaric solutions mentioned in the literature and the mean specific gravity of both the hyperbaric preparations observed in our study were comparable. Besides, hyperbaric ropivacaine is not available commercially; extreme antiseptic care is required to prepare the hyperbaric solution. Hence, use of autoclaved dextrose ampoule was preferred and can be used safely to avoid the risk of contamination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that 0.5% ropivacaine (in 8.3% dextrose), made hyperbaric relative to CSF, can be easily prepared.
