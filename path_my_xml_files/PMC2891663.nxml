VC was prepared by wash and dry techniques and taken orally before smoking, matching the frequency of strenuous exercise (three times weekly). Before and after a two month period, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO), blood oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA], nitric oxide [NOx], protein hydroperoxide [PrOOH] and total antioxidant capacity [TAC]), beta-endorphin and smoking rate were measured, and statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In Group 1, MDA, PrOOH, and NOx significantly decreased, whereas TAC increased (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

Moreover, in low education, urban and eastern parts of the country, cigarette smoking has increased from 9.66 to 10.26 cigarettes per smoker per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Light and self-rolling cigarettes are generally used everywhere, especially in northern regions such as Chiang Mai province. Cigarette smoke contains an abundance of free radicals and prooxidant species known to negatively influence human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Increased production of free radicals from tobacco is recognized because of the more than 4,000 chemical substances found in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Previous reports have noted that the levels of protein carbonyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] are higher in smokers than non-smokers. Therefore, cigarette smoking related ill-health and disease may be mechanistically linked to increased production of free radicals. Aside from monitoring bloodborne biomarkers of oxidized molecules, evaluation of oxidative stress from smoking can be determined from exhaled hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO). Nicotine in smoke is known to release neuroendocrine substances, such as beta-endorphin (&#x003b2;-end) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], found in women smokers with either high doses of nicotine cigarettes or with heavy smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, a previous report showed that nicotine stimulates the pituitary release of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) which contains the precursor for &#x003b2;-end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Smoking cessation has been promoted in Thailand as well as in other countries in the world. Previous evidence shows that behavioral counseling and/or pharmacotherapy is successful in long-term abstinence at a rate of approximately 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and pharmacotherapy is widely used in within the smoking clinic. Major disadvantages of this approach are high cost and the unwanted side effects such as nausea, dry mouth, weight gain, and sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Exercise is a popular activity that is recognized to change in behavior and habit, including smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Acute and strenuous intensity exercise transiently increases the production of free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to the activation and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes following various aerobic exercise protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While this increase in antioxidant defense may prove helpful in combating smoke-induce free radical producton, perhaps more importantly vigorous exercise may aid in smoking abstinenice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although moderate intensity exercise has been shown to provide both psychological benefits and improved adherence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], heavy intensity exercise promotes reduction of tobacco withdrawal symptoms and urges to smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Lastly, exercise has been reported to release &#x003b2;-end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], especially in non-trained volunteers using strenuous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Vernonia cinerea Less. (VC) is classified in the Asteraceae Family as a slender stemmed plant, variable in leaf shape with pinkish-purple flowers. It has been documented and recommended in Thai traditional medicine, as in other countries, for smoking cessation, and relief of asthma, cough, fever, malaria, urinary calculi, and arthritis. Unfortunately, little scientific data are available in regards to these effects. VC is a perennial herbaceous plant and distributed in grassy areas found in Southeast Asia and Hawaii [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In a mouse model, study of the active compound in VC had noted anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, a methanol extract of VC has been shown to exhibit significant anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The active compound is proposed as a flavonoid and terpenoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], exhibiting both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p><p>Unsing an <italic>in vivo </italic>study, an extract from the VC flower demonstrated an anti-oxidant effect in arthritis-induced rats by reducing lipid peroxide, and increasing the glutathione concentration in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In humans, few scientific data are available in relation to the use of VC, in particular in regards to smoking cessation. To our knowledge, the only study of VC in relation to smoking cessation was performed at a clinic within the Thanyarak Institute, Pathumthani, Thailand. It included a 14-day VC tea supplementation program in which patients were followed for 12 weeks. Results showed a higher continuous abstinence rate (28.1%) compared to the control group (21.9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, they investigator did not evaluate the anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory activities in smokers. Thus, the aim of this present study was to evaluate the efficacy of both exercise and VC supplementation alone and in combination with regards to smoking rate and blood anti-oxidant status, oxidative stress, &#x003b2;-end levels, over a two month period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and Physical Characteristics</title><p>All volunteers participated in this study after giving their written consent.

Preparation</title><p>Naturally grown,raw VC was collected from local clean area which uses natural growth without spray of insect-toxin drugs at Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. VC was washed four times and cut to small piece approximately one inch and heated until dry by an oven at 70 decree C. VC was then kept in a sterile bottle which contained a small bag of anti-moisture silica-gel pills. Each day for preparation, 20 grams of dry VC material and 3 cups of clean water (390 milliliter) was boiled in a traditional pot until water evaporated to 1 cup (130 milliliter). Condensed VC juice was then preserved in a clean bottle and was provided to subjects to drink prior to smoking each, three days per weeks for two months.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise program</title><p>The exercise program was performed on treadmill at the local community center, short warm up was performed by stretching the upper and lower limbs for approximately 3. The actual exercise consisted of 30 min of running with a progressive incline and speed program, with a maximum intensity of 85% of maximal heart rate (calculated manually by a trainer). The Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was limited to under 15 or hard exertion (6-20 Borg Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our objective was to endure that participants were performing strenuous exercise. The session concluded with 3 min of slow speed walking.

Stock ABTs cation radical was produced by mixing ABTS (14 mmol/L) and potassium persulfate (14 mmol/L) together and leaving in the dark overnight. Working ABTs cation radical was diluted from stock ABTs with deinoized water, until absorbance at 734 nm was shown at 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.02 before adding plasma. The 10 &#x003bc;l of plasma was added to 990 &#x003bc;l of working solution ABTs cation radical in a plastic cuvette (size 1.5 ml), and gently shaken 9 times before adding again in the spectrophotometer. Decreased absorbance was recorded continuously every 1 min for 3 minutes, and finally calculated to &#x00394;A/min.

After the 2 month intervention, only group 2 (198.00 &#x000b1; 4.23 pg/ml) and 3 (201.00 &#x000b1; 2.31 pg/ml) showed a significant increase in &#x003b2;-endorphin levels. It should be noted that in group 1, the slight reduction of &#x003b2;-end level was significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05), thus suggesting that the increased &#x003b2;-end in group 2 and 3 most likely resulted from exercise only and not from VC. From previous reports, the intensity and type of exercise for increasing &#x003b2;-end is still unclear, but resistance and moderate intensity exercise did not influence &#x003b2;-endorphin level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>There has been little evidence to support a specific exercise program for smoking cessation or for reducing the rate of smoking.

However, in our study, the rate of cigarette consumption was lower than 10 cigarettes per day, with lower CO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, the reduction rate was higher for light smoking (62.79% in group 2, 59.52% in group 1, 53.75% in group 3) than self-rolled cigarettes (54.47% in group 1, 42.30% in group 3, 40.0% in group 2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>VC and Exercise for smoking cessation</title><p>Vigorous exercise has been used to assist in smoking cessation, as this results in increased caloric expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which may offset the often observed weight gain associated with cessation and can also serve as a substitute behavior during cessation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Currently, the work of Misra and co-worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] shows that extracts of the VC leaf include chloroform, methanol, and petroleum ether, which have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities in a rat model. It has been suggested that VC decreases locomotory, exploratory behavior and increases the body scratching behavioral model that is probably due to CNS depression with excitatory activities of the monoamines neurotransmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. However, there is no evidence supporting this hypothesis in regards to smoking behavior. In our study, the active compounds in VC juice were not analyzed; hence, we cannot state with confidence the chief actives responsible for teh reduction in smoking rate.

Results indicate the use of VC supplementation for reducing smoking rate,with and with our exercise. The reduction in smoking rate may be associated with levels of oxidative stress. Both VC supplementation and exercise may compensate for nicotine addiction. Additional studies using larger samples, as well as a combination of both men and women who are heavy smokers are needed to extend these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DL was responsible for obtaining funding, designing the study, establishing community connections, performing laboratory testing, and performing data analysis.
