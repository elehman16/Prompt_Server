The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of two different exercise programs compared to a control group in individuals with established radiographic and symptomatic knee osteoarthritis on self-reported knee-related quality of life, knee pain, physical function, and cartilage quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A three-armed randomized controlled trial involving two exercise interventions and a control group of individuals doing as they usually do is described. The patients will have mild to moderate radiographic osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren and Lawrence classification (grade 2&#x02013;3), and fulfill the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria, be aged between 45 and 65&#x000a0;years, and have no other serious physical or mental illnesses. The patients will be randomly allocated to a strength exercise group; a cycling group, or a control group. The primary outcome is the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score knee-related quality of life subscale. Secondary outcomes include all five Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales, morphological evaluation of cartilage including focal thickness, subchondral bone marrow edema, proteoglycan content and collagen degradation (measured using magnetic resonance imaging clinical sequences, T2 mapping and T1&#x003c1;), specific serum biomarkers, isokinetic muscle strength, maximal oxygen uptake, quality of life (EuroQol 5D), and self-efficacy (Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale). A sample size calculation on the primary outcome showed that 207 individuals, 69 in each group, is needed to detect a clinically relevant difference of 10 points with 80% power and a significance level of 5%. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 14&#x000a0;weeks, 1&#x000a0;year and 2&#x000a0;years post-randomization. The interventions will be a 14&#x000a0;weeks exercise program.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although exercise therapy has been found to be effective in knee osteoarthritis, the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms for why exercise works is lacking. This study will contribute with knowledge on the efficacy of strength exercise versus cycling on patient-reported outcomes, cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrial.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01682980">NCT01682980</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Knee</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recent recommendations for treatment of knee osteoarthritis suggest exercise and physical activity in combination with patient education as first line treatments to reduce pain and improve function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During the last decades, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) summarized in systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that exercise and physical activity are important interventions in a rehabilitation phase as well as in daily life in reducing pain and improving function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. New evidence support that exercise in almost any types works; aquatic exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or land-based exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], aerobic exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or strength exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], high-intensity strength exercise or low intensity exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, the effect sizes are low to moderate. Studies have shown similar effect sizes for exercise therapy and pain reliving drugs for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but exercise therapy have fewer side-effects than may be seen for drug therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite of a huge amount of literature in this field, we need more high-quality RCTs that give new knowledge with respect to the efficacy of different types of exercise and the optimal exercise intensity and frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Adherence to exercise is another important aspect associated to the efficacy of exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showed a possible association between high adherence to exercise and improved pain and function. We currently know too little about the dose&#x02013;response relationship in exercise interventions on patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. All existing literature concerning effective treatment methods for osteoarthritis inquire clearer guidelines on exercise frequency, duration, and intensity. Furthermore, studies identifying those patients responding well to exercise (responders) and those who do not (non-responders), are lacking. In addition, there is little knowledge on which subgroups benefit more (or less) from exercise interventions. For instance, age, obesity, radiographic severity, previously knee injury, and level of physical activity are factors that we need more specific knowledge about [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>RCTs evaluating the efficacy of strength training versus aerobic exercise on knee-related quality of life (QOL), pain and physical function in patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Strength deficits may be caused by several aspects of muscle function such as atrophy, pain inhibition, or activation failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, both neuromuscular exercises and strength exercises should be included in a strength program to increase muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Few studies have evaluated the effect of neuromuscular exercises targeting hip control in combination with progressive strength exercises in patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Different types of exercises such as strength training including neuromuscular exercises versus aerobic exercise might induce different adaptations in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Hence, an investigation on how various training methods might influence knee-related QOL, pain, and physical function is necessary. To ensure a reliable evaluation of the efficacy of an intervention, a control group that is not receiving a particular intervention should be included in RCTs.</p><p>Sparse evidence exists with respect to the efficacy of different exercise interventions on structural progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Significant biomarkers of structural and compositional changes to bone, cartilage, and synovium may be identified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With the understanding that structural changes in the knee joint starts early and that the osteoarthritis disease process affects several joint structures, MRI has now been recommended to assess cartilage and other knee joint pathologies in clinical trials. Quantitative MRI techniques can capture tissue morphology and biochemical composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Monitoring changes in collagen integrity and proteoglycan content may give us valuable insight into the understanding of mechanisms explaining why exercise therapy reduces knee pain.</p><p>Osteoarthritis seems to be both a mechanically and an inflammatory driven disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, biomarkers from proteins in serum and synovium have recently been used to study changes in the knee osteoarthritis disease process. Furthermore, some recent studies have reported the effect of exercise interventions on circulating cartilage markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Exercises have shown to cause rise in circulating cartilage markers like cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), aggrecan and C-terminal telopeptides of collagen type II (CTX-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Additionally, exercises have shown to increase the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator interleukin-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The economic burden of knee osteoarthritis is growing with respect to surgical interventions, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and consequently social indirect costs. However, according to a systematic review by Pinto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] there is limited evidence for the cost-effectiveness of non-surgical treatments for the management of knee osteoarthritis. Thus, cost-effectiveness analyses comparing conservative treatment with usual care are needed.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>In patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a strength exercise program versus an aerobic exercise program compared to a control group doing as they usually do using knee-related QOL, physical function and structural progression of the disease (cartilage quality). Furthermore, we aim to do cost-effectiveness analyses on exercise interventions compared to control group. One group will have tailored strength exercises, a second group will perform cycling, and a third control group will do as they usually do (but are asked to not start physiotherapy treatment or exercises the first 4&#x000a0;month of the study period). The primary outcome will be knee-related QOL at the 1&#x000a0;year follow-up. Secondary outcomes include pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living (ADL) and sport and recreation, thigh muscle strength, aerobic capacity, cartilage morphology, and biochemical composition as well as conventional radiographic evaluation of the knee joints. In addition, an explorative analysis of prognostic factors for the main outcome after 2&#x000a0;years will be carried out. The intervention will start with a 2&#x000a0;week preparation phase followed by 12&#x000a0;weeks intervention phase. Assessments will be performed before the intervention starts (baseline), after 14&#x000a0;weeks, 1&#x000a0;year, and 2&#x000a0;years post-randomization. The study is a superiority trial with the following hypotheses:</p><p>1.

Using a semi-flexed view and at least 2&#x000a0;years follow-up time, JSW measurements have been shown to be sensitive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and have shown good evidence for reliability and responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A standardized response mean (SRM) of 0.71 (95% CI of 0.44-0.98) has been calculated for conventional radiographic JSW in knee osteoarthritis trials using semi-flexed views with a trial duration of more than 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In order to evaluate structural progression using changes in JSW, a reliability study will be performed to establish the smallest detectable difference (SDD) within this study for the JSW measurements. This is based on the OARSI-OMERACT recommendations for structural progression using conventional radiographic measurements.

MRI has shown to have inherent strength and advantages to visualize tissue pathology and has shown good reliability and responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. A separate MRI method protocol will be developed to assess the utility, limitations, validity and reliability of T2 mapping and T1&#x003c1; sequence methods in evaluating the quality of cartilage in patients with mild knee osteoarthritis. The MRI evaluation will include morphological evaluation of cartilage, detecting focal thickness reduction or defects. Focal areas of subchondral bone marrow edema will be noted. Assessment of cartilage quality (proteoglycan content and collagen degradation) will be made using two sequences: T2 mapping and T1&#x003c1;. T2 mapping have been shown to correlate with collagen degeneration in patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] whereas T1&#x003c1; has been shown to detect changes in the proteoglycan content of the cartilage. Both were suggested as viable tools for detecting early degeneration and progression of osteoarthritis disease and both have shown biochemical changes in the knee articular cartilage in the absence of radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory measures</title><p>Molecular biomarkers of cartilage turnover will be assessed in serum.

After being centrifuged at 1800&#x000a0;g for 10&#x000a0;minutes, samples will be stored at &#x02212;80 degrees Celsius in 1&#x000a0;mL aliquot tubes. We will investigate the longitudinal change of cartilage specific biomarkers (including, but not limited to a specific fragment of Aggrecan (ARGS), Collagen &#x02212;9 and Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) and cytokines (including, but not limited to IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2;).</p></sec><sec><title>Maximal oxygen consumption</title><p>Maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) will be measured on an ergometer cycle (Monark 839E, Sweden) at baseline, at post-intervention, and at the 1 and the 2&#x000a0;year follow-ups. A cardiovascular examination will be performed at the screening to exclude those with serious and unstable coronary heart diseases. The test protocol includes a 20&#x000a0;minute progressive warm-up at 45&#x02013;90% VO<sub>2max</sub>, followed by an all-out incremental &#x0201c;ramp&#x0201d; test, lasting approximately 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;minutes. During the &#x0201c;ramp&#x0201d; test, the cadence will remain as steady as possible at 90 repetitions per maximum, and the workload will increase by 25 Watts every 30&#x000a0;second, to a supramaximal workload and totally exhaustion (rate of perceived exertion 17&#x02013;19).</p></sec><sec><title>Self-efficacy for pain</title><p>Several studies including patients with osteoarthritis have found that a patient&#x02019;s perceived self-efficacy is related to health outcomes and the course of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. ASES will be included as a measure of the patients&#x02019; self-efficacy for pain. Perceived self-efficacy is defined as a person&#x02019;s judgment or belief of their ability to change, manage or execute tasks related to pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is concerned not with the skill one has, but measures a changeable psychological aspect of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A modified version of ASES contains 11 questions regarding the patient&#x02019;s certainty to perform various tasks related to pain and symptoms, where each item is rated from 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very certain). Good concurrent validity and internal reliability has been reported for the original version of the scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Other assessments</title><p>Background variables such as height, weight, physical activity, type of work or disability pensions, range of motion, knee joint alignment measured with an inclinometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], numeric change scale, analgesics consumption or other medications, previously knee injuries, and adverse events will be collected at the baseline test, the post-intervention test and at 1 and 2&#x000a0;year follow-ups. Cases of joint replacement will be recorded at the 2&#x000a0;year follow-up.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The interventions will be delivered by guided physiotherapists at selected physical therapy institutes in the Oslo and Akershus area. The strength exercise program will be based on previously developed exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], focusing on heavy resistance training and neuromuscular training including one leg exercises and balance training. The program has been planned according to American College of Sports Medicines (ACSMs) guidelines for strength progression in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The aerobic exercise will be performed to improve physical function and cartilage quality and the dosage has been planned according to general guidelines for training parameters in people with pain associated to osteoarthritis, as developed by the American Geriatrics Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The intervention programs will last for 12&#x000a0;weeks with 2&#x02013;3 training sessions per week. In addition, the patients will go through a pre-phase of 2&#x000a0;weeks to prepare for the intervention programs. The patients in all three groups will be told to stick to the exercise program or usual care for the 12&#x000a0;weeks of intervention to make sure they do not increase or change usual activity level parallel with the intervention. The included patients will be followed closely to ensure that the exercises are performed adequately and to ensure the progression of intensity. A description of the interventions and the response to the program depending on patient characteristics will be performed in a separate study. The definition of responders will be defined according to the OMERACT-OARSI set of responder criteria, including improvement in at least two of the following three criteria: pain&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20% and absolute change&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10%, or physical function&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20% and absolute change&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10%, or patient&#x02019;s global assessment&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20% and absolute change &#x02265; 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. A brief description of the three interventions can be seen below:</p><sec><title>Strength exercise intervention</title><p>The strength exercise program will be delivered 2&#x02013;3 times per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x02013;10 repetitions maximum (RM) in 3 series with approximately 30&#x000a0;seconds to 1&#x000a0;minute pause between the series. One of the training sessions may be performed at home. The patients will go through a 2&#x000a0;weeks phase before the strength program including neuromuscular exercises and strength exercises on low intensity. The patients will warm up 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;minutes on an ergometer cycle or a treadmill according to the patients&#x02019; desire. The following muscle groups will be trained: Quadriceps and hamstrings, hip abductors and extensors, and calf muscles. A home exercise program will be delivered including one leg exercises and balance exercises. Progression will follow a 2+ principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. For instance, when the study participant is able to perform 2 more repetitions in a set of 3&#x000d7;8, more loads are required.</p></sec><sec><title>Aerobic exercise intervention</title><p>In the present study, the main aim of the aerobic exercise is to improve cartilage quality, in addition to the general health effects physical activity gives. Both overloading and underloading may cause cartilage degradation, but moderate loading has been shown to be beneficial for joint health because of mechanosensitive chondroprotective pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. However, these pathways need to be further elucidated to identify the causation. Based on the moderate loading benefits, ergometer cycling for 45&#x000a0;minutes 2&#x02013;3 times a week, including 10&#x000a0;minutes warm up, 30&#x000a0;minutes on moderate loading (75% of max heart rate) and 5&#x000a0;minutes cool down will be required. For instance, a patient with a maximal heart rate of 160 and rest heart rate of 60 will be required to cycle at a heart rate of about 135 using the formula for heart rate reserve (160-rest heart rate of 60 &#x000d7; 0.75&#x02009;+&#x02009;rest heart rate of 60). The patients who will be allocated to the cycling group will be told to measure their rest heart rate before the intervention starts to ensure moderate loading during the cycling sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance to the interventions</title><p>The patients will be asked to report all training sessions in detailed training diaries distributed to the patients after randomization, including type of exercise, loading, and progression. Pain during training will be reported using the visual analogue scale (0&#x02013;10) (VAS). A cut off value of 4&#x02013;6 is suggested to be acceptable pain during or after the exercise session in patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The diaries will be controlled weekly by the physiotherapist to ensure compliance with the program. An optimal goal is that the subjects should complete minimum 80% of the planned exercise sessions according to ACSMs guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>A control group doing as usual will be included to control for the natural course of knee osteoarthritis. They will be told to not start a new physiotherapy treatment period the first 4&#x000a0;months after inclusion in the study. The group will be tested at baseline, after 14&#x000a0;weeks, after 1&#x000a0;year and 2&#x000a0;years with the same tests as for the intervention groups. Those who are in the control group will get exercise advice according to our intervention programs after they have finished the first 4&#x000a0;months of the study if they are interested.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Primary outcome for the RCT will be the KOOS subscale knee-related QOL (0&#x02013;100 scale). A clinical important difference in the KOOS subscales has been suggested to be 8&#x02013;10 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Based on 10 points expected difference between the intervention groups and the control group and a standard deviation of 20 on QOL, 63 patients are needed in each group with significance level of 0.05, and power of 80% using Popocks formula: n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>/(&#x003bc;<sub>1</sub>- &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> * f(&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;). With an estimated drop-out rate of 10% a total number of 207 subjects will be randomized either into the strength exercise group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;69); the cycling group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;69), or the control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;69).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The analyses will be performed using intention-to-treat mixed linear models and Student t-tests.

We will consider using the closest match missing data imputation for repeated measures data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the societal perspective and according to the intention-to-treat principle. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated by dividing the between-group difference in costs by the between-group difference in effects. Cost-effectiveness ratios will be estimated using bootstrapping techniques and graphically presented on cost-effectiveness planes. Acceptability curves and net monetary benefit will also be estimated. Sensitivity analysis on the most important cost drivers will be performed in order to assess the robustness of the results. The statistical analyses will be discussed and co-worked with our statisticians at the Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, respectively, and with our international collaboration groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical perspectives and project funding</title><p>The study is approved by the Regional Ethical Committee and The Data Inspectorate in Norway (Ref. 2012/334).
