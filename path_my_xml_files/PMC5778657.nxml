The primary outcomes reflect the processes of essential interventions, namely timely and appropriate screening and management of: 1) anemia in pregnancy; 2) hypertension in pregnancy; 3) abnormal fetal growth; 4) and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy. The composite primary health outcome encompasses five conditions representing risk for the mother or baby that could have been detected or prevented by high-quality antenatal care: moderate or severe anemia at admission for labor; severe hypertension at admission for labor; malpresentation at delivery undetected during pregnancy; small for gestational age baby at delivery undetected during pregnancy; and large for gestational age baby at delivery.

The availability of relatively well-defined interventions and measurement indicators for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) provides a head start in monitoring and, ultimately, achieving universal health coverage within this sphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To enhance the quality of care in RMNCH in low- and middle-income settings, implementation of innovative health system interventions should be prioritized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Checklists and clinical decision support for care providers are tools that can enhance quality of healthcare service delivery. Checklists support implementation of interventions and protocols at all levels of a health system among all care providers in a cadre, and have the ability to standardize decision-making throughout the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The World Health Organization 29-item &#x02018;Safe Childbirth Checklist&#x02019;, designed to facilitate childbirth protocols, has been demonstrated to improve provision of safe practices by health workers and the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interactive checklists on electronic platforms can provide decision and guideline support in response to structured data entry by care providers at the point-of-care (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interactive checklists and clinical decision support, as compared to static checklists, have the advantage of offering individual case-based management suggestions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. When data entry is made online into a centralized electronic registry (eRegistry), the system not only supports the quality of care delivered by the individual care provider at one specific patient contact, but also supports the patient-centered continuity and quality of care along and across the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The interactivity in the checklists, customized to health workers and their setting and level of health system, may form an important tenet for its effective use. Point-of-care support tools for health workers can help overcome frequent barriers to high-quality clinical care, such as the lack of accessible guidelines and validated management suggestions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Interactive checklists and clinical decision support can potentially strengthen health workforce capacity and thus contribute to strengthening universal health coverage. Studies on electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) report good potential for such tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and in the RMNCH field they may facilitate healthcare practice, health communication, and health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Health systems may be made more effective, efficient, and accountable by exploiting opportunities of communications enabled by health information systems. However, robust research and evidence evaluating such interventions are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the effectiveness of any form of clinical decision support system linked to electronic health records showed a moderate effect on morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Most large RCTs for electronic health information systems, clinical decision support systems, and electronic registries have been conducted in high-income countries, with obviously different contextual considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Implementing clinical decision support tools and electronic registries is resource-intensive, and substantial efforts are required in design, implementation, training, and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Considering this, there is a need for RCTs of the health systems to justify the extent of use of e- and mHealth solutions in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in primary healthcare where there is the most relevant demand for evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of working definitions describing different components constituting intervention and the delivery platform</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>Working definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>eRegistries</td><td>Electronic registries (eRegistries) are systems using information and communication technologies for the systematic longitudinal collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, and dissemination of uniform information on health determinants and outcomes of individual persons, to serve healthcare services, health surveillance, health education, knowledge, and research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>Interactive checklists</td><td>Interactive checklists are checklists delivered on electronic platforms. eRegistry&#x02019;s interactive checklists integrate individualized decision support for daily clinical procedures, diagnosis, management, and referral routines in response to systematic point-of-care data entry by healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical decision support system</td><td>An electronic system designed to aid directly in clinical decision making, in which characteristics of individual patients are used to generate case-specific assessments or recommendations that are then presented to clinicians for consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Palestinian context</title><p id="Par21">Maternal and child health forms an important part of the healthcare system in Palestine. There are approximately 60,000 live births in the West Bank annually, and 99% are reported to be delivered in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In 2014, the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH) operated 418 primary healthcare clinics (PHC) in the West Bank, and the majority of them provided antenatal care (ANC) services. PHC operated by the Palestinian MoH are classified from level 1 to 4 according to the healthcare services they provide. Level 1 PHC typically operate only once a week with a single healthcare provider, whereas level 4 PHC operate several days a week and with different health workers including specialists. ANC services are offered at all levels, but labor and delivery services are not provided in primary healthcare. Women have predefined PHC where they go for their ANC visits based on their residential address. According to the annual report published by the Palestinian MoH in 2016, adherence to at least one ANC visit is 98%, and to four visits 94%. About 45% of pregnant women in the West Bank receive ANC in PHC operated by the Palestinian MoH, with an average of 4.8 visits per woman. ANC is also provided by private clinics and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Comprehensive pregnancy risk management is provided at so-called high-risk clinics. There are 86 high-risk clinics in the West Bank and in 2015, 14% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4415) of women receiving ANC in PHC operated by the Palestinian MoH were referred to a high-risk clinic for management. The Palestinian National Institute of Public Health (PNIPH) and the Palestinian MoH are currently rolling out a nationwide electronic registry (eRegistry) for maternal and child health. The implementation is undertaken in collaboration with and building on the eRegistries Initiative, tools, and implementation guidance, developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the University of Oslo, and global RMNCH experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The eRegistry for Palestine is developed in the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) tracker software, which is a flexible web-based open-source information system. All Palestinian residents have unique identifiers which makes it possible to track care and outcomes of women throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, irrespective of the healthcare facility level. In this setting, currently operating only with paper case notes, we aim to assess the effectiveness of an eRegistry&#x02019;s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on improving the quality of care for pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objectives</title><p id="Par22">To estimate the effectiveness of the eRegistry&#x02019;s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on: 1) improving the provision of timely and appropriate screening and management for important conditions during ANC; and 2) health outcomes for the mothers and the newborns.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par23">To estimate the effectiveness of the eRegistry&#x02019;s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on: 1) timely ANC visits; and 2) occurrence of stillbirths.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par24">This cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) is a superiority trial with two parallel arms (intervention and control).

An antenatal record is opened at the first ANC visit at the PHC. This record includes the personal ID number and name; socioeconomic information such as address, mother&#x02019;s years of education, age at marriage and age at first pregnancy, monthly household income, and number of members in the household; obstetric information from the current and previous pregnancies such as parity, gestational age, last menstrual period, estimated date of delivery, and conception during breastfeeding; medical and surgical conditions; and family history of diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal disease, etc.). Risk assessments are conducted at the first ANC visit, and women identified with certain risk factors are referred for further management in so-called high-risk clinics. Ultrasound scans during pregnancy are performed at the PHC. Monthly reports on aggregate data are sent from all PHC, high-risk clinics, and hospitals to the Palestinian MoH. Previous research of RMNCH services at different levels of the healthcare system in Palestine suggests considerable room for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Problems identified during stakeholder discussions as contributing to lower quality of care were sizable variations in the quality of care provided and ineffective ANC content despite frequent visits. Stakeholders in Palestine also identified several inefficiencies in the workflow in the PHC, due to redundant paperwork and reporting. Recommendations provided by Palestinian and international experts for the national health system include immediate action to support standardized practice guidelines, minimize inefficiencies, and promote better health information systems in RMNCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par26">The inclusion criteria were PHC located in Bethlehem, Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah/Al-Bireh, and Salfit governorates offering ANC services reporting to the Palestinian MoH, including PHC following the national guidelines and workflows but jointly operated by the Palestinian MoH and nongovernmental organizations (NGO). We excluded PHC defined as level 1 or with no pregnant women enrolled in 2013 (due to small cluster sizes), PHC with a high-risk clinic at the same location (because all referral PHC providing high-risk management must receive the eRegistry&#x02019;s interactive checklists and clinical decision support to enable the continuity of care and maintain information flow for women from the intervention clusters), and PHC participating in another health system study addressing the quality of ANC. A total of 133 PHC were eligible for randomization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These PHC enrolled 8061 (mean 60.6 and median 53.0) new pregnant women in 2013.

A total of 327 care providers from the intervention clinics were trained in the use of the eRegistry in batches of up to 20 participants per day of training. All care providers in the intervention PHC have had a day of introduction and 2&#x000a0;days of training in the use of the eRegistry. Each training session consisted of hands-on clinical case simulations focusing on data entry and documentation, clinical decision support functionalities, retrieving records, reporting routines, and general software maintenance.

We adopted an approach of stratified and covariate constrained randomizations. We stratified by district and constrained on: number of new enrollments of pregnancies per year (which reflects size and thus PHC level and days of operation per week); laboratory availability (which may affect care provider performance of screening tests); proportion of new enrollments above 40&#x000a0;years of age (which reflects general health and risk status); and proportion of primiparous women (which reflects risk status). A set of 10,000 randomization allocations were first generated. The 10% best and balanced allocations, with least differences between the two arms for the given covariates, were then identified. Finally, we randomly selected one of these allocations for the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Statisticians at the Center for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC), University of Bergen, Norway, performed the randomization independently without any influence from the principal investigator or study staff.

During data collection for process outcomes, data collectors cannot be blinded to the allocation due to the nature of the intervention (paper collection versus electronic). The data collectors are, however, independent of the study team. They have received standardized training to collect a large number of routine indicators and data points for the eRegistry while being blinded for the outcome measures of this trial. The adverse pregnancy outcomes are collected independently by hospital staff using their routine health information system which is not linked to the eRegistry, effectively blinding hospital data collection to the allocation. Data analysts will be blinded to the allocation for all data management and computation of raw data for outcome measures, and for all analyses of primary and secondary outcomes. At the end of follow-up, each primary outcome will be analyzed separately. Dummy randomization variable codes will be generated for initial analyses of all primary outcomes by CISMAC (e.g., A and B, C and D, E and F, G and H, I and J), and the code will be provided as allocation groups (intervention versus control for each set) by CISMAC only after the completion of analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data extraction methods</title><p id="Par38">Care providers using the eRegistry or the paper records will continuously enter data during patient care. All data from completed paper records (after delivery of the baby) from the control PHC are routinely computerized by trained registry staff into the eRegistry every month. Double data extraction is carried out on approximately 10% of all the paper-based files for quality assurance purposes. Birth outcome data from public hospital maternity wards and delivery units are collected independently by hospital staff using their routine health information system which is not automatically linked to the eRegistry. These data are routinely exported from the hospital health information system&#x02019;s national server every month, and merged into the eRegistry using the unique identifiers of the mothers. Data on births from all other hospitals with maternity wards and delivery units, including private hospitals and those run by NGOs, are collected by the Palestinian MoH staff using a standardized form on a monthly basis, and also merged into the eRegistry. For this CRCT we will only use anonymous data extracted from the eRegistry in accordance with the SOP of the Palestinian maternal and child health eRegistry for routine registry operations and use of data for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data management</title><p id="Par39">The data in the eRegistry will be managed in accordance with the governance structure approved by the Palestinian MoH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Primary analyses will be according to intention-to-treat comparing control and intervention groups using individual-level data taking the design effect of the clustering into account. In addition, we will undertake a per-protocol analysis. A baseline table with summary measures for the following background characteristics of participants will be reported: maternal age, parity, average monthly household income, education, medical history, obstetrical history, body mass index, blood pressure at booking visit, hemoglobin at booking visit, urine stick results for glucose at booking visit, birth weight, and fetal presentation at term. We will first undertake a cluster-level analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes. We will then perform analyses on individual-level data. All primary outcomes of the study will be measured as proportions. Comparisons of categorical variables will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a log link. We will use two-sided statistical tests and 95% confidence intervals for descriptive statistics and effectiveness estimates. In order to take into account the inherent clustering in our trial design, we will use random effects models. The effect of the intervention on the risk and prevalence of outcomes will be reported as relative (risk ratios (RR) and prevalence ratios (PR)) and absolute (risk difference and prevalence difference) measures of effect. Effectiveness will be calculated as 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1 &#x02013; RR) and 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1 &#x02013; PR) as appropriate. We will consider adjusting for confounders if there are baseline imbalances in the trial arms for variables that are strongly associated with the primary outcomes. We will perform complete case analyses and consider appropriate imputations for missing data. We will employ spider graphs in order to graphically display the effect of the intervention and whether a disproportionately large part of the effect can be ascribed to extreme effects in a few large clusters. In the rare event of protocol violations such as withdrawal of the eRegistry from an intervention PHC, data from these clusters will be excluded for women enrolled from the time of violation and onwards. All data on the pregnant women who maintain allocation, irrespective of from which cluster they receive care, will be included in the analyses. For those women that switch from intervention to control PHC, they will be analyzed as randomized in the primary, intention-to-treat analyses. In the per-protocol analysis, only data prior to switching clinics will be used and the rest will be treated as missing data. We will undertake instrumental variable analyses to better estimate the field efficacy of the intervention, in anticipation of possible nonadherence to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For this analysis, the random allocation to the two arms of the CRCT will be the instrument. To enable this analysis, we will capture backdated data entry into the eRegistry from paper back-up (provided for use in cases of power outages and internet disruptions) to assess actual receipt of the intervention by the pregnant women. We will present additional analyses of quality of antenatal care measures in order to gain better understanding of the primary process (adherence) outcomes of the trial. These include: the proportion of women booked for care that both utilize and receive appropriate care; the probability of a woman affected by pregnancy complications to be successfully identified and managed; and provider-centric performance (the proportion of visits in which timely and appropriate care is provided).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data monitoring</title><p id="Par41">This CRCT will be completed before the other clinics elsewhere in Palestine have completed their national implementation.

This CRCT aims to contribute to filling this evidence gap. In order to study effectiveness of the intervention in the health system, we have designed a pragmatic CRCT. We have worked closely with the Palestinian MoH to plan the intervention and the timelines for the implementation of the eRegistry. All our communication strategies to the study clinics have always been through the Palestinian MoH via established channels within the health system in an attempt to keep monitoring of sites robust but as close to real-world settings as possible. We have striven to maintain generalizability of study findings by including a large representative sample of PHC and having no individual-level eligibility criteria. Data for outcome measures are derived from existing data collection pathways for the eRegistry in Palestine. The design and implementation of this CRCT places emphasis on the outcomes, as well as the feasibility of their measurement, in registry settings within the health system. Loss to follow-up is expected to be minimal since all our data sources are part of the eRegistry. We have designed outcome measures to directly reflect the effect of the intervention within the setting of an electronic registry, justifying the use of secondary data, where the process outcomes are based on the care providers&#x02019; own documentation of process, and health outcome measures are based on data collected independently from the care provider.</p><p id="Par48">There are some limitations to the design of the CRCT. Pregnant women from intervention and control PHC are referred to the same high-risk clinics, where care providers use both paper records (for women referred from control PHC) and the eRegistry (for women referred from intervention PHC). This may lead to some contamination, which may underestimate the true effect of the intervention. About 5&#x02013;10% of care providers in the study clinics work both in intervention and control PHC. This is another source of contamination that may potentially lead to effectiveness underestimation. Since the data for process outcomes is dependent on completeness of documentation by the care provider, there might be missing or incomplete data to inform some of the outcome indicators. We recognize that PHC location, activities, and staff are vulnerable to changes in public health planning and policy. We have tried to mitigate the risk of this affecting the study design by working closely with the Palestinian MoH and maintaining strong stakeholder involvement.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par49">The CRCT started recruitment on 15 January 2017.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec32"><p>
