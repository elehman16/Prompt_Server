Antipsychotic medications are widely used in this setting and the availability of an inhaled formulation with deep lung absorption of the antipsychotic loxapine has the potential to deliver a faster onset of therapeutic effect than the available intramuscular formulations of antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The efficacy of inhaled loxapine and the alternative antipsychotic aripiprazole delivered via intramuscular (IM) injection will be compared in the Phase IIIb PLACID study. Adults (18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years) with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder presenting with acute agitation will be randomly assigned to open-label treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Clinical evaluation will be conducted by raters blinded to treatment assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint is time to response (defined as a Clinical Global Impression of Improvement [CGI-I] score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved]).</p><p>Secondary endpoints will include the percentage of responders at different time points after dosing; the proportion of patients who receive 1 or 2 doses of study drug; time to second dose; time to rescue medication; satisfaction with study drug (evaluated using Item 14 of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication); and safety and tolerability. Approximately 360 patients will be recruited with an interim analysis conducted once 180 patients have completed the study to decide whether to stop for futility or continue with or without an increase in the sample size up to additional 288 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PLACID trial will assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled loxapine with deep lung absorption compared with the IM antipsychotic, aripiprazole, in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Agitation, defined as a state of cognitive and motor hyperactivity characterized by excessive or inappropriate motor or verbal activity with an emotional arousal element, is common among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For these patients, the manifestation of acute agitation represents a serious, disruptive and morbid complication that can escalate rapidly and unpredictably from distress to loss of control and physical aggression and violence towards themselves, other patients and their carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Acute agitation is frequently encountered in both medical and psychiatric emergency settings and should be managed initially with verbal de-escalation and environmental management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Continued escalation of agitation may ultimately require physical restraint and pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, such coercive management measures may damage the therapeutic relationship between patients and their carer&#x02019;s and evoke feelings of panic, fear, powerlessness, anger, frustration, and injustice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The consequence of this negative association of feelings may destroy trust and lead to patient reluctance to seek psychiatric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early intervention for acute agitation with a medication delivered via a non-traumatic route has the potential to avoid the negative feelings evoked by a traumatic therapeutic encounter and reinforce the partnership between patient and their carer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The costs associated with agitation, especially agitation that escalates to aggression and violence, among patients with psychiatric disorders may also be considerable although precise estimates of the overall burden are lacking. When inadequately managed, agitation among psychiatric patients can result in an increase in the number and duration of inpatient hospital stays, a reduced likelihood of discharge to community and use of coercive measures and/or escalation to patient violence, presenting a substantial economic burden to the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Spain, the annual cost of psychiatric mechanical restraint has been estimated at &#x020ac;27 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A separate study conducted in the UK, estimated that the annual cost per psychiatric ward for containment was &#x020ac;267,069 in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Agitation among patients with psychiatric disorders requires early recognition and swift intervention with treatments that can achieve rapid symptom relief and avoid the progression of agitation to aggression and violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder includes pharmacological tranquilization with oral antipsychotic agents given alone or in combination with benzodiazepines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, while a preferred route of delivery in terms of maintaining a non-traumatic experience for the patient, orally dosed agents may not be optimal in terms of delivering a sufficiently rapid onset of therapeutic effect. Intramuscular (IM) formulations have been shown to provide relatively faster symptomatic relief compared with oral formulation of antipsychotics but have the disadvantage of a potentially traumatic experience for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Inhaled loxapine with deep lung absorption is the first anti-agitation medication available to provide rapid control of agitation combined with a noncoercive non-invasive route of administration. It is administered by inhalation using the Staccato delivery system. The efficacy of inhaled loxapine for the management of agitation among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder has been confirmed in placebo-controlled, Phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is supported by indirect comparisons with other antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, head-to-head comparisons with other antipsychotics, including those delivered via IM injection, are lacking. Head-to-head trials, often neglected by regulatory authorities and industry sponsors, are important for clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The PLACID study will compare inhaled loxapine and IM aripiprazole (considered a standard of care in this setting; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]) for the prompt stabilization of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The PLACID study will evaluate the efficacy, defined as time to response (Clinical Global Impression of Improvement [CGI-I] or 1 or 2) of inhaled loxapine as compared with aripiprazole administered via IM injection in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</p><p>Inhaled loxapine is available in 10&#x000a0;mg dose, being the delivered dose 9,1&#x000a0;mg, a maximum of 2 doses can be administered during 24&#x000a0;h (24). For IM aripiprazole the standard dose is 9,75&#x000a0;mg with a possibility of two additional doses during 24&#x000a0;h (14). In this study a maximum of 2 doses of both study drugs are allowed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The study will be conducted at up to 30 centres across Europe including centres in the Czech Republic, Germany, Russia and Spain and will include male and female patients aged between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The PLACID study is a Phase IIIb, open-label, rater blind, randomised, active control, prospective, parallel group, multicentre clinical trial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Patients will be specifically excluded from participation if their agitation is judged to be caused primarily by acute alcohol or drug intoxication/withdrawal. Those patients judged to be at serious risk for suicide will also be excluded. Patients treated with benzodiazepines or other hypnotics or oral or short-acting IM antipsychotics within 1&#x000a0;h prior to study drug administration will be excluded although those patients may be subsequently reassessed for inclusion.

The median difference (95% CI) will be estimated by means of the Hodges-Lehmann approach based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) distribution. Kaplan-Meier curves of time to response will also be presented by treatment group.

Clinical evaluation of the inhaled antipsychotic loxapine has demonstrated an onset of therapeutic effect as early as 10&#x000a0;min after dosing, an effect that is maintained through 24&#x000a0;h among patients with acute agitation and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The PLACID trial will assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled loxapine compared with the IM antipsychotic, aripiprazole, in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The PLACID trial is planned as a pragmatic trial close to the real world setting.</p><p>The CGI scale, which was developed as a brief, stand-alone assessment of the patient&#x02019;s global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication, will be used to assess the primary endpoint. This is a simple instrument widely used in a clinical practice and can be completed in less than a minute by an experienced rater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] Even if not validated for agitation assessment, it was shown that there is a very good correlation between the CGI and PANSS-EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. All raters will be trained in the proper CGI use to assess the agitation grade.</p><p>Both inhaled loxapine and IM aripiprazole are currently available in Europe for the treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</p><p>REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) is necessary with inhaled loxapine to mitigate the risk of bronchospasm. For this reason, only the centers with immediate access on site to supplies and personnel trained to manage acute bronchospasm will participate in this study. REMS is the strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product required by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration).</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profiles (PK) of both drugs differ significantly and this is explained by the differences in the administration route. The peak plasma concentration of IM aripiprazole is achieved at 1&#x000a0;h, while for inhaled loxapine it is 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min. Such a short time is explained by the fact that inhaled loxapine is directly absorbed into the blood stream with a PK profile similar to IV formulations. This study will prove if these differences in PK parameters correspond to clinical parameters, namely shorter time to response of inhaled loxapine.</p><p>Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment to avoid bias in terms of treatment allocation. The delivered treatment is necessarily open-label due to the different methods of administration. To avoid the issue of rater bias, drug administration and clinical evaluation will be carried out by different personnel, with the clinical rater blinded to treatment allocation and the randomization will be stratified by diagnosis to balance the groups. Patients will be instructed not to tell the treatment they receive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the prompt stabilisation of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation has the potential to facilitate a patient-centered management approach by maintaining the patient-physician relationship and minimising the need for physical or mechanical restraint or sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The PLACID study will allow, for the first time, the direct comparison of the timing of the onset of therapeutic effect of an IM antipsychotic, aripiprazole, and an inhaled antipsychotic, loxapine, for the treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The results of this trial have the potential to change future treatment guidelines and have a powerful impact on clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional file</title><p>
