Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), the first long-acting stimulant prodrug, undergoes rate-limiting enzymatic bioconversion to <italic>d</italic>-amfetamine in the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and provides a daily duration of efficacy of at least 13&#x000a0;h post-dose in children and 14&#x000a0;h in adults, as determined in laboratory school and simulated workplace studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The efficacy of once-daily LDX in relieving the symptoms of ADHD compared with placebo has been demonstrated in a series of 4-week US-based clinical trials in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and more recently in a 7-week European study in children and adolescents (SPD489-325) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Continuation of long-term LDX treatment has been shown to be more effective than placebo in maintaining efficacy in studies using randomized-withdrawal designs: a US study in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the present multinational study (SPD489-326) in children and adolescents with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such designs allow the value of continued treatment to be investigated more rigorously than in open-label studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although symptoms are themselves important, the broader impact of ADHD on day-to-day functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in domains such as educational achievement and interpersonal relations, often underlies a patient&#x02019;s or parent&#x02019;s decision to seek treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the new guidance on severity of ADHD in the recent Fifth Edition of the &#x02018;<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] states that severe ADHD is characterized either by intense symptoms or by marked impairment in social or occupational functioning. In study SPD489-325, beneficial effects of LDX were demonstrated on HRQoL and functional impairment, as gauged using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition: Parent Report Form (CHIP-CE: PRF) and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P) instruments, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The CHIP-CE: PRF is a generic (i.e. not disease-specific) measure of a child&#x02019;s overall health status in five domains (Achievement, Risk Avoidance, Satisfaction, Resilience and Comfort). Its validity and reliability in children and adolescents with ADHD have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The WFIRS-P is an ADHD-specific instrument designed around typical day-to-day problems, and has demonstrated internal consistency, sensitivity to change and convergent validity with other instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It provides measures of impairment in six domains (Family, Learning and School, Life Skills, Child&#x02019;s Self-Concept, Social Activities and Risky Activities) and overall (total score). LDX treatment was associated with significant placebo-adjusted improvements from baseline to endpoint of study SPD489-325 in the CHIP-CE: PRF domains of Achievement, Risk Avoidance, Resilience and Satisfaction, and in WFIRS-P total score and the domains of Learning and School, Family, Social Activities and Risky Activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>With the aim of evaluating the long-term maintenance of efficacy of LDX, the subsequent study, SPD489-326, comprised open-label LDX treatment for at least 26&#x000a0;weeks with subsequent randomization to continue on LDX or withdraw to placebo for 6&#x000a0;weeks under double-blind conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the primary efficacy outcome, the treatment failure criteria (defined below) were met by a statistically significantly smaller proportion of patients in the LDX group than in the placebo group (15.8 vs 67.5&#x000a0;%, a difference of 51.7 [95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) 38.5, 65.0]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>&#x000a0;0.001).

The effect size (standardized mean difference) for each domain or subdomain <italic>T-</italic>score (CHIP-CE: PRF) or domain or total score (WFIRS-P) was based on the difference (LDX minus placebo) in least-squares (LS)-mean change from baseline to endpoint divided by root-mean-square error.

The present study evaluated the impact of continued long-term (at least 26&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019;) LDX treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD on parental perceptions of HRQoL and functional impairment, using the CHIP-CE: PRF and WFIRS-P instruments, respectively. The effect of continued LDX treatment during the 6-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized-withdrawal period differed statistically significantly from placebo in three of the five CHIP-CE: PRF domains, and in three of the six WFIRS-P domains and in WFIRS-P total score. Following improvement in all domains of both instruments during open-label LDX treatment, HRQoL and functional impairment scores deteriorated in the placebo group, but not in the LDX group. At open-label baseline, mean CHIP-CE: PRF domain <italic>T-</italic>scores were more than one SD (10 points) below the normative mean (50) in four of the five domains, with Achievement exhibiting the greatest deficit, followed by Risk Avoidance, Satisfaction and Resilience. These results are concordant with published CHIP-CE: PRF data in untreated patients with ADHD in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and indicate that HRQoL is severely and pervasively compromised in children and adolescents with ADHD compared with the CHIP-CE: PRF reference population. A Spanish CHIP-CE: PRF reference population has been shown to be generally similar to the US reference population used for conversion of CHIP-CE: PRF responses to <italic>T-</italic>scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], indicating that the normalization procedure is likely to be applicable to the population enrolled in the present study.</p><p>Improvements in HRQoL during open-label LDX treatment for at least 26&#x000a0;weeks in the present study were most pronounced in the CHIP-CE: PRF domains with the most severe baseline deficits, namely Achievement and Risk Avoidance. These improvements occurred mainly during the first 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Within the Achievement domain, a smaller improvement from a higher baseline was observed in Peer Relations than in Academic Performance in the open-label period of the present study, in accordance with previous factor analyses indicating that these subdomains represent distinct constructs in the child and adolescent ADHD population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The HRQoL results from the open-label period of the present study are consistent with the pattern and magnitude of improvements in CHIP-CE: PRF domain and subdomain <italic>T-</italic>scores seen in the previous placebo-controlled, 7-week study (SPD489-325) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The largest improvements in WFIRS-P scores during open-label LDX treatment were also observed in those domains of functional impairment with the worst scores at baseline (Family, and Learning and School). Improvements in WFIRS-P scores also occurred mainly during the first 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and the pattern and magnitude of improvements in WFIRS-P domain scores in the open-label period of the present study were again consistent with that observed in the previous placebo-controlled, 7-week study (SPD489-325) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results and those of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] support the use of the WFIRS-P as a functional outcome measure in patients with ADHD. Interpretation of WFIRS-P scores is hampered, however, by the possibility (not unique to the WFIRS-P) that mean scores may conceal high individual item scores of potential clinical relevance, and by the lack of published psychometric properties and normative or reference population data. Although studies have been conducted to investigate these, the results have not yet been published in full [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The present study was the first to use a randomized-withdrawal design to examine whether continuation of stimulant pharmacotherapy is required for maintained beneficial effects of medication on HRQoL and functional impairment in patients with ADHD. Compared with the deterioration in all domains of both instruments in patients who withdrew to placebo under double-blind conditions, maintained efficacy of LDX was observed in the CHIP-CE: PRF domains of Achievement, Risk Avoidance and Satisfaction (effect sizes 0.696, 0.829 and 0.636, respectively), in the WFIRS-P domains of Family, Learning and School, and Risky Activities (effect sizes 0.859, 0.716 and 0.506, respectively), and in WFIRS-P total score (effect size 0.908). Improvement from baseline to endpoint of the randomized-withdrawal period was observed only in the CHIP-CE: PRF Satisfaction domain, and only in patients who continued on their LDX treatment. Thus, the domains of HRQoL and functioning with the greatest deficits at baseline tended to exhibit both the greatest improvements during LDX treatment and the greatest deteriorations following LDX withdrawal.</p><p>There is no evidence that ADHD medications have any beneficial effect on the underlying neuropathophysiology of the disorder. This is consistent with the previously reported rapid return of symptoms in patients who switched from LDX to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and with the worsening of functional impairment and HRQoL described here. However, it is noteworthy that CHIP-CE: PRF and WFIRS-P scores in the placebo group at endpoint of the randomized-withdrawal period did not return to pre-treatment levels at open-label baseline. It is possible that residual benefits of LDX therapy may have extended beyond the point of treatment withdrawal, or that underlying deficits in HRQoL and functioning may have attenuated over the course of the study (which involved repeated clinic visits). Alternatively, because patients were withdrawn from the study during the randomized-withdrawal period if they met the predefined treatment failure criteria that formed the basis of the primary efficacy outcome (both an increase of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;% in ADHD-RS-IV total score and an increase of &#x02265;2 points in CGI-S score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], intensity of symptoms, HRQoL deficits or functional impairment may have been underestimated at randomized-withdrawal endpoint. Finally, the repeated administration of the parent-rated questionnaires could also have resulted in underestimation at endpoint.</p><p>None of the CHIP-CE: PRF or WFIRS-P effect sizes for LDX continuation versus withdrawal to placebo were as large as the symptom-based ADHD-RS-IV total score effect size of 1.493 in the randomized-withdrawal period (based on mean changes from baseline to endpoint of 1.9 [SD 6.97] in the LDX group and 14.5 [9.95] in the placebo group, with a statistically significant [<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001] least squares mean difference [LDX minus placebo] of &#x02212;12.6 [95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;15.4, &#x02212;9.8]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, effect sizes were greater for the ADHD-RS-IV than for the CHIP-CE: PRF or WFIRS-P outcomes in the previous placebo-controlled, 7-week study (SPD489-325) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In both studies, participants were recruited based on symptom severity and not on HRQoL or functional impairment criteria, but &#x02018;large&#x02019; effect sizes (&#x0003e;0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]) were nevertheless observed using the CHIP-CE: PRF and WFIRS-P secondary outcome measures. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that functional impairment and HRQoL are neither wholly dependent on, nor wholly independent of, ADHD symptoms, even in the domains that are most responsive to stimulant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The concordance between the results of the present study and those of SPD489-325 suggests that the interrelationships of HRQoL and functional impairment with ADHD symptoms are broadly similar during treatment initiation and following withdrawal of long-term treatment. Whether symptoms of ADHD deteriorate more rapidly than domains of HRQoL or functioning following LDX withdrawal, and whether ADHD symptoms lead directly or indirectly to HRQoL deficits and functional impairment, are questions not addressed in the present study.</p><p>To our knowledge, only four other randomized-withdrawal studies of ADHD pharmacotherapies have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and only one of these deployed a measure of HRQoL or functional impairment. In that study, 416 children and adolescents with ADHD completed a 12-week open-label period of atomoxetine treatment and were then randomized to receive atomoxetine or placebo for up to 9&#x000a0;months under double-blind conditions. One of the secondary efficacy measures was the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a measure of children&#x02019;s overall physical and psychosocial well-being. The authors did not state which version of the CHQ was used and did not report physical summary scores or individual &#x02018;concept&#x02019; (i.e. domain) scores. Post-randomization CHQ psychosocial summary scores in the placebo group worsened to a significantly greater extent than in the atomoxetine group (mean change from baseline, &#x02212;9.5 [SD&#x000a0;13.2] vs &#x02212;5.6 [12.0]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal design of the present long-term study is one of its key strengths, alongside the enrolment of both children and adolescents in Europe and the USA. The inclusion of both HRQoL and functional impairment as secondary efficacy outcomes is also a strength of the study design, even though the study population was enrolled based on symptom severity criteria. The strengths and weaknesses intrinsic to the WFIRS-P and CHIP-CE: PRF instruments have been previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As mentioned above, the randomized-withdrawal endpoint included early termination assessments of patients who discontinued the study if they met the treatment failure criteria during the randomized-withdrawal period, and who were not assessed thereafter. Furthermore, the study design was such that patients who entered the randomized-withdrawal period were those who had benefited from, and were able to tolerate, LDX treatment during the open-label period. Given the rapid reappearance of symptoms upon LDX withdrawal, with a median time to treatment failure of 17.0&#x000a0;days (95&#x000a0;% CI 12.0, 22.0) in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is possible that some patients or parents may have drawn their own conclusions about the identity of the allocated randomized treatment, and that this may have affected scores on the parent-rated secondary efficacy measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other advantages and disadvantages of the study design have been previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Continued treatment with once-daily, optimized doses of LDX maintained the improvements in parentally perceived HRQoL and functional impairment acquired during at least 26&#x000a0;weeks of open-label treatment to a greater extent than placebo in this international, phase III, randomized-withdrawal study. Prolonged effectiveness was most pronounced in the CHIP-CE: PRF and WFIRS-P domains that correspond to clinically relevant treatment objectives, such as reducing risky behaviour, improving relationships with family and peers and improving academic achievement. These results may assist healthcare professionals in planning pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD who face particular challenges in domains of HRQoL and day-to-day functioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40263_2014_193_MOESM1_ESM.doc"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOC 111&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00784654; Shire study ID: SPD489-326.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors thank the patients and investigators who took part in the study.</p><p>This study was funded by Shire Development LLC.
