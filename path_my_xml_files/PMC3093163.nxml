The study population included caregivers of elderly with dementia living in the city of Isfahan. Sampling was based on convenience method. Inclusion criteria were as being the main caregiver and having the responsibility to take care of the patient, age of more than 20 years, education level of above elementary school, caregiving just to the patient in the family, not attending any other family educational sessions before that, and not sharing caregiving with others. Also, exclusion criteria included attending less than 4 sessions of the educational program, patient&#x02019;s death during the study, suffering from severe and chronic physical or mental disorders that can be obstacle to caregiving, drug abuse, and providing longterm institutional care for patient during the study.</p><p>In this study, sample size was calculated 50 caregivers considering similar studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref> and by statistical formula. Considering the probability of losing of samples during the study, 60 samples were calculated. Sampling was conducted from April to July 2009, by referring to Modares Psychiatric Hospital and Shariati Psychiatric clinic in the city of Isfahan, which are the centers for elderly with dementia, and the samples were selected from caregivers of the elderly referring to these centers. The samples were randomly divided into two groups of case (n = 30) and control (n = 30). Caregivers of the case group attended family educational program after signing a consent form. Patients and controls were not present in this program. The content of the program was based on an educational pamphlet prepared and edited by the researchers through reading books and articles. The content was approved by 10 psychiatrists, neurologist and faculty members of the School of Nursing and Midwifery of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>This program included 5 weekly sessions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref> using lecturing, group discussions (10-15 members in groups), and question and answer as <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">table 1</xref> presents. The duration of each session was 90 minutes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref> and the place was Noor Hospital in Isfahan. This program was conducted under the supervision of the first researcher who has several years of experience as a university lecturer and patients and their families&#x02019; educator and also has a master degree in psychiatry. Meanwhile, CDs of all the sessions were provided to caregivers of the case group. In this study, the diagnosis of dementia was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders-IV-Text Revised (DSM-IV-TR) and by a psychiatrist specialist in the elderly through structured clinical interview. Also, to assess the cognitive condition of elderly, Mini Mental status Examination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref> was used. The validity and reliability of this test are approved by other studies using concurrent criterion and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha by splitting (&#x003b1; = 0.71-0.78, r = 25).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref> This test includes 30 items and assesses some cognitive functions such as direction finding, recording information, attention and calculation, remembering and language skills.

In Iran, caregiving to patients, especially elderly, is usually by women. Studies of other countries also showed that women in most cases are the main caregiver of patients in the family. Usually the caregivers are middleage, married women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref> In a study by National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), 61% of caregivers were women with a mean age of 46 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT32">32</xref> These findings are similar to those of the present study.</p><p>The present study showed that caregivers&#x02019; burden in the case group was significantly reduced right after the family educational program. This result was not found in any other studies reviewed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref> In all of these studies, caregivers&#x02019; burden was reduced right after the educational-supportive intervention, but this reduction was not significant compared with before the intervention. This difference in results can be to some extents related to study method, especially the components of the program including educational contents. Another factor is the educational-supportive facilities accessible to caregivers at the research environment. Unfortunately, such facilities were not available for caregivers in Isfahan, but other studies were in the countries where such facilities were available to facilitate caregiving and keep the caregivers&#x02019; burden low, which can downsize the effects of the research intervention.</p><p>Also, the results of the present study in the case group showed the continuity of the positive effects of the program on the caregivers&#x02019; burden during one month after the intervention; but due to the effects of the increasing severity of cognitive disorder during the time of study plus the increase of patients&#x02019; problems during this time, the difference between caregivers&#x02019; burden right after and one month after the intervention was not significant.

Lack of supportive educational facilities along with increasing severity of cognitive disorder can be the cause of this increase in caregivers&#x02019; burden. However, the study of Dias et al in India, which aimed to determine the effectiveness of a homecaring program to support caregivers of dementia patients, revealed that caregivers&#x02019; burden in the control group 3 months after the intervention showed a little reduction compared to that right after intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT35">35</xref> In other studies, caregivers&#x02019; burden was increased by time, but the difference between caregivers&#x02019; burden at different times of the study was not significant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT36">36</xref></p><p>Findings also showed a significant difference between caregivers&#x02019; burden of the two groups in all times of the study except before the intervention. This finding is similar to two other studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT36">36</xref> but dissimilar with several other studies due to different methods and educational facilities provided for caregivers in the study environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT35">35</xref></p><p>A significant feature of the present study was providing caregivers constant access to the educational sessions by preparing CDs of those sessions. Also, considering the results of the study, it supports inclusion of mental educational programs among necessary cares for caregivers of the dementia patients. In addition, researchers believe that one of the causes for the relative success of this program is the contents, which were prepared considering the determined problems of the similar studies. Moreover, the present study used group teaching methods, which are more effective than private teachings. The main limitation of the study was short-term followup that were decided because of limited term of education and probability of losing too many samples. Therefore, it is suggested to perform this program with longer term follow-up and evaluation.</p><p>It can be concluded that the results of the present study generally proved the positive effects of the family education program on caregivers&#x02019; burden of the dementia patients and as a result decreased this burden.</p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the research deputy of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
