Whether these cortical brain regions are necessary for probabilistic association learning is presently unknown. Participants' ability to acquire probabilistic associations was assessed during disruptive 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left DLPFC, left iPARC, and sham using a crossover single-blind design. On subsequent sessions, performance improved relative to baseline except during DLPFC rTMS that disrupted the early acquisition beneficial effect of prior exposure. A second experiment examining rTMS effects on task-naive participants showed that neither DLPFC rTMS nor sham influenced naive acquisition of probabilistic associations. A third experiment examining consecutive administration of the probabilistic association learning test revealed early trial interference from previous exposure to different probability schedules. These experiments, showing disrupted acquisition of probabilistic associations by rTMS only during subsequent sessions with an intervening night's sleep, suggest that the DLPFC may facilitate early access to learned strategies or prior task-related memories via consolidation. Although neuroimaging studies implicate DLPFC and iPARC in probabilistic association learning, the present findings suggest that early acquisition of the probabilistic cue-outcome associations in task-naive participants is not dependent on either region.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>consolidation</kwd><kwd>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>inferior parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>probabilistic association learning</kwd><kwd>repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>While cognitive processes rely on multiple brain regions for normal function, some cognitive processes may depend critically on contributions from specific cortical or subcortical regions. Although the prefrontal and parietal cortices are found to be active during many cognitive tasks, it is often unclear whether these 2 brain regions make necessary contributions to specific cognitive processes or, alternatively, whether activity in either of these regions is simply correlated with a given cognitive process. Previous studies have suggested that the prefrontal cortex is essential for working memory and executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Milner et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paulesu et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldman-Rakic 1996</xref>), and the parietal cortex is required during working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paulesu et al. 1993</xref>), attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter et al. 1995</xref>), and self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weniger et al. 2009</xref>). Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that declarative and nondeclarative rule learning and set shifting tasks activate both the dorsolateral prefrontal and the posterior parietal cortices in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Monchi et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asari et al. 2005</xref>). In nonhuman primates, in which it is possible to make direct recordings of neural activity during cognitive processing, feedback learning has elicited changes in neural response patterns of the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miller et al. 1996</xref>) and the posterior parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joelving et al. 2007</xref>) during delay periods when decisions regarding category membership are thought to be made.</p><p>Probability estimation (i.e., determining the likelihood that a particular event will occur) is a form of inductive reasoning that is related to categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smith 1989</xref>) and is integral to normal thought processing that is central to daily function, for example, when determining whether or not one should prepare for a rainy day on the basis of the presence of dark clouds in the sky or when determining how to respond appropriately on the basis of social cues displayed by other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knowlton et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al. 2008</xref>). Probabilistic association learning refers to a gradual feedback-based learning of probabilistically related cue&#x02013;outcome associations, without the necessity of conscious appreciation of the rules or strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knowlton et al. 1994</xref>). The &#x0201c;weather prediction task&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knowlton et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knowlton et al. 1996a</xref>) is one such computerized task in which participants learn the relationship between 2 equally occurring outcome variables (rain or shine) and combinations of 4 cue cards, each composed of simple geometric shapes. It requires feedback-based integration of categorical information presented on cue cards, and acquisition of the probabilistic associations depends at least in part on caudate nucleus function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knowlton et al. 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poldrack et al. 2001</xref>). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of probabilistic association learning in healthy adults have revealed activation of a neural network that includes the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poldrack et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al. 2009</xref>). However, it is presently unclear which parts of this network are critical for successful task performance. For example, relative to healthy young adults, healthy older adults demonstrating successful probabilistic association learning showed decreased prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus activation in conjunction with increased inferior parietal cortex (iPARC) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, although both prefrontal and parietal cortex activation is present during probabilistic association learning, it is presently uncertain whether either prefrontal and parietal cortex activation is necessary for probabilistic association learning.</p><p>To test whether different task-related cortical regions are required for probabilistic association learning, the present study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to selectively dissociate the contributions of cortical brain regions by disrupting neural activity in the given region under stimulation while the participant engaged in probabilistic association learning. Previous studies using low frequency stimulation (&#x02264;1 Hz) in healthy adults have shown that temporary disruption of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can lead to a significant deterioration of working memory performance, which relies on prefrontal cortex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pascual-Leone and Hallett 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mottaghy et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robertson et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mottaghy et al. 2002</xref>). Conversely, high-frequency rTMS (&#x0003e; 1Hz) to the superior parietal lobule facilitates responding during working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hamidi et al. 2008</xref>). Thus, low-frequency rTMS should provide an appropriate method to disambiguate the respective contributions of the prefrontal and parietal cortices during probabilistic association learning by disrupting cortical activity under the region of stimulation.</p><p>In the present study, we applied low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS to either the DLPFC or the iPARC during administration of the &#x0201c;weather prediction&#x0201d; probabilistic association learning test on separate sessions using a within-participant design to disrupt neural activity and determine whether prefrontal and/or parietal cortex function is necessary for probabilistic association learning. Based on fMRI studies revealing activity of prefrontal and parietal cortices in healthy adults during probabilistic association learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poldrack et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al. 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that if the prefrontal and/or parietal regions are critical to probabilistic association learning, then low-frequency rTMS to either prefrontal or parietal cortices would disrupt acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations. Results from the first experiment showed that only rTMS to the DLPFC negatively influenced acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations. However, given that stimulation was applied only following an initial baseline session, it was unclear whether the rTMS affected task-naive acquisition of the cue&#x02013;outcome associations or whether it suppressed access to previously acquired strategies and associated task-specific memories afforded through practice (repetition) or consolidation following the baseline session, which may have facilitated an early performance enhancement on subsequent sessions. Therefore, 2 follow-up experiments were performed using independent samples of task-naive participants to clarify the extent to which low-frequency rTMS was capable of disrupting task-naive probabilistic association learning, as opposed to suppressing facilitation of learning dependent on multiple session practice or between session consolidation (as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robertson 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 1: The Effect of 1 Hz rTMS to the Left DLPFC or Left iPARC Compared with Sham in Individuals Familiarized with Weather Prediction Task</title><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-six healthy volunteers participated in Experiment 1 (age range 18&#x02013;40 years, mean age 24.2 years, standard deviation (SD) = 5.9, 12 males, 23 right-handed). Mean education level was 16.0 years (SD = 1.4), average IQ was 122.5 (SD = 11.4), based on a 4-subtest version of the Wechshler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wechsler 1997</xref>), including Picture Completion, Similarities, Digit Symbol Coding, and Arithmetic from which the full-scale IQ estimate was derived. The procedure was explained, and informed consent was obtained in accordance with a protocol approved by the University of New South Wales and the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service Human Research Ethics Committees. Participants were required to complete a demographic and screening questionnaire, and all participants were interviewed by a medical practitioner for contraindications to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) prior to stimulation. None of the participants had a history of seizures, psychiatric illness, or severe head injury nor any contraindications to rTMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wassermann 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loo et al. 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>Weather Prediction Task</title><p>Each volunteer participated in 5 separate testing sessions performing the weather prediction task: an initial session without stimulation (which will be referred to as &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d;), followed by 1 active and 1 sham rTMS session each to the left DLPFC and the left iPARC, with the latter 4 sessions presented in pseudorandomized order such that equal numbers of participants received each of the presentation orders. Stimuli were 4 cue cards containing patterns of different geometrical shapes presented on a laptop computer screen. In any given trial, a stimulus consisted of 1, 2, or 3 cue cards (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> for an example of a trial). Participants were told that they should make a decision to predict rain or shine based on the presence or absence of the cue cards. They were also told that they should guess at first, but gradually, based on feedback provided, they would improve at determining which cue card combinations predict rain or shine. The relationship between cue cards and outcome variables was predetermined on a probabilistic basis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for an example of a cue&#x02013;outcome probability schedule), and presentations were randomized with the constraint that identical cue combinations would not appear consecutively, and each outcome (rain or shine) was limited to 5 consecutive occurrences. All stimuli were displayed on screen for 4.5 s with an intertrial interval of 0.5 s. Participants responded with a left mouse move and button press by their right hand to choose either rain or shine. After each response the words &#x02018;correct&#x02019; or &#x02018;incorrect&#x02019; appeared on screen as feedback to the participant. Missed trials were not included in the analyses. While cue cards were maintained across separate presentations, a different probability schedule was used at each testing session, with the different schedules presented in randomized order with the constraint that no probability schedule was presented more than once to a given participant.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Probability structure of

A Medtronic MagPro (MagVenture) stimulator and a figure eight-shaped water-cooled coil (70 mm outer diameter) were used to administer rTMS. Prior to the first rTMS session, each individual's resting motor threshold was determined as the minimum intensity that induced a visible movement of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle as agreed by 2 experimenters on 6 of 10 trials. The motor cortex was initially defined as 5 cm lateral and 2 cm anterior from the vertex and then adjusted slightly for each individual, based upon the optimal site for eliciting muscle movement as above. TMS was applied in single pulses with an interstimulus interval of at least 7 s in order to avoid &#x0201c;carry-over&#x0201d; effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mottaghy et al. 2002</xref>). During probabilistic association learning, rTMS was applied at 110% of each participant's motor threshold. The average motor threshold was 60% of the maximum stimulator output (range 39&#x02013;75%). Each individual participated in 4 stimulation sessions as described above. Sessions were scheduled at least 2 days apart (mean days between sessions 5.7, SD = 5.2). During the active sessions, participants received 1 Hz rTMS over either the left DLPFC, defined as 5 cm anterior to the motor cortex (as used in the majority of previous studies stimulating DLPFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pascual-Leone et al. 1996</xref>), or the left iPARC, defined as 4 cm posterior to the motor cortex. The stimulation was applied by placing the flat surface of the coil tangentially on the participant's scalp, at the site of interest, with the handle of the coil oriented posterolaterally. For each sham session, an active coil was placed over 1 of the stimulation sites of interest (at exactly the same parameters described above) but angled at 90 degrees to the scalp. Two trains of active rTMS or sham were administered while participants simultaneously completed 2 blocks of the weather prediction task, each block consisting of 75 trials with a 2-min break between blocks. Each rTMS train consisted of 375 pulses and lasted for 6.25 min. All participants and experimenters wore earplugs and earmuffs during each of the 4 rTMS sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>In order to assess the learning curve over the course of the task, we performed a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the cumulative mean percentage correct over 150 trials. The main analysis of interest concerns the condition by trial interaction, which shows differences in the progression of learning over the course of the task among the rTMS conditions (baseline vs. DLPFC rTMS vs. iPARC rTMS vs. sham).

Neither active nor sham stimulation affected latter trials and ultimate overall performance levels. Previous fMRI studies suggest of a role for the prefrontal cortex in the acquisition of probabilistic associations by showing prefrontal cortex activity during cue&#x02013;outcome association learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poldrack et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al. 2009</xref>). The current finding that rTMS to the DLPFC suppresses the acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations during a subsequent session suggests that DLPFC activity may facilitate acquisition of rearranged cue&#x02013;outcome associations on subsequent exposure. Participants became familiar with the task and may have retained some memories for the cards, previous cue&#x02013;outcome associations, or strategies during a baseline assessment session. Although different probability schedules were administered over multiple sessions with the cue&#x02013;outcome associations varied, the cue cards remained identical across sessions. In the initial presentation of the novel task, participants have to rely on a guessing strategy since no information about the different cue&#x02013;outcome associations is originally available. If participants are able to access memories of learning strategies on subsequent exposures that use rearranged cue&#x02013;outcome probabilities, then acquisition may be initially facilitated. DLPFC access to strategy memories from previous exposure would obviate the need for gradual acquisition of the cue&#x02013;outcome associations as evidenced by the &#x0201c;hockey stick-&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;hinge-&#x0201d;like function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasselblad et al. 1976</xref>) shown during the early trials of subsequent sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2<italic>b</italic></xref>) with the exception of DLPFC rTMS which displayed the more characteristic gradual learning curve similar to baseline. Functional neuroimaging studies have also found a relationship between increased performance during early strategy use and greater DLPFC activity in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Della-Maggiore and McIntosh 2005</xref>). However, as the task progresses within the first 25 trials, on subsequent presentations, some gradual acquisition occurs as participants adjust to learn the rearranged cue&#x02013;outcome probabilities. Thus, although some familiarity with the task may provide some acquisition benefit during subsequent sessions, the rearranged probabilistic structure requires additional learning.</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knowlton et al. 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poldrack et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2001</xref>) have shown that the striatum (especially, the caudate nucleus) is important for the acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations. The accumulation of cue&#x02013;outcome associations occurs over time, putatively takes place without conscious awareness, and is akin to gradually acquired habit learning, which depends on dorsal striatal functioning, as seen in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Packard et al. 1989</xref>). As described above, this would apply throughout each session in the baseline and DLPFC rTMS conditions but not necessarily during early acquisition of subsequent administrations.</p><p>Regarding the role of the iPARC in probabilistic association learning, functional neuroimaging studies have shown active engagement of this area and positive associations between iPARC activity and enhanced performance in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poldrack et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al. 2009</xref>). However, in the present study, we found no evidence of a disruption in acquisition nor in the ultimate performance level due to iPARC stimulation. Thus, it appears that the contribution of the iPARC is not critical in learning the cue&#x02013;outcome associations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al.</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al.</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2005</xref>) provide evidence suggesting that the iPARC may have a compensatory role in groups in which the DLPFC and caudate nucleus are compromised. Patients with schizophrenia, who typically show prefrontal deficits, failed to sufficiently activate DLPFC and caudate nucleus during probabilistic association learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weickert et al. 2009</xref>). However, those people with schizophrenia who did perform the task well showed increased activation in a compensatory network of brain regions that included the iPARC. This further supports the idea that the underlying neural substrate to learn the probabilistic associations can vary. Unlike the DLPFC, in healthy adults, the iPARC does not seem to provide access to prior strategy or memory of prior task-related information. However, chronically ill patients who have had time to develop cortical reorganization may exhibit a compensatory mechanism via iPARC.</p><p>The ultimate performance level, following presentation of a sufficient number of trials, is indicative of how well these cue&#x02013;outcome associations are acquired. Interestingly, in each of the rTMS stimulation or sham conditions, the ultimate performance level surpassed that attained during the baseline session when participants were task-naive. This is in line with the finding that task skill consolidation between sessions may positively influence performance on subsequent encounters with the same task, which has been previously demonstrated for procedural and declarative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Robertson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robertson 2009</xref>). This was achieved through a combination of a rapid elevation in performance during the early trials (made possible via DLPFC access to previous memories of task-relevant information) and gradual acquisition of the revised cue&#x02013;outcome associations across latter trials. Through consolidation, a motor skill or memory may undergo both qualitative and quantitative changes: It can be enhanced, leading to an increase in performance, or stabilized, leading to reduced susceptibility to interference, and in terms of qualitative changes, there can be a shift in strategy or an emergence of awareness for what has been learned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robertson et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walker 2005</xref>). Consolidation of an acquired skill occurs in memory systems that are characterized by reciprocal interactions during wakefulness but are disengaged during sleep. This disengagement during sleep allows the simultaneous processing of procedural and declarative knowledge and may increase the computational power of memory processing. During sleep, the brain's capacity to reorganize and reveal &#x0201c;hidden patterns&#x0201d; becomes especially potent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robertson 2009</xref>). That is, the capacity to bypass intermediary steps increases following consolidation during sleep by forming associations between early steps and the final solution of a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wagner et al. 2004</xref>). It thus seems that this type of implicit probabilistic association learning assessed by the weather prediction test is a skill that is amenable to improvement and can be consolidated over days.</p><p>A possible alternative explanation for the effects observed during the early phases of DLPFC rTMS is that stimulation to the prefrontal region is more likely to produce side-effects such as facial muscle twitching, which may interfere with task performance and which could affect the participant's ability to register an adequate response. However, it is unlikely that the DLPFC effect observed in the accuracy data is merely due to the direct distracting effects of the stimulation itself since the reaction time data showed that both during acquisition as well as in the asymptotic phase, RTs were similar across all stimulation conditions. In addition, if rTMS application was due to distracting side effects, then we would expect performance to fall below the level of the baseline session, during which no stimulation at all was present; however, this was not the case. Furthermore, such a disturbance would be consistent throughout the task not differentially affecting acquisition. Thus, it is more likely that the findings are specific to the influence on local brain activity and not due to general rTMS-induced side effects. Alternatively, 1 Hz rTMS may facilitate neural activity, and the increased DLPFC activity may impair acquisition; however, in the majority of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pascual-Leone and Hallett 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mottaghy et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robertson et al. 2001</xref>) low-frequency (<underline>&#x0003c;</underline>1 Hz) rTMS decreases cortical excitability.</p><p>In summary, 1 Hz rTMS to the DLPFC was found to impair only the acquisition phase of probabilistic association learning during subsequent presentations while ultimate learning was unaffected by either DLPFC or iPARC stimulation. Speed of responding was not disrupted by rTMS to either DLPFC or iPARC. Although functional neuroimaging studies routinely report increased activity in DLPFC and iPARC during probabilistic association learning, the present findings suggest that disruption of DLPFC activity during subsequent presentation of revised probability structures may inhibit or retard access to consolidated strategies or memories from previous exposure to the task. Neither DLPFC nor iPARC activation appear to be critical for the ultimate acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations in healthy young individuals.</p><p>Since rTMS was applied only during subsequent administrations, on the basis of Experiment 1, it was not clear whether DLPFC disruption via low-frequency rTMS would impair acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations during the first administration in task-naive participants. Thus, in order to determine whether disruption of DLPFC interferes with acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations during the first administration in task-naive participants, we conducted Experiment 2 in which rTMS or sham was administered to the DLPFC during the first administration of the weather prediction test in an independent sample of task-naive participants. If the DLPFC contributes critically to acquisition of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations, then applying 1 Hz rTMS to the DLPFC during the first administration in task-naive participants should disrupt acquisition of cue&#x02013;outcome associations. Additionally, since all subsequent sessions were administered with 1 or more intervening night's sleep, it was not clear whether practice (simple repetition) or consolidation was responsible for early acquisition improvement during subsequent sessions. Thus, we conducted Experiment 3 in which a third independent sample of 9 healthy participants who were naive to the weather prediction test received 2 consecutive administrations of the weather prediction test on the same day with different probability schedules at each administration without brain stimulation in order to confirm that accelerated early acquisition on subsequent administrations is related to consolidation as opposed to practice (repetition) effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2: The Effect of 1 Hz rTMS to the DLPFC in Task-Naive Participants</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen healthy volunteers naive to the probabilistic learning test participated in Experiment 2 (age range 19&#x02013;28 years, mean age 21.8 years, SD = 2.6, 7 males, all right-handed).

There were no differences in the learning curves between the 2 conditions (DLPFC rTMS vs. sham) during the acquisition phase or in the asymptotic learning phase. Reaction times were also unaffected by rTMS administration. Although learning rates in the weather prediction task have been shown to be enhanced among those with higher levels of executive function, and thus presumably adequate PFC functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Price 2005</xref>), another study revealed that acquisition of probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations was in fact not impaired in people with prefrontal cortex lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knowlton et al. 1996a</xref>). The current series of experiments suggests that prefrontal cortical activity is not integral to initial acquisition of the probabilistic associations. Our results also fit with a previous finding that executive function may be associated with explicit category learning, but not &#x0201c;implicit&#x0201d; category learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeCaro et al. 2008</xref>), which apparently constitutes the basis of gradual and nondeclarative learning of novel cue&#x02013;outcome associations in a probabilistic design such as the weather prediction task.</p><p>Without prior exposure to the task, participants cannot rely on previously acquired and consolidated strategies to enhance performance early during the acquisition phase when new probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations are being presented. Thus, the rTMS-elicited deficit during early trials in the first experiment appears to have been due to disruption of DLPFC-mediated rapid access to consolidated task-specific skills, memories, or strategies accrued from previous exposure to the task. Experiment 1 was designed in such a way that at least 2 days (and 2 nights) passed between the baseline session and any subsequent session. This time delay may have allowed for consolidation of task skills before any active or sham rTMS session was performed. Those skills may have been both declarative, which would have enhanced performance in the early trials of subsequent exposures (due to strategic responding and conscious memories of prior task experiences), and non-declarative, which may have enhanced the gradual acquisition of the revised cue&#x02013;outcome associations as the task progressed. In the second experiment, effects of prior task exposure were eliminated by administering randomized active or sham stimulation during the first exposure in task-naive participants and using different probabilistic association schedules. Interference due to prior exposure to distinct probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome association schedules in Experiment 3 and the lack of any early disruption by DLPFC rTMS during the first administration of the probabilistic association learning test to task-naive participants in Experiment 2 suggest that DLPFC rTMS during subsequent administrations induces a disturbance of neocortical processing which disrupts access to the previously stored and consolidated skills, memories, or strategies, thereby necessitating a complete reacquisition de novo of the probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations.</p><p>One alternative explanation for the lack of an observable disruption in the acquisition of cue&#x02013;outcome associations during Experiment 2 is that rTMS stimulation was applied unilaterally. Interhemispheric compensatory mechanisms may circumvent the potential interfering effects of rTMS applied to the left DLPFC in isolation. Also, fMRI studies have revealed that both the DLPFC and the iPARC are simultaneously activated during probabilistic association learning; hence, either 1 of these 2 regions may compensate at least partially for disruption of the other as suggested by increased iPARC activity with comparable probabilistic learning performance in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fera et al. 2005</xref>). However, other rTMS studies have observed disrupted performance on cognitive tasks, including working memory, by means of rTMS application to the left DLPFC in isolation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Osaka et al. 2007</xref>), which indicates that compensatory mechanisms may not be sufficient for optimal task performance when a critical region is disrupted. However, Experiment 1 in the present study did demonstrate a detrimental effect of unilateral DLPFC rTMS on acquisition during subsequent exposure to the task. Conversely, with respect to cortico-cortical connectivity, the DLPFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL) are strongly associated with memory encoding and retrieval; thus, DLPFC rTMS may have produced indirect effects on MTL-related declarative processes during early acquisition as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poldrack et al. (2001)</xref>.</p><p>Since identical cues were used during subsequent administrations, there was some potential for interference from previous exposure that could negatively influence performance on subsequent administrations, and DLPFC activity may have inhibited such interference from previous exposure. Given this interpretation, DLPFC rTMS may have prevented the DLPFC from inhibiting the interference effects from previous sessions. Finally, those participants displaying increased conscious awareness of the rules may have been more susceptible to the effects of DLPFC rTMS. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gluck et al. (2002)</xref> have shown that self-report of strategies used to solve the weather prediction test are inconsistent with people's own performance even in healthy participants.</p><p>In sum, evidence from 3 experiments, in which rTMS was used to disrupt processing in discrete brain regions previously associated with performance on probabilistic association learning suggests a lack of a critical contribution from either the DLPFC or iPARC to initial acquisition of novel probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations. Disrupting DLPFC function affected the early acquisition phase of probabilistic association learning but only during subsequent sessions that included at least 1 or more intervening night's sleep. These results suggest that the DLPFC plays a role in accessing consolidated memories and cognitive skills to improve performance when acquiring novel probabilistic based cue&#x02013;outcome associations during subsequent sessions of probabilistic association learning. However, initial learning of probabilistic cue&#x02013;outcome associations may be more generally dependent on other brain regions such as the striatum.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This
