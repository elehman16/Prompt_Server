Several studies<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> have suggested that these injuries have a higher incidence than once thought, and are probably underdiagnosed. Rugby Union seems to have a disproportionately high incidence of ASI, even compared with Rugby League (0.89 vs 0.46 injuries per 1000&#x02005;h).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> While data are scarce in this field, the England Rugby Union Injury Surveillance Project<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> reports a large increase in the incidence of ASI, ranking it third in overall incidence and first in days lost due to injury in 2013, with 145&#x02005;days per 1000 match hours lost to injury (compared with 58&#x02005;days in the 2012 season).</p><p>ASIs are considered more serious and complex, and result in longer delays to match play than lateral ligament injuries.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While there is no consensus on optimal treatment,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> traditional treatment options have been limited either to conservative therapy with immobilisation, or to surgical fixation techniques.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Time to return to play (RTP) after injury is often protracted; usually more than 6&#x02005;weeks in rugby players we have treated, and on average four times longer than for lateral ligament injuries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Where conservative treatment is appropriate, new techniques are being sought to accelerate recovery.</p><p>In the last decade, basic science studies have suggested that treatments using autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> have the potential to accelerate recovery and healing for various musculoskeletal injuries. Despite this, a recent systematic review concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the use of PRP injections in musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries; while pooled data did not demonstrate any harm from adverse events.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessed the influence of an ultrasound-guided PRP injection at diagnosis plus a second injection 1&#x02005;week later, on RTP for athletes competing in a variety of different sports.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Compared with athletes who received no injection, they demonstrated a shorter RTP, low residual pain on return and restoration of syndesmosis stability on ultrasound. An effective, minimally invasive treatment would be valuable to competitive and professional athletes with stable ASIs, who must otherwise weigh the risks and benefits of prolonged conservative recovery or surgery. Surgical intervention (with either screw or suture-button fixation) involves potential complications from the procedure (anaesthesia, bleeding, infection) and implant (failure or further surgery for removal), and an average of 6&#x02005;weeks of postsurgical rest.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The current pilot study was designed to obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness of PRP injection into the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) in potentially accelerating safe RTP in a Rugby Union cohort, to inform the feasibility of conducting a fully powered RCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a historical cohort-controlled study to assess the effectiveness of a single PRP injection for MRI-confirmed ASIs. Football clubs from the Sydney Rugby Union Premiership Competition were invited to participate. Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Sydney, Australia (ID: 2014/439). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Athletes referred by clubs for medical review were assessed by KR or DJS for ASI using clinical criteria described and evaluated in a previous diagnostic accuracy study.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Key clinical features raising suspicion for syndesmosis injury included: tender syndesmotic ligaments on palpation, inability to single leg hop, positive dorsiflexion/external rotation stress test, positive squeeze test, pain out of proportion to the injury and sonographic evidence of injury. The absence of any of these features indicated a low probability of ASI. When clinical suspicion for ASI existed, MRI was performed within 14&#x02005;days of injury and interpreted by a single radiologist (JL). MRI has excellent sensitivity and specificity for ASI<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and is far less invasive than arthroscopy, which is considered the reference standard.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We used a classification system for ASI described by Sikka <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which is applicable to our conservatively managed cohort. The grade is based on those ligamentous structures involved, as seen on MRI, that are thought to be injured sequentially with increasing tibiofibular displacement caused by increasing degrees of talar external rotation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Grade 1 describes isolated AITFL injury, grade 2 involves the addition of inferior interosseous ligament injury, grade 3 is the addition of posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) injury and grade 4 describes the addition of deltoid ligament injury. Static syndesmotic width 1&#x02005;cm above the ankle joint anteriorly was also recorded in all cases, as syndesmotic width has been shown to have a significant correlation with recovery time.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Exclusion criteria included: a low probability of ASI, previous ASI, previous ipsilateral fracture or surgery, concurrent injury likely to cause more prolonged disability, ankle fracture, frank tibiofibular diastasis on plain radiographs, osteochondral defect requiring surgery, concurrent acute grade 3 anterior talofibular ligament injury and greater than 4&#x02005;mm tibiofibular separation on MRI.</p><p>In the 2014 season of the Sydney Rugby Union Premiership, 10 participants with MRI confirmed ASIs were recruited to the intervention group. Twelve patients were investigated using MRI, with 11 meeting diagnostic criteria for inclusion. One patient declined PRP injection, and one patient had lateral ligament rather than syndesmosis injury, as seen on MRI.</p><p>Participants in the intervention group underwent PRP injection within 14&#x02005;days of injury. On enrolment, participants were asked to use paracetamol for analgaesia, and to refrain from taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 3&#x02005;days of administration of PRP. This analgaesic restriction was intended to maximise the theoretical action of the PRP via platelet function.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Using simple venesection, 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;mL of PRP was obtained from participants and put into sterile citrate tubes that were placed in a standard centrifuge at room temperature for 8&#x02005;min at 3000&#x02005;rpm. The portion of plasma just above the buffy coat was aspirated using a 21-gauge needle to obtain 0.5&#x02005;mL of PRP per citrate tube, and no activating techniques were used. This procedure was based on an established technique,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with the omission of chemical activation with calcium chloride. This modified method was validated in-house by JL to produce an average increased concentration of platelets by 3.3 times and of leucocytes by 2.9 times peripheral blood concentration. According to our recent survey of Fellows of the Australasian College of Sports Physicians (Samra D and Orchard J, unpublished data, 2014), the most common method to produce PRP is a manual centrifuge method without chemical or ultraviolet PRP activation techniques, which is akin to our method.</p><p>In administering the PRP, ultrasound guidance was used. The tear of the AITFL was identified, and an injection pathway that would avoid the superficial peroneal nerve was determined. Under sterile conditions, a 25-gauge needle was used to inject 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;mL of local anaesthetic (1% lignocaine) into the skin and superficial tissues. An individualised dose of 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;mL of the PRP was then injected into the precise region of the AITFL defect, so as to be contained and to not hydrodissect tissue further. JL performed all injections.</p><p>In addition to the PRP injection, the standard guidelines for rehabilitation remained consistent with milestones agreed on by medical staff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJSEM2015000033F1">figure 1</xref>). While there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the optimal conservative management of ASI,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> this approach is based on protection of injured tissue with relevant functional milestones to guide progression. All suspected acute ASIs were treated with rest, ice, compression, elevation, CAM (controlled ankle motion) boot immobilisation and modified pain-free weight-bearing. Regular weekly follow-up was observed, and participants were allowed to weight bear without a CAM boot once a pain-free bilateral lunge (maximally bending at the knees while keeping both heels on the ground) and pain-free anterior ankle syndesmosis palpation were achieved. Running was only permitted once a pain-free single leg hop was achieved. In accordance with usual practice, all treating physiotherapists conducted a graded in-house sport-specific fitness test. This was considered the final milestone for RTP.</p><fig id="BMJSEM2015000033F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Rehabilitation protocol for ASI (AITFL, anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament; ASI, ankle syndesmosis injury; CAM, controlled ankle motion).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjsem2015000033f01"/></fig><p>We compared the findings for the experimental study with a historical cohort recruited for a previous study.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This cohort was obtained from injured Rugby Union players in the 2011&#x02013;2013 seasons of the Sydney Rugby Union Premiership, who were recruited with the same criteria and treated by the same physician (DJS or KR).

There are three measures of fear-avoidance produced: physical activity-specific (FABQ pa), sport-specific (FABQ sport) and an overall score (FABQ total).</p><p>Within 1&#x02005;week of return to match play, participants underwent further functional testing at the RTP Test Occasion. Tests included the aforementioned measures for the Early Test Occasion, with the addition of two further tests: the Illinois Agility Test and the Triple Hop test. These are considered valid measures of agility and ankle power, respectively.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Analysis of data was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics V.22. Descriptive statistics were performed on all continuous variables including histogram frequencies, to assess normality. Baseline characteristics including age, weight, height and syndesmosis width on MRI were analysed using Student t tests to detect any significant differences between cohorts. Similarly, quantitative outcome measures of pain, function and time to RTP were analysed to compare groups using Student t tests of independent samples. Where data were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were used to detect differences between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The intervention and historical groups were comparable in all baseline demographic data (p&#x0003e;0.05 for all characteristics; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJSEM2015000033TB1">table 1</xref>), and there were similar numbers of Forwards and Backs in each group.

VJ was a mean of 11&#x02005;cm higher, p=0.001, 95% CI (5.6 to 16.4). There was a reduced level of fear-avoidance beliefs associated with Rugby Union in the intervention group, p=0.014 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJSEM2015000033TB2">table 2</xref>). Three participants from the historical group and one from the intervention group did not attend RTP testing. These participants did not differ significantly from their cohort in any baseline characteristics or injury severity. No loss to follow-up occurred for RTP date and recovery time data.</p><p>No participants in either group reported resting pain at the RTP Test Occasion, however, mild pain was provoked during testing in four athletes from the intervention group, compared with six from the historical control group. On routine medical follow-up of the intervention group 3&#x02005;months after RTP, there were no reports of recurrence or ongoing symptoms. No participant underwent ankle surgery.</p><p>Since there were no complications directly attributable to the PRP treatment, this appears to be a safe therapy for ASIs. There were no reports of adverse events in the immediate period of follow-up performed at 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days postinjection for participants in the intervention group. Later in their recovery, two athletes had unexpected adverse events. One participant was found to have a below-knee deep vein thrombosis diagnosed early in his management. This occurred 2&#x02005;weeks after the PRP injection and thought to be related to immobilisation. Another participant had a non-contact ACL rupture of his ipsilateral knee on his first game returning to rugby. This player, as with all participants, underwent graded fitness testing in order to assess safety to RTP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of an ultrasound-guided PRP injection in accelerating RTP in Rugby Union players. We found that participants who received a single PRP injection took significantly less time to RTP than controls. This is in keeping with the findings of Laver <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> who found that athletes from a variety of sports returned to play significantly faster and with lower levels of residual pain. In contrast to that study, the current study recruited a homogeneous single sport cohort. Furthermore, we tested a simple PRP protocol involving a manual single spin procedure and single injection (rather than Endoret), and we recorded functional outcome measures to confirm safe and appropriate return to sport. The findings of reduced recovery time following PRP injection are supported by significantly higher measures of ankle power and agility, indicative of a better capacity for performance on RTP.</p><p>At the Early Test Occasion, athletes in the intervention group following PRP injection had higher VJ scores than those in the historical control group. There were no significant differences in any other outcomes, including pain scores, balance or fear-avoidance beliefs. Considering that injury severity was comparable between groups, this may represent an early improvement in function associated with a more stable ankle mortise, since jumping places the ankle mortise under considerable stress. Functional superiority of the intervention group was maintained on the RTP Test Occasion. Scores on both the Illinois Agility and VJ tests were significantly higher in the intervention group. Maintenance of greater mortise stability may be responsible for this effect, as the PRP administered is thought to increase stability via augmented tissue healing.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> While some authors cite the trophic effects of growth factors in accelerating the proliferative phase of tissue healing, clinical researchers such as J Fitzpatrick (unpublished data, 2013) have suggested that a sclerosing effect may promote tissue fibrosis and stiffening due to the increased glucose concentration of PRP. In the future, a dynamic imaging test such as serial ultrasound may prove beneficial in quantifying the functional stability of the ankle mortise following such treatment.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>This study appears to demonstrate that a single ultrasound-guided PRP injection into the ASI is safe and effective in accelerating recovery. This is highly applicable to clinical practice for the management of ASIs in Rugby Union players. We applied a single PRP injection produced from a single centrifuge spin in order to maximise external validity. A single injection is easier for the patient and clinician. Furthermore, our recent survey (Samra D and Orchard J, unpublished data, 2014) highlighted that most Australasian Sports Physicians do not use commercial kits, or activation methods (such as ultraviolet light or calcium chloride) to produce PRP. Team physicians trained in ultrasound-guided injections, with minimal additional training, equipment or cost, could easily apply the simple method of PRP preparation we tested. Nonetheless, there remain wide differences in methods of preparing PRP, which could limit the generalisability of our results.</p><p>The use of an historical control is a limiting factor in this study, as it does not involve placebo control or randomisation. Since participants were not blinded to the treatment received, there is the possibility of a placebo effect in the intervention group. However, despite the lack of randomisation, group characteristics were highly comparable, with all participants drawn from a similar competitive level of rugby (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJSEM2015000033TB1">table 1</xref>). All athletes were Sydney Rugby Union Premiership players and were included using the same criteria, same treatment progression milestones and the same treating physicians. Baseline characteristics, player position, grade of injury and syndesmosis width on MRI were also highly correlated. For the purposes of this pilot study, a historical control group was utilised to ensure realistic recruitment targets. This study indicates that an RCT with adequate power to compare PRP injection with placebo injection would be feasible.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single autologous PRP injection appears to be a safe intervention that may accelerate successful return to Rugby, with improved functional capacity and reduced fear avoidance following ASI. Although it may be practically difficult to recruit elite athletes into placebo control groups, further trials with randomisation and placebo control methodology are feasible and warranted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the staff and players at Sydney University Rugby Club, Eastern Suburbs Rugby Club and other clubs of the Sydney Rugby Union Premiership for their assistance and participation in the study.
