Dietary fermentable carbohydrates are the main triggering factor for development of cariogenic biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When biofilm is matured, the presence of sugars promotes a higher plaque cariogenicity, keeping frequently pH value under the critical levels for the demineralization of enamel and dentine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The acidic environment within biofilm favours the growth of more acid-tolerant bacteria such as mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Preventive strategies are needed and recommended to control caries risk factors, mainly based on dietary changes, i.e. sweetener intake reduction, and enhancing host resistance, i.e. twice-daily use of fluoride toothpastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">However, the high-skewed caries prevalence distribution suggests the need of developing new and effective preventive approaches especially for high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The use of sugar-free chewing gums may contribute to prevent dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The increase of stimulated saliva flow rate promotes oral clearance and enhances the buffering capacity to neutralize plaque pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is described in literature that the consumption of xylitol can lead to less plaque, less numbers of MS, and a lower caries increment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although the xylitol mechanisms are not fully known, several studies demonstrate its benefits and clinical trials have shown that xylitol possesses both noncariogenic and cariostatic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is a debate on the effective dose; a total daily dose from 3 to 8&#x000a0;g of xylitol is usually recommended for a clinical effect. In children, the efficacy of low doses of xylitol in caries prevention was speculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; anyhow, the results are inconclusive for long-term effectiveness regarding MS and caries reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The existing evidence of xylitol role in caries prevention needs to be supplemented by well-designed randomized controlled trials, especially in adults at high risk of caries.</p><p id="Par10">Starting from this premise with the aim to assess the caries preventive effect of long-term use of low dosage of xylitol chewing gums in a high-caries-risk adult population, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with two arms was designed and carried out.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par11">This paper reports on findings obtained in a larger research project that examines the effect of several functional foods supplied through chewing gums on caries prevention in an adult population.

Baseline training consisted in 1-day (6&#x000a0;h) theoretical course, followed by examination of 54 extracted teeth plus a session of 120 photographs of extracted teeth. Two days after the theoretical course, a clinical training involving examination of 55 adults was performed. The subjects were re-examined after 72&#x000a0;h. Inter-examiner reliability with the &#x0201c;benchmark&#x0201d; (GCampus) was evaluated using fixed-effect analysis of variance.

Subjects were examined using a mouth mirror and a Community Periodontal Index probe (approved by the WHO) under optimal lighting. The ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) index was used to register caries at tooth level as initial or moderate or extensive lesions and the number of filled and missing teeth for caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Initial caries lesion can be defined as a primary lesion, which has not reached the stage of an established lesion with cavitation. Moderate caries lesions are defined as white or brown spot lesion with localized enamel breakdown or an underlying dentine shadow without visible dentine exposure. Severe caries lesions are defined as distinct cavity in opaque or discoloured enamel with visible dentine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Recordings were performed before and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30&#x000a0;min after a mouth rinse with 10% sucrose and carried out by one examiner (FC). Area under the curve (AUC), described as the area between reference pH (6.2 or 5.7) line and the pH curve, was calculated using a computer-based program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The subjects were asked to make no changes in their dietary and oral hygiene habits. Tooth brushing was not allowed for at least 1&#x000a0;h after the use of chewing gums. All subjects received a fluoridated toothpaste containing 1450&#x000a0;ppm NaF (Mentadent P; Unilever Italia, Milan, Italy) to be used during the experimental period. They were also asked to avoid any other oral hygiene adjuvant and any commercial xylitol or sorbitol product throughout the study period. The body&#x02019;s tolerance to different polyols was assessed by means of a questionnaire administered to the participants shortly after the gum distribution had started and 6&#x000a0;months later, while the study was still proceeding. The questions focused on the potential side effects of using the gum.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">The purpose of this study was to assess the caries preventive effect of long-term use of low-dosage xylitol administered through a chewing gum in a caries high-risk adult population. To elucidate this aim, a two-arm randomized controlled intervention trial was designed and carried out.</p><p id="Par36">The use of sugar substitutes is an intervention able to reduce caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and several nonfermentable sweeteners are incorporated into many products, such as chewing gums, lozenges, candies, and syrup, with the xylitol as the main substitute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several studies indicated an effect, dose- and frequency-dependent, of xylitol with a total daily dose from 3 to 8&#x000a0;g a day and a frequency of four to five times a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In this trial, two types of chewing gums were studied: a low dosage (0.5&#x000a0;g/pellet) of xylitol chewing gum and a polyol (isomalt, sorbitol, mannitol, and maltitol syrup) chewing gum. The trial focused on caries increment (&#x00394;-initial, &#x00394;-moderate, and &#x00394;-extensive caries lesions and &#x00394;-caries experience), plaque acidogenicity, and mutans streptococci concentration in saliva. Two clinical caries evaluations were performed, the first at the end of the chewing gum use period (12&#x000a0;months from baseline) and the second at the end of the no-gum use period (24&#x000a0;months from baseline), during which no other community-based caries prevention strategies were pursued in the sample, except for the personal oral hygiene habits.</p><p id="Par38">At the end of the gum use period, statistically significant differences regarding initial and extensive &#x00394;-caries values were observed between the two groups. Subjects using the low-dosage xylitol chewing gum showed significantly lower caries increment. The comparison between the two follow-up evaluations (12 and 24&#x000a0;months from baseline) showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups, but the comparison with respect to baseline was still statistically significant. Subjects using the low-dosage xylitol chewing gum showed a significantly lower increment of initial and extensive caries lesions and overall a lower increment of caries experience. Few studies reported a long-term caries preventive effect associated with xylitol gum that persists or even increases over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this trial, the long-term effect might be ascribed to the high statistically significant values observed at the end of the chewing gum period (12&#x000a0;months) and these statistically significant values persist even at the 24-month evaluation.</p><p id="Par39">Different results were reported in a recent multicenter placebo-controlled randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], where adults consumed 5&#x000a0;g daily of xylitol or placebo lozenges during a 33-month period. No significant effect was observed in the xylitol group regarding reduction in caries increment even if a dose almost double than those administered in the present study was used. Several hypotheses might be speculated to assess these different results. Although the two studies were similar regarding the number of subjects, the sample of the present study was highly homogeneous (age range, caries risk factors, and number of caries). Moreover, the total caries figure was included in the present study, considering even initial lesions and missed teeth due to caries, giving a wider picture. In addition, timing and administration modalities were different in the two trials; in the present one, xylitol was administered via a chewing gum; this led to the release of xylitol times higher than that of other studies. Xylitol was administered via a chewing gum far from main meals, allowing the polyol to act for a quite long period, and and due to a prolonged residence time of xylitol in the oral cavity.</p><p id="Par40">Plaque pH comparison between groups was statistically significantly different, showing an area under the curve for enamel dissolution less pronounced in the xylitol group at the follow-up evaluations. Regarding the area under the curve for dentine dissolution, no statistically significant difference between groups was recorded, but a decrease in the area was noted during the entire experimental period only in the xylitol group. This pH figure reflects the trend of cariogenic bacteria during the trial period. A statistically significant difference in mutans&#x000a0;streptococci concentration was evident between groups both at the end of the chewing gum use period and at the end of the no-gum use period. A growth-reducing effect of xylitol on salivary MS has been described, suggesting a long-term efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This finding seems to demonstrate a prolonged effect of&#x000a0;Xylitol on different plaque-related variables, acidogenicity, and bacteria concentration, even if the clinical efficacy seems to be limited at the gum use period.</p><p id="Par41">Some limits of the study design need to be underlined. First of all, the study population belonged to an age range, in which the habit to chew daily chewing gum is not common, so it was difficult to find a complete compliance and this might have affected the dropout. The number of subjects and the inclusion criteria do not allow to generalize the results to the general population of this age group. It is disputable if the results of this trial may not overlap to younger populations, taking into consideration that the majority of studies were carried out on children. A quite important issue is to determine if the preventive effect is mainly due to xylitol amount or the frequency of use. The results of the present study put some tiles to the importance of the frequency of xylitol use; anyway, more trials are needed to elucidate this aspect.</p><p id="Par42">Although several studies were carried out on the caries preventive effect of Xylitol, this study holds almost unique characteristics like the age of the subjects (adult population), the length of the administration and the follow-up (12 and 24&#x000a0;months, respectively), the low dosage of xylitol administered (2.5&#x000a0;g/die), and the administration vehicle (chewing gums).</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, a long use of xylitol chewing gums with low concentration of polyol, controlling cariogenic bacteria concentration and plaque acidogenicity, provides an effective means for the prevention of caries disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the willingness of all the participants that provide consent for the participation into the trial.
