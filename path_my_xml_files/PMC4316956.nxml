A total of 79 postoperative patients with cervical cancer participated in the present study. They were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. Patients in the control group were treated with cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients in the experimental group were treated with dendritic cell-cytokine-induced killer (DC-CIK) cells combined with cisplatin chemotherapy. The CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD56<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cell ratios in peripheral blood, and the expression levels of perforin, granzyme B (GraB) and CD107a of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in all patients prior to and following treatment were observed. The changes of immune function and recurrence rate between these two groups prior to and following treatment were compared. Prior to treatment, the lymphocyte ratio had no significant difference between the two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05). Following treatment, the lymphocyte ratio in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The positive expression levels of perforin, GraB and CD107a of PBMCs in the experimental group following treatment were significantly higher than those prior to treatment and those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The cumulative recurrence rate in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). In conclusion, in postoperative patients with cervical cancer, treatment with DC-CIK cells combined with cisplatin chemotherapy significantly improved the immune function, reduced the recurrence rate and prolonged the survival time of the patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritic cell-cytokine-induced killer cell</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd><kwd>cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>immune function</kwd><kwd>recurrence rate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignant tumors. It mainly results from chronic infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which leads to abnormal metaplasia and subsequent cancer. In recent years, the age of incidence of cervical cancer has been decreasing (<xref rid="b1-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Currently, the clinical treatment of cervical cancer is focused on surgery and chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with traditional Chinese medicine treatment. However, the cure rate in patients with advanced cervical cancer remains very low and the recurrence rate is high (<xref rid="b3-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Cancer patients often have severe cellular immune function defects, and cervical cancer patients are no exception. Therefore, improving the cellular immunity functions of cancer patients is essential to improve their survival rate and cure rate. In recent years, the application of biological treatment technology in tumor immunotherapy has been constantly expanding and gradually accepted by medical personnel and patients. This technology has become the fourth main treatment option for tumors, following surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have become the preferred type of cells used in antitumor adoptive cell immunotherapy. CIK cells are heterogeneous cells that can be generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by culturing in the presence of a variety of cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="b4-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). CIK cells have the advantages having the strong antitumor activity of T lymphocytes and a non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted tumoricidal effect (<xref rid="b5-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Dendritic cells (DCs) are currently the most powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have been discovered. They can induce antigen-specific immune responses. A co-culture of DCs and CIK cells has the advantages of fast proliferation, high cytotoxicity and a broad tumor-killing spectrum (<xref rid="b8-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In recent years, clinical studies concerning the use of biological immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer have been increasing; however, few of them have focused on cervical cancer (<xref rid="b9-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Through comparing the efficacy of chemotherapy alone with that of biological immune therapy combined with chemotherapy on patients with cervical cancer, the current study explored the effectiveness of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy on the immune function of patients with cervical cancer and the recurrence rate of the cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Clinical data</title><p>A total of 79 patients with cervical cancer in Suzhou Kowloon Hospital (Suzhou, China) from March 2008 to March 2010 participated in the study. The selection criteria of the patients were as follows: i) diagnosed as cervical cancer by pathology; ii) between the age of 30 and 70 years; iii) without organ lesions, e.g., of the liver, kidney or heart; iv) without cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders; and v) signed an acknowledgment agreement. The patients were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The patients of the control group were treated with chemotherapy, while the patients of the experimental group were treated with biological immune therapy combined with chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 39 cases (age, 51.9&#x000b1;16.8 years), 30 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma and nine of whom had adenocarcinoma. According to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage classification, there were 16 cases in Stage IIa, 11 cases in Stage IIb, seven cases in Stage IIIa, four cases in Stage IIIb, and one case in Stage IV. The experimental group consisted of 40 cases (age, 52.4&#x000b1;17.1 years), 31 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma and nine of whom had adenocarcinoma. According to FIGO stage classification, there were 15 cases in Stage IIa, 12 cases in Stage IIb, eight cases in Stage IIIa, four cases in Stage IIIb and one case in Stage IV. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, clinical stage or the degree of tumor invasion (P&#x0003e;0.05). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval from the Ethics Committee of Suzhou Kowloon Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of DC-CIK cells</title><p>Prior to chemotherapy, 1.5&#x02013;4.0&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> PBMCs were collected from each patient. During the collection of the PBMCs, 60 ml plasma was isolated to prepare for cell reinfusion. The collected PBMCs were centrifuged at 2,500 &#x000d7; g for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. The sediment was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and then resuspended. After that, the PBMCs were mixed with lymphocyte separation medium (Dingguo Biotechnology Co., Beijing, China) in a 1:1 ratio, centrifuged at 3,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 min and the supernatant was decanted. The PBMCs were washed with normal saline three times, and then resuspended in serum-free medium to modulate the cells. The suspension was divided into two parts in the ratio of 1:9. The cell density of the small part of the suspension was adjusted to 1&#x02013;2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>/ml. Then, the suspension was seeded in 6-well plates (2 ml/plate), adherently cultured for 2 h in an incubator and then the non-adherent cells were sucked out. Serum-free medium containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 800 U/ml; Dingguo Biotechnology Co.) and interleukin (IL)-4 (500 U/ml; Dingguo Biotechnology Co.) was added for culturing DCs, and replaced every 3 days. On day 7, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; (1,000 U/ml; Dingguo Biotechnology Co.) was added to promote maturation. The large part of the suspension was mixed with interferon (INF)-&#x003b3; (1,000 U/ml; Dingguo Biotechnology Co.) and used as CIK serum-free medium, in which IL-1&#x003b1; (100 U/ml), IL-2 (500 U/ml) and CD3 monoclonal mouse anti-human antibodies (Boster Biotechnology Co., Wuhan, China) were added from day 2, and replaced every 3 days. On day 8, the mature DCs were collected and divided into two portions. One portion of the DCs was washed with normal saline 3 times and then resuspended in 2 ml autologous plasma. This was then used for administration to patients by superficial lymph node or subcutaneous injection. The other portion of the DCs was mixed and co-cultured with CIK cells at a ratio of 1:10 for 7 days to construct the DC-CIK cell mixture. Starting from day 8, DC-CIK cells were reinfused to patients once a day for a total of four times and the total number of cells was 2&#x02013;3.5&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup>. Prior to reinfusion, all cells underwent bacterial, fungal and endotoxin detection tests and were found to be negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic methods</title><p>Patients in the control group were given conventional chemotherapy with cisplatin (20 mg per day; Haoshen Pharmaceutical Co., Nanjing, China). This involved dissolving 20 mg cisplatin in 250 ml normal saline, and then administered by intravenous drip within 2 h with the avoidance of light. One course of treatment lasted for 10 days. Patients in the experimental group underwent the collection of PMBCs 1 day prior to chemotherapy, which were used for co-culture to generate DC-CIK cells. From the second day, the experimental patients were given the same chemotherapy as that given to the patients in the control group. However, the experimental patients were also given a reinfusion of DC-CIK cells after the chemotherapy. Three months later, all patients from these two groups were given a second course of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation indices and judgment of curative effect</title><p>Prior to treatment and 2 weeks after treatment, 4 ml peripheral blood was collected from each patient of the two groups. The CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD56<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cell ratios in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry and the expression levels of perforin, granzyme B (GraB) and CD107a in the PBMCs were observed. The cumulative relapse rate, the cumulative survival rate and the median survival time of the patients were also analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

In the experimental group, the cumulative recurrence rates were 5% (2 cases), 15% (6 cases) and 22.5% (9 cases), respectively. The cumulative recurrence rates between the control and experimental groups were significantly different when compared by log-rank test (P&#x0003c;0.05). The cumulative 1-year, 2-year and 3-year survival rates in the control group were 92.31, 76.92 and 56.41%, respectively.

The incidence rate of this cancer is second only to that of breast cancer, but the mortality rate is the highest among the malignant gynecological tumors (<xref rid="b10-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the treatment of cervical cancer, the high recurrence rate following treatment is a major problem. Currently, platinum chemotherapy-based comprehensive treatment is the preferred method for treating recurrent cervical cancer, but the total efficiency is only 20&#x02013;30% (<xref rid="b11-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, since the tumor volume is relatively large in the advanced stages, patients are susceptible to immune suppression during the chemotherapy process (<xref rid="b12-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, a feasible and acceptable treatment strategy is urgently required for the clinical treatment of advanced cervical cancer. In recent years, numerous clinical data have shown that the immune function of patients with cervical cancer is suppressed significantly due to disorders of cellular immune function (<xref rid="b14-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This phenomenon is particularly common in patients with advanced cancer (<xref rid="b15-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Bio-immunotherapy has been widely applied to treat different types of tumors. Its effectiveness in killing and inhibiting tumors and advantage in improving the immune function of patients undergoing chemotherapy have been demonstrated by clinical researchers (<xref rid="b16-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Yang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b19-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) applied autologous CIK cell infusion combined with cisplatin therapy to treat 20 patients with advanced cervical cancer and observed the results after one month. The authors found that the TH1/TH2 immune index and the number of natural killer cells increased significantly following the combined treatment, compared with those following cisplatin chemotherapy alone. Their study demonstrated that combined treatment with CIK cells and chemotherapy was able to improve the immune function of patients with cervical cancer; however, follow-up results and the 3-year recurrence rate were lacking. Long-term follow-up of the effectiveness of CIK cell treatment combined with chemotherapy is necessary. Zhu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b20-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) applied a combined treatment comprising autoimmune cells and radiotherapy to treat cervical cancer. The results demonstrated that the immune function of the patients that received the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of the patients treated with radiotherapy alone. In addition, 5-year follow-up results showed that the quality of life in the majority of the patients that received the combined treatment was significantly improved, and the Karnofsky score and the overall 1-year, 2-year and 5-year survival rates of the patients treated with the combination therapy were significantly higher than those of the patients treated with radiotherapy alone. A study conducted by Zhu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b20-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) demonstrated that radiotherapy combined with immune cell therapy for the treatment of cervical carcinoma was able to enhance the immune function of patients and prolong their survival periods.</p><p>Laurin <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b21-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) observed that CIK cells expressed high levels of perforin and GraB, and so were able to induce tumor cell apoptosis through an extracellular apoptosis pathway. Hackstein and Thomson (<xref rid="b22-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) revealed that the cytotoxic activity of CIK cells was remarkably enhanced following co-culture with DCs and stimulation by DCs. It was demonstrated that co-cultures of DCs and CIK cells not only have non-MHC-restricted CIK cell cytotoxicity but also are able to stimulate the MHC-restricted cytotoxic effect mediated by antigen-loaded DC cells. Therefore, the specific killing effects were enhanced. In the present study, the effectiveness of a DC-CIK cell co-culture combined with cisplatin chemotherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer was observed, and it was found that the CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> cell levels in patients following treatment were significantly higher than those prior to treatment, but the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells significantly decreased following treatment (P&#x0003c;0.05), which corresponds well with the results of Yang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b23-etm-09-03-1063" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Moreover, in the present study, it was observed that the perforin, GraB and CD107a positive expression rates were significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), and the cumulative 1-year, 2-year and 3-year recurrence rates were significantly reduced in the combined treatment group compared with those in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirmed the effectiveness of biological immune treatment, particularly biological immune treatment combined with chemotherapy, in the treatment of tumors, and provides further evidence to support its clinical application in the treatment of cervical cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
