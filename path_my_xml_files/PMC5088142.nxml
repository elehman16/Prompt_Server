ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio in adults. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty-two healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to two equal groups
(experimental and control). Participants in the experimental group received a
Wiihabilitation training program for six weeks. Data were collected using a Biodex system
3 Isokinetic dynamometer. Peak torques of the dorsiflexors and plantar flexors were
measured at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec which in turn were used to derive the ankle
dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio. [Results] The mean values of the ankle
dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio decreased significantly between before and
after the training in the experimental group, meanwhile there was no significant
difference between before and after the training period in the control group .
[Conclusion] Wiihabilitation has an impact on the ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion
strength ratio, so it can be considered an effective training tool in terms of the ankle
strength ratio. Thus, it could be recommended for both prevention and rehabilitation of
ankle instability patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Wiihabilitation</kwd><kwd>Strength ratio</kwd><kwd>Ankle instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Wiihabilitation is a new idea that came about after introduction of Nintendo Wii Fit (Wii)
for rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Nintendo Wii is a
low-cost commercial gaming system that provides an attractive means of facilitating
exercise<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nintendo Wii Fit games encourage lower extremity movement,
challenge balance, and require the player to remain in a standing position during play.
These activities have the potential to address rehabilitation goals during patient
recovery<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Wii has been used across
a variety of clinical specialties and may potentially be a useful in the rehabilitation of a
wide variety of conditions. Virtual reality-based training is a feasible and suitable
therapeutic intervention for dynamic balance in older adults<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Nintendo Wii has been
used as a tool that provides a novel way to interact with games in order to promote physical
activities. It directs the user&#x02019;s motor response to be either specific or global to train
motor abilities such as the range of motion of different limbs and whole body balance
training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Addition of the Wii balance
training program to conventional exercise programs has been recommended to improve ankle
muscle strength in patients with functional ankle instability at a low cost<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported that virtual
reality programs improve the static balance and dynamic balance of subjects with functional
ankle instability and can be used safely and efficiently by patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The foot and ankle make up complex anatomical structures that contribute significantly to
the function of the whole lower limb<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Ankle joint stability involves co-contractions of surrounding muscles, recognized as
agonist/antagonist activity, to facilitate reciprocal planar motion and protects and ensures
efficient function of the joint<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exercises should be planned to maintain a balance between agonists and antagonists. Muscle
imbalance results in stresses on the underlying joints and ligaments<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The strength ratios between antagonistic muscle groups
have received considerable attention from clinicians during examinations and in monitoring
of rehabilitation progress<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, they
are thought to be clinically relevant because co-activation of opposing muscles across a
joint may be important in maintaining dynamic joint stability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The agonist/antagonist ratio was advocated to answer the dilemma
regarding a means of more objectively evaluating and comparing the muscle balance (or
imbalance) around a joint. Ratios for various muscle groups in both the upper and lower
extremities have been developed and have become an improved gold standard for
evaluation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Impaired foot function can give rise to many problems, such as strains on ligaments, poor
co-ordination, and impairment of the function of the muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Injuries to the ankle account for a large portion of the injuries
to the lower extremity. Sprained ankle is the most common injury. It has been reported that
approximately 80% of ankle sprains lead to injury recurrence and instability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ankle injury programs for prevention and
treatment have disadvantages relating to time and cost. Repeated episodes of ankle sprain
often occur despite introduction of many rehabilitation programs. Further research clearly
is needed in this area in terms of both treatment and suggestions to reduce the rate of
ankle sprains<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To the knowledge of the authors, there are no previous studies investigating the
effectiveness of Nintendo Wii Fit training on muscle strength ratios of ankle muscles.
Additionally, many studies have investigated the inversion/eversion ratio, but patients
still suffer from ankle instability. Furthermore, it has been reported that the concentric
dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio was affected in chronic ankle instability (CAI)
patients. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of Nintendo Wii Fit
training on the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio as a new concept in the field of
prevention and rehabilitation of ankle injuries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty- two healthy male college students from the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo

Participants in group I performed the Nintendo Wii Fit training program.
Participants in group II were instructed to avoid participation in any strength training
programs until after the post-training testing.</p><p>Participants were included in the study if they had good ankle muscle strength (grade
four), normal flexibility of the ankle muscles, and a normal foot posture index.
Participants were excluded if they had a history of previous ankle surgery or ankle injury,
had a history of vestibular disorder, had previously participated in a strengthening or
athletic training program, or had pronated or supinated foot postures. The foot posture
index total score reference values were as follows: normal = 0 to +5, pronated = +6 to +9,
highly pronated 10+, supinated = &#x02212;1 to &#x02212;4, and highly supinated &#x02212;5 to &#x02212;12.</p><p>The Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, approved this
study. All participants signed an informed consent form assuring that their participation
was voluntary. A brief orientation session about the protocol of the study, its aims, and
the tests to be performed was provided to each participant. The study complied with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental procedures were conducted
in the biomechanics laboratory of the faculty.</p><p>Nintendo Wii Fit includes over 40 games covering strength training, yoga, aerobics, and
balance. The Wii training program in this study included an initial balance game (Table Tilt
game) for 2/3 of session&#x02019;s total duration followed by a muscle strength game (Standing
Rowing Squat game) for 1/3 of the session&#x02019;s duration. The sessions lasted up to 30 minutes
and were performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The selected games target
agonist-antagonist muscle contraction specifically dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.</p><p>The Table Tilt game was designed as a multidirectional balance game. In this game the
participant tries to move a ball into a hole in a tilting platform. The platform tilted
according to weight redistribution on pressure sensors in a Wii balance board (WBB). This
game allowed motion in antroposterior and mediolateral directions around the ankle joint.
Furthermore, it trained the participant to control the position of the center of gravity
(COG) during rapid changes of body movement.</p><p>The Standing Rowing Squat game is a muscle conditioning game that requires the player to
perform squats by flexing the knees from a standing position until the flexed knee reach the
required level. The required level was determined by COG movement displayed on the screen as
a red dot that must be kept in a blue area in the final position of each squats. Performance
of rowing squats correctly was scored and indicated with audible feedback. Squats are a form
of closed chain exercise. They increase joint compressive forces leading to increased joint
stability, increased muscle co-activation, and decreased joint shear forces<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also dynamically recruit most of the
lower-body musculature, including the quadriceps femoris, hip extensors, hip adductors, hip
abductors, and triceps surae<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A Biodex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system 3 Isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY,
USA) was used for measuring the peak torques/body weight (Nm/kg) of the ankle dorsiflexors
and plantar flexors to calculate the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio. The test
procedure was performed according to manufacturer guidelines. Each participant was
instructed to perform 5 sets of ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion through a 60&#x000b0; range
of motion (ROM) (from 40&#x000b0; plantar flexion to 20&#x000b0; dorsiflexion) an angular velocity of
60&#x000b0;/sec. This is the best angular velocity for measuring muscle strength because it is easy,
safe, and a large number of motor units are recruited at low angular velocities<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The test procedures were performed twice,
once before and once after the Wii training program in the experimental group and at the
beginning of the study and then after 6 weeks in the control group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20 (IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 2 &#x000d7; 2 mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to
compare the isokinetic ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio between the
experimental and control groups before and after the training. Initially and prior to final
analysis, data were screened for normality assumption using Shapiro-Wilks normality test.
The alpha level of significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean values of the ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio decreased

and overall well-being. It has been adopted by a number of practitioners to assist in the
treatment of various impairments. However, much work remained to be done to identify which
type of participants would benefit from it, which system features are critical, and what
types of training routine levels would work best. In addition, there have been few studies
with randomized controlled designs that have investigated its effect on agonist/antagonistic
muscle ratios and how this kind of training should be carried out.</p><p>The results of the current study revealed a significant decrease in the ankle
dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio after the training compared with before the
training in the experimental group. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between
before and after the training period in the control group. This might indicate an effect
caused by the Wii training program as the control group did not receive training.</p><p>In the present study, the decreased strength ratio can be attributed more to the increased
peak torque of the plantar flexors than the dorsiflexors, as the mean &#x000b1;SD values for the
peak torque of the plantar flexors increased from 54.1 &#x000b1; 22.85 Nm/kg before the training to
96.1 &#x000b1; 30.83 Nm/kg after the training, an improvement of 42%. On the other hand, the mean &#x000b1;
SD values for peak toque of the dorsi flexors increased from 38.46 &#x000b1; 11.9 Nm/kg before the
training to 55.73 &#x000b1; 15.37 Nm/kg after the training, an improvement of 17.27%.</p><p>The abovementioned improvement was achieved through Wii training. This may be explained by
Wii training acting as a form of neuromuscular training with feedback. Neuromuscular
training is defined as a multi-intervention program with a combination of balance and
strength training<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It improves mechanical leg muscle strength due to training-induced
gains in neuromuscular function including strength gains<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The interaction of balance and strength interaction is essential to lower limb function.
Previous literature reported that lower extremity functional retraining depends not only on
lower-limb mobility and bilateral coordination, but also requires other motor skills, such
as balance control<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, adequate
strength is necessary for normal movement patterns<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, better controlled movement of joint results from
increased muscle strength<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this
reason, combined strength and balance training should be incorporated into lower limb
rehabilitation to augment the potential outcomes of training and rapid recovery. Wii
training provides this in the same session.</p><p>Moreover, the squat is considered one of the best exercises for improving quality of life
because of its ability to recruit multiple muscle groups in a single maneuver<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is estimated that over 200 muscles are
activated during squat performance<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
squat has biomechanical and neuromuscular similarities to a wide range of athletic movements
and thus is included as a core exercise in many sports routines which designed to enhance
athletic performance<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The feedback provided in Wii training is very important for user motivation and positive
reinforcement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This feedback in the
form of either knowledge concerning performance or knowledge concerning results, has been
found to enhance motor skill learning<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It also improves reeducation of patient motor control<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Motion about the ankle joint is controlled by combined actions of at least one pair of
opposing muscles (the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). Therefore, the calf muscles are
important in maintaining an erect posture and have a major role in controlling the ankle
joint, which is often one of the first joints to help the body restore its equilibrium after
perturbation<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pronator weakness, evertor weakness, and calf dysfunction are all terms used to describe
the cause of chronic ankle instability CAI<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. CAI patients have higher ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion
strength ratio) resulting from lower plantar flexors strength<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the same context, findings of the current study showed a
decreased ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion strength ratio. For this reason, CAI patients
may benefit from the Wii training principles, as the training program combines the benefits
of balance training, closed kinetic chain exercise, and feedback effects.</p><p>Neuromuscular training programs are implemented with the aim of optimizing performance,
preventing injury, or providing rehabilitation in functional ankle instability patients<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. McGuine and Keene<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> showed the effectiveness of neuromuscular training in
reducing sport-related injury risk. It has also been shown to enhance functional performance
after sports injury<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Any neuromuscular
training program should incorporates a variety of physical activities that supports
increasing strength and balance<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was limited to healthy male adults who had no ankle deficits, and it only lasted
for six weeks. The selected games for the training protocol were (Rowing Squats and Table
Tilt) activities from Nintendo Wii Fit.</p><p>Based on the findings of the current study, Wiihabilitation is recommended as a preventive
measure and treatment modality for ankle instability in sedentary individuals and athletes.
Thus, the field of physical therapy may improve the rehabilitation protocol for ankle
injuries by introducing Wiihabilitation as a novel method for rehabilitation.</p><p>Further studies should be carried with wider age categories, as this would be valuable for
determining the responses of different age categories to Wii training. Patients with chronic
ankle instability should be evaluated in future research. It is recommended to explore the
correlation between the effect of Wii training and the results of functional performance
tests. Additionally, extending the training period beyond two months may be advisable to
elicit more significant effects. Also, choosing different games may add new results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Efficacy of virtual reality-based therapy on balance in
