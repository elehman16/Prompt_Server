Hence forth, Sleep is one of the essential factors to lead a healthy life. It has been rightly stated by <italic>Acharya Charaka</italic> that happiness &#x00026; misery, proper &#x00026; improper growth, good strength &#x00026; weakness, potency &#x00026; sterility, knowledge &#x00026; ignorance and life &#x00026; death of an individual depend on proper and improper sleep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>.</p><p>Insomnia (inadequate quality and quantity of sleep) may be a symptom of stressful lifestyle, depressive illness, anxiety disorders, any psychiatric conditions or any other pathological conditions. Whatever may be the cause of insomnia it needs immediate attention in present day lifestyle. It is affecting nearly 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of population (especially youth) in western developed countries and the incidences are increasing day by day in the developing countries like India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh etc. If insomnia is left untreated, it may reduce mental capacity of an individual, reduce efficacy, increase the chances of various types of accident and ultimately it may drag the individual towards several severe psychosomatic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Need of the study</title><p>Present day modern medical doctors prescribe different types of tranquilizers for the management of insomnia. Even though initially the tranquilizers give considerable relief in insomnia but continuous and long term use may induce various toxic effects including drug dependency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. In such a scenario there is an immediate need for the efficient management of insomnia in a natural way with good counseling, usage of herbal medicines, following the proper life style and eradicating the problems from root itself. Need has always been felt to develop certain <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> treatment modalities for the management of <italic>Anidra</italic> (Insomnia) which could be safe, effective, readily available, cost effective without any side effects. In comparison to the therapeutic procedures of different systems of medicine, <italic>Ayurveda</italic> has a potent approach towards the treatment of <italic>Anidra</italic> by both internal and external medications. With these backgrounds an effort is made to evaluate the efficacy of a herbal compound drug and the administration of <italic>Shirodhara</italic> (pouring of the medicated liquid on the forehead) in a series of patients suffering from insomnia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims &#x00026; Objectives</title><p>The present research trial was undertaken with the following main objectives-</p><p>

This incidence shows that the complaints of insomnia rise as the age advances. In the trial urban people of middle class were found more affected and there was slight dominance of patients of male sex. It may be due to work stress and struggle for better life. The majority of patients registered were Hindu by religion and were on vegetarian diet.

Out of 30 registered cases 16 patients (53.33%) were having <italic>Vishamagni</italic> with <italic>Madhyama AAhara Shakti</italic> (70.00%).

</p><sec id="sec3-4"><title>1. According to modern physiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></title><p>Experimental studies have variously implicated the medullary reticular formation, the thalamus and the basal forebrain in the generation of sleep. While the brainstem reticular formation, the midbrain, the sub thalamus, the thalamus and the basal forebrain have all been suggested to play a role in the generation of wakefulness.</p><p>Current hypotheses suggest that the capacity for sleep and wakefulness generation is distributed along an axial &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; of neurons extending from the brainstem rostrally to the basal forebrain. Complex commingling of neuronal groups occurs at many points along this brainstem-forebrain axis. A cluster of g- aminobutyric acid (GABA) and galaninergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) hypothalamus is selectively activated coincident with sleep onset. These neurons project to and inhibit histaminergic cell groups in the tuberomammilary nucleus that are important to the ascending arousal system, suggesting that the hypothalamic VLPO neurons may play a key executive role in sleep regulation.</p><p>Pharmacologic studies of sleep and wakefulness suggest roles for other neurotransmitters as well. Pontine cholinergic neurotransmission is known to play a role in REM sleep generation. By this it can be said that the functions of the thalamus and the basal fore brain are diminished and the sleep promoting neurotransmitter serotonin is decreased. It is proved that the presence of catecholamines is responsible for the state of wakefulness.</p><p>In the conditions of Insomnia probably the functions of the structures like thalamus and fore brain might be diminished along with quantitative decrease in serotonin and increase in the quantity of catecholamines. Thus it results in to the state of insomnia.</p><p>In the procedure of <italic>Shirodhara</italic>, particular pressure and vibration is created over the forehead. The vibration is amplified by the hollow sinus present in the frontal bone. The vibration is then transmitted inwards through the fluid medium of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This vibration along with little temperature may activate the functions of thalamus and the basal fore brain which then brings the amount of serotonin and catecholamine to the normal stage inducing the sleep.</p><p>Again, it is explained in modern text books of physiology that pressure has an effect on impulse conduction through tactile and thermo receptors. If prolonged pressure is applied to a nerve, impulse conduction in interrupted and part of the body may go to rest. In <italic>Dhara</italic> therapy, prolonged and continuous pressure due to pouring of the medicated liquid may cause tranquility of mind and induce natural sleep.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>2. According to Ayurvedic Samprapti of Anidra</title><p><italic>Nidranasha</italic> is explained as <italic>Vata Nanatmaja Vikara</italic>, in <italic>Vata</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Pitta Dosha Vriddhi Lakshanas</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> and as <italic>Lakshanas</italic> of some other diseases.
