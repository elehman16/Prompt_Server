It affects 5-10% of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], predominantly women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and has been characterized as chronic in individuals with moderate-to-severe symptoms requiring treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The criteria that define RLS include an urge to move the legs due to unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations during periods of rest, the relief of symptoms through leg movements, and symptoms that follow a distinct circadian pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The onset of RLS symptoms typically begin in the late evening and may persist through the night time hours. Thus, the primary morbidity in RLS is sleep disruption, the major reason patients cite for consulting their physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Sleep-related problems, such as trouble initiating or maintaining sleep and experiencing disturbed, non-restful or non-refreshing sleep, are more prevalent in patients with RLS than in those without RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nearly 90% of patients with RLS experience at least 1 sleep-associated symptom and over 40% of patients identified sleep-associated issues as the most bothersome RLS-related symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nearly 70% of patients with twice weekly RLS symptoms needed more than 30 minutes to fall asleep and 60% had more than 3 awakenings per night. On average, patients with severe RLS symptoms sleep only 4 to 5 hours per night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Because of the subjective nature of RLS symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on sleep, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) play a prominent role as study endpoints in clinical trials investigating RLS treatments. However, for PROs to be credible, they must be subjected to a rigorous inspection of their measurement properties using measurement theory and standard psychometric assessments. While there were several pre-existing sleep instruments to choose from (i.e., MOS Sleep Questionnaire) most were limited in their use in RLS research because they were not disease specific, or were more difficult to administer within a clinical trial setting (i.e., clinician-administered). The hope was to be more responsive to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) recently emphasized expectations around patient reported outcome measures and the need to demonstrate the validity and reliability of such scales when used to measure endpoints in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) is a, 5-item PRO instrument designed to evaluate sleep disturbance in subjects with RLS. This study was a <italic>post-hoc </italic>evaluation of the validity of the PSQ, Version 2, using data from 2 well-controlled clinical trials in subjects with moderate-to-severe RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data source</title><p>This study used pooled data from two 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (XenoPort, Inc. protocols XP052 [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00298623] and XP053 [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00365352]) that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The co-primary endpoints for the 1200 mg and placebo groups in both studies were the reduction in total IRLS score from baseline to Week 12 on the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the proportion of responders rated by investigators as "very much improved" or "much improved" on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement [CGI-I] scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The secondary endpoints evaluated subject-rated improvements in sleep, mood, and quality of life.</p><p>The studies were of similar design. Subjects were randomly assigned for 12 weeks of treatment to GEn 1200 mg or matching placebo (XP052, XP053), with study XP053 also examining a third treatment group, GEn 600 mg, as a secondary endpoint compared with placebo. These studies demonstrated statistically significant efficacy with both GEn doses compared with placebo for reduction of RLS symptoms and improvements in sleep, mood, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Study methodologies have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Briefly, eligible subjects were &#x02265;18 years of age, diagnosed with primary RLS, having RLS symptoms &#x02265;15 nights of the month prior to study enrollement and for &#x02265;4 of 7 consecutive nights in the week prior to their baseline assessment, and had a total RLS severity score of &#x02265;15 (i.e., moderate-to-severe severity). If subjects were receiving RLS treatment at screening, then they must have had a symptom frequency of &#x02265;15 nights per month prior to treatment initiation. A 2-week washout period prior to the baseline assessments was required for dopamine agonists, gabapentin, opioids, and benzodiazepines.</p><p>Subjects with non-RLS-related sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea), a history of RLS symptom augmentation or early-morning rebound with previous dopamine-agonist treatment, neurological disease or movement disorders other than RLS (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dyskinesias, and dystonias), or other medical conditions that could confound study results were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>PSQ</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> displays the 5 items comprising the PSQ, the sleep domains corresponding to each question, the associated response categories, and the scoring for each. The PSQ was developed to evaluate sleep disturbance in subjects with primary RLS over the past weeks using 4 Likert-type scale questions and 1 quantitative, open-ended question. The PSQ assesses several single-item sleep domains, including overall sleep quality, overall daytime functioning, frequency of night time RLS symptoms, and RLS-related sleep disturbances and latency. Higher PSQ scores indicate worse sleep.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The 5-item PSQ with assessed domains, possible responses, and item scores</bold>.

Five of the instruments were previously validated and were used in the present study to validate the PSQ: 1) IRLS Rating Scale comprises 10 questions that assess symptom severity and frequency on a 40-point scale (0 = no symptom; 40 = very severe symptoms); subjects were also classified into RLS symptom severity categories using the IRLS total score (mild = 0-10, moderate = 11-20, severe = 21-30, and very severe &#x02265;31) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; 2) investigator- and subject-rated CGI-I, evaluates improvements in any disease on a 7-point scale (1 = "very much improved"; 7 = "very much worse") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; 3) Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a 30-item scale that assesses mood in 6 domains and 1 total overall mood score, with higher scores indicating a more negative mood state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; 4) Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Scale-Sleep assesses sleep constructs, including sleep initiation, maintenance, perceived adequacy, somnolence, respiratory impairments, and regularity in subjects with health comorbidities, such as RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; and 5) RLS Quality of Life Questionnaire (RLSQoL), a 100-point scale that assesses the direct impact of RLS on the daily life, emotional well-being, social life, and work-life of the subject, with lower scores indicating better quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The remaining 2 instruments were diaries that provided important subject response information: 1) the 24-hour RLS Record assesses the frequency of RLS symptoms in half-hour increments during a 24-hour period and 2) the 7-Day RLS Symptom Diary assesses the frequency of nightly symptoms over a 1-week period.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>Analyses were conducted on pooled data irrespective of treatment assignment, as baseline assessments were used to generate the psychometric indices.

Convergent validity is accepted when the correlation estimates are in the correct theoretical direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and are statistically significant. If correlation coefficients are statistically significant, Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] describes correlations of 0.1 as small, 0.3 as medium, and &#x02265;0.5 as large convergence. Convergent validity for the PSQ was determined by correlating the PSQ item scores with the total scores from the IRLS, RLSQoL, and POMS, and the 4 individual domain scores of the MOS-Sleep scale.</p><p>Individual PSQ item scores were also correlated with similar items from daily diaries that captured RLS-related symptoms and sleep: PSQ Item 3 (nights with RLS symptoms) score and nights with RLS symptoms score from the 7-Day RLS Symptom Diary, PSQ Item 4 (RLS-related sleep disturbance) with number of RLS-related awakenings score from the 24-Hour RLS Symptom Diary, and PSQ Item 5 (RLS-related sleep latency) with the RLS-related sleep latency score from the 24-Hour RLS Record.</p></sec><sec><title>Divergent validity</title><p>An instrument demonstrates divergent validity when it shows a lack of statistical association with other instruments or related variables (e.g., demographic characteristics) unrelated to the focus instrument. This study was limited in the choice of instruments to assess divergent validity because it utilized only the instruments included in the clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] that were used to measure the effects of RLS treatment. To demonstrate divergent validity of the PSQ, we assessed correlations between the baseline PSQ item scores and three demographic variables: ethnicity, race, and gender. Because there was no theoretical basis to expect a relationship between sleep problems and these demographic variables, a lack of correlation would demonstrate that subjects with different demographic characteristics do not interpret the PSQ items differently. Cramer's V statistic was used to assess their associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], because this involved correlating a nominally scaled variable (i.e., 0 = Male, 1 = Female) with continuous variables. Cramer's V estimates range from 0 to 1, with low scores indicating poor association and demonstrating divergent validity.</p></sec><sec><title>Known-group validity</title><p>Known-group validity, or predictive validity, is the ability of a scale or scale items to statistically discriminate respondents in ways expected (predicted) as a result of independent assessments. The known groups in the current study were based on RLS symptom severity, as determined by the IRLS total score. Sleep qualities measured by the PSQ are expected to be most pronounced for persons with severe symptoms. Baseline PSQ scores were compared across severity groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Responsiveness</title><p>Responsiveness means that the PSQ item scores will change in direction and magnitude with changes experienced by the responders. In this case, responsiveness was demonstrated if relationships between changes in the investigator- and subject-rated CGI-I assessments and changes in PSQ scores over time were in the same direction and statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Change from baseline in individual PSQ items were compared with subject symptom changes as measured by the CGI-I using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Among all subjects in the clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], only a few experienced worsening of symptoms over time; as a result, the responsiveness analysis was conducted by re-categorizing subjects reporting 'minimally worse', 'much worse' and 'very much worse' into 1 category of 'worse'. Guyatt's statistic, a measure of test-retest reliability or responsiveness to change, which is the ratio of the mean change for each category divided by the standard deviation for the no change group, was estimated. An instrument with an absolute value of &#x02265;0.20 for Guyatt's statistic has acceptable responsiveness and a value of &#x02265;1.00 is considered highly responsive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject characteristics</title><p>Of 544 total subjects, 540 and 451 completed the PSQ at Baseline and Week 12, respectively, and were included in the analysis.

The parent studies indicated that the PSQ scores showed improved sleep in subjects with RLS symptoms who received active RLS treatment compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>To verify the validity of the PSQ, several measurement properties were evaluated. The PSQ's convergent validity was estimated using correlations between the overall RLS symptom impact score, as assessed with the IRLS, and the individual PSQ items. These correlation estimates were all statistically significant and positive (i.e., worse symptom impact with worse sleep status). All PSQ items scores had moderate convergence with overall RLS symptom impact, except for the PSQ item "nights with RLS symptoms", which had a lower convergence.</p><p>Convergent validity was also assessed using the MOS Sleep Scale. Nearly half of the correlations with the MOS-Sleep Scale sleep domains showed moderate to moderately high convergence. Two PSQ items, <italic>nights with RLS symptoms </italic>and <italic>RLS-related sleep latency</italic>, showed little convergence with the MOS daytime somnolence domain. The PSQ sleep quality domain had sufficient convergence with the MOS sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy and sleep quantity domains. The PSQ daytime functioning item had sufficient convergence with all the MOS domains. The PSQ item, RLS-related sleep latency, had sufficient convergence with MOS sleep domains, except daytime somnolence. Taken together, these data suggest that the PSQ items had adequate convergence with the most pertinent MOS sleep domains.</p><p>Validity can also be shown via divergence with scales intended to measure other concepts. We found no strong associations across the 3 demographic variables of race, ethnicity and gender with the PSQ items. While demographics are not traditionally used for assessing divergent validity, we were limited to using the data collected in the trials. Given that, these findings clearly and robustly demonstrate that the PSQ results do not include systematic measurement errors that could be associated with personal attributes.</p><p>The PSQ results showed a consistent and robust ability to discriminate between RLS severity groups in a known-group validity analysis. All estimates were linear across the severity groups with increasingly worse sleep outcomes found in progressively worse symptom groups.</p><p>The PSQ was found to provide reliable results; for example, the PSQ was responsive to treatment differences over 12 weeks, and the findings were consistent regardless of whether the investigator or the subject rated the improvement, as indicated by the clinician and the patient rated CGI-Is. Further, the changes were seen regardless of treatment assignment, indicating that the PSQ is sensitive to small clinical changes over the course of treatment. Guyatt's statistic, an indication of responsiveness to change, was acceptably strong in all responder categories that indicated change and comparatively weaker in groups that indicated no change or worse change.</p><p>The <italic>post hoc </italic>nature of this study posed some challenges. Analyses were confined to the instruments collected as part of the clinical trials and were not included for the purposes of conducting a validation study. Thus, some aspects of the instruments used to validate the PSQ may not have been ideal. For example, items on some instruments are not directly related to sleep or are confounded by sleep. Finally, the recall periods varied among the instruments and some instruments were not specifically designed for RLS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PSQ demonstrated acceptable measurement properties of convergent validity, divergent validity, and known-group validity. PSQ scores were also reliable in terms of being responsive to change in symptoms. The PSQ is, therefore, a psychometrically valid instrument for assessing sleep among RLS subjects in clinical trial settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p><bold>DMC </bold>is an employee of XenoPort, Inc. where the RLS clinical studies were designed and conducted. <bold>AJB </bold>worked on this project as a graduate intern from West Virginia University at GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC. <bold>MFB </bold>was a full-time employee of Quintiles, Inc., (the company that GlaxoSmithKline sponsored to conduct the psychometric research) at the time this study was conducted. <bold>MOC </bold>is a full-time employee of GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All the authors contributed to the manuscript and have read and approved the final version.</p><p>DMC: project management, study design, execution, medical monitoring, analysis, and primary author.
