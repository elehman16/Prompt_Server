Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Patients admitted to the Department ofCardiovascular Surgery of our tertiary centre between June 2006 and February 2007 who had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had undergone CABG surgery constituted the study group.</p><p>Patients were divided into two groups with block randomisation, using the sealed envelope technique: group T (telmisartan group) consisted of patients who received the angiotensin receptor blocking agent, telmisartan (Micardis&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim, Istanbul, Turkey) 80 mg daily for at least six months in the pre-operative period; group N-T (non-telmisartan group) consisted of patients who received neither telmisartan nor any other angiotensin receptor blockers. In both groups, no patients were using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least six months prior to the study.</p><p>Cases with severely impaired left ventricular function, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, severe systemic non-cardiac disease, severe renal or liver impairment, infectious diseases before surgery, malignancy, those receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatment, and patients with stroke, inflammatory disease, and/or previous cardiac surgery, and valvular heart disease were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Surgical technique and postoperative care</title><p>Cardiac medication, including beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents and nitrates, was continued until the morning of surgery. The same general anaesthetic drugs were used in all patients. A standard median sternotomy incision was used to expose the heart and place the internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts used for coronary anastomosis.</p><p>In each group, routine surgery was performed using a membrane oxygenator (Edwards Vital, Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA), a 3-mg/kg dose of sodium heparin, 2 000 ml of Ringer&#x02019;s lactate primer and a roller pump at a body temperature of 28&#x000b0;C. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted via the ascending aorta and single two-stage venous cannulation (maintained at 2.2&#x02013;2.4 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Following cross-clamping of the aorta, the heart was arrested using 10&#x02013;15 cm<sup>3</sup>/kg cold blood cardioplegia through the aortic root and topical ice slush was continued every 20 minutes for myocardial protection. Heparin was neutralised with protamine hydrochloride (Protamin 1000; Roche, Istanbul, Turkey). The circuit was primed with 2 000 ml Ringer&#x02019;s lactate.</p><p>After completion of the surgery, patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where standard care and processes were followed until discharge. Patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation when they were haemodynamically stable, responding to verbal stimulation, and had been fully rewarmed. Patients were discharged from the ICU if they were haemodynamically stable, had normal blood gasses during spontaneous breathing, and had a satisfactory renal function.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Outcome parameters and other variables</title><p>Smoking, obesity, hypertension, duration of diabetes, family history of coronary artery disease, pre-operative myocardial infarction, and pre-operative haemodynamic data were recorded. During the surgical procedure, haemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, arterial blood gasses and urine output were monitored. In the postoperative period in the ICU, cardiovascular and respiratory values and temperature were recorded every 15 minutes before extubation and then hourly until discharge from the ICU. The length of stay in the ICU was also recorded.</p><p>Microalbuminuria levels were studied pre-operatively, on the first hour postoperatively, and on postoperative days (POD) one and five. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were studied pre-operatively, and on POD 1 and 5. Patients who were considered to be in a low-cardiac output state received positive inotropic agents (dopamine or adrenaline or both). They were assessed for persistent systemic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, urinary output lower than 20 cm<sup>3</sup>/h, and the state of peripheral circulation was evaluated for adequate preload and optimal afterload. Urine samples were measured for microalbuminuria using Micral test sticks (Roche).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Categorical variables were analysed with chi-squared and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests, as appropriate, in contingency tables, whereas the unpaired t-test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test were performed, as appropriate, for comparison of continuous variables. Comparisons for microalbuminuria and hsCRP levels in the groups were done with repeated measures of ANOVA and the Bonferroni test.</p><p>Data are expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 10.0 for Windows, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The calculation of sample size was based on a power analysis. At a power of 80% using a significance level of p &#x0003c; 0.05, the sample size required was 20 subjects per study group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s5"><title>Results</title><p>Forty patients met the eligibility criteria for the study.

The predictive value of microalbuminuria for the expression of cardiovascular diseases has also been investigated and, in fact, is as powerful for predicting hyperlipidaemia or hypertension.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Microalbuminuria also occurs in acute conditions where capillary permeability increases.</p><p>Microalbuminuria increases during major surgery such as CABG, and extracorporeal circulation activates an inflammatory cascade, which may increase capillary permeability and cause microalbuminuria. The increase in capillary permeability may induce exudation of proteins from the lung capillaries into the capillary&#x02013;alveolar interspace and alveoli, causing the so-called post-perfusion lung, which resembles pulmonary oedema.</p><p>We found that telmisartan, as an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, had a significant lessening effect on microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery in our study. A significant decrease in hsCRP levels on day 5 was also noticed between the groups.</p><p>Several previous studies have shown that angiotensin receptor antagonists are effective anti-inflammatory agents, and our patients receiving telmisartan revealed decreased levels of systemic inflammation after CABG. This anti-inflammatory effect of telmisartan may help preserve postoperative renal function and also vascular endothelial function, which may also be seen after bypass surgery.</p><p>We know that renal dysfunction is a serious complication of coronary revascularisation with CABG and results in increased morbidity and mortality rates and prolonged hospital stay.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The injurious action of CABG on renal function is caused by several mechanisms, including non-pulsatile perfusion and increased levels of circulating catecholamines, cytokines and free haemoglobin.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These effects result in damage to the glomerular as well as tubular structures, which, in turn, may cause renal dysfunction, especially in the presence of additional risk factors.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Microalbuminuria is one of the sensitive markers of increased capillary permeability and may be useful to study the systemic inflammatory response after CABG.<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> According to previous investigations, urinary microalbuminuria increased significantly in the early postoperative period and one day after CABG.</p><p>In our study, peak increase in microalbuminuria was observed in both groups but there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.071). These levels decreased, particularly on the fifth day in our cases, and the decrease was statistically significantly different in group T. In both groups, hsCRP increased and peaked on the first postoperative day in both groups. However, in group T, hsCRP, as one of the pro-inflammatory agents, decreased significantly on the fifth day. Therefore, the increase in acute inflammatory response was similar in both groups on the first postoperative day, and in group T, both markers had decreased by the fifth day.</p><p>Borch-Johnsen et al. showed the direct relationship between proteinuria and cardiovascular mortality rate in insulindependent diabetic patients after open-heart surgery in patients undergoing CABG.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Telmisartan was also shown to reduce or normalise microalbuminuria in 34% of patients with diabetes, and in a second, smaller study including 64 hypertensive and 60 normotensive patients, to reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction. This confirmed that telmisartan reduced microalbuminuria independently of its blood pressure-lowering effects. Restoration of normal urine albumin levels has also been demonstrated by telmisartan.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Our study showed that telmisartan reduced microalbuminuria, not only pre-operatively, but also after open-heart surgery. The return to baseline levels was also faster than in group N-T. Angiotensin receptor blocking agents decrease some of the postoperative acute inflammatory agents in on-pump CABG patients with diabetes mellitus by lessening the systemic consequences of renal dysfunction, and may have additional cardiovascular effects by exerting beneficial effects on endothelial tissue elsewhere in the body and within the heart in this patients group. The cardiovascular benefits of angiotensin receptor antagonists have been evaluated, not only in terms of their ability to lower blood pressure, but also on their ability to prevent strokes, cardiac events and target-organ damage.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Limitations of our study are the relatively small size of our series and the lack of definite criteria for selection of patients for this study. As most coronary patients are already being treated with angiotensin receptor blocking agents, the results of our study will not have a major impact on clinical practice. Furthermore, it would have been better to test the predictivevalue of microalbuminuria on prognosis in this category of patients. However, we hope that this study will pioneer further studies on this method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showed that telmisartan decreased systemic inflammation and urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients after CABG surgery, compared to those not taking angiotensin receptor antagonists. These beneficial effects of telmisartan treatment on diabetic patients after CABG should be investigated further in prospective, randomised studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Stehouwer</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Smulders</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name><article-title>Microalbuminuria and risk for cardiovascular disease: analysis of potential mechanisms.</article-title><source>J Am Soc Nephrol</source><year>2006</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>2106</fpage><lpage>2111</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16825333</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hillege</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name><name><surname>Fidler</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Diercks</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gilst</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>de Zeeuw</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>van Veldhuisen</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal><article-title>Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease (PREVEND) Study Group.
