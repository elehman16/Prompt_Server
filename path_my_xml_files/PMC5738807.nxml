However, methodological limitations are observed and only a few studies have university students as the target. The university entrance period has been related to negative changes in eating habits among young people and it represents an important period for developing interventions for health promotion. This study describes the study protocol and the evaluation framework for the Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen program. This program aims to develop cooking skills in university students, and is based on the Cooking with a Chef program in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This ongoing, randomized controlled intervention was designed with a six month follow-up study. The intervention consisted of three-hour weekly classes during a six week period with printed materials provided. Five of the classes were hands-on cooking and one was a tour to a popular food market. There were eight primary outcome measures: changes in relation to i) accessibility and availability of fruits and vegetables; ii) cooking attitudes; iii) cooking behaviors at home; iv) cooking behaviors away from home; v) produce consumption self-efficacy; vi) self-efficacy for using basic cooking techniques; vii) self-efficacy for using fruits, vegetables, and seasonings (while cooking); and viii) knowledge of cooking terms and techniques. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index and in personal characteristics related to cooking. Repeated measures were collected through the application of an online self-completed survey, at baseline, after intervention and six months after intervention. A sample of 80 university students (40: intervention group; 40: control group) was estimated to detect a mean change of 1.5 points in cooking knowledge, with study power of 80%, and 95% level of confidence, plus 20% for random losses and 10% for confounding factors. The control group participants have continued with their usual activities. Data analyses will evaluate the intervention effect on changes in outcomes within and between groups, as well as explore relations with personal characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This method provides new evidence about whether or not a culinary intervention targeting university students has an impact on the improvement of cooking skills and healthy eating practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry - RBR-8nwxh5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8nwxh5/">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8nwxh5/</ext-link>)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>University students</kwd><kwd>Cooking classes</kwd><kwd>Cooking intervention</kwd><kwd>Culinary skills</kwd><kwd>Real setting</kwd><kwd>Cooking behavior</kwd><kwd>Healthy feeding practices</kwd><kwd>Sustained impact</kwd><kwd>Methodology</kwd><kwd>Study protocol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Capes Foundation, Ministry of Education, Brasilia-DF, Brazil</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par19">Studies have demonstrated that, when entering the university some students present with inadequate food habits. These habits are characterized by the increased consumption of snacks, fast food, French fries, sweets, cakes and pies, soft drinks, and the reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, the first years at the university are associated with weight gain and increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, also related to the potential increased risk of chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there is contrasting literature that suggests weight gain may be related to other factors such as socioeconomic status and social responsibilities, rather than university attendance. It is noted that college students and non-college individuals gain similar amounts of weight at comparable ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">University students have related some barriers that inhibit their adoption of healthier food habits, such as lack of time, money and knowledge about cooking skills and how to prepare their own food; lack of space and kitchen utensils and equipment; living away from parents home; and availability and access to unhealthy and convenience foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Studies have discussed that changes in how to prepare and cook foods can influence individuals&#x02019; cooking skills and may be related to the transfer of cooking knowledge between parents and their children as well as within the school setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such changes may be also related to the possible restructuring in the mode of preparing food at home, making use of technology (such as the microwave oven) and of ready-to-eat food products to facilitate meal the preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These social trends in time use, transfer of cooking skills and food purchasing can influence the time one spends in the kitchen. Lyon et al. (2011) analyzed food practices by younger and older women in Scotland and identified that differences in these practices are related to current lifestyle factors. Thus, in this study, women had different levels of cooking knowledge, but they shared similarities in food practices in the kitchen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the same time, there has been an increase of studies in the scientific literature about cooking skills as related to healthier eating habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In this respect, studies have reinforced the importance of encouraging intervention programs that aim to develop cooking skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], by means of changes in cooking knowledge, attitude, and behavior related to healthier eating habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Reicks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] added the topic of the health impact of home cooking on adults to the literature. The main outcomes measured were dietary intake, knowledge or skills, cooking attitudes and self-efficacy, and health outcomes. Among the studies in this review set, only half had a control group and the follow-up period varied from one to forty-eight months. In this context, the authors highlight the broad methodological variability of studies, including the lack of methodological rigor, as well as the use of non-validated instruments to evaluate cooking interventions. Therefore, the authors reinforce the need to evaluate such interventions in the long term, so that there may be consistent evidence to relate cooking skills with outcomes in nutrition and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">In relation to cooking interventions involving university students, four studies were found in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], albeit only one of them used a validated instrument for this target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This instrument was developed in the United States (U.S.) at Clemson University, and consists of the measurement of cooking skills related to health and nutrition to evaluate the intervention program Cooking with a Chef (CWC).</p><p id="Par25">It is relevant to note that interventions using a validated instrument with a focus on cooking skills that evaluate the sustained impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] on the participants&#x02019; eating practices have not yet been found in Brazil. In addition, the current food guide for the Brazilian population highlights, in one of the guidelines, the importance of developing, practicing, and sharing cooking skills as well as valuing the art of preparing and cooking food for the promotion of healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Thus, the literature converges to emphasize the importance of implementing cooking interventions with university students that aim at evaluating the sustained effect on the development of healthier eating practices. For this purpose, we stress the need for adapting the existing CWC intervention program and its evaluation instrument for the culture of the place where it is intended to be used. The purpose of this methods paper is to describe the study protocol and the evaluation framework of the intervention program Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen (NCK), designed for Brazilian students, based on the U.S. program CWC.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nutrition and culinary in the kitchen program, Brazil</title><p id="Par27">The NCK program was designed based on the U.S. CWC program, that, in turn, was extensively applied with different target populations in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives of the NCK program, Brazil</title><p id="Par37">The Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen (NCK) program was developed to transfer knowledge about nutrition science and culinary techniques. The program allows for participants to practice cooking skills so that they are able to feel comfortable and confident enough to prepare healthier food and to make nutritious ingredient choices. The program promotes healthier food habits by means of hands-on cooking classes based on the food groups, menu planning, basic cooking techniques, tips for optimizing productivity in the kitchen, as well as skills to prepare meals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Theoretical perspectives</title><p id="Par38">Intervention studies that aim to promote healthy eating habits should have a solid theoretical foundation designed for enhancing knowledge and positively influencing health behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The CWC and NCK programs were based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) proposed by Bandura. The SCT model involves interpersonal and environmental influencing factors as related to behavior. SCT helps to focus on the analysis of reciprocal interactions among people and environment as related to behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Self-efficacy is a central construct in SCT used to determine change in behavior. It refers to the confidence to overcome obstacles and successfully achieve a particular behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Culinary skill self-efficacy that are measurable may be effective at identifying positive changes in such behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. It is necessary, however to offer opportunities to practice such learned behavior as well as to provide for positive reinforcement in order for learning to take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Practice is important to encourage confidence once participants prepare part of a meal for the group using information and skills learned during the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As identified within SCT, behavior can be changed through new learning experiences, guidance in the adjustment of perceptions, and through support for the development of capacities. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Within NCK classes, participants cooking behaviors are practiced such as: knife skills of slicing, dicing and cutting, basic cooking techniques (i.e. roasting, saut&#x000e9;ing, and pressure cooking), food preservation techniques (i.e. blanching), and nutrition labeling analysis to facilitate healthy food choices. Also, in the NCK program, positive reinforcement takes place during the hands-on cooking classes by means of verbal comments made by the dietitian that conducts the program throughout the planning and execution phases of food preparations. In addition, at the end of each class, the moment called &#x0201c;Seasoning ideas&#x0201d; takes place, during which there is a discussion about the themes and key points covered in the class. These discussions employ a structured script with questions. The objective is to encourage the exchange of positive experiences of that particular class in relation to cooking and nutrition among the participants.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par40">This study used a randomized controlled trial design with six months of follow-up (with repeated measures) to test a community-based cooking skills program to improve cooking and healthy eating behaviors in university students.

The control group (CG) comprised participants from the wait-list group who were waiting for 12&#x000a0;months to participate in the study as they continued with their usual practices. Data from this group was analyzed at the same three-time points before they began participation in the program and subsequent comparison with the IG data. After that, the CG will be invited to take part of the NCK program in order to be able to receive the program benefits.

Three hour classes for these six sessions provide a total of 18&#x000a0;h of intervention. The classes took place in the food laboratory, which resembled a home kitchen with utensils and home style equipment. This setting provided ease of access for students to work rather than them using an industrial kitchen laboratory lay out. Each hands-on cooking class presented specific objectives, and in the course of each class, the topics learned in previous classes were reinforced by means of practice in the kitchen. All cooking classes were characterized as hands-on and included different demonstrations of ingredients and cooking techniques; discussions about nutrition; preparation of recipes by the participants; as well as eating the meal and discussion at the end of each class session. Each class was conducted with a group of 10 to 12 students, divided into groups of two to three students per workbench, enabling all students to practice what was demonstrated in the class. The selection and purchase workshop involved different dynamics. Students were taken to a popular food market where fresh and raw food products were available for purchase, as well as fruits, vegetables, fish, meats and breads. This range of products and local foods was estimated to be at affordable prices for most students.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Development and adaptation of recipes to the NCK program, Brazil</title><p id="Par48">Taking into consideration the guiding principles for the adaptation of the CWC program for Brazil, recipes of the NCK program were developed and included. To reach such a goal, the following aspects were considered: (1) number of hands-on cooking classes to be administered; (2) number of recipes to be worked within each class; (4) target population; (5) average time to prepare recipes, to provide greater flexibility for culinary preparation; (6) utensils and ingredients to prepare the recipes; (7) average cost of each culinary preparation; (8) culinary techniques to be taught in each class; and (9) criteria to consider the recipe as healthy.</p><p id="Par49">The criteria to consider a recipe as healthy were based on national and international public policies in the context of healthy eating, such as: (1) preference for food in its natural form (fresh) and minimally processed foods; (2) limited use of salt and sugar; (3) use of herbs and spices; (4) use of preparation techniques that are considered healthier (e.g.: baking, roasting, saut&#x000e9;ing, pressure cooking); (5) use of vegetables respecting seasonality; and (6) elimination of ultra-processed foods as well as of products with trans fatty acids ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Because NCK recipes were used by university students, additionally preparation time, level of difficulty and the cost of ingredients were considered. These criteria have been cited by this population as possible barriers for preparing meals at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Each of the recipes was cooked from scratch, including preparations based on fruits and vegetables within each of the cooking classes. Most of the ingredients were in their natural (fresh) form or in minimally processed foods. In addition, the feasibility of employing the recipes from the CWC program was verified using the decision tree model. All the recipes were tested and evaluated using a standardized form.

They received a theoretical-practical training of 3.5&#x000a0;h that included an explanation on the presentation of each hands-on cooking class, as well as a guided tour to the lab kitchen where the classes would take place. In each hands-on cooking class, there were from four to five facilitators and a coordinating teacher for each group of 10 to 12 students. The coordinating teacher had an undergraduate degree in Nutrition and practical experience in culinary. Though there are a large number of facilitators to assist in the hands-on cooking classes, given guidance from SCT this level of guidance (social support) was considered to be important.

The randomized controlled methodological design with a follow-up after intervention will allow the researchers to analyze the sustained effect of the program on the eating practices of the chosen population. In addition, the methodological design described in this paper will permit the comparison of results with other culinary intervention programs conducted with similar populations. Since it is the first culinary intervention study conducted in Brazil that is controlled and randomized, as well as the first sustained impact study with university students at an international level, the study may contribute to the generation of scientific knowledge to develop public policies that aim at promoting healthy eating by means of the practice of cooking skills with this population.</p><p id="Par64">This paper also provides practical information about the design and presentation of community-based interventions, including clear details about the program and the recruitment of the intervention and control groups. The use of recipes that were developed, adapted and tested for the objectives of the NCK program and to the target population of this study may contribute to the retention of participants in the program, as well as to the development of cooking skills and healthier eating habits.</p><p id="Par65">The present study also presents some limitations. The population of the study belongs to only one public university, a fact that does not allow for the generalization of results. However, the chosen university has more than 30,000 enrolled students in undergraduate courses. Students come from several regions of Brazil and South American countries, which may contribute an increased diversity within the study sample. The inclusion of students from the same university cannot guarantee that the control group will not be influenced by the intervention group. When the control group waits until the study concludes to receive the intervention it can present limitations. During the waiting period, they may have experiences that may impact study outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Nevertheless, randomization procedures within the study groups remain the only method that could eliminate possible selection and confounding biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The chosen university has faculty, employee, and student population of 50,000 who circulate every day on campus. Thus, the likelihood of students meeting and influencing counterparts on culinary skills may be diminished. As such this factor presents a limitation on community-based intervention studies in general.</p><p id="Par66">Additionally, the online survey was composed of questions that were answered by the participants themselves, which may allow for some information bias. For the BMI classification, data about weight and height provided by the participants themselves were used, which likewise may allow bias in regards to underestimation of weight or overestimation of height. Such bias may occur with overweight participants who tend to underestimate their weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. However, self-reported measures of weight and height have been considered valid in epidemiologic studies and may be used to improve accuracy of the collected data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Given that the study involves a six month follow-up, it is prone to have subject losses during the follow-up period. However, contact with participants will be kept through cell phone electronic messages to remind and reinforce participant attendance at follow-up encounters. Thus, attrition will be recorded in order to verify whether there are differences among students that remained in the program.</p><p id="Par68">One of the strengths of the present study is conducting the intervention by means of a hands-on cooking class series, as opposed to providing a series of cooking demonstration classes. While there is a high staff ratio to assist the participants, the study team assumed that this approach is important for the development of hands-on cooking skills. As a strategy for future program implementation the team would consider a train the trainer model with supervision for interested students. By expanding the trainer pool at a university or like setting the replicability of hands-on cooking classes may be manageable. Studies have suggested that changes in behaviors, attitudes and knowledge about cooking are more substantial among those who have had hands-on cooking classes when compared to those who only participated in expository lectures or classes with a specific interface, as a television [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">NCK class encounters take place in a real home kitchen type setting. Thus, these characteristics may allow for the application of the program in other university types of environments. The instrument employed in the original CWC program was validated for the population of the study that, in turn, was culturally adapted and validated for Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Taking into consideration that few culinary intervention studies use validated and/or adapted instruments with the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the design of the present study follows methodological rigor.</p><p id="Par70">Furthermore, this study made use of an instrument that was developed specifically for the intervention program. This instrumentation included components to evaluate healthy eating and the cooking practices that were practiced during the hands-on cooking classes, such as, the blanching technique.</p><p id="Par71">It is well known that sustained impact studies of culinary intervention with adults are scarce in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The results of this study, which uses a randomized, control design and with a six month follow-up culinary intervention model will allow high quality evidence to evaluate the impact of the NCK program, based on the CWC program, on participants&#x02019; eating habits and cooking behavior. This is the beginning of a program that aims at reaching the entire university community. It is the first cooking skills intervention study devoted to the university community in Brazil. The program may also contribute to the scarce evidence in the literature about the effectiveness of culinary intervention studies with a follow-up period in adults.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AAFV</term><def><p id="Par5">Accessibility and Availability of Fruits and Vegetables Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par6">body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CA</term><def><p id="Par7">Cooking Attitude</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBAH</term><def><p id="Par8">Cooking Behavior away from home</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBH</term><def><p id="Par9">Cooking Behavior at home</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Knowledge of Cooking Terms and Techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p id="Par11">Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CWC</term><def><p id="Par12">Cooking with a Chef</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IG</term><def><p id="Par13">Intervention group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCK</term><def><p id="Par14">Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p id="Par15">Social Cognitive Theory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SECT</term><def><p id="Par16">Self-Efficacy for Using Basic Cooking Techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEPC</term><def><p id="Par17">Produce Consumption Self-Efficacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEVS</term><def><p id="Par18">Self-Efficacy for Using Fruits, Vegetables, and Seasonings (while cooking)</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the staff of the NCK Program for their contributions to support the cooking classes as well as the Federal University of Santa Catarina students for their participation in the NCK Program.
