The 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonist revexepride (SSP-002358) is a novel prokinetic that stimulates gastrointestinal motility, which has been suggested as a continued cause of symptoms in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess whether revexepride pharmacokinetics were affected by co-administration of omeprazole, in preparation for a proof-of-concept evaluation of revexepride added to proton pump inhibitor treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase 1, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study, healthy adults aged 18&#x02013;55 years were given a single dose of revexepride 1 mg or revexepride 1 mg + omeprazole 40 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed for up to 48 hours after administration of the investigational product. Adverse events, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters, electrocardiograms, and vital signs were monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 42 participants were enrolled and 40 completed the study. The median age was 24 years (18&#x02013;54 years), 55% were women and 93% were white. The pharmacokinetic parameters of revexepride were similar without or with omeprazole co-administration. The mean area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) was 23.3 ng &#x000b7; h/mL (standard deviation [SD]: 6.33 ng &#x000b7; h/mL) versus 24.6 ng &#x000b7; h/mL (SD: 6.31 ng &#x000b7; h/mL), and maximum plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) were 3.89 ng/mL (SD: 1.30 ng/mL) and 4.12 ng/mL (SD: 1.29 ng/mL) in participants without and with omeprazole, respectively. For AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of geometric least-squares means (with:without omeprazole) were fully contained within the pre-defined equivalence limits of 0.80&#x02013;1.25. Mean apparent terminal phase half-life was 9.95 hours (SD: 2.06 hours) without omeprazole, and 11.0 hours (SD: 3.25 hours) with omeprazole.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Co-administration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 agonist revexepride with omeprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of revexepride in healthy adults.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>revexepride</kwd><kwd>omeprazole</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>gastroesophageal reflux disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition characterized by the symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation, which are caused by gastroesophageal reflux.<xref rid="b1-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It has been reported to affect 17%&#x02013;28% of patients in primary care<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and is associated with lower health-related quality of life than that found in the general population.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Treatments for GERD include over-the-counter antacids, as well as prescription drugs that reduce gastric acid secretion.

The chemical structure of the compound is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-9-1257">Figure 1</xref>. It is a highly potent and specific 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist, which enhances the physiological release of acetylcholine at the myenteric plexus.</p><p>As a potential therapy for GERD, revexepride would be used in combination with or directly following treatment with PPIs, which have a lasting inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion.<xref rid="b7-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Changes in gastric pH affect the absorption of some drugs. Revexepride has high solubility across the gastric pH range, so an effect on its pharmacokinetics due to a change in gastric pH is unlikely. There is, however, potential for a drug&#x02013;drug interaction (DDI) between revexepride and PPIs through the enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5. An in vitro study demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 is involved in the metabolism of revexepride and the formation of the associated normetabolite (Supplementary material), and CYP3A4 is also involved in the metabolism of PPIs.<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, when ketoconazole, a known CYP3A4 inhibitor, was co-administered with revexepride, there was a two to three fold increase in the systemic exposure to revexepride-base (Supplementary material).</p><p>To evaluate a potential DDI between revexepride and PPIs, the pharmacokinetics of revexepride were compared in the presence or absence of omeprazole, a commonly used PPI that has been shown to be metabolized by CYP3A4.<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The study did not aim to address the impact of revexepride on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole. Revexepride was not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administered omeprazole, because an in vitro study had previously demonstrated that revexepride had minimal effects on the activities of the major CYP groups (Supplementary material). Moreover, the typical dose of omeprazole in clinical practice (40 mg once daily) is at least 20 fold higher than the proposed doses of revexepride in the present proof-of-concept study (&#x02264;2 mg).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to examine the effect of co-administration of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of revexepride.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 to receive one of two treatment sequences, A followed by B or B followed by A, in which the treatments were: A) a single oral dose of revexepride 1 mg (expressed as base-equivalents); B) a single oral dose of revexepride 1 mg + a single oral dose of omeprazole 40 mg. The alternative treatment was administered on Day 1 of Treatment Period 2 following a 4 day washout period and overnight fasting. Participants received a follow-up telephone call 7 days after the last dose of investigational product. A 1 mg dose was used because it was in the potential clinical range and would allow a multifold increase in revexepride plasma concentrations without compromising safety and tolerability.</p><p>Clinical data collection and safety analyses were carried out at PRA International, Zuidlaren, the Netherlands, and PRA International, Raleigh, NC, USA, respectively.

Plasma revexepride-base concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, which was linear over the range 2.08&#x02013;1,040 pg/mL, with a lower limit of quantification of 2.08 pg/mL.

Mean estimates of accuracy ranged from &#x02212;2.7% to &#x02212;7.1% and mean estimates of precision ranged from 3.2% to 8.7% across the three concentration levels. Although plasma concentrations of revexepride were determined in pg/mL during bioanalysis, they were converted to ng/mL before pharmacokinetic analysis for consistency with previous data.</p><p>Covance Clinical Research Unit, Leeds, UK, carried out pharmacokinetic and related statistical analysis and reporting of these data.

To demonstrate equivalence, allowing for a 5% difference in true means (ratio of 1.05) and true within-subject coefficient of variation of 25%, 36 participants were required to achieve 90% power. To ensure that 36 participants completed the study, it was decided to enroll a total of 42 individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters</title><p>Following logarithmic transformation, the primary endpoints, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, for participants in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set were analyzed using a mixed-effect linear model with sequence group (AB or BA), treatment period (1 or 2), and treatment (revexepride, or revexepride + omeprazole) as fixed effects. Subject-within-sequence was included as a random effect. For each endpoint, the least-squares (LS) mean and associated standard error were determined for both treatments. The LS mean and standard error were also calculated for the difference between treatments, and used to evaluate a 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the logs of the two treatments. To return to the original scale, an exponential transformation was applied to the lower and upper limits of the CI. This created a 90% CI for the ratio of revexepride + omeprazole to revexepride alone. Point estimates and 90% CIs for the primary endpoints, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, were assessed against the accepted bioequivalence criteria for log-transformed data (0.80, 1.25).</p><p>The main secondary pharmacokinetic endpoint, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, was analyzed by the same methods as the primary endpoints but was not assessed against equivalence criteria. The analysis of the other secondary endpoint, t<sub>max</sub>, was conducted without transformation or modeling. Each value from participants treated with revexepride alone was subtracted from each value from participants in the revexepride + omeprazole group to create a set of all differences in observations between the two treatment regimens. The median difference and 90% CI were then calculated based on Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann estimate for Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant disposition and demographics</title><p>Forty-two participants were enrolled and included in the Safety Analysis Set, of whom 40 completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-9-1257">Figure 3</xref>).

These observations are consistent with the fact that revexepride is highly soluble across a range of acidities (pH 1&#x02013;8), and confirm that alteration of gastrointestinal pH by omeprazole therefore does not affect revexepride absorption.</p><p>In vitro data have shown CYP3A4/5 to be involved in the metabolism of revexepride-base (Supplementary material). In addition, a DDI study demonstrated a two to three fold increase in systemic exposure to revexepride when revexepride 1 mg was co-administered with the potent CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (Supplementary material). Together, these data indicate that revexepride is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4/5. Omeprazole is also metabolized to some extent by CYP3A4/5, suggesting that co-administration might interfere with revexepride metabolism.<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The lack of such interference in the present study can be explained because omeprazole is also metabolized by CYP2C19, for which it has an approximately ten fold higher affinity.<xref rid="b13-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The most commonly observed TEAEs in the present study were gastrointestinal disorders and headache. These are consistent with known AEs for omeprazole and AEs expected of a prokinetic drug, as well as with data from in-house pharmacokinetic studies in healthy participants (Supplementary material), and likely reflect the enterokinetic (gastrointestinal disorders) and serotonergic (headache) properties of the drug. There have been concerns over the potential for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists to cause cardiovascular side effects, which led to the withdrawal of cisapride, the first compound in this class;<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> however, this compound exhibited additional pharmacology as a potent blocker of the human ether-&#x000e0;-go-go-related gene channel. This channel is responsible for the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential, which is believed to be the cause of these cardiovascular AEs.<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> No cardiac TEAEs were seen in the present study in which participants were treated with the more selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist revexepride, and there were no clinically significant changes in cardiovascular parameters or vital signs.</p><p>A possible limitation of the study is that the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole were not assessed. As discussed above, however, previous evidence indicates that revexepride has minimal effects on the activities of any of the major CYP enzyme groups (Supplementary material). Moreover, because the dose of revexepride administered was much lower than that of omeprazole, concentrations of revexepride reaching the shared drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4/5 would also have been substantially lower than those of omeprazole. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole in these participants were not expected to be affected by revexepride at the relative doses of the two drugs used in this study.</p><p>Additional treatment options are needed for patients with GERD whose symptoms are not relieved by PPIs. Promotility drugs could be useful for increasing gastrointestinal motility and alleviating symptoms in these patients.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-1257" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The data presented here suggest that, from a pharmacokinetics perspective, revexepride could be used in addition to PPIs. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of revexepride in patients with GERD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was no effect of co-administration of omeprazole 40 mg with the novel 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist revexepride 1 mg on the pharmacokinetics of revexepride, compared with revexepride 1 mg alone. The safety and tolerability profiles of revexepride were similar when taken alone or in combination with omeprazole 40 mg, and no serious TEAEs were reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec><title>In vitro experiments showing that CYP3A4 was involved in the metabolism of revexepride-base</title><sec><title>Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in metabolism</title><p>Based on in vitro inhibitor experiments and in vitro metabolism experiments with heterologous expression systems, the human CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of revexepride were identified and quantified. Revexepride is mainly metabolized in vitro in humans by CYP3A4 (99.9%) with a minor contribution of CYP2D6 (0.1%). However, the intrinsic clearance in human hepatic microsomes is low, and when scaled to in vivo liver metabolic clearance in humans it was also low, which indicates that metabolism may not be a major clearance route in humans; thus CYP mediated drug&#x02013;drug interactions where revexepride is the victim are unlikely. Revexepride was not a substrate for human CYP3A7 (a CYP enzyme expressed in newborns and infants).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytochrome P450 inhibition and induction</title><p>Revexepride was not a direct or metabolism-dependent inhibitor of human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 in vitro. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) direct inhibition values were higher than 100 &#x003bc;M, the highest revexepride concentration tested. Revexepride showed direct inhibition of human CYP3A4 in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 16&#x02013;49 &#x003bc;M. Revexepride showed metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro with a decrease in IC<sub>50</sub>, following a 30 minute pre-incubation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase of 5.6&#x02013;14 fold. Metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 was confirmed in vitro with maximal rate constants of inactivation of 0.0434 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and the concentration of revexepride required to achieve half-maximal inactivation was 8.09 &#x003bc;M. Data suggest that revexepride is not a reversible CYP3A4 inhibitor, but it is not possible to distinguish between a quasi-irreversible or irreversible inhibition mechanism. At the predicted maximal plasma concentration after a 2 mg three times daily dose, this inhibition of CYP3A4 could be clinically significant. SSP-002833 (a metabolite of revexepride) showed inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro with a calculated IC<sub>50</sub> value of 85 &#x003bc;M, while the IC<sub>50</sub> values of SSP-002834, SSP-002835, SSP-002836, and SSP-002837 (other metabolites of revexepride) were higher than 100 &#x003bc;M. Revexepride did not induce human CYP1A2 in vitro (based on both catalytic and gene expression measurements). Revexepride seems to be a slight inducer (at least in some hepatocyte donors used in the study) of the CYP2B6 enzyme in vitro, but the observed increase was significantly lower than that observed after treatment with the known inducer rifampicin. Revexepride is a potential inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme (based on gene expression evaluation), and its in vitro induction potential is, at least in some donors, comparable to that of the known inducer rifampicin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>BEL-14 &#x02013; co-administration of ketoconazole leads to an increase in revexepride-base</title><sec><title>Revexepride&#x02013;ketoconazole interaction</title><p>Inhibition experiments in human liver microsomes revealed that CYP3A4 was a major CYP form involved in the metabolism of revexepride-base. Other CYP isoenzymes contributed to revexepride-base metabolism to a minor extent. The urine excretion results obtained in study BEL-1 showed that the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine as unchanged revexepride-base was approximately 12% after a single revexepride-HBr dose.</p><p>The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2 period crossover study, BEL-14, was carried out from 18 May to 7 July 1999 at a single center in Belgium. On days 1&#x02013;8 of each period, participants received either ketoconazole 200 mg or placebo twice daily. On day 2 of each period, individuals received a single dose of 1 mg revexepride. On days 4&#x02013;7 of each period, participants received 1 mg revexepride three times daily, followed by a single morning dose on day 8, together with either ketoconazole 200 mg tablets or corresponding placebo tablets twice daily. After the single dose of revexepride on day 2, the pharmacokinetic parameters of revexepride were assessed until 48 hours post-dosing. At steady state (day 8), the pharmacokinetic parameters of revexepride-base were assessed (until 72 hours post-dosing). A washout interval of at least 1 week was required before the participants were crossed over to the second period.</p><p>Fourteen healthy volunteers (eight men and six women) were enrolled in the study. Their mean age was 41.1&#x000b1;2.3 years (range 23&#x02013;55 years). All participants were fully compliant and took all doses of the investigational product(s) as specified in the protocol, with the exception of one individual who forgot to take one placebo tablet in the evening of day 7 in period 2. The pharmacokinetic parameters for revexepride-base in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-dddt-9-1257">Table S1</xref>.</p><p>Co-administration of revexepride with ketoconazole triggered a clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interaction, which resulted in a two and three fold increase in the plasma concentrations of revexepride-base for maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to infinity, respectively, after either single or three times daily dosing. Whereas administration of 1 mg revexepride was well-tolerated, the combined administration of revexepride with ketoconazole was only moderately tolerated. Following intake of a single dose of revexepride, there was a similar number of adverse events (AEs) during co-treatment with ketoconazole (78.6% of participants) compared with placebo (75.0%). However, a higher level of abdominal pain (42.9% versus 0%) and diarrhea (71.4% versus 66.7%) was seen with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The incidence of AEs decreased during multiple dosing with revexepride, and were resolved before the end of the study (5 day multiple dose). Two participants discontinued co-administration of revexepride with ketoconazole due to AEs (vomiting and severe abdominal pain, both known side effects of ketoconazole). These results indicate that combined use of revexepride and strong CYP3A4-inhibitors should be met with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods|results"><title>NED-3 &#x02013; single dose pharmacokinetic study, the results of which were used for sample size calculations</title><p>This open-label, randomized, three way crossover, Phase 1 study was conducted from 21 July 1999 to 27 August 1999.
