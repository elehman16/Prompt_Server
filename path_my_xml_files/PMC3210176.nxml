Due to standardization problems the method has not entered clinical practice. The aim of the study was to assess the comparability for two commercially available devices in healthy controls. In addition, we assessed different breathing patterns in healthy controls with protein markers to analyze the source of the EBC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>EBC was collected from ten subjects using the RTube and ECoScreen Turbo in a randomized crossover design, twice with every device - once in tidal breathing and once in hyperventilation. EBC conductivity, pH, surfactant protein A, Clara cell secretory protein and total protein were assessed. Bland-Altman plots were constructed to display the influence of different devices or breathing patterns and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. The volatile organic compound profile was measured using the electronic nose Cyranose 320. For the analysis of these data, the linear discriminant analysis, the Mahalanobis distances and the cross-validation values (CVV) were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Neither the device nor the breathing pattern significantly altered EBC pH or conductivity. ICCs ranged from 0.61 to 0.92 demonstrating moderate to very good agreement. Protein measurements were greatly influenced by breathing pattern, the device used, and the way in which the results were reported. The electronic nose could distinguish between different breathing patterns and devices, resulting in Mahalanobis distances greater than 2 and CVVs ranging from 64&#x00025; to 87&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>EBC pH and (to a lesser extent) EBC conductivity are stable parameters that are not influenced by either the device or the breathing patterns. Protein measurements remain uncertain due to problems of standardization. We conclude that the influence of the breathing maneuver translates into the necessity to keep the volume of ventilated air constant in further studies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a relatively new and completely noninvasive method to access the epithelial lining fluid of the lungs <xref rid="pone.0027467-Sidorenko1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It should be particularly useful in longitudinal studies and questions requiring repeated measurements. In contrast to clinically established methods like bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling, EBC can be performed without any problems because it is a safe and simple procedure even in small children <xref rid="pone.0027467-Baraldi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>In the past years there have been numerous studies using EBC to analyze inflammatory diseases, examining unspecific markers like conductivity or pH on the one hand <xref rid="pone.0027467-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027467-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but also looking at very specific inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 on the other hand <xref rid="pone.0027467-Shahid1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027467-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, so far the reported mediator levels vary greatly, enabling studies on EBC to make relative statements only. This is due to a lack of work on standardization and sampling technique that might have an influence on observed results. There has been an abundance of different condensing equipment, but nowadays the commercially available devices RTube (Respiratory Research Inc., VA) and ECoScreen (VIASYS Healthcare, Hoechberg, Germany) are used in most studies. As differences in the condensing materials, cooling temperature and air trapping exist, there is a need for information on how these differences influence volume and composition of the EBC.</p><p>Two studies found differences in amounts of proteins such as eotaxin and cysteinyl-leukotriene <xref rid="pone.0027467-Soyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> as well as in pH levels <xref rid="pone.0027467-Prieto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast, in our comparison of ECoScreen I and RTube the EBC pH values were not significantly different for the two devices <xref rid="pone.0027467-Koczulla1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Variation of the coating material also seemed to have an impact on the amounts of albumin and 8-isoprostane <xref rid="pone.0027467-Rosias1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In another study, Czebe et al. compared three devices and different cooling temperatures for the RTube but did not find significant differences in volume and total protein in samples collected with the RTube and ECoScreen. While in some studies different cooling temperatures seemed to have an influence on pH values, the largest study addressing this issue demonstrated that the cooling temperature had no significant impact on EBC <xref rid="pone.0027467-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The volume of EBC was reported to be higher in samples collected using the ECoScreen <xref rid="pone.0027467-Czebe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Until now, there have been few data regarding the influence of different breathing maneuvers on composition and volume of the EBC. Patients who breathe either performing tidal breathing or forced expiration (hyperventilation) might ventilate different areas of the lung leaving the researcher with only a vague idea of the origin of the condensed breath. Furthermore, the fact that the ECoScreen I can not be purchased anymore is another major reason for the comparison of ECoScreen Turbo and RTube. We wanted to address the question as to what extend breathing patterns and different collection devices influence a variety of non-specific markers in EBC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study participants</title><p>EBC was collected from 10 healthy non-smoking controls at the age of 24.8 years &#x000b1;2.78 years (23 years to 30 years) that showed no clinical sign of inflammation at the time of their measurements.

Furthermore, hyperventilation provided higher sample volumes compared to tidal breathing. Neither the device nor the breathing pattern influenced EBC pH. EBC conductivity remained relatively stable. Hyperventilation increased total protein amounts. The ECoScreen showed a trend towards higher total protein amounts. Neither SP-A or CCP concentrations were influenced by the breathing pattern. Normalization to the volume of EBC (absolute amount) or to the volume of ventilated air changed the results of the protein measurements dramatically. The electronic nose could distinguish between breathing pattern and device.</p><p>Interestingly, the RTube provided higher sample volumes compared to the ECoScreen Turbo. This is different from Soyer et al., who, using the EcoScreen 1, found that this device provided significantly higher sample volumes compared to the RTube <xref rid="pone.0027467-Soyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. One difference besides the assembly between the three devices is the cooling temperature during the sampling process. The ECoScreen I is constantly cooled to &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C, and the ECoScreen Turbo, based on a modified wine cooler, has a constant cooling of approximately &#x02212;4&#x000b0;C. The RTube has no constant cooling, but the temperature of the condenser usually starts at a fairly low temperature.</p><p>When comparing the RTube and the tested ECoScreen Turbo, the tube system length is another important difference in the assembly. The distance from the mouth to the collecting tube via a flexible tube system is much longer in the ECoScreen Turbo device compared to the RTube. It can be assumed that EBC volume is lost in the flexible tube system. Another possibility is a turbulent flow profile within the RTube which might increase the EBC volume, because there is more chance for a contact with the cooled walls of the collection tube.</p><p>We found no influence on EBC pH in comparing the breathing patterns suggesting that this parameter is robust. This confirms previously published data <xref rid="pone.0027467-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. One might have expected a drop of the EBC pH after hyperventilation due to the possibility that hyperventilation might increase the amount of alveolar (and endobronchial) CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to an increased amount of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and HCO3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. However, we did not observe significant changes of the pH due to ventilatory manoeuvres.</p><p>Similar findings have been published regarding the comparisons of different devices <xref rid="pone.0027467-Soyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027467-Koczulla3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We also found no significant differences when comparing the RTube and ECoScreen Turbo regarding EBC pH. We extend the published comparisons to recently introduced devices. This is relevant, because the previously compared and used ECoScreen I cannot be purchased anymore and because pH in EBC has been proposed as a clinically relevant parameter to monitor airway inflammation in respiratory diseases, most often in asthma <xref rid="pone.0027467-Carpagnano2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027467-Kane1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is known that inflammation can change pH, but we ruled out systemic inflammation by clinical history and measures. Gastric reflux was also ruled out by clinical history, as it is also known to cause EBC acidification <xref rid="pone.0027467-Hunt2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The hyperventilation maneuver tended to increase the total protein volumes in the EBC samples. Hyperventilation was monitored with an expiratory flow measure device provided by the manufacturer of the EBC device as described above and resulted in a 1.78-fold increased expiratory flow (data not shown). The increase of the total protein concentration did not seem not be caused by increased alveolar ventilation. We could show that SP-A, an alveolar marker, was not increased after hyperventilation. The bronchial marker CCP also showed no increased levels when performing hyperventilation. We performed ELISA and Western blots (data not shown) for CCP and SP-A, indicating no influence of the ventilation pattern on CCP or SP-A concentrations. To our knowledge, the total protein amount after performing hyperventilation has not been measured in EBC before. For mechanical ventilation in piglets it has been shown that hyperventilation increased albumin in the lavage <xref rid="pone.0027467-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Albumin measurements were not performed in our setup. One possible explanation for the trend of the higher protein concentrations might be shear stress forces. Protein volumes could also be higher because of the higher expiratory flow during hyperventilation, which might cause the blowing off of proteins from the bronchial branches, although this seems not very likely. Regarding the difference between the RTube and the ECoScreen Turbo, one might speculate that the RTube produces a more dilute sample because a similar volume of respiratory droplets is mixed with a greater volume of condensed water vapour as described above.</p><p>These results are also of interest when discussing different theories of about the source of exhaled respiratory droplets. It has been stated that respiratory tract turbulence results in the formation of aerosols out of the respiratory lining fluid <xref rid="pone.0027467-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, Bondesson et al. conducted technetium-99 m studies in healthy subjects and concluded that EBC derives mainly from the central airways but that its composition of EBC would only partially reflect that of the epithelial lining fluid <xref rid="pone.0027467-Bondesson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Moreover, Johnson and Morawska challenged the turbulence model and suggested an alternative model (bronchiole fluid film burst, BFFB) <xref rid="pone.0027467-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The proposed mechanism is based on a &#x0201e;process of respiratory fluid film or bubble bursting during the clearance of fluid closures which form in the lower bronchioles following exhalation&#x0201d;. The authors controlled the breathing pattern for inspiration and expiration separately. In contrast, we altered in- and expiration simultaneously by using voluntary &#x0201e;hyperventilation&#x0201c;. It might be that the primary mechanism involved the bursting menisci in bronchioles but that this was complemented by shear forces at higher ventilatory rates. As we did not see differences in SP-A or CCP we have to leave this question unanswered.</p><p>Different normalization processes are possible in EBC. One study tested (unsuccessfully) whether specific protein measurements could be normalized to the total protein amount to give more reliable results <xref rid="pone.0027467-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The problem arises from the presence of two carrier matrices, namely the EBC volume and the volume of ventilated air. Compared to measurements from fluids like blood, serum or urine, where the concentration of proteins depends on the absolute amount of protein and on the amount of only one carrier (fluid), the measurements of protein in EBC depend not only on the volume of EBC but also on the volume of ventilated air. This produces a high amount of complexity as shown in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027467-g004">figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027467-g005">5</xref> where the additional information of the volume of ventilated air changed the results dramatically. This is a very strong argument for either reporting ventilated volumes of air or using a standardized volume of ventilated air. We would advice to use a standardized volume of ventilated air to keep the &#x0201c;third parameter&#x0201d; (besides protein and fluid) constant.</p><p>By analyzing the EBC profile above the fluid surface of the samples we were able to show that the device and the breathing patterns caused a different VOC profile, which were clearly distinguishable with the electronic nose. This again strongly suggests that the breathing pattern should be standardized for healthy controls and probably also for patients, although they have not been tested in our setup. The results further showed that the device for sampling EBC did not seem to make a difference when analyzing robust parameters like EBC pH and (less so) EBC conductivity. For more sophisticated measurements such as protein measurements or pattern recognition performed with electronic noses, the device and the breathing pattern were of important influence. Our data indicate that device and breathing pattern cause sensible differences in the VOC composition. It is known that the expiratory resistance causes a difference in the VOC composition <xref rid="pone.0027467-Dragonieri1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Other possible explanations include the cooling temperature and the above mentioned tube system in the ECoScreen Turbo which might be implicated by the loss of VOCs. The different breathing patterns had an influence of the VOCs which could have been caused by the above mentioned shear stress, resistance differences and a higher intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure caused by dynamic hyperinflation which could be a reason for higher amounts of shear stress. This has been described as the case in a bench model of hyperventilation <xref rid="pone.0027467-Thorevska1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Further experiments should be performed to explore the cause of the differences in the VOCs caused by the devices and the breathing maneuvers.</p><p>Although we performed a carefully designed study there are some limitations. We only sampled healthy controls. The average age of the studied group was 24.8 years, reflecting a young age. Sampling a group of patients with obstructive lung disease might have strengthened the study. This should be performed in a fully powered experimental study, as the present one was a proof-of-concept study exploring important factors of influence. Regarding the RTube no expiration flow meter is commercially available; therefore the volume of ventilated air was assessed only using the ECoScreen Turbo. Further limitations arise from the purely cross-sectional nature of the study, as the results might differ over time.</p><p>In summary, EBC collection, analysis of pH and (partially) conductivity are extremely simple to perform, noninvasive, robust, inexpensive and comparable using the commercially available devices ECoScreen Turbo and RTube. The way of breathing seems not to have a major impact on these parameters. Therefore, it is well suited for noninvasive analysis in a longitudinal follow-up of individual patients, and patients can be provided with a portable device for collection of EBC at home.</p><p>Regarding the protein collection many questions remain unanswered. The breathing pattern seemed not to change the source of the EBC, since we could not show that CCP as marker for the bronchial fraction or SP-A as marker of the alveolar fraction were altered after hyperventilation. However, as the results of protein measurements, were greatly altered by the amount of ventilated air, the ventilated volume should be reported in further studies. For future measurements we recommend standardization of the amount of ventilated air (for example to 100 l) to gain better comparability between reports from different groups. This advice is further strengthened by the fact that using the C-320 it could be shown that the device and the breathing pattern had significant influence of the VOC pattern.</p><p>In conclusion we provide important results that increase the knowledge of the EBC sampling. Until now, EBC analysis has not entered clinical practice because of the lack of standardization of methods. Our results enhance the knowledge about the influence of the breathing pattern. Furthermore, we could show that ECoScreen Turbo and RTube display comparable values for robust, non-specific EBC markers like pH and (partially) conductivity. The total and specific protein values in EBC depend strongly on the underlying method of protein calculation and analysis. A comparison of protein markers in EBC will remain difficult with the current knowledge.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Angelique Holland and Silke Mronga for replacing TG and ARK in clinical duties during this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work was partially funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG, SFB/TR22, TP A19).
