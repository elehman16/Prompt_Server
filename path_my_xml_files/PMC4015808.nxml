Previous preclinical and clinical studies support the safety and efficacy of UC-II in modulating joint discomfort in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of UC-II in moderating joint function and joint pain due to strenuous exercise in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in healthy subjects who had no prior history of arthritic disease or joint pain at rest but experienced joint discomfort with physical activity. Fifty-five subjects who reported knee pain after participating in a standardized stepmill performance test were randomized to receive placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) or the UC-II (40&#x000a0;mg daily, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) product for 120&#x000a0;days. Joint function was assessed by changes in degree of knee flexion and knee extension as well as measuring the time to experiencing and recovering from joint pain following strenuous stepmill exertion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 120&#x000a0;days of supplementation, subjects in the UC-II group exhibited a statistically significant improvement in average knee extension compared to placebo (81.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x000ba; vs 74.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2&#x000ba;; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011) and to baseline (81.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x000ba; vs 73.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000ba;; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002). The UC-II cohort also demonstrated a statistically significant change in average knee extension at day 90 (78.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000ba; vs 73.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000ba;; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045) versus baseline. No significant change in knee extension was observed in the placebo group at any time. It was also noted that the UC-II group exercised longer before experiencing any initial joint discomfort at day 120 (2.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;min, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019), compared to baseline (1.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2&#x000a0;min). By contrast, no significant changes were seen in the placebo group. No product related adverse events were observed during the study. At study conclusion, five individuals in the UC-II cohort reported no pain during or after the stepmill protocol (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031, within visit) as compared to one subject in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Daily supplementation with 40&#x000a0;mg of UC-II was well tolerated and led to improved knee joint extension in healthy subjects. UC-II also demonstrated the potential to lengthen the period of pain free strenuous exertion and alleviate the joint pain that occasionally arises from such activities.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>UC-II</kwd><kwd>Undenatured type II collagen</kwd><kwd>Joint function</kwd><kwd>Knee extension</kwd><kwd>Stepmill</kwd><kwd>Joint pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The impact of strenuous exercise on knee joints may cause localized pain and stiffness, which are hallmark features of pathologic inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been shown that when dogs undergo a strenuous running regimen, significant losses in articular cartilage and glycosaminoglycans occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Such studies suggest that strenuous exercise may activate some of the same physiological processes that occur in arthritic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In fact, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that many of the cytokines implicated in the onset and progression of both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) also appear to regulate the remodeling of the normal knee extracellular matrix (ECM) following strenuous exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>When normal chondrocytes undergo strenuous mechanical stimulation under static conditions, their physiology shifts towards ECM breakdown, as indicated by the upregulation of several metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-13 as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and various aggrecanases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This <italic>in vitro</italic> catabolic response is mediated by changes in the phosphorylation, expression, or translocation of several transcription factors to the cell nucleus such as NF-&#x003ba;B, p38 MAPK, Akt, and ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. By contrast, normal chondrocytes produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 when mechanically stimulated under moderate and dynamic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The secretion of this autocrine molecule not only helps in shifting chondrocyte metabolism towards the synthesis of aggrecan and type II collagen, it also downregulates production of nitric oxide (NO) and various MMPs and aggrecanases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This conclusion is corroborated by the finding that pretreatment of strenuously compressed normal chondrocytes with IL-4 attenuates their catabolic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This suggests that IL-4 plays a key role in downregulating remodeling functions, restoring articular cartilage homeostasis, as well as decreasing chondrocyte apoptosis following strenuous mechanical loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Mechanically stressed chondrocytes also produce a number of other molecules known to participate in inflammatory responses, including prostoglandin E2, NO, and vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These are proinflammatory molecules that, in conjunction with TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;, result in a localized, and transitory inflammatory-like response that is part of the normal repair process occurring in knee joints, serves to moderate remodeling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Ostrowski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed that healthy individuals express up to 27-fold greater concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in blood following a marathon run when compared to IL-10 blood levels at rest. This finding is not surprising given that these same individuals also show marked increases in the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6. It therefore appears that in healthy subjects undergoing strenuous exertion, the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is offset by the synthesis of anti-inflammatory agents as part of the recovery process. This view is supported by the observation that IL-10 reduces the catabolic impact of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; on cartilage explants from healthy volunteers, and this effect is enhanced by combining IL-10 with IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another protein released by dynamically compressed chondrocytes is transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This factor is secreted by many cell types and is known to interfere with the cell cycle and arrest differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With regard to chondrocytes, TGF-&#x003b2; induces cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and slows terminal differentiation into hypertrophic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that TGF-&#x003b2; reverses the <italic>in vitro</italic> catabolic effect of various proinflammatory cytokines on normal chondrocytes as well as chondrocytes harvested from RA and OA donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The overall findings discussed above point to a new, unifying view of joint physiology. It suggests that many of the biological processes occurring in knee joints affected by RA and OA also participate in the maintenance of healthy knees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It therefore seems appropriate to test the efficacy of natural supplements or ingredients, which have been shown to moderate joint pain in RA and OA, as possible candidates for treating the joint discomfort that occasionally results from strenuous exercise in healthy individuals.</p><p>UC-II is a natural ingredient which contains a glycosylated, undenatured type-II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that small doses of UC-II modulate joint health in both OA and RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Tong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], using an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of collagen induced arthritis (CIA), demonstrated that ingesting microgram quantities of undenatured type II collagen significantly reduces circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, potentially serving to decrease both the incidence and the severity of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The ability to alter immunity via the ingestion of a food, or an antigen, is called oral tolerance. This is an ongoing normal physiological process that protects the alimentary tract against untoward immunological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Research into its mechanism of action has revealed that several distinct types of T regulator cells mediate this phenomenon by releasing IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It has also been shown that this effect is transitory in nature requiring that the food, or antigen, be consumed continuously in order to maintain the tolerogenic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Given these findings, plus our current understanding of the role of various cytokines in normal joint physiology, it was hypothesized that supplementation with UC-II might relieve joint discomfort and restore joint function in healthy subjects.</p><p>The aim of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the impact of UC-II on knee function in otherwise healthy subjects with no prior history of arthritic disease who experienced knee pain upon strenuous physical exertion. The primary efficacy variable for assessing knee function included measurements of flexibility using range of motion (ROM) goniometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Investigational product</title><p>The investigational study product UC-II is derived from chicken sternum.

Briefly, subjects were instructed to sit in an upright position on a table edge with their backs straight (knee position defined as 90&#x000b0;). The axis of a goniometer was placed at the intersection of the thigh and shank at the knee joint. Subjects were asked to bring their knees to full extension without changing the position of the pelvis and lumbar spine. The extended knee joint angle was measured and recorded. For knee flexion measurement, subjects were asked to actively flex their knees while lying in a prone position with their shins off the end of the table. The range of knee flexion motion was then measured and documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Timed joint discomfort measurements</title><p>Briefly, a stopwatch was started when subjects began climbing the stepmill. Time to onset of pain was recorded at the first sign of pain in the target knee. The baselines at each time point were normalized to account for dropouts. Percent change in time to complete recovery from pain was measured as follows: a new stopwatch was started when the subjects disembarked from the stepmill and the time to complete recovery from pain was recorded. The baselines at each time point were normalized to account for dropouts then compared against the reference interval which was defined as the percentage change between the study baseline and day 7.</p></sec><sec><title>KOOS knee survey &#x00026; Stanford exercise scales</title><p>The KOOS survey is a validated instrument consisting of 42 questions that are classified into sub-scales such as symptoms, stiffness, pain, daily activities, recreational activities and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

This effect did not reach statistical significance between groups but there was an evident trend in the data towards a greater number of subjects losing pain in the UC-II cohort (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.126). A binomial analysis for complete loss of pain at each visit demonstrated a statistical significance for the UC-II group by day 120 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031). It is important to note that the complete loss of knee pain was not a random event. The pattern among the subjects indicates that loss of knee pain appeared to be a persistent phenomenon that spanned multiple visits (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).

The rationale behind this approach centered on the hypothesis that strenuous exercise might uncover transient joint changes due to daily physical activities that are not attributable to a diagnosable disease. In the same way that nominally elevated blood levels of lipids, glucose plus high blood pressure and obesity can be predictive of future progression to diabetes and heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the development of joint pain upon strenuous exercise may be indicative of possible future joint problems.</p><p>At study conclusion, we found that subjects ingesting the UC-II supplement experienced a significantly greater forward ROM in their knees versus baseline and placebo as measured by knee extension goniometry. Knee extension is necessary for daily function and sport activities. Loss of knee extension has been shown to negatively impact the function of the lower extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. For example, loss of knee extension can cause altered gait patterns affecting ankles and the hip which could result in difficulty with running and jumping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Studies have further shown that a permanent loss of 3-5&#x000ba; of extension can significantly impact patient satisfaction and the development of early arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>By contrast, when knee flexion, another measure of knee function, was assessed via goniometry, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed between the two study cohorts. From a structure-function perspective this outcome is not surprising. During the earliest characterized phases of OA there is an apparent preferential loss of knee extension over knee flexion, and this loss has been shown to correlate with WOMAC pain scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In addition, MRI imaging of the early osteoarthritic knee has shown that initial changes in knee structure appear to center on articular cartilage erosions (fibrillations) about the patella and other weight bearing regions of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Such changes might favor a loss in knee ROM that preferentially affects extension over flexion. The pathophysiology of the early osteoarthritic knee, we believe, provides insight regarding the effect of daily physical activities on the healthy knee insofar as it helps explain the discordance in clinical outcomes between knee extension and flexion.</p><p>Both the time to onset of initial joint pain as well as time to full recovery were measured in this study. For each of these measures the clinical outcomes favored the UC-II supplemented cohort versus their baseline status. The ability of UC-II to modulate knee extension may relate to its ability to moderate knee joint pain. Crowley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and Trentham et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] demonstrated that UC-II effectively enhances joint comfort and flexibility thereby improving the quality of life (QoL) in both OA and RA subjects, respectively. This effect may be attributable to the finding that microgram quantities of undenatured type II collagen moderate CIA in both the rat and the mouse via the induction of T regulator cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The induction of these T regulators takes place within gut associated lymphatic tissues (GALT), including mesenteric lymph nodes, in response to the consumption of undenatured type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Studies have shown that these regulatory cells produce IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A special class of CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, found almost exclusively in the GALT, facilitates this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Once activated, T regulator cells appear to downregulate a wide range of immunologic and proinflammatory activities resulting in the moderation of the arthritic response initiated by undenatured type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The phenomenon of oral tolerance has also been demonstrated in humans, and appears to involve a similar set of T regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>The above description of how UC-II might modulate joint function is most easily understood in the context of RA given that the CIA animal model resembles this disease most closely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, the case for T regulators and immune cytokines having a moderating effect on healthy or OA knee joint function appears less apparent. This view has changed in recent years due to a growing body of evidence suggesting that both OA and normal chondrocyte biology appears to be regulated by some of the same cytokines and chemokines that regulate inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. For example, Mannelli and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] recently reported that feeding microgram amounts of native type II collagen (porcine) prevents monoiodoacetate-induced articular cartilage damage in this rat model of osteoarthritis, as measured by pain thresholds and by circulating levels of cross linked c-telopeptides derived from type II collagen. This finding corroborates the efficacy of undenatured type II collagen in improving joint comfort in osteoarthritic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we show for the first time that UC-II can improve joint function in healthy subjects undergoing strenuous physical exercise. This observation, when considered in context with normal chondrocyte physiology, suggests that activated T regulator cells, specific for undenatured type II collagen, home to an overstressed knee joint where their release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; reverse the catabolic changes caused by strenuous exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In addition, the IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; produced by these T regulators may tilt the T<sub>H</sub> balance in the knee joint towards T<sub>H</sub>2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] responses which preferentially result in IL-4 production further fostering a shift in chondrocyte metabolism towards ECM replenishment.</p><p>Several additional tests were used in this study to assess overall joint function, QoL, and physical activity. The additional parameters and tests measured included a six minute timed walk plus the Stanford exercise scale and KOOS survey. With respect to the KOOS survey, both cohorts were statistically significant versus baseline for symptoms, pain, daily function, recreational activities and QoL but were not significant from each other. This is not an unexpected finding given that this study was carried out with healthy subjects who do not present with any joint issues at rest. It is only when the knee is stressed via the stepmill do subjects report any joint discomfort. Under these conditions, and as indicated above, the UC-II group appears to experience less joint discomfort and greater joint flexibility. No difference in clinical outcomes between groups was seen in the six minute timed walk, the daily distance walked, or the Stanford exercise scale questionnaire. Once again we are not surprised by these results given that these tests and questionnaires are designed and clinically validated to assess the severity of arthritic disease in unhealthy populations.</p><p>No clinical biomarkers associated with arthritic diseases were assessed in this study. Healthy subjects would not be expected to present with significant alterations in their inflammatory biomarker profile as they lack clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In addition, it should be noted that the joint discomfort measured in this study is acute pain induced by a stressor rather than due to an ongoing inflammatory event. Therefore, any elevation in inflammation markers that might occur in these healthy subjects may simply be due to the physiological impact of strenuous exercise.</p><p>There are two study limitations to consider when reviewing these results. The first, time to onset of initial pain, was limited to a 10-minute interval. The current study design did not address the possibility that subjects might cease to experience pain on the stepmill. Future studies should allow for an extension of the exertion interval in order to gauge how much longer a subject can exercise before reporting pain. In this way better defined parameters can be placed upon the degree to which UC-II supplementation results in the cessation of joint pain due to strenuous exercise in healthy subjects.</p><p>The second limitation that merits consideration is the possibility that study subjects may have early signs of arthritis that do not meet the ACR criteria. This possible limitation was addressed by performing an extensive medical examination for signs and symptoms of OA and by excluding volunteers who experienced pain levels of 5 or greater within one minute of using the stepmill.</p><p>UC-II is a unique ingredient that supports healthy joints. Previous studies have focused on the efficacy of this ingredient in OA subjects. By including healthy subjects in this study, and using non-disease endpoints as a measure of efficacy, it is believed that the benefits that derive from UC-II usage now extends to include healthy individuals. Further, this ingredient appears to be safe for human consumption based on an extensive series of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicological studies as well as the absence of any adverse events in this and in previous human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In conclusion, daily supplementation with 40&#x000a0;mg of UC-II supports joint function and flexibility in healthy subjects as demonstrated by greater knee extension and has the potential both to alleviate the joint pain that occasionally arises from strenuous exercise as well as to lengthen periods of pain free exertion.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; OA: Osteoarthritis; ECM: Extracellular matrix; TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL-1&#x003b2;: Interleukin-1 beta; IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-4: Interleukin 4; IL-10: Interleukin-10; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; NF-&#x003ba;B: Nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; MAPK: Mitogen activated protein kinase; ERK: Extracellular receptor kinase; NO: Nitric oxide; TGF-&#x003b2;: Transforming growth factor-beta; CIA: Collagen induced arthritis; KOOS: Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score; ROM: Range of motion; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; GALT: Gut associated lymphatic tissue; QoL: Quality of life; MIP-1&#x003b2;: Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta; IP-10: Interferon gamma-induced protein 10; TH: T helper cell; WOMAC: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; ACR: American College of Rheumatology.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Medicus Research received research grants from InterHealth Nutraceuticals, Inc., Benicia, California.
