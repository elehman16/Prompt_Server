Concomitant pruritus often affects patients&#x02019; Quality of Life. Optimal compliance to therapy ensures high success rates preventing relapse or recurrences.</p></boxed-text><p>Superficial mycotic infections such as &#x02018;Dermatophytoses&#x02019; is an extremely common infection occurring throughout the world with a reported incidence of 20% in USA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The disease is caused by dermatophytes belonging to genera of Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermatophyton. The fungal infections of the skin and its appendages are more common in tropical countries like India due to environmental factors like heat (summer) and humidity (monsoon). The risk factors include socio-economic conditions like overcrowding and poverty leading to poor personal hygiene. The type and frequency of dermatophytoses may change with time, due to changes in living standards and application of preventive measures like personal hygiene. However in India, the most commonly occurring clinical type of dermatophytoses for adults includes, tinea corporis (36-59%) and tinea cruris (12-27%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Though classically dermatophytoses is characterized by the presence of &#x02018;ringed lesions&#x02019; with central healing, concomitant presence of inflammatory symptoms including pruritus is noted in these patients. Pruritus often leads to intense urge to itch affecting the quality of life of the patient. Secondly, intense itching of the lesion increases the chances of secondary bacterial infections and eczematisation. Misuse of topical steroids result in unclear morphology of fungal infections (tine in-cognito)</p><p>Imidazoles, allyalamines and triazoles are most effective agents for dermatophytoses. Topical daily antifungal therapy usually involves imidazoles (namely, <italic>Luliconazole</italic> and <italic>Sertaconazole</italic>) and allylamines (<italic>Terbinafine</italic>). Terbinafine is a broad spectrum lipophilic antifungal agent showing excellent activity in patients with tinea corporis or tinea cruris. Luliconazole, an imidazole antifungal agent is active against dermatophytes and highly active against candida albicans but it inactive against zygomycetes. However the antifungal therapy is often fraught with several clinical challenges including high relapse rates and recurrences that often occur after treatment stoppage or discontinuation. Also untreated and improperly treated infections may become chronic, causing significant disability and morbidity. To manage this growing pathogenicity of superficial fungal infections, development of newer broad spectrum antifungals like sertaconazole have opened up new treatment options.</p><p>Sertaconazole is a new benzothiophene imidazole derivative that is being used worldwide for varied indications including dermatophytosis, candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, seborrhoeic dermatitis of scalp. Sertaconazole has both fungistatic and fungicidal activity against <italic>Dermatophytes, Candida spp</italic>. and <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> fungal infections. It is also effective against <italic>Aspergillus</italic> fungi and Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus genera</italic>), that are likely to cause secondary infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] This action is attributable to its indirect inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and direct inhibition of nonsterol component of fungal cell membrane leading to rapid leakage of key intracellular components and immediate cell death. Additionally, the unique benzothiophene ring in the chemical structure offers higher lipophilicity and greater retention of drug in the stratum corneum) for up to 48 hrs, leads to greater mycological cure rates and lesser chance of relapse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic actions of Sertaconazole leads to symptomatic relief and is considered to be beneficial to patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] These ancillary properties of sertaconazole are likely to make an impact on the concomitant symptom control and therefore improve quality of life of these patients with dermatophytoses. Drug resistance is a common problem with most of the antifungal agents; however the data for sertaconazole is quite limited. According to resistance testing conducted in European settings, 4% strains were resistant to sertaconazole compared to 48.8% with triazoles (fluconazole).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Serataconazole has excellent safety record, with the reported adverse event being cutaneous related including contact dermatitis, dryness, burning, eczema, itching and skin tenderness. However the frequency of these side effects was comparable to placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Clinical efficacy and safety of these three topical antifungals has not been studied in Indian population and therefore the present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of sertaconazole 2% cream with terbinafine 1% and luliconazole 1% for the treatment of superficial mycoses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A prospective, randomized, multicentric, open-labeled, parallel study was undertaken in 83 patients with Dermatophytoses involving <italic>tinea corporis</italic> and <italic>tinea cruris</italic> infections.

Recurrence of tinea infections is common due to inadequate treatment or reinfections especially of the intertriginous areas.</p><p>In the present analysis based on data of 62 evaluable patients, all the three study drugs showed significant reduction in signs and symptoms (<italic>pruritus, erythema, vesicles</italic> and <italic>desquamation</italic>) of tinea infections as compared to baseline. At end of &#x02018;Treatment Phase&#x02019; greater proportion of patients in sertaconazole group had absence of pruritus (85%) and erythema (95%) as compared to terbinafine and luliconazole.</p><p>This substantiates the antipruritic and anti-inflammatory action of sertaconazole over other antifungals that would ensure better adherence to treatment and improved quality of life. This antipruritic and anti-inflammatory property of sertaconazole is due to its ability to reduce histamine release and several other proinflammatory cytokines including PGE2. The clinical implication of this is significant since for most patients with tinea infections topical imidazoles are usually advocated where sertaconazole shows highest antimycotic potency compared to other antifungal agents especially against <italic>candida albicans</italic> that are also likely to be involved or concomitantly present in a patient of tinea cruris.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Significant improvement in vesiculation and desquamation was observed in all three groups compared to baseline.</p><p>At the end of &#x02018;Treatment Phase&#x02019; and &#x02018;Follow-up&#x02019; Phase, all patients showed negative mycological assessment in all three treatment groups, suggesting of no recurrence of the disease.</p><p>As per physician global assessment, all patients in Sertaconazole group (100%) had successful treatment outcome (<italic>clinical and mycological cure</italic>) as compared to terbinafine (95%) and luliconazole (86.4%).</p><p>In the present study, all three treatments were well tolerated and found to be safe. One patient in the sertaconazole group had complained of burning sensation on application. This could be attributed to the pharmacological property of any topical antifungal drug or hypersensitivity to the study drug, that could not be assessed since the patient was lost to follow-up.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study are likely to be confounded by the study design since the therapy duration was different for all the treatment drugs. However since most the clinical trials conducted with sertaconazole employed a four week study design, our pilot study also employed similar duration of therapy for sertaconazole while comparing its efficacy and safety with standardized regimen of terbinafine and luliconazole (2 weeks) for the first time in patients with tinea cruris or corporis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that sertaconazole was better than terbinafine and luliconazole in relieving signs and symptoms of dermatophytoses especially pruritus thereby improving patients&#x02019; quality of life.
