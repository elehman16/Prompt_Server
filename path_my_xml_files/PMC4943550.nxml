Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important cause of liver damage and occurs more commonly in individuals living with HIV (30%&#x02013;40%) than in the noninfected population (14%&#x02013;31%) [<xref rid="OFW062C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="OFW062C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is known to cause adverse changes in body composition including central fat accumulation, insulin, and elevated triglycerides [<xref rid="OFW062C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="OFW062C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such changes and chronic inflammation may lead to increased severity of NAFLD in HIV-infected patients. In a cross-sectional study, patients with HIV-associated NAFLD exhibited higher rates of steatohepatitis and increased severity of liver injury compared with age- and sex-matched non-HIV patients with NAFLD [<xref rid="OFW062C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Given the increased risk of hepatosteatosis for individuals infected with HIV, effective therapies to limit the progression of NAFLD in this population are needed. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 13 patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfection, pioglitazone treatment reduced hepatic fat content measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy [<xref rid="OFW062C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Statins have been proposed to mitigate cardiac disease risk in HIV-infected patients [<xref rid="OFW062C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but no studies have yet assessed the effects of statins on NAFLD in the HIV population. Among non-HIV patients, limited studies suggest potential benefit of statins in patients with NAFLD [<xref rid="OFW062C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFW062C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a Swedish open-label study, statin treatment significantly reduced fatty liver infiltration observed in liver biopsies collected at a 13.8-year follow-up of patients with NAFLD [<xref rid="OFW062C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More recently, lower hepatosteatosis prevalence was reported in patients who received statins for more than 2 years, using observational data from the Rotterdam Study [<xref rid="OFW062C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These reports highlight the need for data from controlled trials of statins on NAFLD in HIV-infected patients, a population with a particularly high prevalence of both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In a 12-month randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we previously demonstrated significant reductions in coronary plaque in HIV-infected participants treated with atorvastatin versus placebo [<xref rid="OFW062C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Leveraging computed tomography (CT) data obtained in the study, we now investigate the effects of atorvastatin on hepatosteatosis among HIV participants with NAFLD. We hypothesized that hepatosteatosis would improve after 1 year with atorvastatin.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>We recruited 40 men and women with HIV on stable ART, no prior history of cardiovascular disease or cardiac symptoms, LDL cholesterol between 70 and 130 mg/dL, and evidence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis on coronary CT angiography (CCTA). Full exclusion resistance criteria were previously reported [<xref rid="OFW062C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Participants with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and/or undergoing treatment for active liver disease were excluded. Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to either atorvastatin (starting at dose of 20 mg/day and escalating to 40 mg/day at 3-month visit if study drug was well tolerated) or placebo for 12 months. Thirty-seven of the 40 participants completed the study. In the current analysis, we assessed changes in hepatosteatosis measured by CT in response to atorvastatin. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00965185).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Noncontrast Computed Tomography (CT) and Contrast Coronary CT Angiography</title><p>Cardiac electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated CT was performed at enrollment and 1 year of follow up, using a Somatom Definition Flash 128 slice dual source CT scanner (Siemens) according to the guidelines of the Society of Cardiac Computed Tomography [<xref rid="OFW062C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as previously described [<xref rid="OFW062C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The protocol included a noncontrast CT that was used to measure the density of liver and spleen.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measurement of Liver and Spleen Density</title><p>Noncontrast CT allows for the noninvasive measurement of liver density (attenuation) in Hounsfield Units (HUs). Liver density is inversely correlated to fat content and has been validated as an accurate, reproducible means to characterize hepatosteatosis [<xref rid="OFW062C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFW062C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Liver density was measured on noncontrast ECG-gated CT images originally obtained for coronary artery calcium. A reader blinded to participant allocation, CCTA, and biomarker results measured the hepatic and splenic CT attenuation using a dedicated workstation (AQi; TeraRecon) [<xref rid="OFW062C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="OFW062C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hepatic density was measured by selecting 3 circular regions of interest with an area of at least 2 cm<sup>2</sup> on 3 axial CT slices, taking care to avoid the hepatic vessels and bile ducts. Likewise, 3 density measurements were taken in the spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFW062F1">1</xref>A). The spleen is visible on most liver CT slices, it is normally less dense than the liver, and it is used as an internal control for assessing liver density. The ratio of the mean liver measurements divided by the mean spleen measurements was calculated, with a liver/spleen ratio &#x0003c;1.0 defined as NAFLD [<xref rid="OFW062C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFW062C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This definition is commonly used with good accuracy compared with liver biopsy and minimal intra- and interobserver variability [<xref rid="OFW062C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFW062C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Reproducibility was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of mean liver attenuation, spleen attenuation, and liver/spleen ratio measurements used in the analysis compared with 20 randomly selected CTs remeasured by the same reader more than 6 months after the original measurements. The ICCs of mean liver and spleen attenuation were 0.977 and 0.986, respectively. The ICC for the liver/spleen ratio was 0.982.

Of note, the change in hepatosteatosis in response to statin therapy was significantly correlated with decreases in LDL, corroborating a potential statin effect and suggesting a link with reduced lipid levels. To our knowledge, this is the first report of statin therapy reducing liver fat in the HIV population.</p><p>Our results support similar findings of atorvastatin and other statins in reducing hepatosteatosis in the general population. In a substudy of the St. Francis Heart Study, among participants with NAFLD defined as liver/spleen ratio &#x0003c;1, atorvastatin 20 mg daily in combination with vitamins C and E significantly improved liver/spleen ratio by 0.40 after 4 years of treatment [<xref rid="OFW062C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In another study in patients with NAFLD who were randomized to atorvastatin, fenofibrate, or both drugs, the proportion of patients who no longer had evidence of NAFLD at the end of treatment was significantly higher in the atorvastatin groups than in the fenofibrate group [<xref rid="OFW062C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies using other lipophilic statins have shown mixed results. A few studies suggest beneficial effects of pitavastatin. In one study, patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treated with pitavastatin for 12 months showed significant improvement in ALT, &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase, and lipid profiles [<xref rid="OFW062C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In another study, both pitavastatin and atorvastatin reduced the severity of hepatosteatosis by CT [<xref rid="OFW062C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, a randomized placebo-controlled study of simvastatin in 16 patients with NASH demonstrated no statistically significant improvement in serum aminotransferases, hepatic steatosis, necroinflammatory activity, or stage of fibrosis with treatment, despite a 26% reduction in LDL in the simvastatin group [<xref rid="OFW062C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among the hydrophilic statins, rosuvastatin may have beneficial effects on NAFLD [<xref rid="OFW062C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFW062C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a pilot study of 23 patients with NAFLD, rosuvastatin treatment for 8 months significantly improved the lipid profile and liver biochemical markers [<xref rid="OFW062C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In another study, repeat liver biopsies and ultrasonography showed improvement of NASH in 19 of 20 patients after 12-month treatment with rosuvastatin [<xref rid="OFW062C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings in the general population suggest that the beneficial effect on hepatosteatosis may not be limited to atorvastatin or lipophilic statins; however, there may be differential effects of different statins on NAFLD. Moreover, data on the effects of statins in the HIV population are lacking.</p><p>Statins may reduce hepatosteatosis by inhibiting expression of the membrane-bound transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD as an explanatory link between metabolic dysregulation and triglyceride synthesis. When activated, SREBP-1c enters the nucleus where it upregulates enzymes involved in hepatic lipogenesis [<xref rid="OFW062C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In humans, atorvastatin 80 mg given for 4 weeks reduced messenger RNA expression of SREBP-1c [<xref rid="OFW062C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, one potential mechanism through which statins reduce hepatosteatosis may involve downregulation of SREBP-1c and inhibition of triglyceride synthesis.</p><p>We found that MCP-1 concentrations are higher among HIV-infected participants with hepatosteatosis than those without steatosis, which is consistent with existing literature in the general population. In the general population, hepatic expression of MCP-1 has been shown to be upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid="OFW062C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, activation of the innate immune system in chronic HIV infection may play an important role in the development of NAFLD, and statins can help to reduce proinflammatory monocytes and macrophages.</p><p>This study has limitations. The CT liver density measurement technique assessed for diffuse hepatosteatosis, the most common manifestation of fatty liver. Areas of focal fatty deposition may have been missed, although this potential for sampling error is also shared by liver biopsy, the reference standard for hepatosteatosis [<xref rid="OFW062C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This study was also limited by the small number of participants with NAFLD who could be included in the analysis. Larger trials are needed to corroborate this observed effect of statin therapy on hepatosteatosis in patients with HIV and NAFLD and to elucidate potential mechanisms, including LDL-lowering, metabolic, or inflammatory effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Leveraging CT data obtained from a randomized trial of atorvastatin, in this new analysis, we report an improvement in hepatosteatosis with statin therapy in HIV-infected participants with NAFLD, possibly related to a reduction in LDL or via effects on immune activation. This preliminary observation suggests that statins may confer potential beneficial effects on NAFLD through their effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation in the HIV patient population, warranting future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofw062/-/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> is available online at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:href="http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/">http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).</p>
