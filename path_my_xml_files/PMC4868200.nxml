stroke patients, core stability exercises or conventional exercises. [Subjects and
Methods] Forty participants with hemiplegia were recruited in the Department of Neurology
of Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang between January 2014 and February 2015 and randomly
divided into either an experimental or control group. The patients in the control group
performed conventional exercises for six weeks, and those in the experiment group
performed core stability exercises for six weeks. The outcomes were evaluated using
Modified Barthel Index and Berg Balance Scale. [Results] After treatment, the Modified
Barthel Index and Berg Balance Scale were significantly increased in both groups when
compared with the baseline. The Modified Barthel Index was significantly lower in the
control group compared with the experimental group. The Berg Balance Scale scores in the
control group were relatively lower than those in the experimental group, but there was no
significant difference between the two groups. [Conclusion] Core stability exercises have
a better effect on patients with hemiplegia than conventional exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Core stability exercises</kwd><kwd>Conventional exercises</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, with a high prevalence and long-term disabilities, is a major health problem in the
world<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it was reported that about two million people suffer from
stroke each year<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impairments including
loss of strength, sensation, and coordination abilities, which result in walking
difficulties, balance disorders, and limb function disturbance, occur in 70&#x02013;80% of stroke
patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This affects the life quality
of patients adversely and leads to a heavy economic burden on society. Subsequently,
effective rehabilitation interventions to optimize recovery in stroke patients have received
high attention.</p><p>In the treatment of balance and gait dysfunction, exercise therapy is regarded as one of
the commonly used methods that bring greater benefits in physical function for stroke
patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effect of exercises on
balance and gait dysfunction in stroke patients has been confirmed by many clinical
studies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, core stability exercises
have been widely carried out in many fields, including medical rehabilitation, sports
training, and medical care. Core stability exercises were shown to improve dynamic standing
balance, functional autonomy, static balance, flexibility, and stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, core stability exercises have been reported to improve the rehabilitation
effect in stroke patients. In a study of 20 stroke patients, the control group underwent
standard exercise therapy, while the experiment group underwent both the core
stability-enhancing exercise and standard exercise therapy simultaneously. After 4 weeks, Yu
found that the mean trunk impairment scale score and muscle activity of the lower trunk
increased in the experiment group significantly<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In study by Cabanas-Valdes, 80 patients were randomly assigned to
an experimental group and a control group, both groups underwent conventional therapy
including exercises, and the experimental group performed core stability exercises. The
results showed that core stability exercises improve the efficacy of conventional
exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although these studies
confirmed the effect of core stability exercises in the rehabilitation of stroke patients,
few comparative studies have been carried out to compare the effect of core stability
exercises and conventional exercises. Which is better in improving the stability and balance
of stroke patients, core stability or conventional exercises? The answer is still
unclear.</p><p>Therefore, a prospective study including 40 participants was carried out in the Department
of Neurology of Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang between January 2014 and February 2015. The
objective of the study was to determine which is better in the rehabilitation of stroke
patients, core stability exercises or conventional exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants with stroke-induced hemiplegia were recruited from the Department of Neurology
of Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang between January 2014 and February 2015. The diagnosis
and lesion side of these participants were confirmed by history evaluation, physical
examination, brain imaging, and examination of their medical records. The inclusion
criteria<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> were ability to walk more than
32 feet, duration of disorder &#x0003e;6 months, no musculoskeletal problems, absence of any
cardiac disorders, complete understanding of this research, and ability to communicate. The
included participants were randomly divided into either an experimental or control group by
a random computer-generated sequence. The randomization was managed by a physician who was
not involved in the study. The group allocations were concealed in numbered, sealed, opaque
envelopes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. All the included patients
signed an informed consent form, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of our
hospital.</p><p>The patients in the control group performed conventional exercises including limb
stretching, passive mobilization of joints, walking between parallel bars, and occupational
therapy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients in the
experiment group performed core stability exercises including the plank, side plank, bridge,
straight leg raise, and modified push-up<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before the beginning of the study, the patients were given
individual instruction by the researchers. During the exercises, physicians provide
necessary assistance to help the patients in executing the exercises. The exercises in both
groups were performed for one hour per day, six times a week for six weeks.</p><p>The Modified Barthel Index (MBI)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Berg Balance Scale (BBS)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> were used to
assess the clinical outcomes of the two groups. The MBI, which demonstrates the ability of
patients to deal with daily activities, consists of ten items including personal hygiene,
taking a bath alone, eating, using the bathroom, ascending stairs, dressing, defecating,
controlling urine, walking or using a wheelchair, and moving to a chair or bed. Each item is
rated on a scale of 5 ranging from independent conduct to impossible to conduct. The BBS,
which can evaluate static and dynamic balance abilities of patients, consists of 14 items
covering functional tasks in three domains, sitting, standing, and changing posture, that
are scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;4.</p><p>IBM SPSS STATISTICS 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis,
and p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. The differences in the baseline data including
age, gender, and disease course were compared using the t test or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.
Comparison for the MBI and BBS were carried out using the t test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the current study, 40 patients with stroke-induced hemiplegia were included and divided
randomly into experimental and control groups, with 20 participants in each group at the
beginning of the study. The baseline clinical data including age, gender, disease course,
BBS, and MBI were recorded. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the
two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). The patients in the control group performed conventional exercises
for six weeks and those in the experimental group carried out core stability exercises for
six weeks.</p><p>Three patients in the experimental group and two in the control group withdrew from the
study two weeks after treatment, and in total thirty-five patients completed the training.
The final results showed that, compared with the baseline, the mean MBI scores of the
experimental and control groups increased significantly from 53.5 and 55.1 to 66.8 and 61.2
(p&#x0003c;0.05), respectively, and that the mean BBS scores increased significantly from 30.2
and 31.9 to 38.6 and 35.7 (p&#x0003c;0.05), respectively. In addition, MBI scores were
significantly lower (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the control group than in the experimental group. The BBS
scores in the control group were relatively lower than those in the experimental group, but
there was no significant difference between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A prospective study was carried out to compare the effect of core stability exercises and
conventional exercises on patients with stroke-induced hemiplegia. To the best of our
knowledge, few studies have been published on this topic in the English literature.</p><p>The core is central to almost all kinetic chains in the human body<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The core, described as a box in the trunk with the
abdominals, paraspinals, and gluteals; diaphragm and pelvic floor; and hip girdle
musculature serving as the front wall, back wall, roof, and bottom, respectively, makes up
the largest part of the body and plays an important role in stabilizing the body and
controlling movement of daily activities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Core stability is regarded as a prerequisite for maintaining proper posture of the lumbar
and pelvic regions during sports activities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, core stability exercises have many advantages in the
field of rehabilitation and can improve the activation and cooperative contractions of
abdominal and multifidus muscles, facilitating the function and movement of the limbs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, the MBI and BBS scores after treatment were significantly increased
in both the experimental and control groups when compared with those before treatment. This
indicates that both core stability exercises and conventional exercises can improve the
abilities of patients to deal with daily activities and control body balance, which confirms
the viewpoints of many published studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, after treatment, the MBI scores were significantly lower in the control group
than those in the experimental group, and the BBS scores in the control group were also
lower than those in the experimental group. The outcomes demonstrate that compared with
conventional exercises, core stability exercises can result in better effectiveness in
patients with stroke-induced hemiplegia. However, in terms of comparison of the BBS scores
at the end of treatment, although the mean BBS score in the experimental group was larger
than that in the control group, there was no significant difference between the two groups.
Such a condition may be attributed to the relatively small sample size, and in a
larger-scale study, the difference between the two groups may be significant. Consequently,
the outcomes in the present study can demonstrate that core stability exercises present with
better effectiveness than conventional exercises.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, and a large-scale
clinical study may be better in a comparative study. Second, the exercises results were
evaluated using self-reported measures of function instead of an objective measurement, and
this may have had some adverse influence on the final outcomes. Third, there was a lack of
long-term follow-up in the study, and it is unclear whether the effectiveness of core
stability exercises will decrease in patients with hemiplegia with time. Therefore, more
studies need to be carried out in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Potential predictors for health-related quality of life in
