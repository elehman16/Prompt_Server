Furthermore, cellular injury, intestinal permeability changes and subsequent endotoxaemia can lead to other serious systemic complications (Davison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>; Derikx et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). Although intestinal hypoperfusion/ischaemia, intestinal cellular injury/damage and permeability changes are rare in young healthy individuals they can occur in physiological stress situations such as strenuous exercise (ter Steege et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). Intestinal hypoperfusion, ischaemia&#x02013;reperfusion (I&#x02013;R) and increases in core temperature during (or shortly after) strenuous exercise are primary pathways contributing to intestinal injury and changes in permeability (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Pals et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; ter Steege et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012a</xref>; Zuhl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>).</p><p>Measurement of the urinary excretion ratio between lactulose and rhamnose (<italic>L/R</italic>) is an accurate, repeatable, non-invasive method of assessing intestinal permeability. It does, however, have some limitations. This method requires ingestion of the probes and a period of fasted urine collection. Furthermore, analysis of urinary <italic>L/R</italic> can be complex, time consuming and the equipment required is not widely available (Miki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1996</xref>). Another commonly employed marker is circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS (Bosenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1988</xref>; Brock-Utne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1988</xref>; Camus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>; Jeukendrup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>). However, this is not a direct measure but rather is a potential consequence or outcome of increased permeability, and it lacks standardisation (i.e. levels may vary/not be standardised within the gut). There are also issues pertaining to the collection and analysis of blood samples in addition to the detection of LPS further suggesting that the use of this marker to assess intestinal permeability changes and/or intestinal cell injury is less than ideal (Camus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>). For these reasons, and since damage or injury to the intestinal epithelial cells is a key pathway implicated in increased permeability, markers of enterocyte damage or injury as a result of strenuous exercise are of value and desirable. One such marker that has received recent attention and has been suggested as a valid marker of intestinal cell injury or damage following exercise in humans is human Intestinal Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (I-FABP) (Morrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). I-FABP is a 15&#x000a0;kDa cytosolic protein which plays a role in the cellular uptake and metabolism of fatty acids (Ockner and Manning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1974</xref>). It is present in the mature enterocytes of the small intestinal villi and is released as soon as cell membrane integrity is compromised and subsequently appears in the circulation following enterocyte injury (half-life 11&#x000a0;min) (Thuijls et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). Therefore, in young healthy individuals plasma I-FABP following strenuous exercise can be an acute and sensitive measure of intestinal cellular injury. A previous investigation reported a significant increase in plasma I-FABP, paralleled by a significant increase in plasma <italic>L/R</italic> (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). In a subsequent study (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012b</xref>), the same group reported a significant increase in plasma I-FABP which was also paralleled with an increase in urinary <italic>L/R</italic> (5&#x000a0;h) although no direct statistical comparison was made between the increase in permeability following exercise and baseline (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012b</xref>). Therefore, it is warranted to investigate whether increases in plasma I-FABP (a marker of intestinal cellular damage) are mirrored by subsequent changes in permeability (measured by urinary <italic>L/R</italic>) using a consistent, validated and reliable method of measurement (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Mahmood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Playford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>) and an exercise protocol that is known to increase intestinal permeability (20&#x000a0;min of treadmill running at 80% <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Fourteen days of oral supplementation with bovine colostrum (Col) has previously been shown to blunt exercise (and other stressor)-induced increases in intestinal permeability (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Playford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>), hence can serve as a positive control.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was: (1) to determine whether disturbances in the intestinal barrier (increased permeability) using a well-established measurement of permeability (<italic>L/R</italic>) and a relevant exercise protocol are paralleled by changes in a marker of enterocyte damage/injury, plasma I-FABP. (2) To determine whether a positive control (Col), which is known to blunt exercise-induced changes in permeability, can also reduce post-exercise increases in plasma I-FABP. It was hypothesised that changes in permeability would be paralleled by increases in plasma I-FABP (as a marker of enterocyte injury) and that both would be blunted by 14 days of oral Col supplementation (as a positive control).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Aberystwyth University Research Ethics Committee.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a similar manner to previously reported findings (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>), we observed an increase in intestinal permeability (as measured by urinary <italic>L/R</italic>), following strenuous exercise which was blunted by 14 days of oral Col supplementation (acting as a positive control). The main findings of this study are (1) the exercise-induced change in urinary <italic>L/R</italic> was paralleled by an increase in plasma I-FABP, (2) the exercise-induced increases in urinary <italic>L/R</italic> and plasma I-FABP were both blunted by 14 days of oral Col supplementation. In the current study, presenting plasma I-FABP as absolute concentration or percentage of baseline did not change the pattern of results or overall outcome. The use of the positive control is a novel aspect of the current study which strengthens the suggestion that damage to enterocytes is implicated in permeability increases. It is important to note that plasma I-FABP is not a direct marker of compromised permeability per se, but is a marker of injury or damage to enterocytes and our findings provide evidence that this damage contributes to compromised intestinal barrier function (increased permeability).</p><p>The use of urinary <italic>L/R</italic> as a method of assessing intestinal permeability following exercise has previously been shown in this exercise model (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). The use of the same mixture of <italic>L/R</italic> (which also includes mannitol to maintain consistency and osmolality) through a series of studies (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Mahmood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Playford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>) allows reliable comparisons of the effects of exercise on intestinal barrier permeability to be made. The increase in plasma I-FABP following exercise is in agreement with previously reported observations (Morrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). During strenuous exercise, there are numerous insults that can affect the intestine, and all of these may contribute to damage and/or increased permeability. This includes heat stress from increased core body temperature, oxidative stress, mechanical damage from body movements (especially during running) and ischaemia/hypoperfusion due to reduced splanchnic blood flow (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; de Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>; Jeukendrup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>; Pires et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012a</xref>). In a recent systematic review it was reported that increases in core temperature accounted for 63% of the variance in the increase of intestinal permeability seen with exercising (Pires et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) emphasising the importance of this pathway. Reductions in intestinal perfusion are also known to be an important contributing factor. This occurs as a consequence of the redistribution of blood flow towards exercising muscles (to meet increased oxygen and substrate demand), to the skin for heat dissipation and towards tissues with increased activity such as the heart, lungs and brain (Clausen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1977</xref>). The intestines have a low hypoxia tolerance and are particularly sensitive to episodes of hypoperfusion compared to other organs as a result of the vascular architecture of the villi creating a low oxygen state at the tip (Blikslager et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). This low oxygen environment at the villus tip is exacerbated during exercise resulting in loss of intestinal cell integrity and subsequent release of I-FABP which diffuses through the interstitial space into the circulation upon enterocyte injury (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012a</xref>). However, our main aim was to explore the relationship between a marker of enterocyte damage and changes in intestinal permeability, so regardless of the mechanistic cause, we have shown that such damage to cells within the intestinal wall appears to have a key role in the subsequent increase in permeability as detected by increases in <italic>L/R</italic>. As such, assessing acute changes in I-FABP (as a marker of such damage) may be informative and has the advantage of allowing more frequent measurement times during and after exercise. However, the association between the increase in <italic>L/R</italic> and I-FABP was not the strongest and is somewhat variable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This highlights that although injury may occur to the enterocytes resulting in I-FABP release and this injury contributes to increased permeability it is not the only factor. For example, there are other components within the intestinal barrier (not just the enterocytes), which contribute to maintenance of its barrier function (e.g. tight junctions and related proteins and structures between adjoining enterocytes) and damage/injury to these structures may also compromise barrier function (independently of direct injury to enterocytes, and hence I-FABP&#x000a0;release), (Groschwitz and Hogan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>).</p><p>In the present study in the placebo arm plasma I-FABP significantly increased following exercise. An increase from 309&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;46&#x000a0;pg/mL to 615&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;118&#x000a0;pg/mL (199% increase) in plasma I-FABP following 60&#x000a0;min of cycling at 70% <italic>W</italic>
<sub>max</sub> has previously been reported (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>), which is similar to the increase reported in the current study. Further studies by the same group have reported approximately 161 and 172% increases in plasma I-FABP immediately following cessation of exercise in the same cycling protocol (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). In the present study we reported an increase in plasma I-FABP after only 20-min exercise, which could be due to greater exercise intensity and consequential greater redistributions of blood flow (ter Steege et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). Moreover, running compared to cycling elicits larger changes in core temperature, intestinal blood flow (greater musculature activation), and additional injury may be induced by mechanical stress due to the &#x0201c;up and down&#x0201d; movements of the abdominal organs encountered when performing this type of exercise (van Nieuwenhoven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Given that increases in permeability and consequent gastrointestinal complaints are associated with either long-distance strenuous running events (Brock-Utne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1988</xref>; Camus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>) or competition where running accounts for a significant proportion of the race (Bosenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1988</xref>; Camus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>; Jeukendrup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>), the exercise mode (running) employed in the current study seems appropriate in this context.</p><p>As previously mentioned I-FABP is primarily expressed in mature enterocytes in the upper half of the villi and is released into the circulation when cell membrane integrity is compromised (Derikx et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). We have previously shown that Col can increase levels of HSP70, and induce favourable changes in markers of temperature-induced apoptosis (Bax &#x003b1;, Bcl-2 caspase-3 and 9), and tight junction protein phosphorylation (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>), with the epidermal growth factor present in Col at least partly responsible (Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). Indeed apoptosis is the major cause of cell death during periods of ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion through disruptions between neighbouring cells and the extracellular matrix (Daemen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Ikeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>), which high-intensity (above 70% <italic>W</italic>

The protective cellular mechanisms induced by Col that have been demonstrated in vitro (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>), along with the findings from the present study showing concurrent reductions in plasma I-FABP and Urinary <italic>L/R</italic> in vivo support the notion that intestinal damage is a key pathway resulting in changes in intestinal permeability during and following exercise. It is important to note that the mechanism of action for Col are likely multifunctional and, therefore, its modulatory effects are probably a result of a number of constituents (Bodammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). It should also be noted that the positive control (Col) did not affect any of the physiological responses in the present study. This shows that the physiological stress/insult was comparable between trials and that the increase in permeability is due to the effects this has on the intestinal barrier (including damage to enterocytes). Furthermore, the blunting seen with Col is likely due to direct protection or repair mechanisms within the intestinal barrier rather than via any effects on physiological responses such as core temperature or splanchnic perfusion. Although we did not measure splanchnic blood flow in the present study it has been shown that reductions in intestinal blood flow during exercise can exacerbate increases in core temperature as heat is not removed from the intestine (Gil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>; Zuhl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>), so if there had been any blood flow differences between trials we would expect these to be reflected by different core temperature responses. As the core temperature responses (and other physiological responses) were no different between trials there was likely no difference in blood flow. These points are important in this context because it shows that the physiological stress presented by exercise was consistent between trials and Col acts via protective and/or repair mechanisms on the enterocytes or intestinal barrier in general (as previously mentioned and evidenced by our previous work, e.g. Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). Together this provides further evidence that exercise-induced injury to enterocytes is a contributing factor in the exercise-induced increases in intestinal permeability.</p><p>Changes in plasma I-FABP represent increases in intestinal cellular damage or injury and we have demonstrated a concomitant increase in permeability [as measured by urinary <italic>L/R</italic> (5 h)]. This finding is in contrast with a previous study where plasma I-FABP was not paralleled by changes in intestinal permeability (urinary <italic>L/R</italic>) but a shorter urine collection period (2&#x000a0;h) was used in that study (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). We used a 5-h urine collection period since longer periods of urine collection (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;h) may be the preferable method (as a result of difficulties in producing urine in the first 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h post-exercise) for assessing intestinal permeability following exercise with the dual sugar probe method (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Pals et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). Further explanations could be variances in the administration of the sugar probes or in the amount of lactulose and rhamnose (and subsequent differences in osmolality) used in the mixture. Another important point of note is the degree of hypoperfusion in the latter study (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>), which was lower than previously reported (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). We reported an average increase in core temperature of 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the present study whilst many previous studies investigating changes in both plasma I-FABP and urinary <italic>L/R</italic> have not measured core temperature (van Wijck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). Furthermore, the previous exercise investigations that report significant changes in core temperature do show a concomitant change in permeability during treadmill running (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Pals et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Pires et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Yeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of the present study is that we did not obtain resting plasma for I-FABP concentration at the same time point as the baseline Urinary <italic>L/R</italic> samples. However, we wanted to minimise the blood sampling demand on participants. Furthermore, we were most interested in the acute pre- to post-exercise increase in plasma I-FABP and are confident (although this is an assumption) that if it was possible to assess <italic>L/R</italic> pre-exercise it would have been equivalent to the baseline values. Indeed, the baseline Urinary <italic>L/R</italic> values are almost identical across the four baseline measurements and comparable to numerous other studies that have shown similar stability using the same methods and mixture of <italic>L/R</italic> (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Mahmood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Marchbank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Playford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>); therefore, we believe that it is a reasonable assumption that these baseline <italic>L/R</italic> values would be equivalent to the pre-exercise time point when plasma I-FABP was assessed (and hence baseline to post-exercise <italic>L/R</italic> is a true representation of acute post-exercise changes).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary this is the first study to demonstrate that changes in plasma I-FABP during running exercise are paralleled by increases in intestinal permeability and that both are blunted with 14 days of oral Col supplementation.
