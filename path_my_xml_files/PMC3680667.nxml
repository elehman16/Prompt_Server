As reviewed by Rader et al., stimulants have been used for decades to treat ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and remain a first-line option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP) psychostimulants have similar subjective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but somewhat different mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The selection of an AMP- or MPH-based medication as the first-choice treatment should be left to the physician, in consultation with the patient and family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ADHD treatment guidelines recommend that, if treatment with one stimulant is ineffective, an alternative stimulant should be attempted before considering second-line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is supported by crossover trials which suggest that the outcome of treatment with one stimulant is not predictive of that with the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, a greater understanding of the response to treatment in patients who have previously received a different stimulant will further assist prescribers in making informed clinical choices.</p><p>Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a long-acting prodrug stimulant approved for the treatment of ADHD in the United States and Canada for children 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years of age, adolescents 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years of age, and adults. In Europe, LDX is indicated as part of a comprehensive treatment program for ADHD in children aged 6&#x000a0;years and over, when response to previous MPH treatment is considered clinically inadequate. After oral ingestion, therapeutically inactive LDX is converted to l-lysine and active <italic>d</italic>-AMP in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. LDX was designed to have an extended duration, without the need for multiple daily dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clinical trials of LDX have demonstrated short- and long-term efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In a 7-week, open-label, dose-optimization study (study 1) of children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], LDX (20&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mg/day) was effective, as assessed by a clinician-rated symptom scale and by clinician- and parent-rated global measures. Since many children with ADHD also experience impairments in executive function (EF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and in emotional function across settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this study measured these impairments at baseline and posttreatment. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] examined real-world parent-assessed EF behaviors and the Expression and Emotion Scale for Children (EESC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] evaluated parent-rated negative/positive aspects of emotional expression in children before and during treatment. Participants significantly improved versus baseline in BRIEF and EESC total and subscale scores following LDX treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Children with ADHD exhibit impairments in the school setting, due to inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity; therefore, laboratory school models have been used to assess ADHD impact and treatments. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study (study 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] evaluated the impact of LDX treatment from dosing to 13&#x000a0;h post-dose using a laboratory school setting. The Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) scale, a clinician-rated assessment of classroom behavior with subscales for deportment (SKAMP-D) and attention (SKAMP-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a series of skill-adjusted, timed (10-min) math tests that measure ability to attend to work and effortful performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], were used. Children receiving LDX treatment had significantly improved SKAMP and PERMP scores at all time points versus placebo (1.5&#x02013;13&#x000a0;h post-dose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In studies 1 and 2, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with other pediatric studies of LDX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Given the paucity of empirical evidence on the response to stimulant medication in patients who have previously received another stimulant, the current post hoc analyses examined the effects of LDX treatment in subgroups of children who had taken MPH in the 6-month period before enrollment in studies 1 and 2, without knowledge of the outcome of this prior therapy. All participants in these two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] had at least moderately symptomatic ADHD at baseline. The study outcomes analyzed were clinician-rated ADHD symptoms and global severity, parent-rated EF behaviors and emotional expression, and investigator-assessed behavior and effortful performance. The results may help clinicians determine whether LDX is an appropriate option for patients who have recently been exposed to MPH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>These post hoc subanalyses examined the efficacy measures from two multicenter studies of the efficacy and safety of LDX conducted in children with ADHD aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years, herein referred to as study 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and study 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Study 1 was a prospective, 7-week, open-label dose-optimization study; and study 2 was a laboratory school study incorporating a 4-week dose-optimization phase, followed by a 2-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover period. Both studies enrolled children with a baseline ADHD Ratings Scale IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (ADHD-RS-IV) total score &#x02265;28, but excluded patients whose pre-study ADHD treatment provided effective control of ADHD symptoms with acceptable tolerability, and patients who had failed to respond to a course of AMP therapy of adequate dose and duration.</p><p>The subgroups for the present analyses comprised children who had been treated with MPH (MPH hydrochloride, MPH, or dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride) at any time within the 6-month period immediately prior to study enrollment.

The primary efficacy assessment was the change in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to endpoint. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the EESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the BRIEF-Parent Form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>ADHD-RS-IV is an 18-item, clinician-rated scale based on criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic> (DSM-IV-TR), with symptoms grouped into two subscales (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Each symptom item was scored from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often); total scores ranged from 0 to 54. The CGI global assessments evaluated baseline severity and improvement over time. At baseline, the CGI-Severity (CGI-S) scale rated ADHD severity from 1 (normal/not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). At all subsequent visits, the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) assessed improvement from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The EESC is a 29-item validated measure of emotional expression; total scores ranged from 29 to 145, higher scores indicating greater impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The EESC was administered at baseline and at the final study week. The BRIEF-Parent Form is an 86-item validated assessment of EF in children (5&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Study 2 included a 4-week, open-label, dose-optimization phase, followed by a crossover phase where each participant took LDX and placebo for 1&#x000a0;week each in randomized order.

In addition to a total score, subscores are calculated for deportment and attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. PERMP consists of a 5-page, 80-problem math test, and participants are scored according to the number of problems attempted and the number solved correctly in a 10-min period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. SKAMP and PERMP assessments were made 0.5&#x000a0;h pre-dose and 1.5&#x02013;13.0&#x000a0;h post-dose.

In study 1, the majority of treated participants [269/317 (84.9%)] experienced TEAEs with LDX.

In studies 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], LDX effectively reduced ADHD symptoms in children previously treated with MPH within 6&#x000a0;months of study initiation, most of whom were previously treated with long-acting MPH. For prior MPH participants, ADHD-RS-IV total scores decreased at endpoint by a mean of 64.9% in study 1. At the end of the crossover phase of study 2, mean ADHD-RS-IV total scores were lower for prior MPH participants receiving LDX (57.1% reduction) and placebo (18.1% reduction). The results were comparable with the overall populations for both studies; however, a trend that suggests a slightly lower reduction in ADHD-RS-IV scores with LDX in the prior MPH group versus the respective overall study populations exists. CGI-I results confirm the efficacy of LDX in prior MPH participants. In study 1, the mean CGI-I for prior MPH participants at endpoint was 1.6. At the end of the crossover phase of study 2, the mean CGI-I for prior MPH participants receiving LDX was 1.7 versus 3.6 when receiving placebo. These values are comparable to those of the overall study populations of study 1 (1.5) and study 2 (1.7 LDX, 3.5 placebo).</p><p>In study 2, LDX demonstrated efficacy versus placebo in children with prior MPH treatment by improving attention, behavior, and math scores as assessed with SKAMP-A, SKAMP-D, and PERMP scores, respectively. This effect was sustained from 1.5 to 13.0&#x000a0;h post-dose (last time point assessed) for SKAMP-A, SKAMP-D, and PERMP scores. Overall, the results of these analyses are in line with a similar post hoc analysis of data from a 4-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of LDX efficacy in children with ADHD that found improvements in ADHD symptoms and global illness were comparable between prior MPH users and the overall study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Clinical trials of ADHD generally focus on core ADHD symptom of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Nevertheless, ADHD is associated with impairment in EF, as reviewed by Edward Brown, which is considered by many as an essential component of ADHD etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Study 1 examined BRIEF scores as a measure of EF. LDX treatment resulted in improvements in BRIEF scores among prior MPH children, indicating that parents perceived improved EF in daily life. The magnitude of the improvement seen in BRIEF GEC score in this post hoc analysis is comparable to that in the overall study population. All BRIEF subscale scores were normalized with LDX treatment. For example, improved BRIEF subscale score for emotional control may demonstrate improvements in the child&#x02019;s ability to better manage emotional responses and, therefore, core EF behaviors such as emotional regulation and frustration modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The EESC results from study 1 suggest that LDX treatment in prior MPH children with ADHD does not negatively affect overall emotional expression. Children with ADHD have significantly worse scores on measures of emotional well-being than children without ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although this has not been established in clinical trials, emotional flattening resulting from stimulants is a concern of clinicians and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The magnitude of improvement in the EESC total score for prior MPH children in this analysis was comparable to the overall study.</p><p>Differential clinical response rates to stimulant treatment are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Due to suboptimal treatment of ADHD, alternative stimulants should be evaluated to improve patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Clinical response rate can be improved to an estimated 92% when stimulants are tried sequentially, after one has failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There has been limited systematic evaluation of patient outcomes after switching stimulants. The authors&#x02019; findings suggest that LDX may provide effective symptom control in children with ADHD who have had prior MPH exposure. A substantial proportion of participants in both studies achieved symptomatic remission, suggesting that LDX treatment in children previously treated with MPH had improved ADHD symptoms. Based on the study data, many patients previously treated with MPH may respond well to LDX and achieve symptomatic remission, although overall remission rates may be slightly lower in prior MPH-treated patients. These results agree with those of a recent post hoc analysis which found that children with significant ADHD symptoms despite MPH treatment improved on LDX to a similar degree to the overall study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Both studies were not prospectively designed to examine the effects of LDX on MPH nonresponders; hence, the interpretation of the findings from this manuscript was confounded by the post hoc nature of the analyses. Study 1 was limited by the lack of a placebo group for comparison. In contrast, study 2 was strengthened by the utilization of the placebo-controlled laboratory school setting and the blinded design of the crossover phase. The dose-optimization phase of both studies allowed assessment of participants at optimal doses, closely approximating clinical practice in medication dosing. Another limitation was that participants were not necessarily taking MPH immediately before screening (only had taken MPH within 6&#x000a0;months of study), which limits extrapolation of these findings. There were no comparable reports of symptom control on prior MPH using the ADHD-RS-IV or other study measures, and often precise dates for initiation/termination of prior treatment were missing. Nor was there control over patient compliance/adherence to the prior MPH regimen. Since participants who were responding well to, and tolerating, their prior medication were excluded from both studies of the overall study populations, it is presumed that enrolled participants were those who may have discontinued MPH therapy due to poor efficacy or tolerability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For children with ADHD who were previously treated with MPH, LDX may be an efficacious treatment option, by significantly reducing ADHD symptoms, improving EF and emotional expression as well as attention and deportment in the laboratory school setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Clinical research and the article processing charges were funded by the sponsor, Shire Development LLC under the direction of the authors.
