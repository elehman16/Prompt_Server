Topical azole antifungals are commonly used in their treatment but literature suggests that most require twice-daily application and provide lower cure rates than the allylamine antifungal terbinafine. We conducted a head-to-head comparison of the effectiveness of the once-daily topical azole, sertaconazole, with terbinafine in these infections.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, observer-blind, parallel group study (Clinical Trial Registry India [CTRI]/2014/09/005029) with adult patients of either sex presenting with localized lesions. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by potassium hydroxide smear microscopy of skin scrapings. After baseline assessment of erythema, scaling, and pruritus, patients applied either of the two study drugs once daily for 2 weeks. If clinical cure was not seen at 2 weeks, but improvement was noted, application was continued for further 2 weeks. Patients deemed to be clinical failure at 2 weeks were switched to oral antifungals.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Overall 88 patients on sertaconazole and 91 on terbinafine were analyzed. At 2 weeks, the clinical cure rates were comparable at 77.27% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.52%&#x02013;86.03%) for sertaconazole and 73.63% (95% CI 64.57%&#x02013;82.68%) for terbinafine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.606). Fourteen patients in either group improved and on further treatment showed complete healing by another 2 weeks. The final cure rate at 4 weeks was also comparable at 93.18% (95% CI 88.75%&#x02013;97.62%) and 89.01% (95% CI 82.59%&#x02013;95.44%), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.914).

It is the only azole with a fungicidal action due to its ability to cause direct fungal cell membrane damage.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The available topical formulation of sertaconazole (2%) attains fungicidal concentration in the stratum corneum as the lipophilic property of the benzothiophene ring enables prolonged dermal retention.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This permits just once-daily application contrary to most other topical azoles.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Sertaconazole has additional anti-inflammatory and antipruritic actions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It has shown efficacy even against dermatophyte isolates resistant to other azoles.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Its faster and superior cure rates as compared to other azoles are well documented.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy profile and dosage convenience of sertaconazole appear to be similar to that of terbinafine. However, few head-to-head comparisons have been done. The present study sought to assess whether these two topical agents differ significantly in their cure rates in case of the common localized dermatophyte infections.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was designed as a randomized, observer-blind, parallel group, controlled clinical trial and conducted in the dermatology outpatient department of a large tertiary care teaching hospital. Permission was taken from the institutional ethics committee before commencement. The study is registered with Clinical Trial Registry India [CTRI/2014/09/005029].</p><p>For sample size calculation, the clinical cure rate was taken as the primary outcome measure. Available literature indicates that as much as 15% difference can be expected between the cure rates of the two types of drugs with maximum cure rates in excess of 90%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Taking Type I error probability as 5%, power of the study as 80%, two-sided testing and attrition rate as 10%, we estimated a recruitment target of 105 patients in each group. The calculation was done using nMaster 2.0 (Department of Biostatistics, Christian Medical College, Vellore) software.</p><p>Consenting adult patients (18&#x02013;65 years age) of either sex presenting with localized tinea lesions, without nail or scalp involvement, and without any secondary bacterial infection over the lesions were recruited who provided that they had not applied any topical or taken any oral antifungal drug before the baseline visit. Diabetic, immunocompromised, pregnant, and lactating patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>During screening, if recruitment was an option, the protocol was explained in vernacular to the patient. If the patient provided written informed consent, scrapings were taken from the lesion and subjected to potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear microscopy. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of fungal hyphae in the scrapings.</p><p>Based on previous studies, each patient was assessed on three parameters, namely, erythema, scaling, and pruritus, which were graded on a 4-point scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Erythema and scaling were graded by the dermatologist. Pruritus was graded under direct supervision of the dermatologist with a 10 cm long visual analog scale.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>A member of the study team, not otherwise involved in day-to-day patient care, assigned the codes &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; to the two topical agents. Based on a software-generated random allocation sequence, the sealed tubes were concealed in identical, fabric-lined, sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. After obtaining the baseline scores, the envelope bearing the appropriate serial number was opened and the number noted in the prescription record and case report form (CRF). Patients were instructed to apply the medication over the lesion, without rubbing, once daily for 2 weeks. They were to report for the first follow-up visit after 2 weeks along with the used medication tubes. In case of significant local irritation, they were to withhold the ongoing medication and inform the observer. A separate enrollment log with each patient's identity and contact number was maintained for urgent communication (if necessary) by the same member who assigned the codes.</p><p>During the follow-up visit at 2 weeks, the lesions were clinically reexamined by the dermatologist. Based on previous studies, &#x0201c;complete clinical cure&#x0201d; was defined as the complete absence of erythema, scaling, and pruritus and the dermatologist's impression of a &#x0201c;cleared&#x0201d; lesion. This was the primary end point[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and clinically cured patients were regarded as &#x0201c;treatment completed&#x0201d; [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>]. If a patient showed only partial improvement after the first 2 weeks, the assessment parameters were graded once more and a fresh supply of the ongoing medication was provided in a separate, opaque, sealed envelope bearing only the code &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; on its face. These patients were to report after another 2 weeks.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) A case of tinea corporis (abdominal skin).

Since the modified intention-to-treat strategy was to include patients who appeared for at least one postbaseline visit, this data set essentially were equal in numbers to the per protocol dataset. Thus, 88 recipients of sertaconazole and 91 of terbinafine were finally analyzed.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Scheme depicting flow of study participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-48-659-g003"/></fig><p>As seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the two groups did not differ significantly in age and gender distribution.

After the first 2 weeks of topical therapy, the clinical cure rates of sertaconazole (77.27%; 95% CI 68.52%&#x02013;86.03%) and terbinafine (73.63%; 95% CI 64.57%&#x02013;82.68%) did not differ significantly between groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.606). A total of 6 recipients of sertaconazole and 10 recipients of terbinafine were diagnosed as &#x0201c;clinical failure&#x0201d; and switched to oral antifungal drugs. The clinical performance distribution overall was comparable between groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.620 by Chi-square test).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Clinical performance of the study medication at 2 weeks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-48-659-g005"/></table-wrap><p>In each group, 14 patients showed partial improvement after the first 2 weeks. Within each group, the total and individual scores of erythema, scaling, and pruritus of these 14 patients at 2 weeks were compared with their baseline scores. Both total and individual symptom scores showed a significant improvement from baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) in each group although clinical cure was not achieved at 2 weeks in these patients. Repeat KOH microscopy was not performed.</p><p>For the 28 patients (14 in each group) with partial improvement at 2 weeks, the number of patients with relatively milder grades of erythema, scaling, and pruritus vis-a-vis more severe grades were compared between the two groups. The distributions were comparable. All these 28 patients who needed topical therapy beyond 2 weeks ultimately achieved complete clinical cure within 4 weeks. The overall cure rates achieved were thus 82 out of 88 for sertaconazole (93.18%; 95% CI 88.75%&#x02013;97.62%) and 81 out of 91 for terbinafine (89.01%; 95% CI 82.59%&#x02013;95.44%), which was again statistically not a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.914).</p><p>During the entire duration of the study, both applications were well tolerated and essentially no local or systemic adverse events were captured. Compliance was satisfactory in all patients who reported back, as judged from the condition of the medication tubes (though these were not weighed), and there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, majority of the patients receiving either of the study drugs achieved complete clearing of tinea lesions within the first 2 weeks of topical treatment. Even those who needed treatment beyond 2 weeks achieved significant improvement in erythema, scaling, and pruritus within 2 weeks. Overall, around 93% of sertaconazole recipients and 89% of terbinafine recipients achieved complete clinical cure within 4 weeks of treatment while the rest had to be switched to systemic antifungal therapy. Cure rates were slightly higher with sertaconazole but did not differ significantly from that of terbinafine. These results suggest that though topical terbinafine has proven superior to topical azoles in several studies, the cure rates of the relatively new azole antifungal, sertaconazole did not differ significantly from that of terbinafine. The absence of significant differences between the two is possibly due to the unique fungicidal action of sertaconazole which includes direct fungal cell membrane damage and subsequent leakage of intracellular contents.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The absence of significant differences between the cure rates of these two drugs has also been reported by Choudhary <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in a study conducted in the Western part of India. The differences from the present study were that no &#x0201c;failures&#x0201d; were reported and the sample size was 15 per group. We speculate that a difference in the sample size as well as recent emergence of antifungal-resistant strains among dermatophytes may have accounted for this difference.</p><p>Thaker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] compared the cure rates of topical sertaconazole and topical butenafine in localized epidermal tinea infections and reported a significant reduction of sign and symptom scores at the first follow-up visit. Choudhary <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also reported that after the first 2 weeks, there was hardly any scale left over in either sertaconazole or terbinafine recipients to perform KOH microscopy. A nearly identical scenario was encountered in the present study among those patients who needed topical therapy beyond 2 weeks.</p><p>In another comparative study between sertaconazole and terbinafine, Jerajani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] detected that the antipruritic efficacy of sertaconazole was significantly superior to that of terbinafine. In the present study, the antipruritic effect suggested a possible trend in favor of sertaconazole though the numbers were too small to yield statistical significance. Furthermore, this study was on localized tinea lesions without marked inflammatory features such as pustules, vesicles, or crust formation. Thus, a difference, even if it exists, was not discernable. A similar explanation was given by Vidhya Lakshmi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who compared the efficacies of topical terbinafine and topical luliconazole, another newer azole. A significant improvement in the baseline scores of disease parameters was reported after the first 2 weeks in case of both the drugs.</p><p>The present study detected a failure rate of approximately 11% among terbinafine and 7% among sertaconazole recipients. Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have reported resistance to terbinafine. Six isolates of <italic>T. rubrum</italic> were obtained sequentially from an onychomycosis patient who failed to respond to oral terbinafine (250 mg daily for 24 weeks). All the isolates were resistant to terbinafine but sensitive to itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin. A target-specific mechanism of resistance was suggested. Resistance to sertaconazole has been documented by Croxtall <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who detected 4% resistance among 250 clinical isolates of dermatophytes. This resistance, though small in quantum at present, remains a worrying feature for clinicians.</p><p>Azoles usually need twice-daily application. An interesting aspect of the present study was that sertaconazole showed comparable results with terbinafine even with once-daily application. This could be attributed to its prolonged retention in the stratum corneum on account of the lipophilicity of its benzothiophene ring.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The tolerability of the two drugs was excellent in this study. A similar view is shared by authors of earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Jerajani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported that in their study, only a single sertaconazole recipient withdrew because of contact dermatitis.</p><p>The present study has its share of limitations. Due to logistic constraints, blinding was not possible. Hence, only an observer-blind procedure was implemented. Fungal culture, species identification, and determination of resistance patterns among dermatophytes could not be done. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two topical drugs was not compared in other variants of tinea beyond localized uncomplicated infections on the trunk, limbs, or groin.</p><p>Nonetheless, we can still conclude that the performance of the azole sertaconazole does not differ significantly from the established fungicidal agent terbinafine in localized epidermal dermatophytosis. Further studies are required to compare their effectiveness in other variants of tinea and in patients with comorbidities or immunocompromised status.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial Support and
