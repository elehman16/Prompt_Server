The pharmacokinetic profile of mifepristone is characterized as nonlinear with less than dose-proportional increases in serum concentration following increased single or multiple doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Following oral administration, mifepristone is rapidly absorbed with time to peak plasma concentrations between 1 and 2&#x000a0;h after single doses and 1 and 4&#x000a0;h after multiple doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The half-life of mifepristone is ~&#x000a0;85&#x000a0;h, with time to steady state achieved within 2&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Mifepristone is metabolized primarily via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4, yielding three active metabolites RU 42633 (mono-demethylated), RU 42848 (di-demethylated), and RU 42698 (hydroxylated) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The metabolites are each less potent than mifepristone at the glucocorticoid receptor; the affinities of RU 42633, RU 42848, and RU&#x000a0;42698 to the glucocorticoid receptor are 61%, 45%, and 48%, respectively, compared with 100% for mifepristone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mifepristone has also been shown under in vitro conditions to inhibit as well as induce CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to CS, mifepristone has also been studied in other patient populations, including those with psychotic depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and it is currently being evaluated as a concomitant treatment in certain forms of breast and prostate cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02014337, NCT02788981, NCT02012296) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because mifepristone is a substrate of CYP3A4, it is important to examine the effects of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on its pharmacokinetic parameters. Typically an area under the curve (AUC) increase of at least 5-fold in the presence of a strong inhibitor indicates a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The AEs were categorized as mostly mild in severity; four moderate AEs occurred, including three during period&#x000a0;1 (hypertension, rash, and vomiting) and one during period&#x000a0;2 (headache). There were no serious AEs or events of adrenal insufficiency reported during the study.</p><p id="Par35">Two participants were discontinued from the study during period&#x000a0;1. One subject with elevated blood pressure upon study entry was discontinued on day&#x000a0;6 after the 5th dose of mifepristone because of moderate hypertension. The AE was classified by the investigator to be possibly related to mifepristone; however, an alternate etiology of anxiety was also noted. One other subject was discontinued on day&#x000a0;11 after the 10th dose of mifepristone because of a moderate bilateral rash, which was classified by the investigator as related to mifepristone and resolved within 4&#x000a0;days without sequelae. Mildly elevated liver enzymes were reported for one subject during the mifepristone plus ketoconazole dosing period, starting approximately 1&#x000a0;day after the first dose of ketoconazole. During the concomitant dosing period, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase ranged from 45 to 76 U/L (normal range 0&#x02013;37&#x000a0;U/L) and 85 to 126 U/L (normal range 6&#x02013;45 U/L), respectively. Both returned to normal ranges during the washout period. There were no clinically meaningful changes in hematology, biochemistry, ECG, urinalysis findings, or orthostatic vital signs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study was conducted to examine the pharmacokinetic effects following concomitant mifepristone and ketoconazole administration. Coadministration of mifepristone 600&#x000a0;mg daily plus ketoconazole 200&#x000a0;mg twice daily resulted in a mean increase in exposure to mifepristone of approximately 28% for <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and 38% for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>. The increased exposure was approximately 85% of the maximum exposure following the highest labeled dose of mifepristone (1200&#x000a0;mg) and less than the at least 5-fold increase needed to be considered a sensitive substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Coadministration with ketoconazole had little effect on the exposure to mifepristone&#x02019;s mono-demethylated (RU 42633) or di-demethylated (RU 42848) metabolites; exposure to the hydroxylated metabolite (RU 42698) increased by approximately 70%. The mechanisms for the increased exposure to this metabolite could not be determined from this study. While it is unknown what the clinical effect of the increased exposure to the RU 42698 metabolite would be, its lower affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor than mifepristone likely minimizes its clinical importance relative to the exposure to mifepristone and the other active metabolites.</p><p id="Par37">As expected, the GLSM <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and interval AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> of ketoconazole following multiple doses of ketoconazole 200&#x000a0;mg twice daily plus mifepristone was substantially higher (2.53- and 3.65-fold) than the <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> following a single dose of ketoconazole 200&#x000a0;mg. The increased interval AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> (day&#x000a0;17) vs AUC<sub>inf</sub> after a single dose (day&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;1) is consistent with the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole, which has shown greater than expected increases in AUC following multiple dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Factors contributing to the increased exposure to ketoconazole in this analysis could include inhibition of CYP3A4 by mifepristone and/or autoinhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole.</p><p id="Par38">Serum cortisol and plasma ACTH significantly increased over baseline with mifepristone alone and when combined with ketoconazole. These increases are in line with the competitive glucocorticoid receptor antagonistic effects of mifepristone. Similar increases in ACTH and cortisol have been observed with mifepristone administration in other healthy (non-CS) populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While ACTH remained elevated with the addition of ketoconazole, serum cortisol significantly decreased with concomitant ketoconazole compared with mifepristone alone, likely due to the inhibition of steroidogenesis by ketoconazole. However, it remains to be determined what the pharmacodynamic effects of concomitant ketoconazole and mifepristone would be in patients with baseline hypercortisolism and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction.</p><p id="Par39">AEs observed during the study were mostly mild or moderate in severity and were generally consistent with the known safety profiles of mifepristone and ketoconazole. Overall, similar rates of drug-related AEs were reported during period&#x000a0;1 and period&#x000a0;2, and there was no evidence that would suggest an increase in AEs under the conditions studied.</p><p id="Par40">In order to optimize the possibility of detecting a potential drug&#x02013;drug interaction between mifepristone and ketoconazole both compounds were administered with food to increase their absorption. The doses used for each compound in this study were within the recommended clinical doses for each agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; however, the median dose used for ketoconazole in the long-term off-label treatment of CS is higher (600&#x000a0;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic profile of mifepristone assessed at steady state before concomitant ketoconazole was generally consistent with the known pharmacokinetic profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Also, increases in cortisol and ACTH levels were seen, as expected, following repeated mifepristone administration during period&#x000a0;1. These findings suggest that the pharmacokinetic analysis provided an accurate assessment of the effects of ketoconazole on mifepristone.</p><p id="Par41">There are several limitations of this study that must also be considered. Although multiple doses of ketoconazole were administered using the maximum recommended dose, the duration of concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (5&#x000a0;days) may not have been long enough to observe the full magnitude of inhibition by ketoconazole on mifepristone because of the long half-life of mifepristone. The rationale for shortening the duration of treatment with ketoconazole was based on its known hepatotoxicity potential. Likewise, the analysis of the effects of mifepristone on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was also designed to limit exposure to ketoconazole, but as a result, the comparison of ketoconazole pharmacokinetics before and during concomitant mifepristone may have overestimated the contribution of mifepristone, by comparing a single dose vs multiple dosing. Of note, since the completion of this study, the FDA has advised using alternate strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as itraconazole or clarithromycin, over ketoconazole in clinical pharmacokinetic studies because of the risk of liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the cross-study comparison, both studies included healthy subjects and used similar dosing conditions (fed state) and pharmacokinetic blood sampling schedules; however, the subject variability may have impacted the results. Furthermore, because the analysis was conducted in healthy subjects, the effects of concomitant dosing on the various aspects of clinical disease status are unknown, which limits the conclusions that can be made regarding definitive dosing recommendations.</p><p id="Par42">On the basis of the results of this study, it is recommended that the dose of mifepristone be limited to 600&#x000a0;mg daily when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor like ketoconazole. However, because of mifepristone&#x02019;s long half-life and nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile, with less than proportional increases in exposure with increasing doses, additional studies may be needed to determine if longer durations of concomitant administration and/or using mifepristone doses beyond 600&#x000a0;mg will produce exposure within the acceptable ranges. This is of clinical importance because of the dose-dependent effects at the glucocorticoid receptor, and an additional assessment of mifepristone efficacy and safety in patients with CS has noted trends toward improved efficacy at the higher dose ranges of mifepristone and with no discernable increase in AEs with increasing dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">Together these data indicate increased pharmacokinetic exposure to mifepristone following mifepristone 600&#x000a0;mg combined with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. The increase in systemic exposure was within the exposure bounds of the maximum 1200&#x000a0;mg dose of mifepristone. Dose adjustment of mifepristone may be required when coadministering mifepristone and ketoconazole.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D5BCF0602C731D7F">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D5BCF0602C731D7F</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study, the article processing charges, and the open access fee were funded by Corcept Therapeutics.
