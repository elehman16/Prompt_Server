chloroquine, an antimalarial agent, has shown some antiviral effects, this study
evaluated its effect in patients with dengue. A randomised, double-blind study
was performed by administering chloroquine or placebo for three days to 129
patients with dengue-related symptoms. Of these patients, 37 were confirmed as
having dengue and completed the study; in total, 19 dengue patients received
chloroquine and 18 received placebo. There was no significant difference in the
duration of the disease or the degree and days of fever. However, 12 patients
(63%) with confirmed dengue reported a substantial decrease in pain intensity
and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily activities (p =
0.0004) while on the medication and the symptoms returned immediately after
these patients stopped taking the medication. The same effect was not observed
in patients with diseases other than dengue. Therefore, this study shows that
patients with dengue treated with chloroquine had an improvement in their
quality of life and were able to resume their daily activities. However, as
chloroquine did not alter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days
of fever, further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical effects and to
assess the side effects of chloroquine in dengue patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>therapeutics</kwd><kwd>chloroquine</kwd><kwd>activities of daily living</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support: FAPESP (2005/04450-4)</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p id="para2">Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection of humans and
represents an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas. The
World Health Organization estimates that approximately 2.5 billion people in 100
countries are at risk of infection. It is reported that over 100 million people are
infected with dengue viruses (DENV) every year; of these individuals, 500,000 develop a
severe form, leading to approximately 20,000 deaths annually (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Pinheiro &#x00026; Corber 1997</xref>).</p><p id="para3">Dengue results from infection by one of four DENV serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2,
DENV-3 and DENV-4. These viruses belong to the Flaviviridae family and are transmitted
to humans through the bite of female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The
clinical manifestations of dengue range from a mild flu-like syndrome, occasionally
associated with a rash (dengue fever) to a more severe form of the disease that is
associated with plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage (dengue haemorrhagic
fever) and/or shock (dengue shock syndrome). No dengue vaccine or effective antiviral
agent is available for the treatment of dengue infection (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Valero &#x00026; Levy 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Noble et
al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="para4">As in many other countries in Latin America, the Brazilian population has been
seriously affected by dengue infections. Indeed, approximately 80% of the reported
dengue cases in the Americas occur in Brazil and more than one million cases have been
reported in all five Brazilian geographic Regions in the last few years (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Schatzmayr 2000</xref>).</p><p id="para5">Chloroquine has been primarily used as an antimalarial drug and, due its
anti-inflammatory effects, has been used as a secondary drug to treat a variety of
chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Tutor-Ureta &#x00026; Yebra-Bango 2005</xref>). Recently,
several efforts have been made to identify an effective, inexpensive and universally
available antiviral agent. Chloroquine has been suggested as such an agent (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al. 2006</xref>) and has been shown to exert
antiviral effects by inhibiting the replication of flaviviruses (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Randolph et al. 1990</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et
al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="para6">Therefore, due to the need for an effective treatment for dengue and based on
the anti-inflammatory and possible anti-flavivirus effects of chloroquine, we
hypothesised that chloroquine could have a clinical benefit in dengue infection.</p><sec><title>PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p id="para7">We set up a double-blind, randomised study that administered either
chloroquine or placebo (starch) to patients suspected of having dengue disease.
Patients were included in the study if they presented with dengue-related symptoms,
such as fever and at least two other symptoms, such as headache, retro-orbital pain,
muscle and bone or joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rash, for less than 72 h.
Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, younger than 18 years old or had
either cardiac or neurologic disease. Once entered into the study, the patients were
randomised in a double-blind fashion to receive either 500 mg chloroquine (300 mg
base) BID or an identical-appearing placebo BID for three days (control group). In
addition to the use of either chloroquine or placebo, both groups were similarly
treated with hydration and symptomatic medication, such as analgesic and antipyretic
drugs, according to medical prescription.</p><p id="para8">Three diagnostic tests were performed according to well-defined protocols
[reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, IgM antibody capture ELISA and the
non structural 1 (NS1) antigen detection] on all the samples (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Innis et al. 1989</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti
et al. 1992</xref>, <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Dussart et al. 2006</xref>,
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Castro-Jorge et al. 2010</xref>). Dengue was
confirmed when at least two diagnostic tests were positive. The patients were
re-evaluated one week later and clinical data associated with dengue symptoms, such
as fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, muscle, bone or joint pain, nausea and
vomiting were recorded as well as symptoms related to the side effects of
chloroquine. The axillary temperature was objectively measured and considered
abnormal (fever) when &#x02265; 37.8&#x000b0;C. Other variables were obtained actively and
objectively during a medical consultation using a research form.</p><p id="para9">This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00849602). The study
was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Hospital of the School of
Medicine of Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, process 12603/2006, and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p id="para10">The data are presented as the means &#x000b1; standard deviations and number of
patients (%). Differences between the two study groups were assessed using an
unpaired <italic>t</italic> test for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact test for
proportions. All p values were two-sided and all analyses were performed with the
use of GraphPad Software, version 3.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="para11">The study was conducted from mid-February to the first week of May of
2008. One hundred thirty-two patients were assessed for eligibility: three did not
meet the inclusion criteria and 129 underwent randomisation. The patients enrolled
in the study were adults (mean age, 31.64 &#x000b1; 11.74 years), were predominantly female
(51.2%) and reported a mean average duration of symptoms of 41.52 &#x000b1; 20.16 h. Of the
129 patients, 63 were randomised to receive chloroquine and 66 were randomised to
receive placebo. Seventy-five patients had other febrile diseases (OFDs) and 54 were
confirmed to have dengue. Of the dengue patients, 17 refused to participate and 37
completed the study. Of these patients, 19 received chloroquine (mean age, 32.72 &#x000b1;
11.50 years; male, 42%; duration of symptoms, 1.94 &#x000b1; 0.90 day) and 18 patients
received placebo (mean age, 36.74 &#x000b1; 11.83 years; male, 56%; duration of symptoms,
1.56 &#x000b1; 0.73 day). No patient exhibited the severe form of the disease (dengue
haemorrhagic fever) and/or shock (dengue shock syndrome) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table</xref>). There was no significant difference between group
characteristics (p &#x0003e; 0.05) and the most frequent symptoms were fever (100%), body
ache (99.2%), headache (96.8%), joint pain (70.4%) and retro-orbital pain (68%).
There was no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the intensity
and days of fever among the dengue patients treated with either chloroquine or
placebo. However, 12 (63%) of the dengue patients reported a substantial reduction
in the intensity of pain and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily
chores after taking chloroquine, whereas no improvement was reported by the patients
taking placebo (p = 0.0004) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table</xref>).
However, as this finding was not observed in the patients with OFDs, which included
bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and influenza, these diseases were not
included in the statistical evaluation because the primary goal of this study was to
examine the influence of chloroquine on the evolution of dengue disease.
Interestingly, the symptoms returned immediately after the patients stopped taking
the three-day chloroquine treatment, showing that chloroquine's effect was most
likely due to the anti-inflammatory action of chloroquine rather than to its
antiviral effect.</p><p>

and days of fever compared to the dengue patients taking placebo. However, the
patients taking chloroquine reported a substantial reduction in the intensity of
pain and a great improvement in their health status.</p><p id="para14">Dengue is a worldwide health problem that affects millions of people and
causes innumerable deaths, particularly in the tropical and subtropical areas of the
world. Controlling the viral vector is currently the only option for reducing dengue
disease rates, as there is no a vaccine or effective antiviral agent available for
the treatment of dengue infections. Accordingly, it is important to identify
treatment strategies that could reduce the burden of this disease (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Valero &#x00026; Levy 2008</xref>).</p><p id="para15">Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinoline known since 1934 that has a long
history of use as an antimalarial agent and as an alternative drug to treat a
variety of chronic diseases (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al.
2003</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Tutor-Ureta &#x00026; Yebra-Bango
2005</xref>). The rationales for using chloroquine in dengue patients include
the drug's anti-inflammatory property, possible antiviral effect, with action on
flaviviruses, low cost, universal availability and safety and global public health
importance of dengue. Recently, a potential use of chloroquine has been described in
some viral infections, such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti
et al. 1992</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al. 2003</xref>,
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Vincent et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al.
2007</xref>, Di Trani et al. 2007, <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et
al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Martinson et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="para16">One possible explanation for the antiviral effect of chloroquine could be
related to the impairment of viral replication by raising the intracellular pH and
thereby interfering with endosome-mediated viral entry. An increase in pH in acidic
organelles, including endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles, leads to unwanted
changes in the post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins,
particularly the inhibition of glycosylation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Rolain et al.
2007</xref>). These effects are of particular importance in DENV infection
because these viruses require endosomal acidification to release their viral RNA in
the cytoplasm to initiate viral replication (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Lindenbach &#x00026; Rice 2003</xref>). Other possible antiviral actions of
chloroquine are based on either interference with the post-translational processing
of viral glycoproteins, leading to imperfect glycosylation or to undefined
interference with the late stages of viral replication (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of action of chloroquine has not
been completely elucidated and differs depending on different pathogens (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Rolain et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p id="para17">
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Tricou et al. (2010)</xref> evaluated the effect of
chloroquine in hospitalised adult patients with dengue and found no difference in
viraemia or NS1 antigenaemia duration and modest anti-pyretic activity for
chloroquine in the intention-to-treat population, but not in dengue
laboratory-confirmed cases. Moreover, these researchers observed a trend toward a
lower incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in dengue patients treated with
chloroquine.</p><p id="para18">In our study, there was also no difference in the duration of disease or
days of fever in dengue patients taking either chloroquine or placebo. However, the
patients taking chloroquine in addition to routine analgesic drugs had a substantial
reduction in the intensity of pain and a great improvement in health status. The
pain amelioration observed in the enrolled patients taking chloroquine was not
quantified by pain scales, which is a limitation of our study. However, we
objectively inquired about and evaluated the dengue-related symptoms, including
pain, in all patients during acute disease and one week later, at the time when the
patients returned for a clinical evaluation during convalescence.</p><p id="para19">We hypothesised that the clinical benefit observed in dengue patients
treated with chloroquine could be due to the drug's anti-inflammatory effects,
particularly because chloroquine is a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; inhibitor and
some of the clinical manifestations in dengue patients are due to high levels of
serum TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Hober et al. 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Pinto et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Gandini et al. 2011</xref>). Another possible effect of chloroquine
in dengue patients could be related to its antiviral action, lowering the viral load
and thus the degree of immune system activation. Other studies with different
therapeutic doses, different durations and an earlier onset of treatment should be
performed to evaluate the in vivo effect of chloroquine on dengue infection.
Moreover, it would be interesting to compare the effect of other anti-inflammatory
compounds on the treatment of dengue patients; however, non-steroidal drugs should
be avoided in the care of these patients.</p><p id="para20">One limitation of this study was the small number of patients treated
with chloroquine. Although only a small number of dengue patients were included in
the study, approximately 63% reported an improvement in their symptoms while on the
medication and the symptoms returned immediately after the patients stopped taking
the medication. This finding indicates that chloroquine is a possible candidate for
use in the treatment of dengue. In addition, the side effects of chloroquine
observed in this study were unremarkable.</p><p id="para21">Although chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, it is usually well
tolerated. Adverse effects, such as headache, nausea, malaise, dizziness, blurred
vision, difficulty focusing, mild gastrointestinal upset and pruritus, may commonly
occur. Severe toxicity, e.g., neuromyopathy, retinopathy and bone-marrow toxicity,
is rare and may occur with long-term treatment and/or as an idiosyncratic reaction (
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Taylor &#x00026; White 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Alkadi 2007</xref>). Chloroquine may worsen
psoriasis, though is rarely associated with seizures and psychosis. Acute toxicity
is most frequently found with therapeutic or high doses administered too rapidly by
parenteral routes (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">AlKadi 2007</xref>). Toxic
effects are related to the ingested dose and a single dose of 20 mg/kg is considered
toxic (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Taylor &#x00026; White 2004</xref>). In this
study, a safety dose of 600 mg per day for three days was used in adults and the
side effects were unremarkable. Furthermore, the chloroquine dosage used in this
study is very similar to the dosage used for vivax malaria treatment and, in our
experience, side effects are rare with this treatment. However, considering the
small number of patients, more studies are necessary to evaluate the safety of
chloroquine in dengue patients.</p><p id="para22">In conclusion, chloroquine promoted a reduction in the intensity of pain
and an improvement in the well-being of patients with dengue infection, but did not
alter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever. Therefore,
considering that the current options for dengue treatment are very limited, we
suggest that chloroquine should be further tested in dengue disease with a larger
number of patients and different chloroquine dosages and times of administration to
confirm the drug's clinical effect and to assess the side effects of chloroquine in
dengue patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B01"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adachi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ichinose</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Takizawa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kitazato</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>Inhibition of betanodavirus infection by inhibitors
