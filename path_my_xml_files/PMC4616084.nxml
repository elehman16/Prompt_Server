training on the physical function and psychological problems of stroke patients. [Subjects
and Methods] Thirty stroke patients were divided evenly into an experimental group and a
control group. Both groups carried out neurodevelopmental treatment. The experimental
group additionally performed mechanical horseback riding training for 30 minutes a day, 5
days a week, for 6 weeks. Physical function was evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale
(BBS) and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT). Psychological problems were assessed using the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In order to compare differences within groups between
before and after the experiment, the paired t test was conducted. In order to compare
differences between groups before and after the experiment, the independent t test was
conducted. [Results] In the experimental group, the BBS, TUGT, and BDI showed significant
improvements after the intervention. The experimental group&#x02019;s BBS, TUGT, and BDI
post-intervention changes were significantly better than those observed in the control
group. [Conclusion] According to our results, horseback riding training has a positive
effect on the physical function and psychological problems of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Horseback riding training</kwd><kwd>Physical function</kwd><kwd>Psychological problems</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a cerebrovascular event in which a blood vessel of the brain either becomes
blocked or ruptured<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neurological
loss is determined by the occurrence area, which may stimulate psychological disorders of
anger and depression, and physical function disorders affecting factors such as sensory,
exercise, balance, and walking ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke may cause posture instability due to
weakening of muscular strength and anesthesia, making it difficult to maintain balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The loss of balance limits daily activities and the gait of stroke patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Depression may occur in cases without a history mental illness and is a common psychological
problem among stroke patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a
complication that may occur either acutely or during recovery<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical function recovery becomes delayed in patients who have
depression, which decreases their quality of life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, stroke patients must be
comprehensively treated for both physical function disorders and depression.</p><p>Horseback riding is receiving attention as a method that preserves function in patients
with physical disability or patients with damaged motor ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rhythmical and repetitive movement of the horse
stimulates all of the senses in order to rotate the center of the body upwards and downwards
and to the left, and right<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been
reported that this is similar to the movement pattern of the pelvis when a person is
walking<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horse-riding movements increase physical function, improving
muscular strength, agility, balance, weight support, coordination, and blood
circulation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also have a positive influence on psychological problems,
including self-esteem, pride, motivation, and space perception<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it has been
reported to help the physical recovery of patients who have cerebral palsy, multiple
sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord damage<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies of horseback riding have been conducted, but there is still insufficient
information about how horseback riding influences physical and psychological functions.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to find out how horseback riding influences physical and
psychological function, as well as to suggest an effective treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 30 stroke patients as subjects and divided the patients into two
groups: 15 (8 males and 7 females) in the experimental group, and 15 (8 males and 7 females)
in the control group. Subjects with no visual disability, no orthopedic diseases in the
upper or lower limbs, who scored more than 24 points in Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), and who were able to walk more than 10 meters using auxiliary equipment were
selected. All the participants were informed about the research purpose and provided their
informed consent before the experiment. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Seonam University and was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The general characteristics of the subjects are

height of 168.6&#x000b1;7.1&#x02005;cm, an average weight of 71.2&#x000b1;3.2&#x02005;kg, and an average time since stroke
onset of 11.5&#x000b1;2.1 months. The control group had an average age of 67.0&#x000b1;3.2&#x02005;years, an average
height of 169.2&#x000b1;3.1&#x02005;cm, an average weight of 70.6&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;kg and an average time since stroke
onset of 12.1&#x000b1;3.1 months.</p><p>Both groups received neurodevelopment treatment for 30 minutes every day, 5 times a week,
for a total of 6 weeks. Additionally, the experimental group performed mechanical horseback
riding training for 30 minutes every day, 5 times a week, for a total of 6 weeks. Horseback
riding equipment (JOBA EU7800, Panasonic Inc., Japan) was used for the study. Horseback
riding equipment delivers 5 types of movements (twisting, up-down sliding, front to back
slide, front to back roll, and left to right roll) to simulate three-dimensional movement.
This study conducted parts of courses and whole body courses using the software installed on
the horseback riding equipment. Based on the level, adaptability, and motor ability of the
subjects, they were asked to start at level 1 and continue to level 4. The subjects were
able to control their posture while using the horseback riding equipment by holding onto the
handles with their hands and by maintaining proper posture.</p><p>Physical function was evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go
Test (TUGT). Psychological problems were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
Measurements were taken both before and after the 6-week intervention. The BBS assesses the
functional level of balance. It comprises 14 items, divided into three sections of sitting,
standing, and change of posture. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 points, and the maximum
possible score is 56. When the score is high, it indicates that balance ability is good. The
TUGT assesses functional mobility by measuring the time taken to stand up from a chair, walk
forward 3 m, turn around, walk come back, and sit back down on the chair. The BDI assesses
the depression level. It comprises 21 items, including emotional, cognitive, motivational,
and physiological symptoms. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 points, and the maximum possible
score is 63: 0 to 9 points indicates not depressed; 10 to 15 points indicates slight
depression status; 16 to 23 indicates mild depression; and 24 to 63 indications severe
depression.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. The
general characteristics of the subjects are expressed as the mean and standard deviation
using technical statistics. The paired t-test was used to compare the pre- and post-test
results of each group. The independent t-test was conducted to compare the changes of the
two groups. The statistical significance level used was to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in BBS, TUGT, and BDI are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the results of the BBS, TUGT, and BDI between the experimental

physical function of stroke patients. To assess physical function, the BBS and TUGT were
used. In the within group comparison, the experimental group&#x02019;s BBS and TUGT showed
significant improvements (p&#x0003c;0.05), and the changes in the experimental group&#x02019;s BBS and
TUGT were significant compared to their values in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). Lee et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, Kim and Lee<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Han et al.,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted horseback riding training for stroke patients and
reported significant improvements in the experimental group&#x02019;s BBS, similar to the results of
this study. Rhythmical and repetitive movement through horseback riding training stimulates
the body<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a continuous movement pattern is administered the body
muscles are activated in trying to maintain an upright stance while resisting gravity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Learning about the instability of the body, improves the vestibular sense and
proprioception, improving balance ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait speed significantly increased in the
experimental group of stroke patients that received horseback riding training in the study
of Lee et al<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim and Lee<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an increase in gait ability as a
result of horseback riding training for stroke patients, which is also consistent with the
results of this study. The repetitive movements of a horse stimulate proprioception<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This stimulates the upper motor nerves
through the upper spinal cord<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
results demonstrate that horseback riding training helps to increase the physical function
of stroke patients.</p><p>Depression often occurs as a psychological problem in stroke patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a serious complication that has a negative
influence and also affects disability level<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study showed that horseback riding training influences
the psychological state of stroke patients. The BDI was used to measure the psychological
state. There was a significance improvement in the BDI of the experimental group
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The experimental group&#x02019;s BDI also significantly improved compared to the
control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). Horseback riding training is reported to be effective at widening
a subject&#x02019;s one&#x02019;s outlook, breaking free from everyday life, and overcoming depression<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asselin et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted horseback riding exercise for patients with a
damaged spinal cord and found that patients&#x02019; self-esteem increased a similar result to that
of the present study. Horseback riding training can also help increase physical function and
improve psychological problems. Moreover, it offers a new paradigm for improving patients&#x02019;
quality of life.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that the generalization of the results is limited by the
small number of subjects. Moreover, the durability of the effect was not confirmed through a
follow-up. There was also difficulty in accurate assessment because the assessment tools
used in this study were clinical measurements. Future studies should address these
limitations by increasing the number of subjects and making long-term assessments to clarify
the effect of horseback riding training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke disability</article-title>. <source>Phys
