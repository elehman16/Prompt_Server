According to the WHO, smoking kills nearly 6 million people each year [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Although the prevalence of smokers has declined by more than 4 percentage points in Italy in the last 20 years, it began to increase again between 2013 and 2014 [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among Italian hospital personnel, including physician, healthcare workers, nurses and students, the prevalence of smokers is, paradoxically, higher than in the general population. According to recent surveys, about 44% of health professionals smoke, which is almost twice the prevalence in general population [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar rates have been shown by a survey conducted among more than 800 nursing students, 42% of whom currently smoke [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The majority of hospital workers who smoke do so in the hospital, and more than 90% of healthcare workers have seen colleagues smoking cigarettes inside the hospital at least once (47.4% in staff toilets, 33.4% in kitchens and 4.7% in patients' rooms) [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Physicians and healthcare workers should play a key role in encouraging smokers to quit and to achieve longterm abstinence. Their behaviors can set an example and contribute to the spread of healthy lifestyles [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial that they receive good training on smoking-related diseases and smoking prevention. However, this is uncommon; for instance, UK Medical Colleges include factual knowledge of nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms in only 50% of curricula [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Italy, although 90% of medical residents in Public Health report hearing about smoking-related issues during their undergraduate courses, only 17% claim to have received specific smoking cessation training during specialization [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Surveys conducted among Italian Health Professional School students reveal that 94.3% of the respondents should receive specific training to quit smoking, but that only 21.3% do so during their study courses [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>School-based interventions to reduce and prevent smoking have been widely implemented and results have been summarized in a systematic review by Murphy-Hoefer that concludes that, while some promising results have been achieved, rigorous evaluation of a wider range of programs is needed [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The present study aims to contribute to the international debate on school-based anti-smoking interventions by evaluating the efficacy of a school-based intervention in reducing the prevalence of smokers among physiotherapy students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S2a"><title>STUDY DESIGN</title><p>A non-randomized trial with two independent arms was carried out between 2008 and 2013.</p><sec id="S2aa"><title>Sample and setting</title><p>Students on two different physiotherapy courses at a teaching hospital in Rome were enrolled for the study: course A students participated in a seminar on smokingrelated diseases and were enrolled for training in respiratory and thoracic surgery units.

Personal data were collected: age and gender, smoking (yes/ no), number of family members who smoked (asked only in the first year). Students who smoked were asked about their own level of nicotine addiction (<italic>Fagerstr&#x000f6;m score</italic>) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] at T0.

The relative risk (RR) of smoking at T0 and T1 and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated in both groups. The attributable risk (AR) of smoking was calculated for both groups.

At T0, the control group (B) was made up of 75 members, 39 males and 33 females, with an average age of 22.5 years and an average of 0.9 smoking relatives; only 28% of group B subjects smoked at T0. The level of nicotine dependence estimated by means of the <italic>Fagerstr&#x000f6;m score</italic> at T0 <italic>was low among smokers in both groups</italic>. No statistically significant differences in demographic factors or the level of nicotine dependence emerged between the two groups at T0.</p><p>After the intervention (T1), group A comprised 75 participants, 38 males and 37 females, with an average age of 25 years. The percentage of smokers was seen to have decreased over time, from 36 (T0) to 33 (T1). At T1, group B counted 57 participants, 28 males and 29 females, with an average age of 25 years. In this group, the percentage of smokers increased from 28% (T0) to 39% (T1).</p><p>In group A, only three participants where lost between T0 and T1 (4%), while in group B 15 participants were lost (21%).</p><p>The table above shows four comparisons and the relative risks that emerged. The first comparison is between the prevalence of smoking in groups A and B before the intervention. The prevalence was higher in group A than in group B at T0 (A: 36% vs B: 28%). The relative risk (RR) for group A was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The second comparison shows an inversion in the prevalence of smokers between the two groups after the intervention: 35% in group B and 33% in group A; the RR of group A compared with group B was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.59-1.53). On comparing the prevalence of smokers in group A between T0 and T1, a decrease from 36% to 33% was seen, the RR at T1 being 0.93 (95% CI: 0.6-1.44).

At the international level, evidence of the effectiveness of school-based interventions against smoking is not homogeneous. While the latest systematic reviews on the issue are controversial, there is a consensus that results in terms of reducing or preventing smoking mainly depend on the approach of the intervention implemented. Thomas reports that school-based interventions that combined social competence and social influences showed a significant effect both at one year and over longer follow-up. By contrast, studies adopting a social-influences program alone showed no overall effect at any time point, and multimodal interventions and those with an information-only approach proved similarly ineffective. He argues that interventions involving social competence and those combining social competence and social influences have yielded positive results [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Santon agrees that complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 day prevalence of abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those that incorporate elements sensitive to the stage of change and use motivational enhancement and CBT [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Carson concludes his systematic review by claiming that there is some evidence to support the effectiveness of community (including school-based) interventions in reducing the number of young people who take up smoking. However, the evidence is not strong and the studies reviewed contain a number of methodological flaws [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations.</p><p>First, the small sample size did not allow us to obtain statistical significances in the analysis performed. Second, the intervention was not standardized and consisted of two different activities (seminar and practical training); it is therefore unclear which part of the intervention mostly contributed to the results obtained. Third, the percentage of group B subjects who were lost to follow-up was high; failure to investigate the reason for this phenomenon could have introduced a bias into the findings of the study. Fourth, as the T0 and T1 data were not paired, it is likely that the statistical analysis was not very accurate. Fifth, the data collected were insufficient to enable us to determine whether other important factors, in addition to the intervention, may have influenced the prevalence of smoking. Finally, the fact that the study was neither randomized nor blind could reduce the reliability of the results.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study suggests that the intervention was effective. Further studies with larger samples and better defined intervention should be conducted in order to assess the impact of campaigns to improve awareness and prevention among young adults enrolled in healthcare training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>School-based interventions could play a key role in the global fight against smoking. Moreover, education and training on tobacco-related diseases could improve awareness and promote healthy behaviors among healthcare practitioners, who have a leading role to play in fostering healthy lifestyles in the community. However, as evidence of the success of anti-smoking initiatives is not strong, further research on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of school-based interventions should be undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of Sapienza University of Rome.
