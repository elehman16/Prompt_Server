Introduction</title><p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with high morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 15% of all deaths from stroke [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many patients make only a partial or poor recovery, and 36% of acute hemorrhagic stroke patients remain moderately to severely disable at discharge [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, treatments to enhance their recovery are necessary. Clinical research performed in China based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may reveal new possibilities for the treatment of strokes. However, these treatments have limited acceptability outside China because of the Western medical world's unfamiliarity with the TCM concept of stroke, which is relatively different from the Western view.</p><p>Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that several TCM herbs possess antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiglutamate properties [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such herbs can dilate blood vessels, suppress platelet aggregation, protect against ischemic reperfusion injury, and enhance the tolerance of ischemic tissue to hypoxia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (AM) is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used extensively in China as a drug to facilitate recovery after a stroke. Clinical studies performed in China have shown that AM enhances stroke patients' recovery from their neurological disability and improves functional outcome [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, these trials did not comply with the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and they used positive controls. Furthermore, the outcome measures were not the standard scales used in modern stroke trials. One study [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] suggested that the effectiveness of AM in improving stroke recovery may be related to the herb's role in reducing the area of cerebral infarction area, and its antioxidative qualities. Because no previous studies had researched the use of AM with hemorrhagic stroke patients, we investigated whether AM can enhance the functional recovery of hemorrhagic stroke patients. Our study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The objective of this research was to obtain pilot data to support the design of a larger, controlled trial in the future.</p><p> Ganglionic (putamen, caudate, and thalamus) hemorrhages are the most common forms of ICH, followed by lobar hemorrhages, and then those of the cerebellum or pons [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Location is important for outcome (pontine hemorrhages result in higher mortality), potential surgical intervention, and underlying cause. To evaluate the efficacy of AM, we chose patients who had the same location of ICH, namely, putaminal ICH, to minimize bias. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods </title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>Patients were recruited from China Medical University Hospital's neurosurgery and emergency departments between January 1, 2008 and December 21, 2010. All patients were recruited within 24 hours after the onset of hemorrhagic stroke. The experimental procedures complied with the ethical principles dictated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol of the trial was approved by the institutional review board of China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan (IRB: DMR 96-IRB-126). The trial was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave their informed consent to participate. </p><p>The criteria for including patients in the study were as follows: (1) female or male; (2) aged between 30 and 75 years; (3) randomized allocation to a study group within 24 hours of hemorrhagic stroke onset; (4) this was the patient's first hemorrhagic stroke, and the location of hemorrhage was the putamen; (5) treatment may or may not have been included surgery; (6) the subject or their legal representative gave written informed consent to participate. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) recent thrombolysis treatment; (2) history of previous stroke; (3) full-dose or long-term anti-coagulation therapy; (4) hemorrhagic stroke but the location was not putamen; (5) coexisting systemic diseases such as terminal cancer, renal failure, liver cirrhosis, severe dementia, or psychosis; (6) participation in another clinical trial within the last three months; and (7) pregnancy or lactation. </p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Preparation of AM</title><p>The AM was purchased from Shansi Province, China. The origin of the herb was authenticated, and the material was examined for microorganisms, heavy metals, and pesticide according to the accepted standards (good manufacturing practice or GMP) of Taiwan. The AM was found to be of good quality, and the crude AM had been extracted by Sun Ten Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Taiwan. The AM was extracted at a rate of 3.0&#x02009;g from every 3.3&#x02009;g of crude AM. The freeze-dried extracts of AM were verified by high-performance liquid chromatography using <italic>Astragaloside </italic>IV (Biotic Chemical Co. Ltd., China, Shanghai) as an active component of AM. Finally, each 3&#x02009;g extract was sealed in an aluminum foil sachet. The placebos were also made by Sum Ten Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and were manufactured from starch and sealed inside identical foil sachets. </p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Design and Sample Size</title><p>The present study was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II pilot study. The sample size was calculated according to our hypothesis that AM can increase a patient's score on ten dimensions of the functional independence measure Scale (FIM), and also on the Barthel Index (BI). We further hypothesized that the increase in score would be evident when comparing scores at baseline (the week of the stroke onset) and week 4, and again at week 12. To achieve a statistical power of 90%, the sample size would need to be 46 patients, and thus, 23 patients in each group. If the rate of followup was 0.8, we would need to recruit 58 patients (46 &#x000f7; 0.8 = 58). </p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Randomization and Grouping</title><p>Random numbers were generated by computer, using block randomization with a block size of 2 or 4. The pregenerated random numbers were placed in sealed envelopes, and a serial number was assigned to each envelope according to the sequence of allocation of the randomized number. Each envelope was then opened sequentially, according to the admission sequence of subjects at the study center. The number inside the envelope determined which group the subject was allocated to. </p><p>Subjects who were randomly assigned to Group A received oral or nasopharyngeal administration of AM at a rate of 3&#x02009;g three times per day for 14 days continuously starting within 24 hours after stroke onset except standard treatment that was according to Guidelines for the Management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in adults (2007 update of American Stroke Association [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Patients who were randomly assigned to Group B received the placebo treatment, according to exactly the same schedule as for Group A. Subjects as well as investigators and pharmacists were blinded to the patients' allocation to each group. The password for the randomization envelope for each subject was known only by a designated researcher. </p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Discussion</title><p>Our results indicated that the FIM and GOS scores of Group A (patients treated with complementary therapy AM) were similar to those of Group B (placebo) at baseline. The increase in FIM scores was greater for Group A at week 4 and again at week 12, relative to Group B. The increase in GOS scores was greater for Group A than Group B at week 12. The score changes for BI and MRS were not significantly different at week 4 and at week 12 compared to the first week after stroke onset. </p><p>Therefore, we suggest that AM provides an advantage for acute hemorrhagic stroke patients, if treatment with AM is started within 24 hours of stroke onset. In particular, we found that AM therapy enhanced patients' functional recovery for grooming, bathing, showering, dressing the lower body, and toileting. Additionally, the results show an excellent safety profile for treatment with AM; overall, the treatment was well-tolerated and none of the observed SAEs were considered drug related.</p><p>The pathological changes because of brain injury after ICH include hematoma expansion, midline shift, and brain edema. Enlargement of the hematoma after ictus contributes to midline shift and accelerates neurological deterioration [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Perihematomal brain edema develops immediately after an ICH and peaks several days later [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In humans, perihematomal edema develops within 3&#x02009;h of symptom onset and peaks between 10 and 20 days after ictus [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The formation of edema after ICH increases intracranial pressure and can result in herniation [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the degree of brain edema around the hematoma is associated with outcome, with worse edema being associated with poorer outcomes [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There are several phases of edema formation after ICH. The early phase (first few hours) involves hydrostatic pressure and clot retraction, with movement of serum from the clot into the surrounding tissue [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The second phase (first two days) is related to the coagulation cascade and thrombin production; and the third phase is related to erythrocyte lyses and haemoglobin toxicity. Therefore, the mechanism of edema includes hematoma, oxidation, and inflammation. </p><p>Therapy with AM has the effect of antioxidation and anti-inflammation, which indicates that AM can decrease edema and improve the patient's prognosis [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results showed that AM therapy improved functional outcomes at week 4 and at week 12 after hemorrhagic stroke onset, which may be due to AM's properties of anti-inflammation and antioxidation, which would decrease brain edema. </p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammation after both ischemic stroke and ICH or higher brain edema is predominantly deleterious. In human stroke, prestroke infection is associated with worse outcome, as recently reported in a review by McColl and colleagues [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High levels of CRP, which is an acute-phase protein released by the liver in response to IL-6, are linked to worse outcome following stroke [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and acute prestroke administration of human CRP is deleterious in experimental models [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It may be that CRP enhances complement-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation. Inflammation aggravates hemorrhagic brain injury. An inflammatory response in the surrounding brain occurs soon after ICH and peaks several days later in human beings and in animals [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to CRP, another indicator of inflammation is ESR. </p><p>Our results leave one question unanswered. That is, why did FIM scores increase more for Group A than Group B at weeks 4 and 12, and GOS scores also increased more in Group A at week 12 relative to Group B, whereas the groups did not show any significant differences regarding changes in CRP, ESR, and BER? In response to this question, we suggest that the effect of AM effect gradually increases, with the greatest effect occurring after seven days. Our study design was such that we stopped measuring CRP and ESR and performing CT scans after the seventh day; we measured on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. This possible explanation requires further study. </p><p> One study, which reviewed data from 586 patients with ICH seen at 30 different medical centers, reported that hemorrhagic stroke mortality at 3 months was 34% [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Ganglionic (putamen, caudate, and thalamus) hemorrhages are the most common forms of ICH, followed by lobar, and then cerebellar or pontine [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Location is important for outcome (pontine hemorrhages result in higher mortality), potential surgical intervention, and underlying cause. Our results indicated that the mortality of putaminal ICH is approximately 5 to 6%, which is lower than for average ICH. Therefore, putaminal ICH is associated with a better outcome than other locations of ICH. </p><p> Our study was subject to some limitations. The sample size of 68 subjects was insufficient to draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy of the treatment. The study itself was an exploratory analysis, with the objective of generating hypotheses for future, larger trials. In addition, our data analysis did not consider the inflation of type I error due to multiple comparisons. All observed results were not statistically significant if Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was made. Although testing multiple response variables with Bonferroni correction is technically correct, it is seldom used by most of clinical trials in the literature. However, trends were observed, and our results provided some estimates for sample sizes, which would be required to achieve statistical significance in future studies. The duration of the treatment and of the study itself was shorter than that of other trials assessing the efficacy of AM after stroke. This suggests that a longer trial period could also be an important criterion for subsequent protocols. </p><p>In conclusion, the findings of our study are preliminary, and a larger study to assess the efficacy of AM after stroke is needed. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments </title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of the Health, Executive Yuan Republic of China.
