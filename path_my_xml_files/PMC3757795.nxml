Therefore, this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to compare isobaric with hyperbaric ropivacaine for spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Our primary outcomes of the study are the onset of the sensory and motor blockade and hemodynamic, secondary outcome are regression of sensory and motor blockade, duration of analgesia, visual analog scale (VAS), side effects, patients, and surgeon satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A randomized controlled double-blind study was performed after obtaining the approval of the Ethical Committee of the institution, 70 ASA Grade I-II patients who were to undergo elective lower abdominal surgery under spinal anesthesia gave written informed consent to take part in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups (<italic>n</italic>=35 in each group) using a computer generated random number tables. These groups were further classified, based on the intrathecal drug combination used.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group A: 18 mg 0.6% isobaric ropivacaine.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group B: 18 mg 0.6% hyperbaric ropivacaine.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The patients were explained about the intrathecal use of drug, and written informed consent was taken. Patients and anesthetist who recorded the data were not aware of the drug combination, nor the doctors who prepared the drug knew which group of drug they received for spinal anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, any contraindication for spinal anesthesia, patients with previous abdominal surgeries, known drug allergy, patients having a body weight &#x0003e;70 kg. All Patients were nil per orally for 6 h, pre-medicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg, alprax 0.25 mg, and metoclopramide 10 mg the night before and on the morning of surgery, patients were preloaded with 10-15 ml/kg body of ringer lactate via 18 gauge venous catheters. Baseline standard monitoring included continuous electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressures and urine output. Sensory and motor assessment methods were described in all patients before the start of anesthesia. The solution was prepared aseptically by the anesthetist, by mixing ropivacaine 7.5 mg/ml (4 ml) with 25% dextrose (1 ml) to obtain a total volume of 5 ml, each ml contained ropivacaine 6 mg and glucose 50 mg to give solutions a density of 1.01949 g at 37&#x000b0;C.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Spinal anesthesia was given in left lateral position between L<sub>3</sub> and L<sub>4</sub> vertebrae using 25 gauge Whitacre needle taking complete aseptic precautions. In group A, intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine (18 mg) and in group B, intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine (18 mg) was given over 10-15 s. Noninvasive blood pressure pulse and oxygen saturation were measured every 5 min for first 30 min and thereafter every 10 min. Patients were given supplementary O<sub>2</sub> with the help of venturi mask if oxygen saturation dropped &#x02264;92%. Sensory block was tested by cold, touch, and pinprick along the midclavicular line till the block reached T6 level and then the surgical incision was allowed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Motor block using a modified Bromage Scale (0=no block, 1=inability to raise extended leg, 2=inability to flex knee, and 3=inability to flex ankle and foot) was also recorded at the 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The following variables were recorded: time to an initial onset of analgesia, highest level of sensory analgesia, the time to complete motor block, time to two-segment regression of analgesic level, regression of analgesic level to S1 dermatome, motor recovery (ability to move lower limbs), and first request for analgesic. The total duration of analgesia was considered from the time of injection of spinal anesthetic, until the first request for analgesic by the patient. The surgical anesthesia was graded by anesthetist as &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; &#x02013; if there were no complaints from patient or surgeon, &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; &#x02013; if there was a complaint of pain, which was relieved by IV opioid analgesics and &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; &#x02013; if more than one dose of analgesic or rescue general analthesia (GA) was required.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Hypotension (defined as systolic arterial pressure falling more than 20%) was treated with injection ephedrine 6 mg in bolus doses and heart rate &#x0003c;55 beats/min was treated with 0.4 mg of injection atropine. Intravenous fluids were given as per operative loss with blood transfusion if required. During the surgical procedure, side effects like sedation, nausea, vomiting, shivering, bradycardia or hypotension was recorded. Nausea and vomiting were treated with 4-6 mg of i.v. ondansetron. Urinary bladder was catheterized in all patients before the start of surgery, until 24 h post-operatively. VAS score between 0 and 10 (0=no pain, 10=the most severe pain) was used for post-operative pain analysis at every 4 h until 24 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Injection paracetamol 15 mg/kg intravenous was given as rescue analgesia when VAS &#x02265;4. Follow-up was carried out for 1 week post-operatively by the blinded anesthetist who asked about post-operative headache as well as post-operative pain and dysesthesia in the buttock, thighs, or lower limbs. Supplementation of some analgesia and sedation was given such as ketamine, midazolam, and fentanyl during the perioperative period if required.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The collected data were analyzed by using statistical software namely statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 15.0.

After randomization and a lumbar puncture, five patients from group A and two patients from group B were withdrawn because of total block failure (no muscle weakness or loss of sensation) and given a general anesthetic, so leaving 30 patients in group A and 33 patients in group B. There was no difference in the type of surgery, although its duration was somewhat longer in the group A (50.8&#x000b1;10.2) as compared to group B (45.5&#x000b1;15.5) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Hyperbaric ropivacaine produced a more rapid onset of sensory block, which, ultimately regressed more quickly. The onset of analgesia to pinprick at T10 was more rapid in group B (4.43&#x000b1;1.33) as compared to group A (6.0&#x000b1;1.03), and the maximum block height T4 (T3-T6) was greater in group B, as compared to group A with T5 (T4-T6) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Median time to maximum block height was the earliest in group B (10.03&#x000b1;1.22), as compared to group A (14.2&#x000b1;1.51) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

Median time to two segment regression of sensory block to T10 was longer in the hyperbaric group (66.54&#x000b1;10.25) as compared to isobaric group (48.14&#x000b1;5.26), but median times to complete regression of both sensory and motor block (B0) were longer in the isobaric group (192.49&#x000b1;9.60) as compared to hyperbaric group (166.57&#x000b1;11.71) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

Patients of hyperbaric blocks were adequate for surgery while two patients required general anesthesia due to surgical complication, five patients (two patients blocks were not extensive enough and in three patients became inadequate 20 min after the start of surgery) who received isobaric ropivacaine required general anesthesia. Patients of both groups were hemodynamically stable throughout the surgery, group B showed a mean heart rate (72.11&#x000b1;5.75) and a mean blood pressure (82.17&#x000b1;4.98) as compared to group A showed a heart rate (78.2&#x000b1;5.29) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] and a mean blood pressure (85.14&#x000b1;5.32) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Doses of ephedrine administered were more in group B (14&#x000b1;6) as compared to group A (8&#x000b1;4). Supplementation of midazolam (1.8&#x000b1;0.6) mg, ketamine (30.8&#x000b1;8.6) mg, and fentanyl (50.5&#x000b1;10.8) mcg were required in the isobaric group for completion of surgery, while patients of hyperbaric group did not require any analgesic and/or sedative for completion of surgery. The surgical anesthesia was graded by anesthetist as &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; in hyperbaric group and &#x0201c;Good&#x0201d; in isobaric group.

Our study showed that hyperbaric solution of ropivacaine produces a more reliable block than an isobaric one. Addition of glucose to isobaric ropivacaine led to a more rapid onset, more dense motor blockade, increase the level of block with early post-operative mobilization and rehabilitation as compared to isobaric ropivacaine. The addition of glucose 50 mg/ml to ropivacaine causes earlier onset of the block, good quality with adequate duration, and increase the recovery. Isobaric solutions was not reliable for abdominal surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Addition of glucose to isobaric ropivacaine increases its density that result in an equal distribution of the drug and increase height of the block while isobaric ropivacaine produces less intense, unpredictable, and variable height of block, therefore, patient of isobaric group felt some discomfort during surgery so supplementation of analgesia and sedation were required such as ketamine, midazolam, and fentanyl in a few patients in our study. Kallio <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] also found analgesic effect in 64% (18/28) patients in the isobaric group while good quality of anaesthesia was found in all patients of hyperbaric group.</p><p>This study shows that hyperbaric ropivacaine, in a dose of 18 mg, produces predictable and reliable spinal anaesthesia for lower abdominal surgeries of relatively longer duration as compared to isobaric ropivacaine. Yegin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] studied effect of hyperbaric ropivacaine in a dose of 18 mg and compared with hyperbaric ropivacaine 18 mg and fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g in trans urethral resection prostate (TURP) surgery and found similar effect in onset and duration of sensory and motor effect except for prolonged analgesic effect in fentanyl group. In the comparison of the isobaric solutions of ropivacaine, the hyperbaric preparation produced a higher, more consistent block with faster onset and recovery, whereas there was a failure rate with the isobaric solution,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] similar result was noted by Hocking and Wildsmith.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] While variability in a spread can be minimized by adding glucose, the variable response of isobaric ropivacaine should always consider. The spread of isobaric ropivacaine is dependent on the current produced by injection and simple diffusion. So that the drug, which we inject through intrathecal route stays locally at the point of injection, so quality of the block is not reliable for abdominal surgery but prolong effect was observed in lower limbs due to dense effects on lumber and sacral nerve.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Our study also shows variable response during lower abdominal surgery with isobaric ropivacaine and required some supplementation of analgesic and sedative agent for good quality of surgical relaxation. In our previous study in which we studied isobaric ropivacaine for lower limb surgery and found the best quality of prolonged analgesic effects which justified dense effect of isobaric ropivacaine on lumber and sacral plexus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In the earlier time lidocaine was the standard agent for a short duration of surgery, but this drug is now not used because of the high incidence of transient neurological symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] So the currently ropivacaine is of great choice for short duration of surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hyperbaric ropivacaine produced more consistent, reliable and good quality of sensory and motor block, with faster onset, early mobilization and rehabilitation than an isobaric ropivacaine, which is required for day-case surgery in which prolong immobilization is undesirable. Isobaric ropivacaine did not provide good quality of motor blockade it required some additional analgesic and sedative agent for completion of the surgery. We, therefore, conclude that isobaric ropivacaine are very good for lower limb surgery. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of hyperbaric ropivacaine in comparison to isobaric ropivacaine for surgical procedures of short-duration, particularly in the day case surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O&#x02019;Connor</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Finucane</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Induced hypotension with epidural/general anesthesia reduces transfusion in radical prostate surgery</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>2006</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>873</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16960264</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Kleef</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Veering</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name><name><surname>Burm</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine: A double-blind study on the efficacy and safety of 0.5% and 0.75% solutions in patients undergoing minor lower limb surgery</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1994</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>1125</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8198269</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Ocampo</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sia</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of duration of analgesia of intrathecal 2.5 mg of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine in combined spinal epidural analgesia for patients in labor</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2004</year><volume>98</volume><fpage>235</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14693626</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Casati</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moizo</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchetti</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Vinciguerra</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of unilateral spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine for inguinal herniorrhaphy</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2004</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>1387</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15502035</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sultan</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ali Shams</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Mageed</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>El-ebidy</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine versus hyperbaric bupivacaine in geriatric hypertensive patients</article-title><source>Benha M.
