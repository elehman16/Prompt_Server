Eighty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I and II, in the age group of 35-60 years, scheduled to undergo elective vaginal hysterectomies under subarachnoid block (SAB) were included. Patients having body weight &#x0003e;110 kg, height &#x0003c;140 cm, on calcium channel blockers, adrenergic receptor blockers, arrhythmias, having heart block, and contraindications to spinal anesthesia (e.g., coagulation defects, infection at the puncture site, preexisting neurological deficits in the lower limbs) were excluded from the study. Patients with known allergy to study drugs and local anesthetics and patients with respiratory, neurological, psychological, hepatic or renal diseases were also excluded from the study.</p><p>No premedication was given to patients. On the arrival of the patients in the operating room, all patients were monitored for heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure, respiratory rate (RR), pulse-oximetery (oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub> ]), electrocardiography and baseline values were recorded. An intravenous (i/v) line was secured with 18G cannula and all patients were preloaded with 10 mL/kg of Ringer Lactate solution. Following preloading, under all aseptic precautions, lumber puncture was performed with 25G Quincke's spinal needle in L3-L4 interspace or L4-L5 interspace (if lumber puncture was found to be difficult at L3-L4 interspace) through a midline approach in a sitting position. The observers as well as the patients were blinded to the drug solution and patients' group. The study solution was prepared by anesthesiology staff, who was not involved in administration of study drugs as well as recording the parameters. By sealed envelope technique, patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Patients allocated to Group D (<italic>n</italic> = 40) received 3 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine +5 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine in 0.5 mL of normal saline intrathecally (dexmedetomidine 100 &#x003bc;g/mL was diluted in preservative free normal saline) and Group M (<italic>n</italic> = 40) received 3 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine +2 mg preservative free midazolam in 0.4 mL (5 mg/mL) +0.1 mL of normal saline intrathecally.</p><p>The study solution was administered over 10-15 s through spinal needle with no barbotage. After SAB, patients were placed in lithotomy position and oxygen 2 L/min was given through the face mask.</p><p>The level of sensory and motor block was assessed every 2 min for first 15 min, at 20 min, 30 min after completion of intrathecal injection of the drug and then every 15 min during surgery and in the postoperative period in post anesthesia care unit (PACU). The level of sensory block was assessed by pin prick method using 26G hypodermic needle along mid axillary line. Sensory block at level of T8 dermatome was considered as adequate for surgery.</p><p>The onset of sensory block (defined as the time interval from completion of subarachnoid drug injection to onset of complete loss of needle prick sensation at T8 level), time to achieve peak sensory block level, level of the sensory block (highest dermatomal level of sensory blockade by needle prick method), and duration of sensory block (defined as time interval from completion of subarachnoid drug injection to two segment regression of sensory block by needle prick method) and regression of sensory block to S1 level was also recorded.</p><p>Motor block was assessed using modified Bromage scale.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Score 0: Patient able to move the hip, knee and ankle. Score 1: Patient unable to move the hip but able to move the knee and ankle. Score 2: Patient unable to move the hip and knee but able to move the ankle. Score 3: Patient unable to move the hip, knee and ankle.</p><p>Onset of motor blockade (time interval from completion of subarachnoid drug injection to Bromage score 3) and duration of motor blockade (time interval from Bromage score 3 to Bromge score 0) were also noted.</p><p>All calculations of durations were done considering the time of subarachnoid injection as time &#x0201c;zero.&#x0201d; All patients were shifted from PACU only when regression of sensory block occurred to S1 level and Bromage score of 0 was achieved.</p><p>The level of sedation[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] assessed before giving SAB and then assessment was repeated every 15 min intra-operatively and postoperatively using following score. Score 0: Alert. Score 0: Occasionally drowsy, easy to arouse. Score 0: Frequently drowsy, easy to arouse. Score 0: Somnolent, difficult to arouse.</p><p>Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), SpO<sub>2</sub>, were recorded every 5 min for 1 h and then every 15 min till 2 segment regression of sensory block. Hypotension was defined as decrease in MAP &#x0003e;20% from baseline or fall of systolic blood pressure below 90 mm of Hg and was treated with ephedrine 6 mg in incremental doses followed by i/v fluids as required. Bradycardia was defined as decrease in HR &#x0003e;20% from baseline values or &#x0003c;50 beats/min (bpm) and was treated with boluses of atropine 0.3-0.6 mg i/v.</p><p>Intra-operatively, all patients were assessed for nausea, vomiting, sedation, rescue analgesia. Intra-operative rescue analgesia was planned to be given with injection fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg i/v, if required. If pain still not subsided, general anesthesia was given and the patient was excluded from the study. Duration of surgery (min), infused volume of i/v fluids (mL), doses of ephedrine (mg) and atropine (mg) were also recorded.</p><p>Postoperatively, pain was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS; 0- no pain; 10- worst pain) at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24 h. Patients who had VAS score of 3 or more were given injection diclofenac 75 mg intramuscularly. The time to first request of analgesia and total number of diclofenac injections required in 24 h was also recorded.</p><p>In postoperative period, all patients were closely observed for 24 h for any side effects, e.g., behavioral changes, confusion, dizziness, nystagmus, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting or any neurological complication such as numbness or pain in leg, back and buttocks, incontinence or retention of urine.</p><p>A sample size of 40 patients per group (Group D, Group M) was calculated using power and sample size calculation (PS version 3.0.0.34 Power and sample size calculator.

Dexmedetomidine binds to presynaptic C-fibers and postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine produces analgesia by suppressing the release of C-fibers pro nociceptive neurotransmitters, substance <italic>P</italic> and glutamate from primary afferent terminals and by hyper polarization of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons through G- protein mediated activation of potassium channels.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] An &#x003b1;-2 agonist, administered intrathecally or epidurally, provides prolonged analgesic effect in postoperative period without severe sedation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The absence of severe sedation is due to sparing of supraspinal sites from excessive drug exposure resulting in intense analgesia without heavy sedation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Many studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] done in the past, revealed that Midazolam is safe and efficacious as an adjuvant to bupivacaine hence we used midazolam 2 mg as an adjuvant to bupivacaine 0.5% in SAB. Goodchild <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have found that intrathecal midazolam is involved in the release of endogenous opioids acting on spinal delta receptors so antinociceptive effects of morphine like substances is potentiated when intrathecal midazolam is added.</p><p>This study indicates intrathecal administration of 5 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% significantly prolongs the duration of both sensory and motor blockade without producing significant side effects compared with intrathecal midazolam 2 mg in patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomies under SAB. Kanazi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied 60 patients, undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate or bladder tumor under SAB with bupivacaine and found that 3 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine produced shorter onset of motor blockade with prolonged duration of sensory and motor block with minimal side-effects. Al-Ghanem <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] also found that 5 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine used intrathecally produces significantly prolonged sensory and motor blockade when compared to intrathecal fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g. In present study also, we found similarly prolonged duration of sensory and motor block.</p><p>Kim and Lee[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Prakash <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed analgesic effects of intrathecal midazolam 1 mg or 2 mg along with bupivacaine and concluded that duration of postoperative analgesia was significantly prolonged with the addition of intrathecal midazolam in a dose dependent manner. Our study also reports prolonged duration of sensory and motor blockade in midazolam group (Group M).</p><p>Visceral and somatic pain, nausea and vomiting are very commonly encountered intra-operative problems in female genital tract surgeries under spinal anesthesia with local anesthetic agents.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Al-Ghanem <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Kalso <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have reported that an &#x003b1;-2 receptor agonists, when added to spinal anesthetic agents, significantly reduce visceral and somatic pain. Kim and Lee[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Bharti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found out that intrathecal midazolam also reduces visceral and somatic pain during intra-operative period. In our study also, both dexmedetomidine and midazolam improved the intra-operative analgesia, as no patient in either of the study group suffered from visceral or somatic pain intra-operatively and also no patient in both the study groups required additional analgesia or general anesthesia.</p><p>The most significant side effects associated with the use of intrathecal &#x003b1;-2 receptor agonists are hypotension and bradycardia. In this study, 8 patients (20%) had hypotension and 8 patients (20%) had bradycardia in Group D, while in Group M, 5 patients (12.5%) had hypotension and 4 patients (10.0%) had bradycardia, but overall analysis showed that this difference was not significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> 0.0595). Hypotension and bradycardia, both could be managed with Ephedrine and Atropine, respectively. This can be explained by the fact that we used smaller doses of dexmedetomidine. Previous studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have also revealed the prolongation of spinal block by intrathecal 5 &#x003bc;g and 10 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine without significant effect on blood pressure and HR.</p><p>Intrathecal &#x003b1;-2 receptor agonists and midazolam, both have intra-operative sedative effects, but similar to Tamsen and Gordh[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Bharti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] no patients in either group were heavily sedated as is evident by overall sedation level between 0 and 1.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine given intrathecally as an adjuvant to bupivacaine leads to increase in the duration of motor blockade, limiting its use in short term surgical procedures or ambulatory surgeries.</p><p>Although no major side-effects were reported in this study, larger studies are required to rule out any short term or long term adverse effects. The study population included was otherwise healthy and young patients and the effect in old patients with cardio vascular co-morbidities or other medically compromised population are yet to be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In vaginal hysterectomies, intrathecal use of dexmedetomidine was found to be better alternative to intrathecal midazolam, since it produces significantly longer duration of sensory block as is evident by significantly prolonged postoperative analgesia, reduced pain scores on VAS and reduced number of doses of postoperative analgesics without being associated with significant hemodynamic instability, sedation and other side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
