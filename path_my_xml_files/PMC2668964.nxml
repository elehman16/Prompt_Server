Observational data from large PD cohorts show that poor peritoneal salt and water removal is associated with decreased survival, independent of residual renal function, inflammation and cardiac biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref>]. There is also evidence that when the residual renal function is low, many PD patients become fluid overloaded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. It is likely that volume overload aggravates not only hypertension, but also left ventricular hypertrophy, often present already at the start of PD. Salt and water overload may be the result of excess intake, especially when there is increased thirst, insufficient ultrafiltration (UF), which is the primary determinant of peritoneal sodium removal in PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6">5,6</xref>], or a combination of these. The problem increases with time on treatment, not only as a consequence of loss of residual renal function, but also due to changes in peritoneal membrane function and the desire to avoid excessive glucose exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p>In clinical practice, various strategies are currently used to manage fluid excess: dietary salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs, icodextrin, addition of an extra day dwell, and, as a last option, PD combined with haemodialysis (HD), or switch to HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Another possibility would be to enhance sodium removal during PD. When using conventional PD fluid, where the [Na<sup>+</sup>] &#x0223c;132 mmol/l, sodium removal is predominantly due to convection and typically &#x0223c;10 mmol Na<sup>+</sup>/dl of UF volume in 4 h. Increasing the glucose concentration to obtain more ultrafiltration will increase absolute sodium removal, but due to aquaporin-mediated fluid transport, an essential component of healthy UF, the relative proportion of sodium to fluid removal will decrease, especially in short exchanges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. This gap between sodium and fluid removal may in part explain the increased thirst reported by PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Theoretically, this problem could be improved by designing low-sodium dialysis solutions so that the sodium removal by diffusion would be increased, closing the gap between salt and water losses. However, no such solutions are presently commercially available.</p><p>The role of low-sodium dialysis solutions in the management of hypernatraemia due to the excessive aquaporin-mediated ultrafiltration associated with the short exchanges employed in intermittent PD patients was first described by Ahearn and Nolph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. More recently, Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] studied nine patients on CAPD with a dialysis solution containing Na<sup>+</sup> 120 mmol/l in either 1.36% or 2.27% glucose (G), replacing all four exchanges. Compared to conventional solutions, sodium removal over a 4-week period increased from 38.5 &#x000b1; 25.8 mmol/day to 85.0 &#x000b1; 27.5 mmol daily with the low-sodium solutions. All patients showed a significant fall in blood pressure, and two patients dropped out because of hyponatraemia and overhydration. Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>. also reported the effect of ultra-low-sodium dialysis fluid ([Na<sup>+</sup>]: 98 mmol/l) during CAPD in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In one of these, the authors used ultra-low-sodium dialysis fluid in one exchange daily for 7 days in overhydrated CAPD patients. There was a significant increase in sodium removal and UF. Furthermore, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body weight (BW) decreased significantly. Similarly, increased sodium removal with variable clinical effects has been demonstrated in a number of subsequent small-scale investigations of low-sodium solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15 R16">13&#x02013;16</xref>].</p><p>The design of low-sodium solutions needs careful consideration because sodium is osmotically active, so unless this is compensated there will be a fall in the ultrafiltration obtained that might be counter-productive. Computer simulations of sodium removal as a function of dialysate sodium concentration according to the three-pore model have recently been reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and corroborated by clinical observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. These simulations show how Na<sup>+</sup> removal could be strikingly increased by reducing dialysis fluid Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and the effect this would have on net UF could be predicted. We have used these simulations to design three possible low-sodium dialysates called &#x02018;DeltaSol-low/medium/high&#x02019; intended to replace low (1.5%), medium (2.5%) and high (3.9%) standard G solutions for once-daily clinical use. Each would increase the total sodium removal by 20&#x02013;30 mmol/day, but the low and high replacement fluids were compensated with an increase in the glucose to ensure maintained UF, whereas the medium replacement solution was not. The purpose of this study was to establish whether our predictions of sodium removal and UF were valid, establish their safety and investigate whether the use of these solutions had any effect on BP, thirst and volume status. In the event, we were unable to recruit sufficient patients to the regular use of the high G (3.9%) replacement solution to warrant statistical analysis, so the data presented here are for the low G (compensated, group A) and medium G (uncompensated, group B) solutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study design: population</title><p>This was an open-label, multicentre, prospective intervention study, performed at the University Hospitals of North Staffordshire (Stoke-on-Trent, UK), Lund and Malm&#x000f6; (Sweden).

Patients not usually using Gambrosol&#x000ae; trio were appropriately trained and used this for the study exchange during this period. The Deltasol study period lasted 2 months during which one bag of Gambrosol&#x000ae; trio, a glucose-lactate-containing, low-GDP fluid, per day was replaced by the Deltasol low-sodium solution. Patients were allocated into groups A (low-strength G, compensated) or B (medium-strength G, uncompensated) according to their baseline prescription as a major change in G prescription was considered a potential hazard. As with Gambrosol&#x000ae; trio, Deltasol is a three-compartment bag allowing the constitution of three different low-sodium solutions depending on which are mixed together prior to instillation.

In group B, 2.5% G Gambrosol&#x000ae; trio was replaced with Deltasol by mixing compartments B+C (G = 2.5%, Na<sup>+</sup> = 102 mmol/l); see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Longitudinal measurements</title><p>Following the stabilization period (T<sub>0</sub>) and at 1 (T<sub>1</sub>) and 2 months (T<sub>2</sub>) during the test period, the patients were assessed by BW, multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (Xitron and Tanita instruments, respectively, see below). Total body water (TBW) was further determined by deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O) dilution at T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by 24-h ambulatory monitoring and as office readings. Blood, urine and dialysate samples were collected for measurements of electrolytes, glucose, dialysis adequacy, peritoneal membrane transport characteristics and residual renal function (calculated as the mean of urine clearance of urea and creatinine). In a sub-group of patients, thirst, mood and appetite were assessed using a specially designed palmtop utilizing an electronic appetite rating system (EARS) to record serial visual analogue scores (VAS) six times daily previously validated in PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Changes in anti-hypertensive medication were prohibited unless needed for patient safety; diuretics were not changed. Any change in hypertensive medication was noted. Dialysis prescription remained the same throughout the study period and identical to the one used for the stabilization period except for the test bag dwells.</p><p>Blood pressure was measured manually with a validated device at each visit; two measurements were performed after at least 5 min in sitting position with at least 2 min between the measurements. This was followed by one measurement in standing position to detect postural hypotension.</p><p>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure readings were recorded using the same device in all three centres (SpaceLabs Medical, model 90217, Hertfordshire, UK). Measurements were performed hourly during the entire 24-h period and divided into day- and nighttime periods with the nighttime period from 2200 to 0600 h. At least 60% of the measurements during the entire day or a single period had to be properly measured or the measurement was repeated.</p><p>Body composition was determined using two multiple-frequency bioimpedance devices: the Hydra analyzer (Model 4200, Xitron Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA) and Tanita body composition scale (TBF 300 MA, Tanita UK Ltd, Yiewsley, Middlesex, UK). With the Xitron equipment, measurements were performed using the standard bipolar technique with electrodes placed on the dorsum of wrist and anterior aspect of the ankle. The patient was supine for at least 10 min before measurements without dialysis fluid present. During the measurements, values for TBW, extracellular fluid (ECF), intracellular fluid (ICF) and lean body mass (LBM) were determined by the instrument. The Tanita measurements were performed by having the patients standing on the scale with the feet in direct contact with the four measuring electrodes and the following results were recorded: BW, TBW, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and body mass index (BMI).</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Sodium removal and UF volume measurements</title><p>Assessing UF volume and sodium removal took careful account of the problems associated with &#x02018;flush-before-fill&#x02019; systems, which due to variable overfill and length of flush variably over-estimates the UF volume (50&#x02013;200 ml, and sodium removal 5&#x02013;20 mmol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18 R19">18,19</xref>].

690 ml for group A and 855 &#x000b1; 411 ml in group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. As predicted, there was a significant decrease in UF volume after 1 month in group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.034), due to a fall in UF with the test exchange that was not seen in group A. There were no significant changes in daily urine volume or urinary sodium losses over the observation period and these were not different between groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The simulated and achieved total net sodium removal (NaR) for the test exchanges is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. In group A, the achieved NaR for the test dwell was close to the values predicted by the three-pore model for the stabilization period (&#x02212;0.10 &#x000b1; 11.1 mmol/dwell versus the three-pore model simulated value of 5 mmol/dwell), although the UF was slightly negative (&#x02212;69 ml). Deltasol markedly improved the NaR that reached 32.4 &#x000b1; 50.1 mmol/dwell, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0021, in close agreement with the three-pore model simulated value (32 mmol/dwell). In group B, the achieved sodium removal for Gambrosol&#x000ae;trio was lower than the predicted value (10.6 &#x000b1; 27.6 mmol/dwell versus a simulated NaR of 37 mmol/dwell), due to a lower than predicted UF volume (113 &#x000b1; 24.2 ml). For Deltasol in group B, the increase in NaR was excellent, being 62.5 &#x000b1; 26.3 mmol/dwell, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, compared to 53 mmol/dwell in the simulation. The improvement in sodium removal by Deltasol was nearly entirely (&#x0223c;90%) due to diffusive sodium removal for group A and exclusively (&#x0223c;98%) due to diffusive sodium removal for group B. These increases in sodium removal from the test exchanges translated into increases in the total daily peritoneal sodium loss (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).

There was a strong agreement between the simulations and observed increase in sodium removal during test dwells that was predominantly due to an increase in the diffusive component. This was associated with an increase in the total daily peritoneal sodium removal without significantly affecting urinary sodium losses, despite the marked between-patient heterogeneity in daily sodium removal and the associated increase in error when determining losses from multiple exchanges. There appeared to be clear differences in the observed effects on the secondary clinical endpoints according to whether the glucose concentration was increased in order to maintain ultrafiltration. In the compensated group, there were reductions in blood pressure, ECF and more marked decrease in thirst; no changes in the clinical measures were observed in the uncompensated group. These observations have implications for our understanding of membrane physiology, the role of sodium in controlling blood pressure in PD patients and for the design of future randomized controlled trials to determine the clinical role of low-sodium solutions.</p><p>The three-pore model remains the most powerful descriptor and predictor of peritoneal fluid and solute transport. In this study, it was used to predict sodium and fluid transport for a typical PD patient, setting the membrane area parameter (A<sub>0</sub>/&#x00394;<italic>X</italic>) at 23&#x000a0;000 cm, equivalent to a D/P creatinine ratio during a 4-h peritoneal equilibration test of &#x0223c;0.72. The PS value for sodium was reduced (6 ml/min) to take account of previous observations that suggest it is lower than would be expected from its molecular weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. When comparing the simulations to the observed sodium removal and ultrafiltration, it is apparent that the predictions of the former were very close; there was a tendency for the model to over-predict ultrafiltration, although the expected fall in ultrafiltration observed in the non-compensated group B was seen. This relative accuracy in predicting sodium removal, in particular the diffusive component, as compared to ultrafiltration was also seen in a comprehensive testing of the model in over 1800 exchanges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], and would thus justify the selection of the PS value for sodium.</p><p>The actual daily increase in sodium removal observed (&#x0223c;30 mmol), regardless of the solution used, is likely to be clinically significant. There is some confusion in the literature as to the typical daily sodium removal in PD patients. This is mainly due to variability in the measurement of net ultrafiltration in CAPD patients due to the presence of overfill of dialysate in each bag needed to take into account the flush before fill procedure and to a lesser extent evaporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18 R19">18,19</xref>]. This differs by manufacturer and may account for 50&#x02013;200 ml per exchange, 200&#x02013;800 ml per day in a typical CAPD patient, equivalent to 20&#x02013;80 mmol of sodium. The discrepancy in measured sodium intake (&#x0223c;80 mmol/ day) and removal (180 mmol/day), initially reported by Asghar <italic>et al.</italic> can largely be explained by this error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21 R22">21, 22</xref>]. The rather high average daily sodium losses reported by Ates (180 mmol/day) are also associated with relatively high reported ultrafiltration; although this might reflect a high daily salt intake (&#x0003e;11 g/day for the peritoneal component alone), the relationship between fluid removal and mortality reported is much different to more recent studies, where increased mortality is seen at much lower levels of ultrafiltration (400&#x02013;750 ml/day). In one of the centres in this study (UHNS), regular audit of total daily sodium removal indicated average losses of 70&#x02013;80 mmol/day (&#x0003e;50% from urine), although there is a very wide variation. In this context, an increase in peritoneal losses of 30 mmol per day is likely to be clinically significant. Although there is undoubtedly a role for sensible salt restriction in PD patients, it can seen that even a relatively strict low-sodium diet of 5 g a day would not be sufficient for some, especially those with an increased mortality associated with low ultrafiltration in whom peritoneal losses can be estimated at &#x0223c;40&#x02013;55 mmol/ day (&#x0223c;3&#x02013;4 g) as seen in the EAPOS and ADEMEX studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2">1,2</xref>].</p><p>The clinical observations in this study appeared to be different according to the type of low-sodium solution used. The combination of effects seen with the compensated solution that included lower blood pressure, especially for the nocturnal readings, changes in fluid status in keeping with a reduction in extracellular water and a greater reduction in thirst independent of appetite and mood strongly suggest that benefits can be obtained from increasing the sodium removal whilst maintaining ultrafiltration in PD patients. In contrast, the lack of any effects in the uncompensated group implies that these benefits cannot be achieved by manipulation of sodium removal alone. This is a potentially important clinical message for the management of PD patients but must be interpreted cautiously. This was not a randomized study and patients were allocated to groups A and B on the basis of their current treatment regimes and therefore to some extent were pre-selected. Most of their baseline characteristics are similar (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), except for the greater peritoneal ultrafiltration in group B reflecting their higher glucose prescription. Interestingly, this did not translate into significantly higher sodium removal at baseline, possibly due to sodium sieving leading to a greater gap between sodium removal and ultrafiltration. Patients in group A had spent longer on treatment but were not proportionately more likely to be on APD or be using icodextrin. Although these differences were not statistically significant, it remains possible that poorly understood or unmeasured selection factors such as dietary salt intake that was not measured independently in this study contributed to the different clinical effects seen with the two solutions tested. The lack of effect in group B might have been because the incremental increase in the peritoneal sodium removal was less in these patients (35% versus 55% in group A) and thus not sufficient to cause a change. In the study of Nakayama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], sodium removal was higher than that achieved in the present study, causing a marked influence on both body fluid status and BP, even in the absence of glucose compensation of the low-sodium solutions. It is conceivable that an additional low-sodium exchange in the present study would have caused more clear-cut effects on body fluid status and BP, even at the price of reduced UF (group B), than those achieved with only one daily low-sodium exchange.</p><p>The rationale behind designing a solution that was not compensated was that over time this would lead to decreased thirst and thus a lower fluid intake that would more than make up for the expected loss in ultrafiltration. The level of thirst measured at baseline was similar to that reported by Wright using the same methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and again supports the impression that PD patients experience increased thirst; if this were as a result of sodium sieving then low-sodium solutions by increasing diffusive sodium removal will close the gap between salt and water removal and thus be expected to be of benefit. Both groups experienced a reduction in thirst, which appeared more marked in group A, possibly because they had a higher mean score at baseline. It is of interest that the effect on thirst did not become significant until the second month of treatment raising the possibility that the lack of effect seen in group B was also due to an insufficiently long observation period; previous studies have found that the maximal effect of salt restriction may not be seen for 6 months in haemodialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p>Both the solutions investigated in this study appeared to be safe. Only one patient had to stop the study due to hypotension and five patients had to reduce their BP medication. No patients developed hyponatraemia that probably reflects the decision to use the low-sodium solution for just one of the exchanges during the 24-h period. There was no significant fall in residual renal function in either group suggesting that the impact on blood pressure and fluid status is rather gradual. However, follow-up was just for 2 months and clearly, longer studies are required to confirm safety.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study indicates that it is possible to improve BP control, fluid status and thirst in PD patients with the use of low-sodium fluids, as long as the osmolality is preserved to maintain UF volume. Net sodium diffusive removal per given glucose load was clearly increased by low-sodium solutions, even moderately exceeding the predictions made by computer modelling such that net sodium removal using a 2.0% solution exceeded that removed by a conventional 2.5% dialysate. Finally, over the observation period, a moderate increase in daily sodium removal was safe with no effects on plasma sodium, residual renal function or inflammatory markers. These observations form the basis for future larger randomized controlled trials to establish the clinical value of low-sodium dialysate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Gambro Lundia AB, Sweden and also in part by funding from the Swedish Research Council (grant no. 08285).
