School-based programs can facilitate change in the environment as well as encourage adopting a healthy lifestyle <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Previous findings on eating disorder prevention programs have been mixed. Paxton <xref rid="pone.0091778-Paxton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> reported that about half the school-based curricula have been shown to have positive impact on some aspects of body image. A smaller proportion has produced changes in eating measures. Others found, a larger positive effect in high-risk participants, over the age of 15 years, and female-only participation groups <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-Fingeret1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, usually effect sizes from effectiveness trials were small to moderate, though some effects were medium in magnitude <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>It was suggested that school-based programs should include strongly interactive and participatory components <xref rid="pone.0091778-Paxton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-McVey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and incorporate self-esteem components <xref rid="pone.0091778-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To avoid glorification of eating disorder, a wellness approach may be preferred <xref rid="pone.0091778-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A wellness approach to prevention programs focuses on overall aspects of well-being, addressing self-esteem, problem solving, stress management, and goal setting, with no special attention to eating disorders.</p><p>In Favor of Myself addresses the four main areas that were found effective when incorporated in preventive programs <xref rid="pone.0091778-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>: Education about adolescence, media literacy <xref rid="pone.0091778-VarnadoSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-Wade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, cognitive dissonance <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-Golan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and incorporation of wellness approach <xref rid="pone.0091778-McVey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091778-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

This question has not been addressed specifically so far in the research field.</p><p>Physical, neurological and psychological changes are often experienced differently by male and female adolescents. It has been observed that men assess their physique in terms of strength (chest, shoulders, biceps and muscular strength), while women express concerns related to weight and the shape of certain body parts (hips, thighs, buttocks, etc.).</p><p>Concern for body image differs according to the gender. While boys are concerned with having a muscular body image, girls have beauty ideals that are inseparable from thinness, in most cases below a healthy size <xref rid="pone.0091778-VarnadoSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-McArthur1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. So, for men, being underweight is seen negatively but for women it is desired <xref rid="pone.0091778-Cash1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, some research found that for men, thinking you are less muscular than you really are, is related to higher depression scores and eating disorder symptomology <xref rid="pone.0091778-Olivardia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Amongst the sociocultural factors that influence most negatively female and, progressively more, male body image perceptions, are stereotypical ideal body representations, transmitted through different socialization agents and most notably the mass media <xref rid="pone.0091778-Florack1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Although girls have more correct BMI than boys, girls show greater prevalence when it comes to suffering misperceptions of their body image and this creates a greater number of behaviors dedicated to control their weight <xref rid="pone.0091778-Larson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For example, the percentage of adolescents who skip breakfast is higher among girls than among boys; that percentage, in many studies, is more than double <xref rid="pone.0091778-Mullie1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-Vereecken1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Although females, more likely than males, might experience eating disorder symptoms and associated risk factors like thin-ideal internalization and self-objectification, there are also many men who feel dissatisfied and concerned about their physical appearance, and may be affected by eating disorders or use steroids <xref rid="pone.0091778-McCabe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, gender discussions should be included within studies evaluating the effectiveness of prevention programs.</p><p>The majority of prevention interventions had a focus on the needs of females <xref rid="pone.0091778-Scime1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, research does indicate that boys do have body image concerns which may result in body dissatisfaction, steroid use and body dysmorphic disorder [1, 19)] It has been recognized that it is important that attitudinal change takes place in boys as well as girls to support change <xref rid="pone.0091778-Paxton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, a number of studies did include boys in the interventions <xref rid="pone.0091778-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091778-JureguiLobera1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091778-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. O&#x02019;Dea and Abraham <xref rid="pone.0091778-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> reported that the &#x02018;Everybody&#x02019;s Different&#x02019; program was significantly beneficial to male as well as female students. An average of 87% of male students reported that the education program had been of value to them and 72% indicated that they would like to be involved in another similar education program if it becomes available in the future. However, when analyzed separately, the program had no impact on body satisfaction or drive for thinness in males. Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al <xref rid="pone.0091778-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> reported that a media literacy based program revealed, at the long term follow-up (thirty months), an effective internalization of the aesthetic body ideal on boys and girls as a way of sustaining resilience. The authors also found improvement among girls, as well as boys, that at baseline scored the &#x0201c;EAT-26&#x0201d; above the cut-off <xref rid="pone.0091778-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This manuscript describes the gender differences in respect to self-esteem, self-image, body-image, media literacy and contingencies of self-worth among adolescents who participated in a school-based wellness program, In &#x02018;Favor of Myself&#x02019;. This program focuses on self-esteem, self- image, body-image, media literacy and cognitive dissonance, due to their perception as protecting agents against hazardous behaviors such as eating disorders, alcohol abuse and drugs <xref rid="pone.0091778-VarnadoSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Our study explored the genders' differences responses to &#x02018;In Favor of Myself&#x02019;, a wellness program that was evaluated via a longitudinal, controlled intervention study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by Tel Hai institutional research board and every parent signed a written consent.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Two hundred and ten adolescents (mean age 13.5, ranged between 12&#x02013;14 years) participated in the intervention group.

In short, &#x02018;In Favor of Myself' consists of eight structured 90-minute sessions, delivered approximately one week apart in groups of 15&#x02013;20 participants. Each session describes the background of the topic and offers interactive activities to engage participants in the subject in both verbal and nonverbal ways. The program was integrated into a regular school coping skills curriculum- a program which offers teachers with a list of topics and activities to deliver in each grade. It is delivered once a week, focusing on personal and social skills.</p><p>After receiving Tel Hai Institutional review board approval and parents' informed consent, the baseline status of participants and controls were assessed using a computerized questionnaire which was filled also at program termination and at 3 months follow-up. Twenty trainers (school counselors and teachers) were trained to deliver the program while the task of data collection was assigned to research students. Each participant was given an identification number to ensure confidentiality and anonymity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measures</title><p>Demographics, including personal and familial details, were obtained from each participant at baseline. The psychometric properties of the self-report measures were previously described <xref rid="pone.0091778-Golan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In short, the computerized questionnaire included the following measures: perception of the changes occurring during adolescence, identification of media strategies that promote consumption and internalization of stereotypes, pressure by media using the pressure subscale of SATAQ-3, contingencies of self-worth using the other's approval and appearance subscales of CSW), self-esteem using the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, body image using the figure body images (FBG), eating attitude and behaviors using EAT-26 and drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction which are subscales from Eating Disorders Inventory-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Participants were clustered in 9 program-groups. In order to take into consideration the unit treatment additivity the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for each variable. Due to reasonable ICC (range of 0.03&#x02013;0.07) the analyses were performed with all data sets together.</p><p>The change in scores over time was analyzed after the intervention (pre-&#x0003e;post) and over the 6 months study (pre-&#x0003e;3 months follow-up).

The program also aimed to promote ability to filter external media and culturally inappropriate messages about diversity of beauty.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study support and extend previous research suggesting that there are gender differences in respect to body image and self-image in young adolescents. Further, there appear to be some differences but some similarities in how girls and boys are affected by preventive program.</p><p>Gender differences were statistically significant, already at baseline, in most of the variables. Compared to boys, girls reported to be more contingent by appearance, and that their self-image is more influenced by popularity, appearance, interpersonal communication and admired people. These findings seem to agree with the results of most studies conducted on gender and its relation with appearance, achievement and with self- efficacy and self- esteem <xref rid="pone.0091778-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Girls reported on more awareness to life burdens and at the same time perceivedlife as exciting and interesting at baseline.</p><p>In respect to body image, a larger gap has been noted among girls between current body figure and perceived ideal figure at baseline as well as higher awareness to the pressure imposed by media and higher wish to &#x02018;fix&#x02019; oneself. Not only were they more dissatisfied with their body, but girls were more active in attempts to become and/or remain &#x0201c;thin&#x0201d;.</p><p>Researchers support the idea that there are gender disparities in adolescent self-esteem with some claiming that girls having lower self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0091778-Harter1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091778-Sira1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and others found that boys have lower self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0091778-Bhardwaj1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These differences might be explained by the different ages and cultures investigated. The higher self-esteem in boys compared to girls is more common in middle adolescence than in early adolescence, as was found in our study.</p><p>Studies reported by Fairburn indicate that when adolescent girls are insecure, they become significantly more self-conscious and have greater concerns about popularity, lower body esteem, and lower self-esteem. Self-consciousness leads to increased self-criticism, leaving the adolescent extremely vulnerable to disordered eating <xref rid="pone.0091778-Fairburn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Another explanation is that girls are more liable than boys to be influenced by their physical self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0091778-Usmiani1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, which has been found to be central to overall self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0091778-Harter1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Oliva <xref rid="pone.0091778-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> assumes that these differential patterns of self-appraisal have their origins partly in parental gender linked beliefs and partly in cultural stereotypes.</p><p>Young girls are searching for positive themes with which to identify, to make them feel like they fit in with a group and to make them feel confident. Ideally, the teenager will emerge from the process stronger and more confident, knowing who they are and thinking they know what they want out of life. Unfortunately, this is not always the case <xref rid="pone.0091778-Phares1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The large effect size of gender at baseline questions the appropriateness of providing universal preventive programs to mix gender groups.</p><p>At program termination, gender &#x000d7; time effect was detected with only girls exhibiting significant increase in awareness to changes associated with adolescence, reduction in contingencies of self-worth by others, increase in importance given to achievements at schools, parents' perceptions and decrease in importance given to appearance in relation to self-image. Boys did not show this trend. A large effect size (partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.38) with statistically significance had been found in awareness to changes associated with adolescent due to the intervention but with only small gender &#x000d7; time effect (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.053). Girls reported on larger increase in perception of life as exciting and interesting when getting older. Most differences between girls and boys were also detected at follow-up.</p><p>These changes demonstrate a process of &#x02018;growing&#x02019;, acquiring knowledge and change in perceptions following the intervention. Although knowledge may not immediately translate into behavioral changes, it may well provide protection against external pressures at a later date, and provide a foundation on which to evaluate new situations.</p><p>In respect to body image, dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, a statistically significant increase has been noted in the size of ideal body figure among girls in the intervention group as well as decrease in the gap between current and ideal body figure. The change in ideal body figure, was gender sensitive, with higher and maintained change in girls (assessed at 3 months follow-up), while smaller and disperse among boys. Both genders exhibited reduction in drive for thinness with no gender &#x000d7; time effect.</p><p>Other studies employing the Figure Body Images also showed that in the case of girls the ideal body is substantially smaller than their own, whereas no difference in choice occurred in the case of boys <xref rid="pone.0091778-Williamson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091778-McCabe3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Owing to a more critical stance by girls with regard to their body image, they manifest a high esteem for their body image which causes a self-awareness related to overweight and obesity. Nevertheless, the presented intervention succeeded in decreasing the gap between current and ideal body figure of girls in the intervention group. In contrast, boys mean current figure at baseline was closer to their perceived ideal figure and lower than their perceived healthy figure. In respect to the gap between current figure and the ideal, attractive and healthy figures, there was a consistent difference between the genders. Girls always perceived their current body figure above their ideal figure as well as above girls' attractive and even healthy figures, while boys always felt their current body figure is below their ideal as well as <italic>below</italic> boy's attractive and healthy figures. This trend had been observed during all three assessment point. The impact of intervention on body image was different among genders, but it did not reach a statistically significant effect. In contrast to boys who had demonstrated, during time of assessments, increase in the gap between their current figure vs. ideal or attractive figuresm, in girls the gap decreased. Since the change in boys' gap was not statistically significant it is hard to draw conclusions in respect to these gender opposite trends. Although research documents that some adolescent boys experience body dissatisfaction, these concerns appear to be less pronounced for boys than they are for girls in this age range and less than those of adult males. Hargreaves and Tiggeman <xref rid="pone.0091778-Hargreaves1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> found that among adolescent boys aged 14 to 16, a small percentage of boys reported high levels of body image dissatisfaction and engagement in body change strategies. Most of the boys discussed a desire to change their weight and their height, though the most prevalent body image concern was about being stronger and more muscular. O&#x02019;Dea &#x00026; Abraham <xref rid="pone.0091778-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> reported that post-pubertal boys have been shown to have less body dissatisfaction then prepubertal boys.</p><p>Moreover, the use of body figure ratings to assess men's body image dissatisfaction is problematic because many men want to become more muscular rather than fatter but the figure ratings do not allow them to express this goal. The use of these figure rating scales could explain why previous research has found that men and boys experience fewer body image problems. Most males are not likely to indicate a desire to look like a chubbier figure than they already are (except males with a low BMI) when their real desire is to become more muscular.</p><p>Flament et al <xref rid="pone.0091778-Flament1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> reported that in adolescent males, weight-esteem partially mediated the relationship between muscular ideal and restrained eating; while appearance-esteem partially mediated effects in the emotional and external eating regressions. This finding suggests that boys may be more at risk to engage in restrained eating behaviors when their focus is on their weight, and not their overall appearance, in relation to the lean, toned look portrayed in the media. Moreover, Flament et al <xref rid="pone.0091778-Flament1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> suggested that it could be that poor appearance-esteem and internalization of the muscular ideal are more likely to occur among males who experience negative affect and emotional instability. In both genders, appearance-esteem appears as the sole (males) or stronger (females) predictor for both emotional eating and external eating. Appearance-esteem includes qualities beyond weight satisfaction, e.g., satisfaction with muscle tone and facial beauty. Perhaps the additional qualities of appearance-esteem account for the dominant association with emotional and external eating, which offers an opportunity for future research in the field.</p><p>As has been previously reported by us <xref rid="pone.0091778-Yager1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reduction in influence of appearance on self-worth was found to be associated with self-esteem. Those with higher self-esteem at baseline showed greater reduction in influence of appearance on self-worth. Brown <xref rid="pone.0091778-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> suggested that global self-esteem guides the way people evaluate their specific qualities. From this perspective, people who are fond of themselves in a general way (i.e., those with high self-esteem), imbue themselves with many positive qualities. They like the way they look and they appreciate more their talents <xref rid="pone.0091778-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, preventive program should incorporate contents that address global self-esteem as well as appearance-esteem and not only focus on weight-esteem.</p><p>Since our study has showed that boys exhibited fewer gains from the program in comparison to girls and showed a tendency towards increase in the gap between current figure and ideal or healthy figure, it is very important to explore whether prevention intervention programs may actually have a counter-productive effect on boys and may be girls might gain more from the program when the program is delivered in mixed gender groups. Since boys tend to be less emotionally matured than girls, and less self-conscious about their appearance in mid adolescents years, (when this program is delivered), a long-term follow up should be performed to observe the program impact for both genders.</p><p>Paxton <xref rid="pone.0091778-Paxton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> suggested that it may well be that girls, perhaps more particularly older girls, will feel inhibited and vulnerable discussing body image issues in the company of boys, and this would have a negative impact on those who arguably need the program most. In addition, the issues for boys, e.g. bulking up and gaining height, may not be very relevant for girls and better be managed in programs specifically tuned for boys. Furthermore, different maturational levels of boys and girls may present difficulties for mixed discussions on some issues. On the other hand, boys contribute in a very powerful way to the social environments of girls and vice versa, so awareness of each group on the pressures on their counterpart may well be beneficial. Gonzalez et al <xref rid="pone.0091778-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> reported that in their program both boys and girls exhibited improvement in internalisation of the aesthetic body ideal, thirty months after termination.</p><p>Limitations of the present study must be acknowledged. Self-report measures may fail to provide reliable information, mainly in respect to eating behaviors and to body misperceptions since we did not use anthropometrical parameters. Moreover, due to limited resources, longer-term follow-up with the current population was not possible. Despite such limitations, the study's longitudinal nature, the intervention that targets multiple risk factors (media images, stereotypes, interpersonal communication, peer influence, media literacy and critical perspective towards the ideal self and body image) and the gender &#x000d7; time analysis are major advantages which may provide causal associations among the variables examined.</p><p>Moreover, it provides information on both male and female adolescents, which enable us to focus on the gender differences and consider which topics might be extended for each gender.</p><p>Given the differences in individualization-separation processes and ideal body image for males and females, males report pressure for increased masculinity and higher BMI <xref rid="pone.0091778-DalleGrave1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, it is essential to investigate principles for developing healthy body satisfaction for both genders. Further research is needed to explore the long term impact of this program as well as its impact when provided to girls and boys separately.</p><p>In conclusion, the main objectives of prevention programs conducted in schools should be to identify and criticize the aesthetic beauty model, to develop critical thinking skills and to challenge the glorification of thinness for girls and muscular ideal for boys <xref rid="pone.0091778-VarnadoSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> as well as support self- esteem which relies on other foundations than appearance.</p><p>Since changes brought about by interventions are typically, though not always, short-lived, it is insufficient to have one intervention and then no further support of the ideas and attitudes introduced in the program. Most likely, developmentally appropriate interventions should continue to be introduced throughout childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. Continued interventions or booster sessions need to be considered mainly in light of the reports that programs that were offered to participants over 15 years of age had a greater effect <xref rid="pone.0091778-Stice2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> than those offered to younger ones.</p><p>Today, there is no reliable evidence supporting the superiority of either mixed or uni-gender groups thus future studies may benefit from comparing the impact of the program when delivered to mixed gender groups vs. uni-gender groups as well as longer-term follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0091778-Stice1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
