Building on previous research with disaster-exposed children and adolescents, a randomised clinical trial was performed in the treatment of trauma-related symptoms. In the current study two active treatments were compared among children in a broad age range and from a wide diversity of ethnic populations.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective</title><p>
The primary aim was to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Design</title><p>
Children (<italic>n</italic>=52, aged 4&#x02013;18) were randomly allocated to either CBT (<italic>n</italic>=26) or EMDR (<italic>n</italic>=26) in a disaster mental health after-care setting after an explosion of a fireworks factory. All children received up to four individual treatment sessions over a 4&#x02013;8 week period along with up to four sessions of parent guidance. Blind assessment took place pre- and post-treatment and at 3 months follow-up on a variety of parent-rated and self-report measures of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology, depression, anxiety, and behaviour problems. Analyses of variance (general linear model repeated measures) were conducted on the intention-to-treat sample and the completers.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results</title><p>
Both treatment approaches produced significant reductions on all measures and results were maintained at follow-up. Treatment gains of EMDR were reached in fewer sessions.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>
Standardised CBT and EMDR interventions can significantly improve functioning of disaster-exposed children.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)</kwd><kwd>cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</kwd><kwd>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</kwd><kwd>disaster</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>For the abstract or full text in other languages, please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurojnlofpsychotraumatol.net/index.php/ejpt/rt/suppFiles/5694/0">Supplementary files</ext-link> under Reading Tools online</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Disaster-exposed children often experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and behavioural problems, which may persist for years thereby potentially disrupting biological, psychological, and social development (Goenjian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">2005</xref>; La Greca, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2008</xref>; Yule et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">2000</xref>). Despite the enormous public health significance of this problem and the value of making effective intervention available (Cohen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">2006</xref>), very few randomised controlled studies on treatment of disaster-exposed children have been reported.</p><p>Chemtob, Nakashima, and Hamada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">2002</xref>) provided 248 hurricane-exposed elementary school children a series of four individual or group sessions of psycho-education and graded exposure. Compared to the waiting list control group, treated participants reported significant reductions in trauma symptoms that were maintained at 1-year follow-up. Thirty-two participants who still met criteria for PTSD were later randomised to three sessions of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) or to a waiting list control group. Compared to the control group, those receiving EMDR showed significant reductions of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression with improvements maintained at 6-month follow-up (Chemtob, Nakashima, &#x00026; Carlson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">2002</xref>). Four months after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, 56 children (7&#x02013;12 years old) with moderate to severe levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of group or individual trauma/grief-focused treatment combining cognitive-behavioural and narrative strategies plus one parent meeting (Salloum &#x00026; Overstreet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">2008</xref>). Participants in both conditions showed significant post-treatment decreases in symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, traumatic grief, and distress. In another study after Hurricane Katrina, 118 children (9&#x02013;15 years old) were randomly allocated to individual Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT; 12 sessions) at a mental health clinic and a group CBT intervention (10 group sessions and 1&#x02013;3 individual sessions) at school (Jaycox et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">2010</xref>). Both interventions led to significant symptom reduction of PTSD symptoms, but many still had elevated PTSD symptoms at post-treatment. Finally, 31 children (8&#x02013;14 years old) with a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD subsequent to war and the tsunami in north-eastern Sri Lanka were randomly assigned to six sessions of either narrative exposure therapy for children (KIDNET) or meditation&#x02013;relaxation (Med-Relax; Catani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">2009</xref>). At 6-months follow-up, recovery rates were 81% for the children in the KIDNET group and 71% for those in the Med-Relax group (not significantly different).</p><p>The most common treatments for child PTSD are CBT and EMDR with a greater research base for CBT and related approaches (Adler-Nevo &#x00026; Manassis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2005</xref>; La Greca, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2008</xref>; Stallard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">2006</xref>). Although both treatments have been proven to be efficacious in children and adolescents with post-traumatic stress reactions, only one direct comparison has been published. Jaberghaderi, Greenwald, Rubin, Zand, and Dolatabadi (2004) randomised 14 sexually abused Iranian girls (ages 12&#x02013;13) to EMDR or CBT. Participants in both groups showed significant post-treatment reductions in post-traumatic stress symptoms. The EMDR group used fewer sessions. However, this study had many limitations including a small sample size, a single therapist for each treatment condition, and no verification of treatment fidelity.</p><p>A large fireworks factory exploded in Enschede, the Netherlands on May 13, 2000 killing 22 people, injuring many, destroying more than 500 houses, and damaging 1,500 more. In total about 10,000 people were affected, of which the number of children and adolescents is unknown. One-third of the affected area's inhabitants were first- and second-generation immigrants mostly of Turkish origin (Committee Oosting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">2001</xref>). The primary aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of an exposure-based cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT, &#x0201c;<italic>opvangprotocol&#x0201d;</italic>)&#x02014;the most widely used treatment for pediatric PTSD in the Netherlands&#x02014;and EMDR among disaster-exposed children. The second aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of both treatments, because a treatment's efficiency has direct consequences for health resource utilisation and costs and may also affect client retention and satisfaction.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0001"><title>Method</title><sec id="S20002"><title>Participants</title><p>This field study was initiated 6 months after the fireworks factory exploded and ran from 2001 to 2004 at the disaster mental health after-care centre Mediant in Enschede, the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were: (1) aged between 4 and 18 years, (2) having firework disaster-related symptoms, and (3) willingness to participate voluntarily. Exclusion criteria were: (1) problems were not disaster-related, (2) severe psychiatric conditions occurred requiring an emergency response (suicidal intent, psychosis), or (3) he/she was already receiving psychotherapy elsewhere. Use of such broad inclusion criteria is common in field studies and is deemed to strengthen their ecological validity.</p><p>Recruitment occurred as a routine procedure when parents approached Mediant for help with their children. Of the 133 children and adolescents assessed for eligibility, 13 (9.8%) reported symptoms that were not disaster-related, 6 (4.5%) only requested consultation (the parents), 22 (16.5%) did not show up after the first contact, 18 (13.5%) refused participation to the study, 14 (10.5%) were excluded for an unknown reason, and 8 (6%) because another treatment was indicated. The 52 survivors were randomly allocated to EMDR (<italic>n</italic>=26) and CBT (<italic>n</italic>=26). The trial profile is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJPT-2-5694-g001"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Procedure</title><p>The protocol and informed consent form had been approved by the local ethics committee. Children were first screened by a senior psychologist who conducted the initial interview meant for gathering of information on medical and psychiatric history including trauma history. The results of the screening were discussed by the fireworks after-care team. If they agreed that symptoms were disaster-related and the child fulfilled other inclusion criteria for this study, they were eligible to participate. Written consents were obtained. The manager of the after-care team then randomised participants to either CBT or EMDR by flipping a coin and assigned participants to therapists on the basis of availability. Assessments pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at follow-up were conducted by one independent assessor who was blind to the treatment conditions. Parents completed paper-and-pencil measures at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at follow-up, and only children of 7 years and older completed self-report measures.</p><p>Both CBT and EMDR treatment were manualised to ensure that the respective interventions were standardised across clinicians. Psycho-education regarding explanation of post-traumatic symptoms and the treatment were part of both methods. Both CBT and EMDR entailed a focus on the identified disaster-related trauma memory. To equalise the treatment conditions, the therapist was allowed to treat other trauma memories if they spontaneously arose while working with the index trauma but was not allowed to systematically work through all trauma memories as might normally be done by some therapists (but not others) in clinical practice. Participants received up to four individual weekly sessions of 60 min duration. As in clinical practice, termination criteria were: (1) children were asymptomatic according to participant and parent verbal report, and (2) therapist and child (&#x0003e;12 years)/parents agreed that no additional sessions were necessary. When there were still severe complaints after four sessions, the multidisciplinary team could decide to offer more trauma treatment. Three participants were referred for additional treatment (not trauma-related) after the research protocol was completed: one in the EMDR condition and two in the CBT condition.</p><p>Because parent guidance is an integral part of treatment for child and adolescent trauma, parents in both groups attended up to four sessions provided by the child's therapist or by a trained colleague. Parent sessions were typically held on the same day as the child sessions and were discontinued upon termination of the child's treatment. The child plus parent sessions in each treatment condition provided a total of up to 8 hours of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="S20005"><title>CBT</title><p>The exposure-based CBT intervention (originally <italic>opvangprotocol</italic>; Eland, de Roos, &#x00026; Kleber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">2002</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>) was the predominant trauma treatment available to children in the Netherlands at the time of the study. The most important elements of the treatment are psycho-education about trauma and its effects, repeated exposure to the trauma memory via the development of a detailed trauma narrative, cognitive restructuring, exploring and correcting undesired or unhelpful coping behaviour, and relapse prevention. The trauma narrative is constructed over the course of several sessions by having the client describe the trauma in detail including thoughts, feelings, images/sensations, and events as they occurred. If the narrative exposure did not by itself lead to changes in dysfunctional trauma-related beliefs or behaviours, cognitive restructuring and advice about changing unhelpful coping behaviour was provided. Conjoint parent&#x02013;child feedback is a common element in all sessions, giving children an opportunity to share their trauma narratives and other aspects of the session with their parents. Because of the wide age range of our sample, developmentally appropriate modifications were incorporated into the child sessions. This primarily involved using age-appropriate language to describe the events and its effects in the narrative, add drawings where necessary to the narrative to increase detail and clarity, and using age-appropriate language to provide advice about changing dysfunctional beliefs and coping skills. The applicability of this CBT protocol had previously been examined in a feasibility study (<italic>N</italic>=47, age 4&#x02013;18, single trauma) and showed that it was effective in reducing post-traumatic stress reactions and behaviour problems (Eland, de Roos, &#x00026; Kleber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">1999</xref>).

Briefly, EMDR treatment consists of (1) Taking history and planning treatment. (2) Explanation of and preparation for EMDR. (3) Preparation of the target memory. The client is asked to focus on the worst moment of the memory in a multi-modal manner including image, thought, emotion, and physical sensation. (4) Desensitisation of the memory. The therapist asks the patient to hold the target image in mind while concentrating on the stimulus for about 30 seconds. The client reports briefly what comes up and is guided by the clinician to refocus on that during further exposure to the distracting stimulus. This continues until the client reports no remaining distress related to the memory. (5) Guiding the client to embrace a relevant positive belief regarding the event. (6) Identification and processing of any residual disturbing body sensations. (7) Closure of the session. (8) Re-evaluation, in which the patient comments on previously processed targets as a basis for guiding further intervention.</p><p>The EMDR procedure in the present study was based on Shapiro's (2001) protocol, with age-appropriate modifications suggested by Tinker and Wilson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">1999</xref>) and Greenwald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">1999</xref>). In this study, mainly the therapist's moving hand was used as the distracting stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="S20007"><title>Parent guidance</title><p>Parent guidance sessions were equivalent across treatment conditions. Goals of the parent guidance were to resolve parents&#x02019; own emotional upset about the child's traumatic exposure and to correct cognitive distortions that the parents may have had. Parents also received psycho-education and advice on enhancing effective parenting and appropriate parental support, affective expression, and correcting of undesired coping behaviour of their child.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0008"><title>Therapists and training</title><p>Treatment was conducted by eight licensed therapists (three psychotherapists, two psychologists, and two registered psychiatric social workers). Each of the therapists treated at least one participant in each condition, and up to seven participants in total. All clinicians were trained in both treatments by the first author, a co-developer of the CBT protocol, and an expert on EMDR for children.</p><sec id="S20009"><title>Treatment adherence</title><p>Several actions were taken to support and evaluate treatment adherence.</p><sec><title>Supervision</title><p>Once a month the first author provided a full day (six contact hours) of group supervision to the clinicians on both methods.

To evaluate treatment adherence, 25% of the completed session forms were randomly selected (blocked for equal sampling from each therapist and each treatment).

In the present study, child and adolescent forms were used as a self-report scale with children from the age of 6 and older. The parent version was used for all ages. The disaster-related index event was the focus of the responses. A cutoff of 38 or greater for a single incident traumatic event has been found to have the greatest sensitivity and specificity for detecting PTSD (Steinberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">2004</xref>). In the present study Cronbach's alpha was .85.</p><p>The <italic>Child Report of Post-traumatic Symptoms</italic> (CROPS; Greenwald &#x00026; Rubin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">1999</xref>) is a 26-item self-report questionnaire not referenced to a specific event, covering a broad spectrum of children's post-traumatic symptoms. The CROPS has shown good validity and reliability with children ages 7&#x02013;17 in several settings and languages as well as sensitivity to change in post-traumatic status (Greenwald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2002</xref>). We did not use the CROPS with the younger children because of concerns about item comprehension. In the present study Cronbach's alpha was .89.</p><p>The <italic>Parent Report of Post-traumatic Symptoms</italic> (PROPS, Greenwald &#x00026; Rubin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">1999</xref>) is a 32-item companion measure to the CROPS, with similar validity with children ages 7&#x02013;17 (Greenwald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2002</xref>). We used the PROPS with all participants because the PROPS symptoms apply also to younger children and because downward age extension has been successful in clinical practice. In the present study Cronbach's alpha was .90.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The <italic>Birleson Depression Scale</italic> (BDS; Birleson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">1981</xref>) was used to assess the degree of depression. This self-report inventory consists of 18 items with a three point scale. The BDS has shown satisfactory internal consistency and stability (Ivarsson &#x00026; Gillberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">1997</xref>). In the present study Cronbach's alpha was .78.</p><p>The <italic>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children</italic> (MASC; March, Parker, Sullivan, Stallings, &#x00026; Conners, 1997) is a 39-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents, aged 7&#x02013;18. The MASC demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity (March et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">1997</xref>). In the present study, Cronbach's alpha was .88.</p><p>The <italic>Child Behaviour Check List</italic> (CBCL; Achenbach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1991</xref>) is a widely used 118-item behaviour rating scale for children ages 4&#x02013;18, where parents rate their child's behavioural problems. It has very acceptable reliability and validity. Verhulst, van der Ende, and Koot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">1996</xref>) reported Cronbach's alphas of .85, .86, and .92 for internalising, externalising, and total scores, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analysis of variance and the descriptive statistics were performed with SPSS 14.0 for Windows. Pre-treatment (baseline) demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and extent of exposure to the Enschede disaster were compared between the two treatment conditions using independent <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. The data were analysed using analysis of variance (GLM: general linear model, repeated measures). Time (pre-treatment, post-EMDR/CBT, and follow-up) was used as a within-subject variable, and treatment (CBT or EMDR) as a between-subject variable. Two types of analyses were performed. Primary analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat sample using data from all randomised participants, while secondary analyses were performed using data from subjects who completed treatment. In the intention-to-treat analysis we replaced outcome data that were missing due to dropout using multiple imputations by fully conditional specification (Van Buuren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">2007</xref>). The imputation model was specified for 44 outcomes. Predictors in the imputation model included age, sex, treatment, treatment of parents, and ethnicity as well as other outcomes and were set up such that both relations between and within time were preserved. Five complete data sets were made by 20 Gibbs sampling iterations in Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE; Van Buuren &#x00026; Oudshoorn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2000</xref>).</p><p>All GLM analyses were repeated for each set. Pooling of statistical parameters was done by Rubin's rules (Rubin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">1987</xref>). Pooling of ANOVA tables was done by the procedure of Li, Meng, Raghunathan, and Rubin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">1991</xref>) applied to the <italic>F</italic>-statistic. Post hoc analysis also employed the effect size (ES) of the change using Cohen's <italic>d</italic> (Cohen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">1992</xref>). To correct for dependence among means in order to make direct comparisons to effect sizes from between-subjects studies, we used the correlation between the two means so that Morris and DeShon's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">2002</xref>) equation can be applied. An effect size &#x0003c;.50 is considered small, between .50&#x02013;.80 is considered moderate, and &#x0003e;.80 is considered large. For all statistical analyses, a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>A time-to-event analysis for treatment efficiency was done for three outcomes: number of child sessions, number of parent sessions, and the sum of these two. The analysis was performed by Cox regression using the number of sessions as the outcome, dropout as the censoring indicator, and treatment group as the explanatory variable. Ties were handled by the Efron approach. Additional covariates (age, sex, and indicators of trauma severity) were included to see whether these explain any observed differences in efficiency. The covariate trauma severity was measured by the following indicators: &#x0201c;present in inner ring&#x0201d; (yes/no), &#x0201c;thought I would die&#x0201d; (yes/no), &#x0201c;separated from parents&#x0201d; (yes/no), &#x0201c;house damaged or lost&#x0201d; (yes/no). We tested for proportionality of the hazards by weighted residuals approach of Therneau and Grambsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">2000</xref>). Calculations were done with the cox.zph function in R2.11.1. None of the terms of the model was significant at the .5 level. The data thus do not contradict the assumption of proportional hazards.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0017"><title>Results</title><sec id="S20018"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref>, demographic characteristics and clinical variables by treatment group are shown.

Thirty-eight children completed both the treatment and the follow-up (18 EMDR, 20 CBT). Of them, 21 were boys (55.3%). The main reason given for dropping out was that the parents were overburdened (57%). Other reasons for dropping out were: refusing to talk (7%), language problems (7%), and a new trauma rising to the forefront (14%). One adolescent refused treatment from a therapist not belonging to his own culture (7%) and one child showed spontaneous recovery before treatment started (7%). Dropout occurred in the very beginning before treatment was started and seemed to be unrelated to the treatment condition. For this group that did not receive the allocated treatment, it was attempted to conduct the assessments post-treatment and at follow-up, albeit without success. Comparison between the 14 dropouts and the 38 completers regarding presentation at time of initial assessment yielded no significant differences on any of the demographic characteristics or number of traumatic experiences (UCLA parent version, trauma screen).

Apparently both CBT and EMDR are capable of substantially reducing children's symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and behavioural problems presenting in a community mental health setting. The post-treatment gains of both treatments were maintained at 3-months follow-up, while no side effects were reported. These findings are especially promising considering that the children and parents in the present study received together only six to eight sessions of 60 min each, indicating that brief treatment in this context can be highly beneficial. The results bode well in the light of the large treatment needs among traumatised children worldwide and are consistent with data on adult studies on CBT and EMDR, in that both methods were efficacious and that the effect sizes were substantial (Bisson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">2007</xref>; Seidler &#x00026; Wagner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">2006</xref>). Although no significant differences between the treatments were found, this does not mean that differences can be excluded since the study may be underpowered.</p><p>The finding that treatment gains of EMDR were reached in fewer sessions than those of CBT is in line with some previous randomised controlled studies comparing CBT and EMDR (Jaberghaderi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">2004</xref>; Power et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">2002</xref>). However, it is possible that this finding of difference in efficiency was an artefact of slight differences across conditions in the treatment fidelity and of the research design. In this study, the session durations were roughly similar across treatment conditions, but the number of min per session was not precisely tracked. It is therefore conceivable that the mean duration of the CBT sessions might have been shorter than that of the EMDR sessions.</p><p>A number of other limitations must be recognised when considering the present findings. First, the relatively small number of participants may have resulted in a lack of sufficient power and sensitivity to detect small differences between the groups. Second, the study lacked a no-treatment control group. Third, follow-up assessments were undertaken at only 3 months post-treatment, thereby limiting conclusions regarding the sustainability of the treatment gains over a longer time period. Finally, in this unfunded field study the fidelity ratings were based on session checklists with no systematic review of session recordings to verify the therapists&#x02019; documentation. Therefore, the current findings must be interpreted with due caution.</p><p>Methodological strengths of our trial include the inclusion of two active trauma treatments, validated measures with clearly defined target symptoms, multiple sources to detect the impact of treatment on multiple symptom domains, random assignment to treatment condition, the same therapists for both treatment conditions cancelling possible therapist effects, blind evaluation, detailed manual-guided treatment protocols, expert therapist training, supervision and therapist checklist forms to support treatment adherence, (limited) assessment and confirmation of treatment fidelity, and field conditions and inclusion criteria supporting ecological validity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results provide support for the effectiveness of both EMDR and CBT among a heterogeneous, multicultural sample of children and adolescents with disaster-related symptoms indicating the feasibility of implementing these treatments for children.

More research is needed to confirm EMDR's efficiency advantage and to address the issue of comparative efficacy between these treatments for psychological trauma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all children, parents, and therapists of Mediant, who took part in the study.
