Hemagglutination-inhibition assays were performed 28 days after 1 or 2 doses in primed and unprimed children, respectively. Immunological noninferiority of QIV vs TIV against shared strains, and superiority against alternate-lineage B strains was based on geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates.

Among influenza virus types, influenza A is generally considered to represent the greatest public health concern, yet the burden of influenza B in children is substantial. Influenza-related hospitalizations and complications such as myositosis are more common in children infected with influenza B than with influenza A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C8">8</xref>].</p><p>Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza and associated complications, and trivalent influenza vaccines include 2 influenza A strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2) and 1 influenza B strain, selected using surveillance-based forecasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C9">9</xref>]. Two antigenically distinct influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria) emerged globally in humans in the early 1980s and have co-circulated in the United States since 2001[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C10">10</xref>]. However, trivalent influenza vaccines provide limited or no cross-reactive protection between the 2 influenza B lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C11">11</xref>]. Moreover, in the United States, the seasonal trivalent vaccine was mismatched for the circulating influenza B lineage in 5 of 10 influenza seasons between 2001 and 2010 and in Europe was mismatched in 4 of 8 seasons between 2003 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C14">14</xref>]. Given the burden of influenza B infection and the rate of B-lineage mismatch with trivalent vaccines, in February 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended B strains from both lineages for inclusion in quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2012/2013 season in the Northern Hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C15">15</xref>].</p><p>Here we report a Phase III, randomized, double-blind study of a candidate inactivated quadrivalent split viron influenza vaccine (QIV) containing both B lineages compared with 2 inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years. The purpose of the study was to test the immunologic noninferiority of QIV vs TIV against shared influenza A and B strains, and superiority against influenza B of QIV vs TIVs containing an alternate-lineage B strain. QIV was also assessed in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months as a separate open-label group.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and Subjects</title><p>This phase III, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study was conducted to assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of QIV vs TIV in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years. There was also an open-label group to assess QIV in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months. The study was conducted in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Philippines, and the United States (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00287469).</p><p>Children were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 6 months to 17 years and were in stable health; children with chronic illness were eligible for inclusion unless there was evidence of significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal functional abnormalities. Children were excluded if they had received any registered or investigational seasonal influenza vaccination within 6 months or any investigational product within 30 days preceding the first study vaccine dose. Other exclusion criteria were history of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous TIV, hypersensitivity to influenza vaccine or its components, immunosuppressed, and receipt of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months preceding vaccination.</p><p>Children who were considered &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; received 1 dose of candidate or control vaccine, and those considered &#x0201c;unprimed&#x0201d; received 2 doses of candidate or control vaccine given 28 days apart; priming status was based on US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C16">16</xref>]. Children aged &#x0003c;9 years were considered primed if they had received at least 1 dose of an A/H1N1 2009 monovalent vaccine or had a laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 2009 infection during the previous influenza season, and had also received 2 doses of a trivalent seasonal vaccine (at least 1 month apart) during the previous influenza season, or at least 1 trivalent seasonal vaccine dose prior to the previous influenza season. Children aged &#x0003c;9 years who did not fulfill the definition of primed were considered to be unprimed.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians of all children. The study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations. All study documents were approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Vaccines, Randomization, and Blinding</title><p>The QIV candidate contained influenza A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) and A/H3N2 (A/Victoria/210/2009) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria lineage) as recommended by WHO for the 2010/2011 season in the Northern Hemisphere, and B/Brisbane/3/2007 (B/Yamagata lineage), which had been recommended for the 2008/2009 season. The TIVs contained the same influenza A strains as the QIV candidate, and either B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria lineage) [<italic>Fluarix</italic>&#x02122;] or B/Brisbane/3/2007 (B/Yamagata lineage). The inactivated split virion vaccines were thimerosal-free, contained 15 &#x000b5;g of each hemagglutinin antigen, and were manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines in Dresden, Germany.</p><p>A randomization list was generated by GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium. Randomization in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years was performed in a 1:1:1 ratio to QIV, TIV-B/Victoria (TIV-Vic), or TIV-B/Yamagata (TIV-Yam), and treatment allocation at each study site was performed using an internet-based system that balanced groups by age strata (3&#x02013;8 years and 9&#x02013;17 years). The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for country, center, and previous receipt of influenza vaccine (priming status).</p><p>All vaccines were presented as colorless and slightly opalescent suspensions in prefilled glass syringes containing 1 dose (0.5 mL); in the randomized study, all participants/participants&#x02019; parents/guardians, investigators, and study personnel were blinded as to vaccine allocation. In the open-label group, vaccines were labeled as to contents. Serological data were not available during to investigators or study personnel; laboratory testing was blinded to the vaccine allocation, and codes linked subjects to each sample.

The parents/guardians of subjects used diary cards to record solicited injection-site and general adverse events (AEs) for 7 days following vaccination. Injection-site AEs were pain, redness, and swelling, and general AEs were fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite (aged &#x02264;5 years) or fever, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, muscle aches, and shivering (aged &#x0003e;5 years). Fever was defined as an oral/axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C or a rectal temperature &#x02265;38&#x000b0;C. Intensity of solicited symptoms was graded (0&#x02013;3); grade 1 symptoms were defined as not interfering with normal activities, and grade 3 symptoms were defined as preventing normal activities (grade 3 redness and swelling: diameter &#x0003e;50 mm; grade 3 fever: temperature &#x0003e;39&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 28 days after each vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and medically attended adverse events (MAEs) were recorded for 6 months postvaccination.

QIV elicited more than 2-fold higher mean HI antibody responses vs each TIV for the influenza B strain from the alternate lineage, which translated into an absolute SCR difference of at least 35.0%. The observed postvaccination GMTs against the vaccine strains in children aged 3&#x02013;8 years were similar to those in children aged 9&#x02013;17 years regardless of priming status, apart from the GMT for the B/Yamagata antigen, where children 9&#x02013;17 years of age had marginally higher pre- and postvaccination titers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIT091F2">2</xref>). QIV was also immunogenic in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months, although GMTs were lower than those observed in the older group; SPRs were &#x02265;71.4%, SCRs were &#x02265;68.1%, and SCFs were &#x02265;9.7 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIT091TB2">2</xref>). There appeared to be no major differences in immune responses by sex or by priming status in the QIV and TIV groups.

In the open-label group, QIV was also immunogenic against all 4 vaccine strains in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months. Reactogenicity and safety of QIV was consistent with the established profile of TIVs in younger and older children, suggesting that formulation with an additional 15 &#x000b5;g of influenza B antigen did not compromise safety. The noninferiority and superiority of the candidate QIV vs TIV against shared strains and an additional B strain, respectively, supports the use of QIV for vaccination against seasonal influenza in children aged more than 3 years as a strategy to potentially improve protection against influenza B.</p><p>There is a clear need for moving from a trivalent to a quadrivalent vaccine including both influenza B lineages as this could reduce the burden of seasonal influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C18">18</xref>]. In children, influenza B is associated with substantial morbidity and hospitalization and is reported to be a disproportionate cause of influenza deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C24">24</xref>]. For example, in the United States during the 2010/2011 season, although influenza B accounted for only 26% of infections, 44 of 115 (38%) influenza-related deaths in children were associated with influenza B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C25">25</xref>]. Moreover, a previous integrated analysis of trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) studies in unprimed children aged 6 months to 6 years, showed that vaccine efficacy against influenza B was 86%, 55%, and 31% if the vaccine B strain vs the prevalent B strain was same lineage, same-lineage drift variant, or alternate lineage, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C11">11</xref>]. The results of our study suggest that the candidate inactivated QIV could address influenza B lineage mismatch and potentially improve protection. QIV was immunogenic in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years, with SCRs of 91.4%, 72.3%, 70.0%, and 72.5% against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata, respectively.</p><p>Influenza vaccines are only moderately immunogenic in children &#x0003c;3 years of age who have had limited previous exposure to vaccines and viruses, and 2 doses of vaccine are recommended in influenza vaccine-naive children aged 6 months to 8 years to achieve protective antibody titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C19">19</xref>]. Indeed, new vaccines and vaccination strategies are needed to improve protection against influenza in infants and toddlers. As such, the open-label arm of our study was conducted to generate pilot data of immunogenicity and safety of QIV in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months prior to a confirmatory Phase III trial. We showed that QIV elicited robust immune responses against all 4 vaccine strains with SCRs of 78.0%, 68.5%, 68.1%, and 82.3%, against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata, respectively, thus supporting further development of QIV in very young children.</p><p>The addition of 15 &#x000b5;g of antigen to a trivalent vaccine has the potential to affect reactogenicity and safety. In our study, the reactogenicity profile of QIV was consistent with TIV in older children, and no major safety concerns were raised in infants. Injection site pain was the most frequent solicited AE in younger and older children with each vaccine. The rate of fever &#x0003e;39&#x000b0;C in children aged 6&#x02013;35 months was 2.54% (dose 1) and 5.4% (dose 2), which was slightly more frequent than in children aged 3&#x02013;5 years (0%&#x02013;1.3%). Overall, grade 3 events were uncommon, and SAEs in the QIV group were consistent with the TIV group.</p><p>The main limitation of the study is that the immunogenicity data provides no information on the magnitude of protection against influenza B illness. Although QIV elicited antibody titers against the added B strain that were superior to TIV and that exceeded levels considered to be protective, the clinical benefits of QIV vs TIV remain to be established. After QIVs are used in annual vaccination programs, their impact on the prevention and control of influenza can be further evaluated in effectiveness trials conducted over multiple seasons.</p><p>Natural exposure to influenza viruses was a potential confounding factor as children were enrolled between early October and mid-December 2010, and blood samples were taken until mid-February 2011. In the United States and Europe, influenza activity increased in December 2010 and peaked in early February 2011, with A/California/7/2009 (A/H1N1) viruses predominating in Europe and A/H3N2 viruses predominating in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C27">27</xref>]. Influenza B viruses, mainly from the B/Victoria lineage, also circulated widely in Europe and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT091C27">27</xref>]. Natural exposure during the study cannot be excluded, yet the effect on the confirmatory immunogenicity endpoints was likely to be limited because the vast majority of blood samples (approximately 95%) were taken before peak season, the exposure risk was expected to be &#x0003c;10%, and the study was controlled, meaning that exposure would have been similar across both vaccine groups.</p><p>In summary, QIV provided noninferior immunogenicity against the shared strains, and superior immunogenicity against the additional B strain compared with TIV in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years. In the randomized study, and the open-label group (children aged 6&#x02013;35 months), QIV elicited robust antibody responses against all 4 vaccine strains. These results show that QIV could prevent influenza B lineage mismatch and potentially improve protection against influenza B. The immunogenicity and safety results support a switch from TIV to QIV in children aged 3&#x02013;17 years.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Acknowledgments.</italic></bold>&#x02003;All authors participated in the implementation of the study including substantial contributions to conception and design, the gathering of the data, or analysis and interpretation of the data.
