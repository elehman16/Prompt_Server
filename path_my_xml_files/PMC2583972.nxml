All subjects undertook moderate intensity aerobic training during three 40-minute sessions per week, over 3 months. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TAG), fasting insulin and fasting glycemia were analyzed in plasma. Thereafter, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated. Tests were performed at baseline (Pre) and after four (Post 4), eight (Post 8) and twelve (Post 12) weeks.</p><p>We observed main time effects in both groups for HDL (Post 4 versus Post 8; <italic>P </italic>= 0.01), TAG and VLDL (Pre versus Post 4 and Post 8; <italic>P </italic>= 0.02 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.01, respectively). However, no between group differences were noted in HDL, LDL, CT, VLDL and TAG. Additionally, fasting insulin, fasting glycemia and HOMA did not change significantly.</p><p>These findings suggest that Cr supplementation does not exert any additional effect on the improvement in the plasma lipid profile than aerobic training alone.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Several recent studies have indicated that creatine (Cr) supplementation may reduce the symptoms and progression of certain diseases, including mitochondrial cytopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and glucose intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition there is evidence that Cr supplementation may also improve the lipid profile when combined with exercise training. Kreider et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported higher plasma HDL-cholesterol levels and lower VLDL-cholesterol in Cr-supplemented athletes undergoing resistance and agility-sprint training compared to their non-supplemented counterparts, while Arciero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] reported lowered plasma total cholesterol concentrations after 28 days of Cr supplementation combined with resistance training. In contrast, Kreider et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] did not observe any changes in the plasma lipid profile of athletes after 21 months of Cr supplementation. However, none of the aforementioned studies were undertaken with the specific intention of examining the changes in plasma lipid profile. The designs of these studies did not allow any conclusion regarding possible additive effects of Cr supplementation on the plasma lipid profile during training.</p><p>To our knowledge, only Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported a specific effect of Cr supplementation on the plasma lipid profile. This group observed that physically active subjects with high basal cholesterol levels exhibited a reduction in blood total cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol, after 12 weeks of Cr supplementation. The authors attributed these changes to a reduction in blood glucose (<italic>P </italic>= 0.051) brought about by Cr supplementation. Reduced blood glucose was interpreted to indicate an enhancement in insulin sensitivity, which simultaneously could improve the lipid profile if followed by a reduction in fasting insulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is known from other studies that, changes in glycemia and/or insulinemia may directly affect blood lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Pedersen and Saltin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have reported that aerobic training has a positive effect on blood lipoproteins. Independently, Walsh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have indicated <italic>in vitro </italic>a regulatory effect of creatine (Cr) and phosphorylcreatine (PCr) on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria which is consistent with a model first proposed by Wyss et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as well as the boader view that the primary role of the Cr-PCr/CK system is the regulation of ADP homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These authors demonstrated that PCr decreases the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to ADP whereas Cr has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several investigations have shown increases in Cr content with little or no change in PCr following Cr supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This would lead to a reduced PCr/Cr ratio, favouring an increase in intra-mitochondrial [free ADP]. Walsh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] noted that a combination of increases in [free ADP] and [Cr] at rest would elevate mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation after Cr supplementation. This raises the possibility that Cr supplementation could exert an additive effect to aerobic training on the balance of lipid and carbohydrate utilisation as fuels during training, with long term effects on the blood lipoprotein profile. Theoretically this could provide an explanation for the positive effects observed by Kreider et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Arciero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (though we note again that no similar effect was observed by Kreider et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]).</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that Cr supplementation and aerobic training have an additive effect on glucose tolerance, which could not be attributed to an enhanced training capacity alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. From this we hypothesized that the inclusion of Cr during aerobic training may also affect the plasma lipid profile, particularly in early training. The aim of this study was therefore to test the possible synergistic effects of Cr supplementation and aerobic training on the plasma lipid profile, glucose and insulin levels in healthy, sedentary, males.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Participants were recruited between August and December 2005 from Sao Paulo, Brazil, through advertisement in local newspaper and distribution of leaflets to homes.

Blood draws were performed prior to training (Pre), after 4 (Post 4), 8 (Post 8) and 12 weeks (Post 12). Samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm, 4&#x000b0;C, for 5 minutes and stored in a -70&#x000b0;C freezer.

Body weights were those measured at the start of the study. This resulted in absolute doses in high body weight subjects slightly higher that those usually used for loading and maintenance (see also Discussion). During the loading phase supplements were presented in four packages, with equal content, and subjects were instructed to ingest one supplement package at breakfast, lunch and dinner and the fourth at 10 pm. During the maintenance phase the dose was divided into two with subjects consuming the supplement during lunch and dinner. The packages were coded so that neither the investigators nor the participants were aware of the contents until completion of the analyses. All subjects were instructed to dissolve the supplements, preferably in juice, in order to mask both the low solubility of Cr and the taste of dextrose. To evaluate subject blinding, the questionnaire asked subjects to indicate which treatment they believed they have received (Cr or placebo) at end of study. The compliance to Cr supplementation was monitored weekly by personal communication. The subjects completed a weekly questionnaire regarding possible adverse effects of Cr supplementation (adapted from Volek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]).</p><p>In order to verify the purity of the Cr used, a sample was analysed by HPLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and 99.9% purity was established.</p></sec><sec><title>VO<sub>2peak </sub>test</title><p>VO<sub>2peak </sub>was determined using an incremental treadmill exercise test conducted according to the Bruce protocol. This test is conducted in three minutes stages. The Bruce protocol begins with a speed of 2.74 km&#x000b7;hour <sup>-1 </sup>and a slope of 10% corresponding to a work rate of approximately 4.6 METS. Each 3 minutes the workload is increased by a combination of increasing the speed and the grade of the treadmill. Attainment of VO<sub>2max </sub>was accepted when two of three criteria were met: a plateau in VO<sub>2</sub>, a respiratory exchange ratio (RER)&#x0003e; 1.1 and volitional exhaustion. Ventilatory gas exchange threshold (VT) was determined by the V-slope method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise training</title><p>Both groups were submitted to aerobic training, three times a week, for 40 minutes per session, for 3 months. Running intensity was set at the corresponding heart rate of 70% of VO<sub>2peak </sub>determined by an incremental VO<sub>2peak </sub>test. Subjects were requested to run at the pre-set heart rate during the whole training period. Thus, an increase in both running distance and running intensity were expected as training progressed. All sessions were monitored by a fitness-professional. From the outset it was ruled that subjects would be dropped from the study if they missed three non-consecutive training sessions, or two consecutive sessions. One subject from PL group was excluded for this reason.</p></sec><sec><title>Food intake assessment</title><p>Food intake was assessed by three 24-hour dietary recalls, using visual-aid photographs of real foods.

The mean body weight of the CR group was 83.1 &#x000b1; 16.3 kg. The dose of 0.3 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;kg <sup>-1 </sup>was chosen to ensure that subjects even at the lowest body weights received a loading dose close to 20 g per day, although the same relative dose resulted in a higher loading dose in subjects at the upper end of the weight range. However, we were cognisant that some authors have suggested that use of a low Cr dose may have been responsible for the lack of change in lipid profile in the study of Volek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The doses of Cr used in this study are comparable to the fixed dose of 20 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1 </sup>used by Arciero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] during the first 5 days, and 10 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1 </sup>over the next 3 weeks.</p><p>Following the earlier work by Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] our aim was to test if Cr supplementation combined with aerobic training was an effective strategy for the improvement in the lipid profile in healthy sedentary males. The main findings were a reduction in triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol, after moderate intensity aerobic training (main time effect). However, Cr supplementation had no further effect on lipid profile improvement. It is important to note that we did not test the effect of aerobic training <italic>per se </italic>on lipid profile. We tested for a possible additive effect of Cr supplementation on the previously described improvement in lipid profile after aerobic training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Our findings do not agree with those of Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The differences between studies may have arisen from differences in their research design. Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] selected hypercholesterolemic men and women (those with total cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dl), while we investigated healthy sedentary males. Thus, it was expected from the outset that a lower adaptative response would be shown by our subjects since their baseline values were within the normal range (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, baseline data). In addition, Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] stated that Cr supplementation reduced triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol levels at week four, and maintained them up to week 12, compared to baseline values (-23%, -22% and -26%, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, respectively). However, the Cr and placebo groups had different baseline values. Thus, this difference impairs the comparison between groups as is not possible to distinguish between a true treatment effect from a distinct response due to a baseline difference.</p><p>Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] also reported a decreased fasting glucose trend (<italic>P </italic>= 0.051). According to the authors, such a decrease indicated a possible improvement in insulin sensitivity, which would cause a better lipid profile particularly if followed by a reduction in the fasting insulin levels. However, our results and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have shown neither a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity nor a decrease in fasting glucose, after Cr supplementation. In light of these findings, we may suggest two explanations: 1) Cr supplementation has no effect on insulin sensitivity, or 2) Cr supplementation does improve insulin sensitivity slightly, but not enough to enhance the lipid profile in healthy subjects. As we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have demonstrated that Cr supplementation may increase both glucose tolerance and glycogen content, we consider the latter hypothesis more plausible. Ferrante et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] indicated that Cr intake can ameliorate hyperglycaemia, typical of transgenic Huntington disease mice, delaying the onset of diabetes. Supporting these findings, Eijnde et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] verified that Cr ingestion can reduce the insulinogenic index in an animal model of inherited type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cr might exert beneficial effects on glucose uptake mainly in insulin resistant conditions, although the exact mechanisms underlying these adaptations have yet to be clarified. Interestingly, Eijnde et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed that Cr intake increases GLUT-4 protein content in line with glycogen accumulation during muscle disuse and a subsequent period of training, suggesting a role of GLUT-4 in Cr-induced glucose uptake enhancement.</p><p>Kreider et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] also reported an improvement in the lipid profile of professional football players following Cr supplementation (15.75 g&#x000b7;day <sup>-1</sup>) during 28 days of high intensity training. The supplemented group presented a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol (13%), and a significant decrease in both triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol (-13%), compared to the placebo group, showing an additive effect of Cr supplementation. Accordingly, Arciero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] showed that intense strength training in conjunction with Cr supplementation (25 g&#x000b7;day <sup>-1 </sup>for 7 days followed by 5 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1 </sup>for 11 weeks) significantly decreased total cholesterol values (-9.9%) when compared to strength training only. Their results reinforced the hypothesis that Cr supplementation had an additive effect to training effects on the lipid profile. A possible explanation for this phenomenon was that Cr supplementation enhanced training quality indirectly (i.e. by optimizing volume and intensity). In a review manuscript, Durstine et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] suggested that the lipid profile improved incrementally with training volume and intensity. Therefore, as Cr supplementation allowed subjects to train at a higher intensity/volume, then the training itself may have enhanced the effect and not the supplementation <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>Cr supplementation is reported to be effective mainly in the improvement of performance during sustained or intermittent high intensity exercise and not in aerobic training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Whilst Cr supplementation has not been shown to increase performance in moderate intensity aerobic activity, Walsh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] have suggested a mechanistic role for Cr in the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation which clearly could have impact on the relative utilization of carbohydrate and fat as fuel sources, and indirectly could affect the plasma lipid profile. Whilst an attractive hypothesis, our observations do not support any such effect of Cr supplementation.</p><p>Volek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] similarly failed to observe any effect on the lipid profile of three months Cr supplementation and periodized resistance training. Arciero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] suggested that the lack of change in lipid profile after resistance training in Volek's study might have been a consequence of the low dose of Cr used (5 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>). However, in our study we provided ~10 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1 </sup>and again no difference between the placebo and the Cr group was observed. Thus, whilst exercise is clearly important in determining the plasma lipid profile, Cr itself does not appear to have any additional effect in healthy males.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cr supplementation did not have any additive effect on the plasma lipid profile of healthy sedentary males undergoing moderate intensity aerobic training for 3 months. These results may appear contradictory to those of Earnest et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] although we emphasise that this earlier study was carried out on hypercholesterolemic subjects, whereas ours were normocholesterolemic. Notwithstanding the lack of benefits in this present study we would suggest that additional studies should be carried out to investigate any indirect effect of Cr supplementation on the lipid profile as a result of subjects being able to train at a higher intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BG is the principal investigator of the project.
