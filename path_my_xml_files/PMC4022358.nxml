Although more oocytes than tubal infertile patients are retrieved from women with PCOS during <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF), similar pregnancy rates are achieved compared with tubal infertile patients. Some data suggest that women with PCOS may have increased miscarriage rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A previously reported meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] demonstrated that PCOS patients are at increased risk for pregnancy complications and neonatal complications, including gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and preterm birth, all of which may lower the chances of live births. Whether that is attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of PCOS, the underlying infertility, the disturbed steroids level or a combination of these factors, however, is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Effective interventions are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients.</p><p>Additionally, both superovulation and assisted reproductive technologies may carry additional risks for abnormal pregnancies. Multiple studies have reported higher risks of abnormal placentation (such as greater placenta weight, placenta previa and preeclampsia), pregnancy complications (such as gestational hypertension) and obstetric complications (such as preterm delivery, low birth weight and high cesarean section rate) in singleton pregnancies induced by assisted conception compared with spontaneous conception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Researchers in several observational studies have demonstrated that pregnancies arising from the transfer of frozen&#x02013;thawed embryos seem to have better obstetric and perinatal outcomes (such as antepartum hemorrhage, small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight and perinatal mortality) than those induced by fresh embryo transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Investigators in two independent studies revealed a statistically significant association between elevated peak serum estradiol (E2) levels on the day of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger and the risks of SGA and preeclampsia in singleton pregnancies conceived via IVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Researchers in a cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated that elective cryopreservation of all embryos and subsequent frozen&#x02013;thawed embryo transfer reduced the odds of SGA and preeclampsia compared with fresh embryo transfer in patients with elevated peak serum E2 levels (&#x0003e;3,450&#x000a0;pg/ml). We hypothesize that supraphysiological steroid level immediately before embryo implantation may represent an independent contributing factor to the increased risk of these pregnancy and obstetric complications.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the current evidence is based on retrospective and uncontrolled studies in which the results may have been confounded by the &#x0201c;second-best&#x0201d; quality of embryos in frozen&#x02013;thawed cycles. The primary outcome of most existing studies is clinical pregnancy, which is defined as the detection of a fetal heartbeat at 7&#x000a0;weeks gestation. Furthermore, despite the distinct characteristics of infertile PCOS patients compared with tubal infertile patients, few long-term follow up studies have been focused on PCOS patients undergoing IVF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial (1:1 treatment ratio), live birth rates of fresh embryo transfer vs frozen&#x02013;thawed embryo transfer are being compared in 1,180 infertile PCOS patients undergoing their first cycle of IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Participants will be enrolled at 14 hospitals across mainland China. This study has been approved by the ethics committees at all study sites (listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).
