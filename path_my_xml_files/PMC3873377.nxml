Obesity is associated with many health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Obesity is the result of a positive energy balance, which occurs when more energy is ingested than expended. Weight loss is achieved by reducing energy intake and/or increasing physical activity (energy expenditure). Increased body weight may be driven by hyperphagia on holidays and weekends (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and less physical activity on Sundays (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Physical activity and exercise are involved in energy homeostasis. As was recently reported from 5 decades of NHANES data, there has been a gradual decrease in physical activity in the workforce that may be accounting for much of the increase in body weight seen during the timeframe (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Edholm found that physical activity was positively related to energy intake with a 48 hour delay (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It is generally accepted that there is a loose positive coupling of energy expenditure from exercise and food intake (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since physical activity may be coupled with food intake and directly affect energy balance, it is critical to account for this part of the energy balance equation (energy expenditure) when performing food intake experiments.</p><p id="P7">Overeating produces a positive energy balance and has not been found to affect physical activity (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The amount of food or energy that people ingest varies from day-to-day (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) with an average intra-individual coefficient of variation (CV) of 25% (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). de Castro originally demonstrated there was a 2&#x02013;3 day lag in habitual free-living energy intake (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) but more recently Bray et al. showed 3&#x02013;4 day corrective responses to habitual variations in food intake, which may be critical in energy balance homeostasis (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Saris et al. also noted a lag in intake and expenditure in bicyclists during the Tour de France bicycle race (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Thus a lag time appears to exist between energy intake and subsequent corrective responses.</p><p id="P8">Lowering the energy density of food decreases energy intake (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Over 4 days, obese, but not lean women decreased food intake on a low fat low energy density diet compared to a low fat high energy density matched diet (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The authors suggested that energy intake may be regulated by weight or mass of food rather than its total energy. Thus the more energy consumed per unit weight of food, the more energy will be consumed. Fat (9 kcal/g) and water (0 kcal/g) are the main contributors to energy density as carbohydrate and protein each have 4 kcal/g. The current study tested the hypothesis that manipulating energy density and fat content might affect subsequent energy intake following overeating.</p><p id="P9">It has been demonstrated that dietary fat is positively related to energy intake (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) whereas the carbohydrate balance of humans is found to be negatively associated with energy balance (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus higher carbohydrate intake and lower energy density may decrease energy intake especially during times of overeating. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of overeating a high-fat low-energy density diet (HF/LED), high-fat high-energy density diet (HF/HED), and high-carbohydrate low-energy density diet (HC/LED) for 2-days on subsequent 4-day food intake, activity levels, energy expenditure, and ratings of appetite and mood. To our knowledge, we are among the first to control activity/energy expenditure during overeating and to examine differences in energy balance after overeating high fat diets that varied in energy density.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><p id="P10">The two studies reported herein were conducted according to the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki and all participants were given verbal and written explanations about the study, provided signed informed consent, and received a monetary stipend. The studies were approved by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board and were registered at clinical trials.gov NCT 01653886 (pilot study) and NCT 01653145 (main study).</p><sec id="S7"><title>Pilot Study</title><p id="P11">A pilot study was conducted to develop study menus that were similar in appearance, aroma and taste. The menus were created using the Standard Reference database. The pilot study occurred prior to the parent study and is a separate study with different participants. Sixteen participants (9 M and 7 F, mean &#x000b1; SD, 32 &#x000b1; 7 years old, 26.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) started and completed the pilot study. All participants completed the taste tests on a single day.</p><p id="P12">The following four diets were utilized in the pilot and main study: 1) a baseline diet (15% protein, 30% fat, and 55% carbohydrate; 11 g fiber per 1000 kcal), 2) a high-fat low-energy density diet (HF/LED, 4.4 kJ/g or 1.05 kcal/g), 3) a high-fat high-energy density diet (HF/HED, 6.7 kJ/g or 1.60 kcal/g), and 4) a high-carbohydrate low-energy density diet (HC/LED, 4.4 kJ/g or 1.05 kcal/g). The high fat diets were created by adding fat with 15% protein to the baseline diet, resulting in diets that were 50% fat, 35% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. The high carbohydrate diet was created by adding carbohydrate with 15% protein to the baseline diet, resulting in a diet that was 20% fat, 65% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. The three treatment diets were low or high in energy density (low = 4.4 kJ/g or 1.05 kcal/g; high = 6.7 kJ/g or 1.60 kcal/g) which was consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Energy density was manipulated by modifying the water content of foods such as soups. Participants overeating the HF/LED, HF/HED, and HC/LED diets consumed 7 g, 10 g, and 14 g of fiber per 1000 kcal, respectively. The diets are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref> and the individual food items are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P13">Each participant completed taste tests at breakfast, lunch and dinner consisting of the baseline and the 3 treatment menu foods (HF/HED, HF/LED, HC/LED) resulting in each participant rating the palatability of the 12 meals. Every participant completed taste test ratings on a 9-point scale evaluating appearance, flavor, and taste. An ANOVA found no differences between meals at breakfast and dinner. However at lunch appearance and taste were significantly different between the baseline and HF/LED menus. The only menu item which differed was a low energy density soup. Thus the soup was modified to improve the texture and overall ratings of the meal.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Main Study</title><sec id="S9"><title>Screening</title><p id="P14">Inclusion criteria were: 1) BMI &#x02265; 20 and &#x02264; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 2) age 18&#x02013;50 years for men and 18&#x02013;45 years for pre-menopausal women, and 3) regular menses, with no less than 28 day cycles (women only). Women were included in the study who used monophasic birth control pills, copper IUD, or vaginal ring, or who had a complete hysterectomy. Screening and testing of premenopausal women was completed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle to control the effect of menstrual cycle phase on food intake.</p><p id="P15">Exclusion criteria were: 1) diseases or conditions that affected metabolism, appetite, or body weight, which included diabetes and cardiovascular disease, 2) post-menopausal or partial hysterectomy (women only), 3) use of prescription or over the counter medications that affected metabolism or body weight (e.g., sibutramine, orlistat), 4) restrained eating (&#x0003e;14 on the Eating Inventory restraint scale), 5) symptoms of depression (&#x0003e; 13 on the Beck Depression Inventory II), 6) tobacco use, and 8) heavy exercise (&#x0003e; 1 hour per day 5 or more days per week).</p><p id="P16">Participants completed two screening visits prior to being enrolled in the study. At <italic>Screening Visit 1 (SV1)</italic>, potential participants provided written informed consent and their initial eligibility was confirmed. Clinic measurements, including height, weight, blood pressure and pulse rate were collected at this visit. Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and the Eating Inventory (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) (see self &#x02013; report questionnaires for psychometrics). Participants wore the SenseWear&#x000ae; Armband (Body Media, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) between screening visits.

Participants resided on the PBRC inpatient unit (metabolic ward) during overeating and during outcomes assessments. All participants first completed a one-week (day -7 through day -1) baseline period before completing the three randomized overeating diets. Baseline ad libitium food intake tests were completed on days -2 and -1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants lived at home for two weeks mid-way through the study. This was so menstruating females could be tested on the same phase of their menstrual cycle (luteal phase) during all diets.</p><p id="P18">The baseline diet was designed to meet energy requirements; hence, from days -7 to -3 energy intake was adjusted based on daily body weights to achieve weight maintenance. If participants were not weight stable (within &#x000b1; 0.5 kg) during days -7 to -3, foods with the same energy density as the diet were added or subtracted in 100 kcal increments in an effort to achieve body weight stability (energy balance). During overeating, participants were provided with 140% of the energy necessary for energy balance/weight maintenance on the inpatient unit. The amount of energy necessary for weight maintenance was determined by calculating resting metabolic rate (RMR) with the Mifflin equation and multiplying estimated RMR by an activity factor of 1.45. This activity factor was derived from physical activity level data collected from PBRC&#x02019;s inpatient unit as well as other studies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This activity factor was approximately 80% of their free living energy balance requirements. Thus, since participants were in energy balance, 140% of the energy necessary for energy balance/weight maintenance on the inpatient unit is about 12% more energy intake than in free living conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Anthropometric Measures</title><p id="P19">Body weight, height, blood pressure, and pulse were measured in the clinic at screening. Metabolic body weight (subject weight minus the gown weight to the nearest 0.1 kg) was measured on all days participants resided in the Inpatient Unit (Day -7 to Day 17) on a scale (A&#x00026;D, UC-32THW). Participants were weighed after the first void in the morning in a hospital gown and underwear only. All measurements were taken in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Activity</title><p id="P20">During positive energy balance, energy expenditure was maintained at the levels recorded during baseline. On day -4 during baseline, energy expenditure was measured with indirect calorimetry (Parvomedics, Sandy, UT) while participants sat or stood and watched TV for 10&#x02013;20 minutes. Energy expenditure was also measured while participants walked 1, 2, 3 mph (4&#x02013;5 minutes each speed). From these measures, physical activity was tailored so energy expenditure on all overeating days would be fixed and equal to 100% of the energy requirements of living in the inpatient unit.</p><p id="P21">During the days of positive energy balance, energy expenditure was quantified with an ActivPAL accelerometer (PAL Technologies, Glascow, UK) and closely monitored every 1&#x02013;2 hours. Participants were instructed to increase or decrease their energy expenditure to match their baseline levels of EE (within &#x000b1; 10 kcal/hr). Walking and standing was spread throughout the day and supervised by inpatient staff. The average treadmill walking speed was 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 mph. Aside from designated times to wash themselves, the participants were asked to sit the rest of the day.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Food Intake</title><p id="P22">During overeating days, participants were required to consume all food provided. However they were allowed to carry-over unfinished food items to the next meal but were required to finish on the assigned day.</p><p id="P23">During all ad libitum feeding days when food intake was being quantified as an outcome variable (including baseline days -2 and -1), a standardized breakfast and afternoon snack were provided consisting of 663 kcal (30% fat, 55% carbohydrate and 15% protein). Since it was standardized, the breakfast and afternoon snack are not included in the ad libitum meal results. The ad libitum meals were 30% fat, 55% carbohydrate, and 15% protein and consisted of the participants estimated RMR multiplied by an activity factor of 2.3. At lunch and dinner, food was provided and participants were asked to eat to a &#x02018;comfortable level of fullness&#x02019;. On these ad libitum feeding days, the total amount of food consumed (weighted to the nearest 0.1 g) was evaluated for 4 days in the inpatient unit following the 2 days of overeating.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Physical Activity Assessment</title><p id="P24">SenseWear armbands (Body Media, Inc.) were worn by participants throughout the baseline and the first 3 days of ad libitum feeding portions of the study to quantify changes in activity levels and energy expenditure. It was worn on the upper arm and has previously been validated (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The armband was worn at all times by participants (i.e. greater than 95% on body time) except during periods of water submersion (i.e., showering). The arm band measures several parameters including daily energy expenditure (kcal/d), measured active energy expenditure (kcal/d), physical activity duration (min/d), daily steps (steps/d), time lying down (min/d), measured sleep (min/d), and average metabolic equivalents (METs). Measured sleep is an output on the Sensewear report determined from proprietary algorithms based on accelerometry, heat flux sensor, body temperature, and galvanic skin response (sweat). A metabolic equivalent is equal to resting VO<sub>2</sub> which is approximately 3.5 ml &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

However, utilizing a 2-day overeating paradigm, a 2-day lag was shown suggesting that a partial corrective response existed with all treatments. With the overeating paradigm used in this study, there may be a faster partial corrective response (2 day vs. 2&#x02013;4 days) to energy intake compared to conditions of deviations of energy intake near energy balance. During a longer term overeating study, young adults have been shown to compensate for the excess energy provided (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Young males that were overfed 4.09 MJ/d (978 kcal/d) for a period of 21 days reduced food intake following overeating allowing body weight to return to baseline. During our short-term overeating study, a ~30% compensation of energy intake over 4 days was observed. Including this ~30% compensation, the overall net positive energy balance from beginning of overeating till 4 days after it ended was about ~1000 kcal or 250 kcal/d. This uncompensated 1000 kcal increase in energy intake is not negligible. Energy intake decreased following overeating but was not statistically lower than baseline on any day of ad libitum feeding. We could not determine if compensation continued after day 4, which would reduce this positive energy balance but body weight was not different from baseline by day 4 suggesting the 4 day ad libitum feeding was of sufficient length to examine for compensation in energy intake as supported by previous articles by Edholm (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), deCastro (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), Saris (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and Bray et al. (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) suggesting compensation occurs within 4 days. Body weight following the HC/LED was higher than HF/HED possibly due to food weight (g) eaten with the HC/LED and the fiber content. However, during and following overeating HF/LED had similar food intake weights (g) as the HC/LED and even lower fiber content but body weight was not significantly different. Thus food weight and fiber are possibilities but do not fully explain the unexpected body weight effect. The days following overeating did not have any energy, macronutrient, or food intake weight effect differences among groups. The body weight response was an unanticipated result which the authors cannot fully explain.</p><p id="P50">The current study also analyzed ad libitum macronutrient intake. Carbohydrate intake decreased ~15% on days 2&#x02013;4 of ad libitum feeding compared to day 1. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that carbohydrate intake is negatively associated with energy intake. However, carbohydrate intake was reduced on days 2, 3, and 4 of the ad libitum diet period and thus supports another study that found carbohydrate intake and energy intake are positively associated (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is likely that increased glycogen stores from the high carbohydrate diet resulted in increased body weight compared to the 4 days following overeating in the HF/HED treatment. Also, it is well known that macronutrients are not independent of each other. When one macronutrient is altered at least one other macronutrient must be increased or decreased to account for the difference. In the current study, fat and carbohydrate intakes were manipulated. Following overeating, fat intake dropped on day 2 and slowly rose back up to be similar to day 1 on days 3 and 4 of ad libitum intake. This suggests the reduction in fat intake on day 2 and carbohydrate intake on days 2&#x02013;4 may be a determinant for the energy compensation shown starting on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day.</p><p id="P51">Previous research suggested that energy density but not fat intake affects ad libitum energy intake in women (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), leaving the applicability to males unknown. The current study included males and females but did not demonstrate a sex effect. Males and females responded similarly to all treatments. Following overeating of energy density matched foods, ad libitum fed volunteers continued overeating (compared to baseline) on day of 1 of ad libitum energy intake. The partial compensation was not an effect of energy density when analyzed over 4 days. On days 2, 3, and 4 of ad libitum feeding, the HF/LED treatment decreased energy intake compared to baseline, whereas neither the other two (HF/HED and HC/LED) reduced energy intake compared to baseline. During the ad libitum feeding period, our results show energy intake may be affected by energy density and fat intake. It is important to note that the definition of energy density is kcal divided by gram weight of food. However often volume is considered, but not included of the definition of energy density (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p id="P52">The modest differences in food intake in this study resulted in changes in appetite measured with the VAS and RVAS that were consistent with the decreases in energy intake compared to baseline following the HF/LED. Specifically, following overeating, the HF/LED decreased feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption but increased feelings of satisfaction compared to the HF/HED when assessed with VAS. Following overeating, the HF/LED decreased prospective food consumption compared to HF/HED with RVAS. The appetitive response changes are suggestive of decreased energy intake following the HF/LED. With the psychological questionnaires, only carbohydrate/starch craving was altered. Following the HF/HED dietary treatment greater cravings of carbohydrates and starches were reported compared to following the HC/LED but not the HF/LED likely due to the 30% reduction in carbohydrate intake during HF overfeeding..</p><p id="P53">Lastly changes in mood state were seen during this short-term intervention. The 4 ad libitum feeding days following the HF/LED were associated with less sadness (more happiness), relaxation, and tranquility whereas the days following the HF/HED were associated with more sadness, tension, and troubled feelings. These findings are consistent with previous studies in females provided an isocaloric low carbohydrate diet (higher fat) having higher tension, depression, anger, total mood score, and less vigor compared to moderate carbohydrate and high carbohydrate diets for one week (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, longer-term low carbohydrate (higher fat) diets with energy restriction lead to improvements in mood in most studies (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) but not all (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Overconsumption of a high energy density diet may have a particularly harmful effect on mood state. This suggests the previous findings on mood state are not macronutrient specific (i.e. fat) per se, but instead may be related to other attributes or characteristics of the diet which, while speculative, may include psychological factors or the energy density of the diet.</p><p id="P54">The alterations in energy density also changed step count and sleeping time. Specifically following overeating, the participants had decreased steps and increased lying and sleeping time suggesting greater sedentary behavior. Thus step counts actually went in the opposite direction of adaptive thermogenesis. Only the HF/HED dietary treatment increased sleeping time. This suggests short-term overeating as well as high energy density diets negatively affect sleep. The finding that obesity is associated with decreased wakefulness has previously been shown in mice (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, previously in humans increased wakefulness has been associated with obesity (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) but these data rely on self-report. With isocaloric feeding, very low carbohydrate diets (high fat diets) do increase slow wave sleep compared to a control mixed diet (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Our data critically evaluated sleep with the validated Sensewear Armband and suggested that after short-term HF/HED overeating participants increase sleep time compared to baseline and LEDs.</p><p id="P55">Previously, Levine et al. found that overeating causes an increase in spontaneous physical activity (SPA) (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Levine et al. overfed volunteers 1000 kcal for 8 weeks (20% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 40% fat). SPA was the main determinant of fat gain during overeating with an average increase of 336 kcal/d. However other studies have failed to reproduce this effect (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). He et al. performed a 3 day overeating study where participants consumed 150% of weight maintenance energy requirements (overeating) followed by 3 days of ad libitum feeding. No differences in SPA or energy expenditure were detected between weight maintenance and overeating. Murgatroyd et al. imposed physical activity following a 21% overeating with 35 or 60% energy consumed as dietary fat. Imposed physical activity (i.e. exercise not SPA) helped prevent positive energy balance (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Similar to the current study, SPA was not affected by 3 day overeating (25% overeating) in obesity prone and obesity resistant humans (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Thus the current study&#x02019;s short physiologic energy imbalances are suggestive of lack of an expenditure compensation (i.e. SPA) that may be leading to increasing body weight gain in adults.</p><p id="P56">This study had numerous strengths. The patients were housed on the inpatient unit. Chances of dietary alterations or additions were thus negligible because it was a controlled feeding and physical activity study. To our knowledge, we are among the first to control physical activity (the energy expenditure side of energy balance) during overeating, resulting in a precise positive energy balance that was the same across the diet conditions. A potential but necessary weakness was that the baseline feeding was not randomized. Baseline feeding was necessary in order to estimate energy intake for overeating. However as previously described, the 3 overeating diets were randomized among participants. Also as described in the statistical methods, order was included in the mixed model and found to be non-significant for all parameters. Thus the authors do not feel an adaptation period was a study weakness. Another potential weakness was that participants were not exposed to the high carbohydrate high energy density treatment (HC/HED), though this condition was included in previous studies, whereas we are among the first to include high fat diets that were low and high in energy density. Also the pilot study assessed palatability but sweetness was not specifically measured across the diets. This may have altered the mood and cravings of volunteers. Lastly, a possible study weakness was literature from studies including children was excluded. The authors did not feel differences between children and adults on an inpatient unit lent itself well to comparisons. Hence the results from this study are not generalizable to children.</p><p id="P57">In conclusion, following 2 days of overeating, energy expenditure was not altered. However, food intake was non-significantly reduced on day 2 of ad libitum feeding which corresponded with a reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake. The reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake may be a physiological effort to correct for the previous positive energy balance. Treatment had no effect over the 4 day ad libitum feeding period but the HF/LED reduced energy intake compared to baseline on days 2, 3, and 4 suggesting that overeating may shorten the time necessary for the corrective response with energy intake. These modest food intake changes did alter appetitive responses. The HF/LED decreased carbohydrate and starch cravings, lying time, and sleep time compared to the high energy density version of the high fat diet despite identical macronutrient composition. Thus the current study&#x02019;s short physiologic duration of energy imbalances like on weekends or holidays are suggestive of an incomplete energy compensation with no spontaneous energy expenditure compensation. This may be leading to increasing body weight gain in adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>01</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS509090-supplement-01.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e610" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P58">The authors would like to thank the participants, PBRC metabolic kitchen and PBRC inpatient unit.
