The primary endpoint was FEV<sub>1</sub> 1 h post-inhalation after 4 weeks of treatment. Other endpoints included patient&#x02019;s and physician&#x02019;s preference for treatment, patient&#x02019;s satisfaction evaluated using a study-specific questionnaire and the abbreviated Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, and safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eighty-seven out of 88 randomized patients completed the study and showed significantly higher FEV<sub>1</sub> 1 h post-inhalation after 4 weeks of treatment with IND/GLY versus tiotropium (treatment difference =0.081 L; <italic>p</italic>=0.0017). IND/GLY was preferred over tiotropium among the patients (69.4% versus 30.6%, <italic>p</italic>=0.0004) and the physicians (81.6% versus 18.4%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). A higher proportion of the patients stated they were very satisfied or satisfied with IND/GLY versus tiotropium with regard to dyspnea reduction (79.3% versus 58.0%, respectively) and reduction of dyspnea on exertion (72.4% versus 43.2%, respectively). Patients treated with IND/GLY showed significant improvement in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication domain scores versus tiotropium.

The patients were on tiotropium treatment prior to enrollment, and according to randomization, they either continued to receive tiotropium or were directly shifted to IND/GLY without any washout period, reflecting what would occur in clinical practice. This kind of treatment escalation is in line with the GOLD strategy document.<xref rid="b5-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In this study, the primary objective was achieved by demonstrating superiority of IND/GLY over tiotropium after 4 weeks of treatment in terms of lung function, assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> 1 h post-inhalation. It was observed that both patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; preferences for IND/GLY were higher compared with those of tiotropium.</p><p>Consistent with other clinical trials, irrespective of treatment sequence, in the FAVOR study, IND/GLY showed statistically significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> 1 h post-inhalation levels compared with tiotropium. Improvement in lung function is inversely correlated with the use of rescue medications.<xref rid="b14-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This was also evident in our study: the patients on IND/GLY showed less need for rescue medications than patients on tiotropium. Consistently, more patients showed signs of symptom relief when treated with IND/GLY than with tiotropium, indicating greater treatment effect and satisfaction with IND/GLY.</p><p>Importantly, alongside with the improvement in lung function, this study demonstrated that more patients preferred dual therapy with IND/GLY over monotherapy with tiotropium. The treatment choice was influenced by the sequential order of drug administration; patients were more likely to prefer IND/GLY when given first in the sequence. This may be because the perception of more effective medication was perhaps much pronounced when patients were switched from the standard therapy (prior tiotropium treatment) to IND/GLY and then returned back to tiotropium in the last sequence. However, it was an open-label study; thus, patients&#x02019; expectations could have influenced drug preference. Efficacy was the main determinant underlying patients&#x02019; preference for either of the study medications. The very important/important reasons cited by patient for using both the medications were mainly related to reduced airflow limitation (as shown in the post hoc analysis), improved dyspnea, less cough/wheezing, less sputum production, and less chest tightness. Based on each of these efficacy determinants, IND/GLY was preferred by more patients than tiotropium. More physicians preferred treatment with IND/GLY than with tiotropium primarily due to reduced dyspnea, less chest tightness, and fast onset of action. However, these data should be interpreted with much caution, since the physicians were aware of the potential dual versus mono treatment benefits and may have expected better efficacy. Reduction in dyspnea was the most frequently cited reason for preferring IND/GLY by patients and the physicians. Based on the post hoc analysis, the patients preferring IND/GLY were observed to have better improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> levels with IND/GLY compared with tiotropium (about 100 mL increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>). This indicated that even an improvement in lung function of about 100 mL is subjectively detectable and is important for the patient. This is in line with the current notion of COPD-related minimal clinically important difference, whereby a decrease of 100 mL in pre- or trough-FEV<sub>1</sub> is considered to be of clinical significance. Furthermore, this analysis showed that patients preferring IND/GLY had slightly more severe COPD than those preferring tiotropium (severity according to GOLD 2010: Stage II 55.9% versus 65% and Stage III 40.7% versus 30.8%; group classification according to GOLD 2015: Group B 59.3% versus 69.2% and Group D 40.7% versus 30.8%). However, it is important to note that this does not reflect any bias in the study design as the patients were properly randomized, but rather confirms the hypothesis that 1) patients who experience more symptoms benefit more from dual bronchodilation than from monotherapy and 2) patients who experience a better treatment effect prefer the more effective therapy.</p><p>In patients who preferred tiotropium, no statistical difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> levels between the 2 treatments was observed. This result suggests that some patients may not experience an increase in lung function with dual bronchodilation therapy when compared with a monotherapy, hence preferring the monotherapy treatment.</p><p>Treatment satisfaction may help to gauge a patient&#x02019;s perception on current treatment.<xref rid="b16-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In this study, the TSQM-9 score was higher with IND/GLY than with tiotropium, particularly for the domains of &#x0201c;Effectiveness&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Global satisfaction&#x0201d;, which could result in better adherence. In contrast, for &#x0201c;Convenience,&#x0201d; the scores were comparable between treatments. Both the drugs were given o.d. and were inhaled using similar single-dose powder inhaler devices. Therefore, a device effect was unlikely, and the level of convenience while using devices for inhaling IND/GLY or tiotropium perhaps would be similar.</p><p>The safety profiles of both the drugs were consistent with the reported safety in global trials,<xref rid="b7-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-copd-13-069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with no new safety issues reported with IND/GLY or tiotropium in the FAVOR study. A disproportionate ratio of occurrences of cough between the 2 treatments (IND/GLY &#x02013; 13.6% patients and tiotropium &#x02013; 4.5% patients) was observed. Apparently, this observation seems to be contrary to the fact that more patients preferred IND/GLY over tiotropium based on the subjective reason &#x0201c;less cough and wheezing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;less sputum production&#x0201d;. Notably, the TEAE cough persisted for a transient time, and majority of the patients recovered from this event after 1 day. As the treatment progressed, patients experienced fewer symptoms of cough and wheezing as evident based on their reasons for preferring IND/GLY.</p><p>As this was an open-label study, the patients&#x02019; and doctors&#x02019; perceived views about the study medications, be it positive or negative, perhaps had some influence on the study outcomes. IND/GLY was only introduced in the German market at the start of this study, while tiotropium is a well-established drug available commercially for over a decade. This could have raised the expectations for the new drug, which could have influenced patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; subjective judgment. Nevertheless, the data obtained gives a consistent picture wherein the improvement in lung function experienced by patients (reduction in airflow limitation) with IND/GLY may have led to a consistent improvement in symptoms of COPD like dyspnea. This might have mainly contributed to patients&#x02019; feeling of well-being, resulting in a preference for IND/GLY. Indeed, single patients without improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> did not prefer IND/GLY.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the FAVOR study demonstrate the benefit of IND/GLY 110/50 &#x003bc;g o.d. combination therapy versus tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g o.d. monotherapy for treating stable COPD patients with persistent complaints based on both patient-reported outcomes and lung function. Further studies are required to investigate whether the favored treatment option translates into improved adherence and long-term treatment outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank patients and investigators who participated in the study.
