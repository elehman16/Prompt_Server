The generation of electrophilic &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated ketone derivatives of the &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in activated human macrophages is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). These derivatives are potent pleiotropic anti-inflammatory signaling mediators that act via mechanisms including the activation of Nrf2-dependent phase 2 gene expression and suppression of pro-inflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B-driven gene expression.

Thus, the American Hearth Association and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a daily dose of approximately 1 g for secondary prevention <xref rid="pone.0094836-Gebauer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs are also effective in reducing the inflammatory phenotype in other chronic degenerative diseases and acute events <xref rid="pone.0094836-Calder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Among the proposed mechanisms of action through which &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs mediate clinical benefits, the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites may be the most relevant. The enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and lipoxygenases (LOs) in part sustain the onset of inflammation by converting the &#x003c9;-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. These oxygenases also convert &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs into bioactive lipid mediators that promote the resolution of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0094836-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Isobe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Recently, the link between dietary intake of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs and the formation of oxygenated derivatives has been explored showing a positive correlation <xref rid="pone.0094836-Norris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Among oxygenated PUFAs, electrophilic &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated ketone derivatives are of interest because they a) are end-products of hydroxylated fatty acid metabolism, b) display reversible electrophilic reactivity with nucleophilic protein targets via Michael addition reaction and c) modulate the activity of critical inflammatory and host defense signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0094836-Schopfer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this regard, electrophilic PUFAs activate the Nrf2-dependent anti-oxidant response, are partial agonists of the nuclear lipid receptor PPAR&#x003b3;, and suppress pro-inflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B signaling at multiple levels <xref rid="pone.0094836-Groeger1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Straus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Musiek1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recently, a method has been developed for the mass spectrometric detection and quantification of electrophilic fatty acids, based on the use of the &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (BME) as nucleophilic bait <xref rid="pone.0094836-Schopfer2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Its use in profiling electrophilic fatty acid generation by activated macrophages led to the discovery of Cox-2-dependent generation of 13- and 17-oxo-derivatives of docosahexaenoic (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)<xref rid="pone.0094836-Groeger1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These electrophilic ketone derivatives mediate pleitropic anti-inflammatory actions via modulation of transcriptional regulatory protein function thus representing a new class of endogenous lipid mediators.</p><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells and, as early responders to bacterial infections, are critical in shaping the inflammatory milieu by releasing AA-derived 5-LO metabolites including leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>), 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-OH-ETE) and 5-oxo-ETE <xref rid="pone.0094836-Cowburn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The formation of electrophilic 5-oxo-EPA by 5-LO in neutrophils supplemented with EPA antagonizes the pro-inflammatory actions of AA-derived metabolites <xref rid="pone.0094836-Powell2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Of note, the endogenous generation of 5-oxo-EPA and other electrophilic &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated ketone derivatives of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs has not been reported, most likely because of their facile Michael addition to cellular and plasma nucleophiles, which makes it difficult to detect these species in &#x0201c;free form&#x0201d; by traditional organic and/or solid phase extraction methods.</p><p>Herein, the endogenous formation of electrophilic &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated ketone derivatives of DHA, EPA and DPA is reported in neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects. Specifically, 5-LO-dependent generation of 7-oxo-DHA, 7-oxo-DPA, 5-oxoEPA and their hydroxy precursors is reported. Moreover, the effects of EPA and DHA consumption at a clinically-relevant dose (1.4 g/day) on the production of these &#x003c9;-3 PUFA ketone derivatives was evaluated in healthy human subjects participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. There was a significant increase in levels of electrophilic &#x003c9;-3 PUFA ketone derivatives in neutrophils under both basal and activated conditions, with no significant change in AA-derived metabolites. It is proposed that these reactive products transduce the salutary actions of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs by modifying the activity of electrophile-sensitive transcription factors that regulate the expression of inflammatory and metabolic-related genes.

Cell extracts were treated with BME to capture electrophilic species and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. When neutrophils were supplemented with DHA, species displaying a neutral loss of 78 amu revealed a major parent ion with m/z 419.2 corresponding to BME addition to oxo-DHA (m/z 341.2+78) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). MS/MS analysis and accurate mass determination at the 2 ppm level confirmed the atomic composition of the parent and product ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Neutrophils supplemented with DPA presented a major ion with m/z 421.2, corresponding to BME addition to oxo-DPA that fragmented through the neutral loss of BME (collision-induced gas phase &#x003b2;-elimination reaction)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2E, F</xref>). For structural characterization, two different methodological approaches were used: a) MS/MS fragmentation of the ions generated from BME loss during in-source fragmentation (in source &#x003b2;-elimination of BME) and b) MS3 following the sequential loss of BME and fragmentation of the resulting product ion. Both methods gave similar results, although the overall efficiency and intensities obtained upon in-source fragmentation were usually higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2C, G</xref>). Fragmentation of oxo-DHA (m/z 341.2) gave, in addition to the non-specific ions corresponding to loss of water (m/z 323.2) and loss of CO<sub>2</sub> (m/z 297.2), two diagnostic fragment ions at m/z 201.2 and 243.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These corresponded to the fragmentation pattern of 7-oxo-DHA as further confirmed by comparison with a synthetic standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Neutrophil-derived oxo-DPA (m/z 343.2) presented a similar fragmentation pattern that, in addition to the loss of water and CO<sub>2</sub> (m/z 325.2 and 299.2, respectively), gave two diagnostic fragment ions at m/z 201.2 and 245.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g002">Figure 2G, H</xref>), characteristic of 7-oxo-DPA. Formation of di-oxygenated electrophilic derivatives of DHA and DPA was also observed in neutrophils supplemented with the respective omega-3 fatty acid precursors. In particular, the formation of oxo-OH-DHA was observed in neutrophils supplemented with DHA. This species reacted with BME, giving an adduct with m/z of 435.2 and, after fragmentation-induced neutral loss of BME, an ion with m/z 357.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). A similar chromatographic profile was observed for DPA-derived oxo-OH-derivatives in DPA-supplemented samples which gave an adduct with m/z 437.2 characterized by the major neutral loss of BME upon fragmentation and the detection of the free oxo-OH fatty acid with m/z 359.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g003">Figure 3E, F</xref>).

Herein, basal and dietary-enhanced levels of 7-oxo-DHA and 7-oxo-DPA and their respective hydroxy precursors are reported for the first time. Basal levels of these species were detected in neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects, and these levels increased after neutrophil activation by either calcium ionophore or PMA in the absence of <italic>in vitro</italic> or clinical &#x003c9;-3 PUFA supplementation. The formation of these species in neutrophils was abolished upon treatment with the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK-866, revealing a role for 5-LO in 7-OH-DHA and 7-OH-DPA synthesis. 5-HEDH, which displays broad substrate selectivity, is a likely candidate for the catalysis of 7-OH-DHA and 7-OH-DPA oxidation to &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated ketone derivatives <xref rid="pone.0094836-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

This suggests that 5-OH-EPA is converted into the ketone derivative more efficiently than 7-OH-DHA and 7-OH-DPA. These electrophilic products reached a maximum concentration 15 min after neutrophil stimulation and returned to baseline levels at later times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094836-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

There is also an associated reduction of plasma triglyceride levels, reduced risk of atrial fibrillation <xref rid="pone.0094836-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and a variety of local and systemic anti-inflammatory actions of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs both in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="pone.0094836-Itariu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The suppression of AA-derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and an increased generation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites are the two most relevant mechanisms through which &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs have been proposed to exert anti-inflammatory actions. While there is a positive correlation between dietary consumption of EPA and DHA and formation of oxygenated metabolites <xref rid="pone.0094836-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Keenan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Maaloe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Turini1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the effects of EPA and DHA consumption on AA metabolites levels are controversial and likely dependent on &#x003c9;-3 PUFA dosing regimens. Several studies have evaluated the impact of dietary &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs on the production of AA-derived eicosanoids and modulation of membrane lipid composition by lowering &#x003c9;-6 / &#x003c9;-3 ratios <xref rid="pone.0094836-Norris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Keenan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Maaloe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Chilton1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094836-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A decrease of AA-metabolite generation in human plasma as well as in activated neutrophils and macrophages is typically observed upon administration of high concentrations (&#x0223c;5 g/day) of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs <xref rid="pone.0094836-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Turini1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In the current study, no significant differences in the basal content or activated neutrophil formation of AA-derived eicosanoids was observed in both control and fish oil-supplemented groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094836.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The current data support the precept that the biochemical basis for the beneficial actions of dietary &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs is the increased synthesis of bioactive oxygenated species rather than the suppression of pro-inflammatory AA-derived products. Furthermore, increased baseline levels of anti-inflammatory and electrophilic &#x003c9;-3 PUFA derivatives, as reported herein for the fish oil-supplemented group, may limit inflammation and tissue damage. In this regard, both receptor-dependent and &#x02013;independent signaling actions of fatty acid electrophiles would result in transcriptional suppression of genes involved in inflammatory propagation reactions and the activation of cytoprotective mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0094836-Groeger1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-RangelHuerta1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Vedin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094836-Bouwens1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>With regards to the clinical trial herein presented, some study limitations should be acknowledged. First, measurements were not obtained at baseline, before the beginning of dietary supplementation. Therefore, although unlikely due to randomization, the possibility that the observed differences between the two groups existed irrespective of fish oil supplementation cannot be excluded. Second, the study had a small sample size. Nevertheless, statistically significant differences were observed between the two study groups, in particular when analyzing oxidized derivatives of EPA and DHA. Finally, as these measures were obtained in the specified ex vivo preparations, it remains to be determined whether increased intake of EPA and DHA would affect electrophilic &#x003c9;-3 fatty acid ketone derivative generation in vivo. Despites these limitations, findings herein reported are of great significance as they provide the first evidence from a controlled clinical trial that customary doses of dietary EPA and DHA increases the generation of electrophilic oxygenated derivatives with known anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>In summary, we report the formation and dietary modulation of oxygenated electrophilic &#x003c9;-3 PUFA ketone derivatives in neutrophils from healthy subjects. These findings support a role for dietary &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs in exerting salutary cell signaling effects through the formation of electrophilic oxygenated derivatives. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of neutrophils as first responders to sites of injury and inflammation and the function of electrophilic fatty acids in limiting the progression of inflammation and induction of tissue-protective responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094836.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
