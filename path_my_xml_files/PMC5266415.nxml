Many stroke patients, therefore, face severe brain damage, disability, and death.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> An improved acute treatment is urgently needed. Contrast-enhanced sonothrombolysis (CEST), encompassing a thrombolytic drug, ultrasound, and microbubbles, may be the next step in acute ischemic stroke treatment. Transcranial ultrasound weakens fibrin cross-links; promotes motion of blood around the clot; increases uptake, penetration, and concentration of tPA within the thrombus; and thus augments clot lysis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Intravenous alteplase therapy with transcranial ultrasound is safe and may induce higher rates of arterial recanalization, as compared with placebo.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Adding intravenous contrast (microbubbles) induces further acceleration of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis, leading to a more complete recanalization and to a trend toward better short- and long-term outcome.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Previous sonothrombolysis studies, with or without microbubbles, were performed in patients with visible occlusions on computed tomography angiography (CTA).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Patients with visible occlusions constitute 10% to 28% of unselected acute ischemic stroke patients.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> There are no data on the effect of sonothrombolysis in the absence of a visible occlusion. However, sonothrombolysis might also have recanalizing effects in minor arteries, arterioles, or even microcirculation, that is, in mild strokes with small invisible thrombi.</p><p>In NOR-SASS (Norwegian Sonothrombolysis in Acute Stroke Study), we hypothesize that in acute stroke patients, eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, the clinical effect of additional CEST, given within 4&#x000bd; hours from symptom onset, is superior to that of intravenous thrombolysis alone. The aims of this phase III study were to assess the effect and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasound treatment in a cohort of unselected acute ischemic stroke patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>NOR-SASS was designed as a multicenter, prospective, PROBE trial (phase III, randomized, open-label, blinded end point), with the aim to demonstrate superiority of contrast-enhanced ultrasound treatment (sonothrombolysis) versus sham ultrasound treatment in consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4&#x000bd; hours after stroke onset. All patients were pretreated with intravenous thrombolysis, either alteplase or tenecteplase in a 1:1 random fashion. NOR-SASS was superimposed on The NOR-TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial), which randomizes patients with acute ischemic stroke to either tenecteplase or alteplase.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The NOR-SASS study protocol has been published.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The study is approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and the Norwegian Medicines Agency and is registered with EudraCT No 201200032341, and the subjects gave informed consent. The trial is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95).</p><p>The study was conducted at Center for Neurovascular Diseases, Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. Patients &#x02265;18 years of age with acute ischemic stroke symptoms admitted within 4&#x000bd; hours of symptom onset were included in the study.</p><p>Clinical severity was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and function was assessed with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index. All patients underwent CTA on admission. Intracranial arterial occlusion on pretreatment CTA was not a prerequisite for inclusion because this study also includes sonothrombolysis of distal arteries and central perforating arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography or CT/CTA were performed after 22 to 36 hours to verify the infarct, assess intracranial recanalization, and detect hemorrhagic transformation. All NIHSS and mRS scores at 90 days were assessed by a neurologist or research nurses blinded to the given treatment. All CT, CTA, and MRI were interpreted by 2 experienced neuroradiologists blinded to the given treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>NOR-SASS randomized eligible patients to ultrasound, microbubbles (SonoVue) plus alteplase/tenecteplase versus sham ultrasound, sham microbubbles (NaCl 0.9%) plus alteplase/tenecteplase in a 1:1 randomization using sealed envelopes (block randomization). Patients, treating physicians, radiologist, and nurses were blinded to the patients&#x02019; study group assignment. Statistically analyzed outcomes were assessed after blinding was broken, on the basis of a statistical analysis plan finalised before blinding was broken.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>The use of either tenecteplase or alteplase was specifically allowed in this study. Intravenous thrombolysis was initiated within 4&#x000bd; hours after the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms. Tenecteplase was given as a bolus in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg, maximum dose 40 mg. Alteplase was given in a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus+90% infusion during 1 hour), maximum dose 90 mg. Sonothrombolysis was performed in parallel with intravenous thrombolytic treatment.</p><p>Before sonothrombolysis, a brief transcranial color-coded duplex sonography was performed by an experienced ultrasonographer working independently from the treating physician. Sonothrombolysis was performed with 2 MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler (TCD) (Nicolet, SONARA; Natus Neurology Incorporate) monitoring for 60 minutes, using a hand-held TCD probe for the foraminal window or a probe in a fixation head-band secured at a stable angle for the temporal window. TCD-emitted output power was set at the maximal achievable level with a mechanical index &#x0003c;1.0. Intravenous microbubbles (10 mL SonoVue; BRACCO, Switzerland) were given as an infusion of 0.3 mL/min for &#x02248;30 minutes, using an infusion pump. In patients with a defined occlusion on CTA, ultrasound was applied to the region of the occlusion. In patients without a CTA-defined clot/occlusion, the investigator judged the clinical picture and applied ultrasound to the region in which she/he thought the lesion/clot was located, through either the temporal or foraminal window, as appropriate.</p><p>In patients with occlusion of perforating arteries, the sample volume was set at the depth of the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA)1 segment, that is, at 50 to 55 mm. In distal MCA2 occlusions, the sample volume was set at 30 to 40 mm depth. In anterior cerebral artery/posterior cerebral artery symptoms, the sample volume was set at 60 to 80 mm. A similar algorithm was applied for the foraminal window. For proximal basilar artery, the sample volume was set at 80 mm and at 100 mm for distal basilar artery. The depth setting was chosen for monitoring purposes only because a therapeutic effect is related to the ultrasound field as such.</p><p>In patients without a defined clot on CTA, insonation of the presumed region of interest was performed with continuous slight fanning of the ultrasound beam. Sham sonothrombolysis was performed with the 2 MHz TCD probe plugged into an inactive channel, and sham ultrasound was given for 60 minutes after baseline transcranial color-coded duplex sonography examination. An intravenous infusion of sham intravenous contrast (NaCl 0.9%) 0.3 mL/min for &#x02248;30 minutes was given using an infusion pump. The sound of TCD both in sonothrombolysis and in sham sonothrombolysis was muted, and the visual display was turned away from the patient, treating physicians, and nurses to keep them blinded to the patients&#x02019; study group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary study end points were neurological improvement at 24 hours and functional handicap at 90 days. Main secondary study safety end points included hemorrhagic transformation (hemorrhagic infarct/hematoma), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and death.</p><p>Early (24 hours) clinical outcome and long-term (day 90) functional outcome were assessed in a blinded fashion by a trained stroke nurse or neurologist. Early clinical outcome at 24 hours was defined by NIHSS score as (1) neurological improvement (NIHSS<sub>24</sub>=0 or reduction of &#x02265;4 NIHSS points compared with baseline NIHSS<sub>0</sub>) and as (2) absolute reduction in NIHSS score (NIHSS<sub>24</sub>=NIHSS<sub>0</sub>&#x02212;NIHSS<sub>24</sub>). Long-term outcome at 90 days was defined by mRS score using (1) single mRS group comparison; (2) fixed dichotomy (excellent outcome=mRS score 0&#x02013;1 versus unfavorable outcome=mRS score 2&#x02013;6 and good outcome=mRS score 0&#x02013;2 versus bad outcome=mRS score 3&#x02013;6); (3) sliding dichotomy/responder analysis (excellent outcome=mRS score 0 with baseline NIHSS score &#x02264;7; mRS score 0&#x02013;1 with baseline NIHSS score 8&#x02013;14; and mRS score 0&#x02013;2 with baseline NIHSS score &#x02265;15); and (4) ordinal logistic regression analysis.</p><p>Patients were monitored in the stroke unit with NIHSS scoring at close intervals for 24 to 36 hours. Safety was determined by the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation within 22 to 36 hours of treatment on MRI (or CT when MRI was not possible) by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to all clinical data. ECASS criteria (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study) were used for classification of hemorrhagic transformation.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> sICH was defined as local or remote parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 on the 22 to 36 hours post-treatment imaging scan, combined with a neurological deterioration of &#x02265;4 points on the NIHSS from baseline or from the lowest NIHSS value between baseline and 24 hours, or leading to death (SITS-MOST criteria [Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study]).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Details are published.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A statistical analysis plan was written in co-operation with the Center for Clinical Research, Haukeland University Hospital, before closing the database and analyzing the data set. Our NORSTROKE database showed that patients treated with thrombolysis (n=223) had a 37% improvement of mean NIHSS score from 8.7 to 5.5 (3.2; SD=5.9) from admission to day 7. Also, based on previous meta-analysis of sonothrombolysis clinical studies<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and clinical studies on thrombolysis in mild stroke,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> NOR-SASS aimed at detecting a 15% higher reduction of mean NIHSS among patients receiving CEST versus sham CEST (<italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>=0.37; <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>=&#x02009;0.52; power 0.8) and intended to include 276 patients over 3 to 4 years.

The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to analyze equality of proportions. Continuous data were analyzed by Student <italic>t</italic> test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test as appropriate. The Fisher exact test was used to analyze categorical data with possibly few patients in some cells. The change in NIHSS score between baseline and at 24 hours was tested in a mixed linear regression analyses with repeated measures. The effect of treatment on long-term outcome was tested by ordinal logistic regression with mRS score as the dependent variable and treatment as an independent variable. We tested that our ordinal logistic regression model did not violate the proportional odds assumption.</p><p>The primary analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Additional per-protocol analyses were also performed. The level of significance was set at 0.05, and 2-sided tests were used for all analyses.

Neither bleeding nor death was increased. The safety of CEST was not modified by stroke severity. Our findings, therefore, suggest that CEST using 2 MHz pulse-wave TCD monitoring for 60 minutes is safe in patients with varying grades of clinical severity, with or without a visible occlusion on CTA and thus with large or small thrombi.</p><p>There have been concerns about safety of CEST in acute ischemic stroke patients.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> NOR-SASS does not support this concern. In NOR-SASS, sICH occurred in 3% and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 12% of all patients included. This is comparable to previous CEST studies in patients with MCA occlusion, reporting sICH in 0% to 27% and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 23% to 75% of patients.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Early death caused by sICH was 1% in NOR-SASS, compared with &#x02248;3% in patients treated only with tPA.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A higher number of microbleedings are detected with MRI compared with CT.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Use of MRI as a 22- to 36-hour imaging modality in the NOR-SASS study may, therefore, account for the overall high rate of cerebral bleeding complications even among mild stroke patients.</p><p>NOR-SASS is a neutral study as to clinical effect.

Patients treated may, therefore, have had small clots in arterial branches or disseminated occlusions in the microcirculation or both. Clinical data on the effect of CEST treatment on the cerebral microcirculation are lacking. In vivo and in vitro studies have, however, demonstrated beneficial effects of CEST on occlusion of small vessels down to the capillary level and reperfusion of the microvasculature.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> An in vitro flow model of partially occluded microcirculation demonstrated more rapid and complete clot lysis after CEST.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> A recent in vitro study examined microscale evolution of the erosion front of blood clots exposed to ultrasound stimulated microbubbles.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The development of a complex zonal erosion pattern was observed. The fibrin zone architecture was dependent on exposure conditions forming large-scale tunnels.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> An in vivo study with a reperfusion model in rats showed beneficial effects of CEST on the level of the microvasculature, resulting in complete reversal of flow obstruction, decreased ischemic lesion volume, and decreased edema formation.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Comparing published clinical trials of CEST treatment with NOR-SASS is difficult because of the wide range of treatment protocols, different end points, and limited number of patients. The NOR-SASS population differs substantially from those in previous CEST trials. Previous trials were conducted in selected stroke populations with visible thrombi in major intracranial arteries on CT/CTA, mostly MCA occlusions.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> To our knowledge, NOR-SASS is the first clinical trial that studied the effect and safety of CEST in an unselected stroke population, predominantly with mild stroke without visible thrombi on admission CTA. This group includes 70% to 80% of all acute ischemic stroke patients.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Mild stroke with small thrombi have a higher recanalization rate after intravenous thrombolysis.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It is, therefore, conceivable that also ultrasound may have a better effect on small arterial thrombi and on microcirculation.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> NOR-SASS indicates that CEST may be a therapeutic strategy for patients with persistent hypoperfusion (no reflow phenomenon) of the microvasculature, for which there is currently no direct therapy. We could, however, not show a significant clinical effect of CEST in these patients. The NIHSS score of median 4 to 5 point on admission suggests mild strokes, in which it may be difficult to achieve a positive result because of a ceiling effect. There was a contradictory trend between improvements in NIHSS score at 24 hours in favor of CEST, which was not seen in mRS at 3 months. Reasons for this may be that mRS outcome measures are insensitive to minor neurological improvement at 3 months or even an insufficient effect of CEST. A larger number of patients and more sensitive outcome measures should be applied in future studies with adequate power. NOR-SASS was superimposed in NOR-TEST trial. Using 2 different thrombolytic agents (tenecteplase and alteplase) in well-balanced NOR-SASS randomization (1:1) has not affected the study results as such. After NOR-TEST trial is finished, the NOR-SASS results on CEST with tenecteplase versus alteplase will be published.</p><p>In previous sonothrombolysis study patients with NIHSS &#x02265;10 points has been shown to have a high positive predictive value (&#x0003e;95%) for proximal intracranial occlusion both in the anterior and posterior circulation.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Moreover, in a subgroup analysis of CLOTBUST (Combined Lysis of Thrombus in Brain Ischemia With Transcranial Ultrasound and Systemic tPA), sonothrombolysis seemed to have greater efficacy in terms of 3-month functional outcome in this specific stroke subgroup.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In NOR-SASS, the patients with NIHSS &#x02265;10 points were thus too few to be analyzed and came with some conclusions.</p><p>Strengths of NOR-SASS, albeit with a low number of patients, are it being the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial on CEST in an unselected stroke population, being the biggest CEST study till now, and having well-balanced treatment groups and complete follow-up data at 90 days. Nevertheless, NOR-SASS showed new results in a specific population of acute stroke patients, who have not yet been investigated. The high rate of MRI controls renders data on infarcts and bleedings (symptomatic and asymptomatic) reliable. NOR-SASS, therefore, was performed in a clinically highly relevant setting.</p><p>As expected, the pragmatic decision to include mild strokes and use CT as baseline imaging modality increased the number of stroke mimics and reduced the chance of detecting a significant difference between the treatment groups. Using MRI at admission may decrease the number of stroke mimics but will increase the time to treatment. Also, not every hospital has access to acute MRI. The protocol is, therefore, suitable also for smaller hospitals. A weakness of NOR-SASS is the accidental inclusion of a high number of presumably functional independent patients, who after investigations turned out to have pretreatment mRS &#x02265;3 points and thus had to be excluded from the per-protocol analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that CEST is safe when given within 4&#x000bd; hours after stroke onset to acute ischemic stroke patients with varying grades of clinical severity, with or without a visible occlusion on CTA and thus with larger or smaller thrombi. An overall clinical effect could not be shown in the small number of patients included. NOR-SASS demonstrates, however, the potential of CEST treatment as a pragmatic adjuvant therapy for acute ischemic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank research nurses Linn Elin R&#x000f8;dal, Leila Marie Frid, and Maren Inselseth for their excellent work and dedication and the participating patients in NOR-SASS.
