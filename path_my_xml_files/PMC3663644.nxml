In Australia, the Department of Veterans&#x02019; Affairs (DVA) covers the costs of medical grade footwear for veterans who have severe foot deformity. However, there is a high demand for footwear by veterans with foot pain who do not meet this eligibility criterion. Therefore, this article describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of low cost, off-the-shelf footwear in reducing foot pain in DVA recipients who are currently not eligible for medical grade footwear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred and twenty DVA clients with disabling foot pain residing in Melbourne, Australia, who are not eligible for medical grade footwear will be recruited from the DVA database, and will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or a &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; control group. The intervention group will continue to receive their usual DVA-subsidized podiatry care in addition to being provided with low-cost, supportive footwear (Dr Comfort&#x000ae;, Vasyli Medical, Labrador, Queensland, Australia). The control group will also continue to receive DVA-subsidized podiatry care, but will not be provided with the footwear until the completion of the study. The primary outcome measure will be pain subscale on the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ), measured at baseline and 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures measured at baseline and 16 weeks will include the function subscale of the FHSQ, the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index, the number of DVA podiatry treatments required during the study period, general health-related quality of life (using the Short Form 12&#x000ae; Version 2.0), the number of falls experienced during the follow-up period, the Timed Up and Go test, the presence of hyperkeratotic lesions (corns and calluses), the number of participants using co-interventions to relieve foot pain, and participants&#x02019; perception of overall treatment effect. Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of off-the-shelf footwear in reducing foot pain in DVA recipients.

Studies of older people have demonstrated that foot pain is associated with decreased ability to undertake activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], problems with balance and gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and an increased risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, several clinic-based studies assessing health-related quality of life across a range of age-groups have shown that people with foot disorders (such as generalized foot pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], nail infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], hallux valgus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] hallux rigidus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and plantar heel pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) demonstrate significantly lower scores than those without these conditions. A range of risk factors for foot problems has been identified, including increased age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], female sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these risk factors, there is also strong evidence that many older people wear inappropriate or poor quality footwear, and that ill-fitting footwear may contribute to foot problems. A household survey of people aged over 80 years conducted in the United Kingdom found that most wore slippers all day, irrespective of whether they were housebound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Similarly, a survey of the indoor shoe-wearing habits of 128 older people in Australia indicated that more than half spent less than 30 Australian dollars on their indoor footwear (most commonly slippers), replaced them infrequently, and often wore their indoor shoes for outdoor activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. More recently, a survey of sub-acute aged care hospital patients reported that only 14% wore &#x02018;safe&#x02019; footwear, with the most commonly observed detrimental features being a lack of fastening (86%), slippery soles (86%) and an excessively flexible heel counter (77%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>By far the most commonly encountered problem with footwear in older people is the wearing of shoes that are too small. Burns <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] compared the length and width of the feet and shoes of 65 people aged between 64 and 93 years attending a rehabilitation ward in the United Kingdom, and reported that 72% wore shoes of an incorrect size. Similarly, a study of 440 Veterans&#x02019; Affairs patients in the United States reported that only 26% were found to be wearing appropriately sized shoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and a recent study of 213 people aged 60 to 80 years in Thailand reported that 50% of women and 34% of men wore shoes that were too narrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Several factors may be responsible for this, including fashion influences (particularly in older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]), not measuring foot dimensions when purchasing shoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], or the absence of commercially-available, low-cost footwear that adequately caters for the altered morphology of the elderly foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Irrespective of the underlying cause of poorly-fitting footwear, there is evidence that wearing shoes that are too small is associated with foot problems. In older people, wearing shoes substantially narrower than the foot is associated with corns on the toes, hallux valgus deformity and foot pain, whereas wearing shoes shorter than the foot is associated with lesser toe deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, a survey of 227 older women revealed that 61% reported foot pain when wearing shoes (most commonly in the forefoot and toes), and that those with foot pain exhibited a broader forefoot than those without pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In Australia, the Department of Veterans&#x02019; Affairs (DVA), as part of the Rehabilitation Appliances Program, covers the costs of medical grade footwear for veterans who have severe foot deformity (defined as feet that cannot be accommodated in regular &#x02018;off-the-shelf&#x02019; footwear). Footwear provision is one of the most common podiatry interventions. An analysis of 1996 to 1997 DVA data indicated that out of the total podiatry DVA population who had received a podiatry intervention (n = 4,418), 3,227 (73%) received new medical grade footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, there is also a high demand for footwear by veterans who have foot pain but do not have severely deformed feet. In this context, it is likely that there are a substantial number of veterans who could benefit from the provision of more appropriate footwear. Such an intervention may also reduce the need for frequent, on-going maintenance foot care provided by podiatrists under the DVA scheme.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of relatively low-cost but good quality, custom-fitted footwear to DVA clients with foot pain who do not currently meet the structural deformity criteria for medical grade footwear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has been registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000322831).</p><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The Australian DVA Human Research Ethics Committee provided ethical approval (approval number E012/005[5.1]) and the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee formally accepted this approval (E012/004).

The FHSQ pain domain comprises four questions, with higher scores representing better foot health (that is, 100 = best foot health and 0 = worst foot health). The FHSQ pain domain demonstrates a high degree of content, criterion, and construct validity (Cronbach &#x003b1; = 0.88), high retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86) and has been used as an outcome measure in clinical trials for a range of foot disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Previous research indicates that the minimal important difference for this measure is 12.5 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The FHSQ pain domain will be measured at baseline and at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, with the primary endpoint being the 16 week score.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Secondary outcome measures will be documented at baseline and 16 weeks and will include:</p><p>(i) the function domain of the FHSQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>];</p><p>(ii) the functional limitation, pain intensity and concern about appearance subscales of the MFPDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>];</p><p>(iii) the number of DVA podiatry treatments required during the study period;</p><p>(iv) general health-related quality of life, assessed with the Short Form 12&#x000ae; Version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>];</p><p>(v) the number of falls experienced during the follow-up period;</p><p>(vi) functional mobility, using the Timed Up and Go test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>];</p><p>(vii) presence of hyperkeratotic lesions (corns and calluses);</p><p>(viii) number of participants using co-interventions to relieve foot pain (such as oral non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications, topical medications and visits to other health-care practitioners), documented using a diary at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, and;</p><p>(ix) participants&#x02019; perception of overall treatment effect at week 16, assessed with the question &#x02018;Overall, how has your foot pain changed since the start of the study?&#x02019; with a five-point Likert scale response (&#x02018;marked worsening&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate worsening&#x02019;, &#x02018;same&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate improvement&#x02019;, or &#x02018;marked improvement&#x02019;). For the purpose of analysis, this scale will then be dichotomized, where &#x02018;success&#x02019; is defined as marked or moderate improvement on this scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size for the study has been calculated based on the pain domain of the FHSQ as the primary outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Using a minimal important difference of 12.5 and a standard deviation of 23 obtained from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], and assuming a 10% drop-out rate, the required sample size is 60 per group (power = 80%). We believe that the 10% drop-out rate is reasonable, as our recent randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted podiatry intervention to prevent falls in older people had a drop-out rate of less than 5% over a much longer period of follow-up (12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. The extra precision provided by covariate analysis was conservatively ignored when performing this calculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of adherence</title><p>Adherence to the intervention will be documented at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks by asking participants on how many days (and for how many hours) they have worn their footwear, on average, in the past month.</p></sec><sec><title>Complications and adverse events</title><p>Complications and adverse events associated with the intervention are unlikely. However, the questionnaires at the 4, 8, 12 and 16 week follow-ups will provide participants with an opportunity to report any difficulties they have with the footwear, and all adverse events will be reported in the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp, NY, USA). All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat principle using all randomized participants. Multiple imputation will be used to replace any missing data using five iterations, with age, baseline scores, and group allocation as predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Demographic characteristics and baseline data will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Continuous data will be explored for normality using standard tests to satisfy the assumptions of parametric statistics. If data are found to be not normally distributed, transformation will be attempted using conventional techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. However, if data are still not normally distributed after transformation, non-parametric statistical tests will be used. Continuously-scored primary and secondary outcome measures with a normal distribution will be compared between groups using a linear regression technique with baseline scores, adjusted for by the analysis of covariance model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Nominal and ordinal scaled data will be compared using chi-square analyses (or Fisher's exact test where appropriate) and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests, respectively. Effect sizes will be determined using Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] for continuous data and relative risks for nominal data. Statistical significance for hypothesis tests will be set at the conventional level of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Footwear plays an important role in the maintenance of foot health and mobility in older people, and it has long been recognized that suboptimal footwear can be detrimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. The provision of appropriate footwear, therefore, has considerable potential to reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life in this age-group. Although several studies have been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of footwear interventions in reducing foot pain in people with rheumatoid arthritis and other degenerative foot disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], none have focused on the general veteran community. The study outlined in this protocol is, therefore, novel in that it targets a specific group of veterans (those ineligible for medical grade footwear) and uses generic, off-the-shelf footwear as the intervention.</p><p>Participants will be followed up at four-weekly intervals up to 16 weeks. This is longer than previous footwear intervention studies, which have employed 8 week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] or 12 week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] follow-up periods. We are, therefore, confident that the duration of the study is sufficient to detect differences between the groups, if they exist. Furthermore, previous footwear studies have been limited to single baseline and follow-up assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], whereas our study will incorporate five repeated measurements for the primary outcome measure (baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks). This will provide additional insight into the trajectory of any improvements in participants&#x02019; foot pain. However, to address the issue of multiple testing of serial measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>], we have pre-specified 16 weeks as the primary end-point, and no statistical comparisons of the 4, 8 and 12 week scores will be undertaken.</p><p>Poor adherence is a well-recognized problem with footwear intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>] and has been attributed to the unique role of footwear as both an item of clothing and a health-related intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. We expect that the level of adherence to the off-the-shelf footwear in this study will be higher than that associated with medical grade footwear, due to better cosmesis. Furthermore, the initial postal invitation to take part in the study will specify the type of footwear that will be provided (accompanied by photographs), thereby providing veterans with an opportunity to decline participation on the basis of dissatisfaction with the appearance of the footwear. However, it is still likely that some participants will not be satisfied with the footwear either at the point of issue or during the follow-up period. The inclusion of baseline questionnaires addressing participants&#x02019; immediate perceptions of the attractiveness, comfort and usability of the footwear may provide useful insights into their adherence during the trial.</p><p>There are three key limitations of the study design that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, due to the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to blind participants to their group allocation, nor will it be possible to blind the investigators providing the intervention. Secondly, because the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; control group will receive no additional treatment until the completion of the study, there is a risk of what is often referred to as &#x02018;resentful demoralization&#x02019;. That is, participants allocated to the control group may be resentful of not receiving the intervention, which may affect their adherence to the tasks required of them in the study and systematically influence their responses to the outcome measure questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. While this cannot be completely avoided, it may be offset to some extent by the fact that the control group participants will receive the intervention footwear at the completion of the trial, free of charge - footwear that they would not otherwise be eligible for under the DVA program. One suggested approach to address this issue is to document participant group allocation preference as a prognostic variable and consider this in the statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. However, this would not be appropriate in our study, as it is unlikely that any participants would prefer to wait 16 weeks for their footwear rather than receiving it at the commencement of the study. Finally, this trial has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the findings can be easily translated into &#x02018;real world&#x02019; situations, where off-the-shelf footwear is most often purchased without clinical assessment or diagnosis from foot health professionals. As such, we have not restricted the inclusion criteria in relation to the underlying <italic>cause</italic> of foot pain, so it is possible that our sample will include some participants with conditions that may not be amenable to treatment with footwear.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>In summary, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of off-the-shelf footwear in reducing foot pain in Australian DVA clients ineligible for medical grade footwear. The study findings will be used to make evidence-based recommendations regarding the potential role of this intervention and will help inform the footwear provision component of the Rehabilitation Appliances Program of the DVA. Recruitment of participants commenced in October 2012 and final results are expected to be available in November 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DVA: Department of Veterans&#x02019; Affairs; FHSQ: Foot Health Status Questionnaire; MFPDI: Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HBM and NF conceived the idea and obtained funding for the study.
