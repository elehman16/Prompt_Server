Rehabilitation (COMCOG) to examine the effects of COMCOG on Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019;
memories. [Subjects] Thirty-five patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia
received COMCOG for 30 minutes per day, five days per week for four weeks. [Methods]
Before and after the COMCOG intervention, subjects&#x02019; cognitive functions were evaluated
using the Cognitive Assessment Reference Diagnosis System (CARDS) and Mini-Mental State
Examination-Korea (MMSE-K) test. [Results] According to the results of the evaluation,
among the CARDS scores of the subjects who received COMCOG, the scores of the delayed
10-word list, delayed 10-object list, recognition 10-object, and recent memory
significantly increased while the scores of recognition 10-word significantly decreased
after intervention compared to before intervention. In addition, among the MMSE-K items,
the orientation, registration, and recall showed significant increases. [Conclusion] Based
on these results, delay in the progress of memory deterioration can be expected when
COMCOG is conducted for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients who show declines in cognitive
functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s</kwd><kwd>Computer-Assisted Cognitive Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Memory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the case of Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia, cognitive disorders such as disorders in attention,
start, plans, organization, problem solving ability, reasoning power, calculation ability,
and memory appear before vascular dementia symptoms, such as motor or behavior
disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia
patients&#x02019; characteristics are impairment of the explicit memory necessary to obtain and
maintain new information and decline in memory which inhibits subjects ability to perform
daily living activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive rehabilitation intervention methods for dementia patients generally implemented
at clinics include Computer-Assisted Cognitive Rehabilitation (COMCOG), memory
rehabilitation, cognitive stimulation, and psychological therapy<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, COMCOG is currently used at clinics widely, and
has the advantages of being easily adjusted to individual patients&#x02019; cognitive levels and
accurate results and immediate feedback for judging the performance of patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study that conducted COMCOG for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients, delay in the progress
of cognitive function disorders was identified<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, it was reported that after conducting COMCOG for
Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients for four weeks, the number of errors in task performance
decreased<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies that have
conducted COMCOG for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients and examined its memory improvement
effects have been are in South Korea. The purpose of the present study was to conduct COMCOG
for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019; to examine its effects on memory and to provide basic
data for the effects of COMCOG on Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients at clinics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 35 in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia.
Criteria for selection of subjects for the present study were: a Clinical Dementia Rating
(CDR) in the range of 0.5&#x02013;2, a Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea (MMSE-K) score of 23
points or lower, and no history of neurological disease. Participants who met the inclusion
criteria and agreed to participate in the study received a general explanation of the
procedures, and gave their written informed consent. All procedures were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Cheongju University.</p><p>The tester provided education before the intervention so that the subjects could learn to
use computers and manipulate the mouse by themselves. The COMCOG program consists of items
such as simple recognition memory, simple spatial memory, sequential recall memory, language
recall memory, combined recall memory, language categorization memory, and language
integration memory, and is intended to improve memories. This program was conducted for 30
minutes per day, five times per week for four weeks.</p><p>The Cognitive Assessment Reference Diagnosis System (CARDS) is a cognitive test tool that
includes individual tests consisting of seven memory test items and five non-memory test
items. The five memory test items consist of recognition of 10 words, delayed 10-word list,
recent memory, delayed 10-object list, and recognition of 10 objects. In the present study,
to measure memories, memory-related tests of five items were conducted. The test-retest
reliability and inter-rater reliability were very high at 0.74&#x02013;0.99<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MMSE-K is the Korean version of a standardized cognitive evaluation tool and is a dementia
screening tool used to evaluate elderly persons&#x02019; cognitive disorders and whether they have
dementia. It consists of a total of 12 questions with a maximum possible score of 30 points:
24 points or higher indicates a normal state, 20&#x02013;23 points indicates suspected dementia, and
19 points or lower indicates dementia. The inter-rater reliability of this test tool is very
high at 0.99<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 and the paired t-test was
conducted to test average differences in memories between before and after intervention.
Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thrity-five subjects participated in the present study, 14 males and 21 females. The
subjects&#x02019; ages were distributed as follows: 60&#x02013;69&#x02005;years 5 (14.3%), 70&#x02013;79&#x02005;years 18 (51.4%),
80&#x02013;89&#x02005;years 11 (31.4%), 90&#x02005;years or older 1 (2.9%). The number of subjects with CDR class
0.5 was 7 (20%), with class 1 was 17 (48.6%), and with class 2 was 11 (31.4%). The subjects&#x02019;
dementia duration was 20.94&#x000b1;9.66 months and their average MMSE-K score was 16.63&#x000b1;4.35

of the delayed 10-word list, the delayed 10-object list, recognition of 10 objects, and
recent memory items significantly increased. These results are consistent with the results
of previous studies in which Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019; memories were improved through
COMCOG<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, in the present study, the scores of recognition of 10 words, that is understanding
the meanings of words, significantly decreased after intervention unlike the other items and
it is our assumption that the characteristics of Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia are reflected in this
result. These results are similar to the results of previous studies indicating that in the
results of cognitive rehabilitation intervention, Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019; scores in
the recognition of 10 words item were shown to be lower than those of the general elderly
persons or groups with other kinds of dementia, as Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019; ability to
distinguish between words and to accurately understand the meanings of words is
impaired<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the results of the present study, the scores of the delayed 10-word list item were
increased by the intervention while the scores of the recognition of 10 words decreased. A
likely reason for this is the characteristics of the evaluation. Recognition of 10 words
requires an understanding of the relevant words to re-recognize the words, whereas in the
delayed 10-word list only recall of words that were heard even if the words may not be
properly understood<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies of the characteristics of Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia
patients, it is thought that the effects of COMCOG on Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients&#x02019;
recognition of 10 words ability is lower than those on other kinds of memories.</p><p>In a study conducted by Cipriani et al., it was reported that when COMCOG was conducted to
10 Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients, their MMSE scores significantly increased<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study are similar and among the MMSE-K items, the memory item
showed a significant increase. These results provide evidence that COMCOG is effective at
improving memories of Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia patients. Based on these results, when in the
deterioration of memories can be expected COMCOG is conducted for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia
patients showing declines in cognitive functions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bickel</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Incidence and relative risk of dementia in an urban
