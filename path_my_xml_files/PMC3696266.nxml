On the other hand, when breathing at normal TV the delivered fresh gas flows are sufficient to meet the minute volume requirements with lesser dilution of inspired O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>This study was designed to compare the efficacy of these two techniques of pre-oxygenation in patients with an ineffective face mask seal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in a selected population of 28 ASA status I adults of either sex scheduled for elective major surgery. After obtaining informed consent, patients with anticipated difficult mask ventilation in whom maintaining a satisfactory face mask seal was not possible (presence of beard, nasogastric tube, large nasal bridge, facial anomalies and lack of teeth, but normal airway) were recruited, whereas those with pre-existing respiratory/cardiac diseases, anticipated difficult airway, pregnancy, body weight beyond the 30% range of ideal body weight and uncooperative patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were pre-medicated with oral Tab. Diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, Tab. Famotidine 20 mg, and Tab. Metoclopramide 10 mg the night before and on the morning of the surgery. In addition, intramuscular Morphine 0.15 mg/kg was given half an hour before the surgery. In the operating theatre, baseline electrocardiogram, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded using Datex-Ohmeda S/5 compact anaesthesia monitor (Datex-Ohmeda Inc., 3 Highland Derive, Tewskbury, MA 1876). After performing Allen's test a 20 gauge arterial cannula was secured under local anaesthesia to obtain multiple arterial samples for recording arterial blood gases during the course of the study.</p><p>The study was conducted as a cross over design after taking the institutional ethics committee approval. Written informed consent was taken from all patients recruited for the study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive pre-oxygenation by two techniques. A sealed envelope method was used to decide the order of pre-oxygenation technique. Patients assigned to TV group (Group TV) were instructed to breathe at normal TV for 5 min through a tightly held mask. A 10 min stabilization period was allowed with room air breathing to allow the PaO2 to come back to baseline value before crossing over to Group VC. Similarly, patients belonging to VC group (Group VC) were first instructed to take eight VC breaths, which was preceded by maximal exhalation and then followed by 10 min room air breathing before they crossed over to the TV group. All 28 patients underwent both techniques of pre-oxygenation with 14 of them doing TV breathing first and the other 14 doing VC breathing first [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Pre-oxygenation was carried out with 10 litres of fresh gas flow using the circle system. The circuit was primed with 100% O<sub>2</sub> by occluding the patient end, the adjustable pressure limiting valve fully closed and discharging the oxygen flush thrice thereby allowing the reservoir bag to fill up. The sensor of the spirometer was connected to the mask of the patient and inspired and expired volumes during both techniques were noted.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-57-175-g001"/></fig><p>End tidal oxygen concentration (EtO<sub>2</sub>) was recorded at the patient end of the circuit before and after each technique of pre-oxygenation. Following the 2<sup>nd</sup> technique of pre-oxygenation, rapid sequence induction (RSI) was performed with Sellick's manoeuvre. Anaesthesia was induced with a sleep dose of 2.5% thiopentone and suxamethonium was used to facilitate tracheal intubation. Time of RSI (from the beginning of induction to completion of tracheal intubation) was noted in all 28 patients. Maintenance of anaesthesia was continued with an inhalational agent and 66% nitrous oxide in 33% oxygen through circle system.</p><p>Data were collected and analysed using SPSS statistical software, version 16.

The commonest cause of leak around the mask was the presence of nasogastric tube (35.7%). All the patients had one or more factors that contributed to an ineffective face mask seal and leak as observed by the improper filling of the reservoir bag and a difference between the expired and inspired TVs.

They suggested that VC breathing might have two opposite effects in the presence of a leak. First, the 2 L reservoir bag would partially empty through the leak causing air to enter the circuit if fresh gas flow was insufficient during a VC breath. This would worsen the efficiency of pre-oxygenation with VC breath than with TV breathing. On the other hand, during a VC breath, a large negative pressure was created resulting in a turbulent flow (flow proportional to the square root of the pressure gradient) through the leak than in the rest of the circuit where the flow was laminar (flow proportional to the pressure gradient). The investigators suggested that this &#x0201c;turbulent flow effect&#x0201d; made the leak less important with the VC breath and probably was greater than the empty reservoir effect.</p><p>According to our study, the fresh gas flow of 10 L/min was insufficient to meet the peak inspiratory demand of the patients breathing VC breaths. The mean total ventilation volume in 1 min with eight VC breaths was 9.4&#x000b1;3.3 L/min and was more than 10 L/min in seven patients. On the other hand, the fresh gas flow (50 L/5 min) was more than sufficient when the same patients were breathing at normal TV (mean total ventilation in 5 min 36.7&#x000b1;6.3). Minute ventilation during VC breaths may exceed the fresh gas flow resulting in rebreathing of exhaled gases in addition to room air entrainment in presence of improper mask seal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and fresh gas flow rates of 10 L/min may not be sufficient to achieve optimum pre-oxygenation. Although the anaesthetic circuits can deliver 100% oxygen concentration, the FiO<sub>2</sub> is influenced by the pattern of breathing, the breathing system used, leak around the mask and the fresh gas flow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The bag is an essential component of the circuit because it provides the reservoir necessary when the patient's peak inspiratory flow (30 L/min) exceeds the fresh gas flow. If this reservoir is empty or partially empty, the patient's demand is compensated from leaks present under the face mask seal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>EtO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a measure of pre-oxygenation in the presence of ineffective face mask seal since it is a continuous and non-invasive method. EtO<sub>2</sub> of expired gases cannot reach 100% due to the inevitable presence of moisture, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] An end tidal O<sub>2</sub> of 90-91% indicates maximal pre-oxygenation and a store of O<sub>2</sub> in the functional residual capacity of 2000 ml with a tight fitting face mask.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, EtO<sub>2</sub> values can extend over a wide range from 0.76 to 0.97[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] depending upon the amount of leak. Such that 0.9 EtO<sub>2</sub> can be achieved if the leak is small but lower values are likely to be observed when the leak is large.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Most studies aim for an EtO<sub>2</sub> value of 0.9 as the endpoint of optimal pre-oxygenation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] but there is insufficient data suggesting EtO<sub>2</sub> end point values in presence of the leak due to an improper face mask seal. The authors suggest that EtO<sub>2</sub> can help to gauge the extent of leak and pre-oxygenation should be performed for a longer time if the leak is large. In our study, significantly higher EtO<sub>2</sub> values were recorded with TVs breaths than with VC. Nevertheless, the likelihood of obtaining high EtCO<sub>2</sub> values should be kept in mind if sampling port is placed near to the site of fresh gas entry on the face mask. The ideal site would be placing a nasal cannula at the nostril connected to the sampling line which is not always possible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In our study, the sampling port was placed at the patient end of the circuit.</p><p>PaO<sub>2</sub> values after TV breathing were significantly higher than that with eight VC breaths in 1 min in our group of patients. PaO<sub>2</sub> is proportional to the alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> in the functional residual capacity which is the main oxygen store. Rapid techniques of pre-oxygenation (VC breaths) may result in rapid arterial oxygenation without a significant increase in the tissue oxygen stores and hence result in more rapid haemoglobin desaturation during subsequent apnea than would a longer period of TV pre-oxygenation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Storage of oxygen in the tissue is more difficult to assess but assuming that Henry's law applies and that the partition coefficient for gases approximates the gas water coefficients, breathing 100% oxygen for 3 min or more significantly increases tissue oxygen stores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Deep breathing for a 2 min period is the practical upper limit and if extended beyond 2 min, can lead to hypocapnia causing an increase in oxygen consumption, cerebral vasoconstriction, dizziness and nausea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To conclude, TV breathing for 5 min is a better method of ensuring optimal pre-oxygenation in patients with ineffective face mask seal with fresh gas flow of 10 L/min delivered through a circle system.
