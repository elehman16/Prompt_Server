This strategy is effective at reducing morbidity in those treated but, without massive economic development, it is unlikely it will interrupt transmission. MDA will therefore need to continue indefinitely to maintain benefit. Mathematical models suggest that transmission interruption may be achievable through MDA alone, provided that all age groups are targeted with high coverage. The DeWorm3 Project will test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using biannual MDA targeting all age groups. Study sites (population &#x02265;80,000) have been identified in Benin, Malawi and India. Each site will be divided into 40 clusters, to be randomized 1:1 to three years of twice-annual community-wide MDA or standard-of-care MDA, typically annual school-based deworming. Community-wide MDA will be delivered door-to-door, while standard-of-care MDA will be delivered according to national guidelines. The primary outcome is transmission interruption of the STH species present at each site, defined as weighted cluster-level prevalence &#x02264;2% by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 24 months after the final round of MDA. Secondary outcomes include the endline prevalence of STH, overall and by species, and the endline prevalence of STH among children under five as an indicator of incident infections. Secondary analyses will identify cluster-level factors associated with transmission interruption. Prevalence will be assessed using qPCR of stool samples collected from a random sample of cluster residents at baseline, six months after the final round of MDA and 24 months post-MDA. A smaller number of individuals in each cluster will be followed with annual sampling to monitor trends in prevalence and reinfection throughout the trial.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03014167">NCT03014167</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) affect 1.45 billion people worldwide, and high intensity infections are associated with anemia, undernutrition and impaired cognition, particularly among children.

These parasites infect an estimated 1.45 billion people globally, resulting in the loss of almost 5 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) annually [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. High to moderate intensity STH infections are associated with increased risk of malnutrition, iron-deficiency anemia and other adverse physical and cognitive morbidities, particularly in children. The current World Health Organization (WHO) strategy for controlling STH is based on mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole or mebendazole to pre-school and school-age children (PSAC and SAC), women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women) and adults in certain high-risk occupations such as agricultural laborers or miners, with the goal of eliminating STH-related morbidity [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>While the current strategy of MDA for STH control has proven successful in controlling morbidity, the incidence of reinfection post-treatment is high and targeted MDA is unlikely to break transmission of STH in many settings[<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is in large part due to adult reservoirs of disease [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even if coverage of all targeted populations were optimized, the current STH strategy would likely need to be continued until significant economic development and universal water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) access are able to interrupt transmission[<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a result, there is increased interest in alternative strategies to interrupt STH transmission using broadly administered MDA strategies targeting all age groups [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed are more effective in reducing the prevalence of STH infection[<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

For example, programs targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination have achieved considerable community acceptability and high MDA coverage in many endemic countries. Of the 73 countries endemic for LF in 2014, 18 have discontinued MDA and are in a state of post-MDA surveillance, pending confirmation that LF transmission has been interrupted [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given that LF programs provide five to seven rounds of MDA to entire communities with albendazole (in combination with ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine), there is a unique opportunity to leverage the LF program platform to continue community-wide MDA after programs have proceeded to surveillance and attempt to break the transmission of STH.</p><p>The DeWorm3 Project (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03014167) will conduct a series of community cluster randomized trials in India, Malawi and Benin in order to determine whether continuing community-wide MDA with albendazole following cessation of LF programs can interrupt the transmission of STH (<italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>, <italic>Necator americanus</italic> and <italic>Trichuris trichiura)</italic> in focal geographic areas.

The prevalence threshold and post-treatment interval were selected based on STH transmission models to maximize positive predictive value (PPV), defined here as the proportion of communities below the threshold in which STH prevalence will progress to elimination rather than revert to pre-MDA levels after drug pressure is removed. In mathematical models, the PPV of different transmission thresholds varies by STH species and pre-MDA transmission intensity / starting prevalence, the size of the community, and the post-treatment follow-up interval. An absolute prevalence threshold of 2% at 24 months post-MDA has a PPV of &#x0003e;0.8 for most scenarios explored in the models, meaning that 80% of communities that attain the threshold for each individual STH species are expected to progress to elimination.[<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Mass drug administration</title><p>In the intervention arm, all individuals 24 months of age and older will be eligible for treatment with albendazole in accordance with WHO guidelines, with the exception of women in their first trimester of pregnancy, anyone with a history of adverse reactions to benzimidazoles, and those acutely ill at the time of MDA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006166.t002">Table 2</xref>).

The detectable alternative <italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>0</sub> ranged from 3% to 3.5% (data not shown).</p><p>Power to detect differences in final prevalence between arms given plausible values for <italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>0</sub>, ranging from 7% to 10%, was then estimated using simulations conducted in R (R Center for Statistical Computing, Vienna.

The threshold for transmission interruption was set at 2% prevalence, and a cluster was considered to have interrupted transmission if prevalence could be declared to be below the threshold with 95% confidence, using a one-sided binomial test. Simulations estimated power to detect a difference in the proportion of clusters in which transmission was interrupted by arm.</p><p>Simulations assumed 20 clusters per arm, 500 or 1,000 individuals per cluster (<italic>m</italic>), and a binomial distribution of STH prevalence with a mean of 7% in the targeted arm (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>0</sub>) and <italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>1</sub> in the intervention arm, a range of ICC (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic> = 0.003 or <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> = 0.005), and &#x003b1; = 0.05; 10,000 repetitions were run for each scenario. For a fixed mean endline prevalence of 7% in the targeted arm (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>0</sub>), power to detect a difference in the proportion of clusters in which transmission is interrupted by arm varies by number of individuals sampled per cluster, ICC and endline prevalence in the intervention arm (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>1</sub>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006166.g004">Fig 4</xref>.</p><fig id="pntd.0006166.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0006166.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Power to detect a difference in the proportion of clusters achieving transmission interruption (Primary Objective 2) assuming 7% mean prevalence in the targeted clusters (&#x003c0;<sub>0</sub>), by mean endline prevalence in the intervention clusters (&#x003c0;<sub>1</sub>), intracluster correlation (ICC) and number of people measured per cluster (m), estimated by simulation.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0006166.g004"/></fig><p>These power calculations demonstrate that with 20 clusters per arm, evaluating the STH infection status of 500&#x02013;1,000 people per cluster at endline would provide &#x0003e;80% power for the primary objectives in most scenarios. Thus, a target sample size of 500 individuals at baseline and post-intervention (6 months post-MDA) and 1,000 individuals at endline (24 months post-MDA) was chosen per cluster for the cross-sectional prevalence assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Potential risks and challenges</title><p>A major risk to the DeWorm3 Project is low treatment coverage and/or adherence, particularly if the same individuals are repeatedly missed [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Low coverage could be a result of failure to access sufficient proportions of the population or suboptimal adherence (i.e. participants do not consume the drugs they are given), or be due to high rates of population migration. Migration could further pose risks to the project due to potential importation of infection from outside of the study area. Although not applicable to the sites selected for DeWorm3, a high baseline prevalence of <italic>Trichuris</italic> infection was recognized as a significant risk to an MDA-only strategy for transmission interruption during the planning stages of the study. Owing to the low cure rate of <italic>Trichuris</italic> with albendazole, transmission interruption through MDA in such a setting would be particularly challenging and would likely require use of combination therapy[<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Reduced cure rates due to resistance mutations are also a concern; STH resistance to benzimidazole anthelminthics is commonly detected in animal samples and resistance mutations have been documented in parasites infecting humans [<xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006166.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The emergence of resistance in the context of expanding MDA to the full population could pose a risk to the success of transmission interruption, and will be monitored in samples collected during the study. Other potential challenges include political instability, the presence of transmission hotspots in areas with low coverage, and unprogrammed MDA activities in either trial arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>If the DeWorm3 field trials demonstrate that transmission is successfully interrupted at one or more sites, this will provide evidence of the feasibility of an MDA-based approach to STH elimination. Secondary analyses will identify cluster-level factors associated with successful interruption and will provide evidence of the effect of community-wide MDA on prevalence and infection intensity, reinfection rates and the emergence of benzimidazole resistance. The DeWorm3 field trials will provide stakeholders with information to evaluate the potential to switch from a control to an elimination strategy and to optimize future programs and policies to achieve maximum impact.</p><boxed-text id="pntd.0006166.box001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><p><bold>Editor's Note:</bold> Please note that PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases does not customarily publish standalone protocols; however, we are pleased to present this protocol as a complement to the research articles in the DeWorm3 collection.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Simon Brooker for contributing study materials and experience from the Tumikia project and the DeWorm3 Trial Review Committee and Data Safety and Monitoring Committee members: Richard Hayes, Deirdre Hollingsworth, Larry Moulton, Harriet Mpairwe, Richard Peto, Jambulingam Purushothaman and Jimmy Whitworth for their guidance on the development of this protocol.</p><sec id="sec029"><title>Members of the DeWorm3 Trials Team</title><p>Dilip Abraham<sup>1</sup>, Manfred Accrombessi<sup>2</sup>, Eloic Atindegla<sup>2</sup>, Euripide Avokpaho<sup>2</sup>, Wilfrid Batcho<sup>3</sup>, Sarah Burr<sup>4</sup>, Felicien Chabi<sup>2</sup>, Chikondi Chalera<sup>5</sup>, Alvin Chisambi<sup>5</sup>, Gilles Cottrell<sup>6</sup>, Jasmine Farzana<sup>1</sup>, Doroth&#x000e9;e Kinde-Gazard<sup>8</sup>, John Hart<sup>4</sup>, Parfait Houngbegnon<sup>2</sup>, Lazarus Juziwelo<sup>7</sup>, Saravanakumar Purthupalayam Kaliappan<sup>1</sup>, Zachariah Kamwendo<sup>5</sup>, Chikondi Mamba<sup>7</sup>, Michael Masika<sup>7</sup>, Achille Massougbodji<sup>2</sup>, Stefan Witek-Mcmanus<sup>4</sup>, Ian Owens<sup>9</sup>, Marina Papaiakovou<sup>10</sup>, Nils Pilotte<sup>10</sup>, David Rollinson<sup>11</sup>, James Simwanza<sup>5</sup>, Innocent Togbevi<sup>2</sup>, Firmine Viwami<sup>8</sup>, Steven Williams<sup>10</sup>, James E.
