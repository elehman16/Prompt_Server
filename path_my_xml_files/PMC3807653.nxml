Patients will be randomized immediately after coronary angiography to the FFR-guided group or angiography-guided group. All patients will then undergo FFR measurement in all vessels with a coronary stenosis &#x02265;30% severity including culprit and nonculprit lesions. Fractional flow reserve will be disclosed to guide treatment in the FFR-guided group but not disclosed in the &#x0201c;angiography-guided&#x0201d; group. In the FFR-guided group, an FFR &#x02264;0.80 will be an indication for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery, as appropriate. The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the proportion of patients allocated to medical management only compared with revascularization. Secondary outcomes include the occurrence of cardiac death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction or heart failure, quality of life, and health care costs. The minimum and average follow-up periods for the primary analysis are 6 and 18 months, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our developmental clinical trial will address the feasibility of FFR measurement in NSTEMI and the influence of FFR disclosure on treatment decisions and health and economic outcomes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Background</title><p>Acute non&#x02013;ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the commonest form of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and a leading global cause of premature morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A coronary angiogram is recommended in intermediate- to high-risk NSTEMI patients to detect obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and so identify patients who may benefit from coronary revascularization.<xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1-3</sup></xref> In ACS patients, stress testing before invasive management is not recommended<xref rid="bb0005 bb0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,3</sup></xref>; and so functional information on ischemia is usually not available.

The active phase of the project is intended to last about 30 months.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Ethics</title><p>FAMOUS-NSTEMI has full UK National Research Ethics Service approval (Reference 11/S0703/6).</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Registration</title><p>The trial registration numbers are: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01764334" id="ir0025">NCT01764334</ext-link>; ISRCTN97489534.</p><sec id="s0125"><title>Trial management</title><p>The trial will be conducted in line with Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials.<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Trial management will include a Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee, Clinical Event Committee, and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (<xref rid="s0150" ref-type="sec">online Appendix Supplementary material</xref>).<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0130"><title>Definition of adverse events</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0030"><label>1)</label><p><italic>Major adverse cardiovascular event</italic> is the composite of &#x0201c;cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, unplanned hospitalization for transient ischemic attack or stroke.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>2)</label><p><italic>Major adverse cardiac events</italic> are defined as &#x0201c;cardiac death, or unplanned hospitalization for MI or heart failure.&#x0201d;</p></list-item></list></p><p>Percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG are nonmajor adverse events.<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0040"><label>3)</label><p><italic>Myocardial infarction</italic> is defined according to the criteria specified in the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (including type 4 MI for PCI and type 5 for CABG).<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p></list-item><list-item id="o0045"><label>4)</label><p><italic>Contrast agent&#x02013;induced nephropathy</italic> is defined as either a &#x0003e; 25% increase of serum creatinine or an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL after a radiographic examination using a contrast agent.<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref></p></list-item><list-item id="o0050"><label>5)</label><p><italic>Bleeding</italic> is defined according to the ACUITY criteria<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>: major bleed = intracranial or intraocular bleeding, bleeding at the site of angiography requiring intervention, a hematoma of 5 cm in diameter, a reduction in hemoglobin level of at least 4 g/dL in the absence of overt bleeding or 3 g/dL with a source of bleeding, or transfusion.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s0135"><title>Sources of funding</title><p>The trial is supported by a Project Grant from the British Heart Foundation (PG/11/55/28999) and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government.

However, this design renders the trial susceptible to selection bias, as may have occurred in other trials (eg, COURAGE, BARI2D, FAME, and FAME-2), potentially favoring inclusion of patients with less complex coronary disease. To facilitate inclusion of patients with complex disease (eg, chronic total occlusion, critically narrowed lesions), an FFR of 0.5 can be assigned without requirement to pass the pressure wire. This approach is intended to facilitate the inclusion of all eligible patients. Because FFR group assignment is &#x0201c;open,&#x0201d; by design, we have attempted to minimize treatment bias at the time of the procedure and during follow-up by not disclosing the FFR values in the angiography-guided group. Nondisclosure of FFR in the control group differentiates our study from FAME-2 where FFR values were known in all of the randomized patients.<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0145"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Professor Berry and Professor Oldroyd have acted as consultants for St Jude Medical and received an unrestricted research grant, with these funds paid to their employers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hamm</surname><given-names>C.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bassand</surname><given-names>J.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Agewall</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation: the Task Force for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)</article-title><source>Eur Heart J</source><volume>32</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>2999</fpage><lpage>3054</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21873419</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wijns</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolh</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Danchin</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Task force on myocardial revascularization of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS); European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI)</article-title><source>Eur Heart J</source><volume>31</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>2501</fpage><lpage>2555</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20802248</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="or0005">National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).

Left main stem disease is included and the upper limit for left main stenosis severity is 80%. In order to facilitate the inclusion of patients with complex disease, an FFR of 0.5 can be assigned without requirement to pass the pressure wire in occluded arteries, left main lesions &#x0003e;80% and critical severe epicardial coronary lesions (e.g. &#x0003e;90% severity) in which the cardiologist believes FFR has no diagnostic value. This approach is intended to facilitate and maximize the inclusion of all eligible patients.</p><p>FFR will be measured according to best practice as described in the investigator guideline. The cardiologist should pass the pressure wire across the target coronary stenosis. The pressure wire (Certus, St Jude Medical, Uppsala) is similar to the guidewires that are normally used in PCI except that the wire has a pressure-sensitive sensor 3 cm from its distal tip. The pressure wire will be calibrated initially to ensure standardized measurements and when positioned at the distal end of the guide catheter the pressure wire recording will be equalized with the aortic pressure. The wire is then passed into the coronary artery of interest and advanced at least 6 cm distal to the coronary stenosis using standard techniques. Once the marker is appropriately positioned and after an initial 2 minute rest period, an intravenous infusion of adenosine (140 mcg/kg/min&#x02013;210 mcg/kg/min) via a central vein or large antecubital vein is started to establish coronary hyperemia. Typical changes in blood pressure (i.e. fall in systolic pressure &#x0003e;10%), heart rate (i.e. rise in heart rate &#x0003e;20%) and symptoms will be recorded prospectively to confirm a hemodynamic response to adenosine during a period of at least 2 minutes. When there is an inadequate response with the standard dose of adenosine (140 mcg/kg/min) then the dose can be increased up to 210 mcg/kg/min in order to best ensure maximal hyperemia. If intravenous adenosine is not tolerated then intracoronary adenosine could be administered or FFR will be not be recorded and this will be noted in the Case Report Form. Our protocol has been developed according to previous studies on the hemodynamic response to intravenous adenosine when used for stress testing (<xref rid="s0150" ref-type="sec">online Appendix Supplementary references</xref>).</p><sec id="s0170"><title>Microvascular function</title><p>Coronary microvascular function is clinically-relevant in NSTEMI<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and has prognostic importance.<xref rid="bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> Pressure wire-derived parameters of microcirculatory function can be easily obtained using thermodilution techniques around the same time as the FFR measurements.

At this time, the protocol also requires prospective confirmation that in the 'angiography-guided control group', the clinical team were blinded to the pressure wire recordings and FFR values throughout. The investigator is also required to confirm that the protocol was preserved.

Day to day study activity will be coordinated by the TMG, which will be responsible to the TSC. The TSC will be responsible for overall trial supervision. In order to adjudicate and validate adverse clinical events, source clinical data will be reviewed by an independent CEC comprised of at least 3 cardiologists.

This difference is based on observations made in a pilot study<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> performed to inform the design of the current trial.

Potentially 25% of screened patients may be ineligible (e.g. unsuitable for PCI or CABG). Some patients may not wish to take part (~25%) and following initial angiography a further 25% may be ineligible based on coronary anatomy and disease resulting in 350 randomized patients. We anticipate the rate of major adverse cardiac events in the control group will be ~20% during ~1.5 years mean follow-up (or at least 35 events in 175 patients) such that the relationship between FFR and cardiac outcome in NSTEMI can be evaluated. The Glasgow Clinical Trials Unit (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics) will act as an independent coordinating center for data management and will conduct the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s0195"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome of the between group difference in the proportions of patients allocated to medical therapy will be assessed using Fisher's Exact test and the differences in proportions estimated with a 95% confidence interval. The rate of discordance between FFR and coronary stenosis severity assessments will be estimated over all patients and segments and a 95% confidence intervals calculated taking into account the within subject clustering. Additional modelling will be carried out to investigate evidence of heterogeneity in the rates of discordance across segments. Rates of major coronary events at 6 months, 12 months and 3 years will be analyzed using logistic regression analysis. In addition Kaplan-Meier time to event curves will be calculated to describe the time course of events in each group. Rates of the feasibility of FFR assessment and adverse events rates will be summarized.</p></sec><sec id="s0200"><title>Health economics</title><p>A decision model will be constructed to reflect the treatment of NSTEMI patients and the effects of the two diagnostic options (FFR or the visual interpretation of the angiogram alone).<xref rid="bb0140 bb0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28,29</sup></xref> The model will be made probabilistic so as to characterise the uncertainty surrounding parameter estimates and ultimately reflect uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimate. The decision model can then be run to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using FFR measurements to guide clinical treatment decisions compared to the use of angiography results alone in the current trial. The health economic model in this developmental study will also inform the design of a future multicenter clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0205"><title>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study</title><p>Since FFR is not validated in patients with unstable coronary disease, we set up an MRI sub-study at the lead site to determine the level of agreement between inducible ischemia as revealed by stress MRI (a non-invasive gold standard) and FFR.

Clinicians will be blinded to the MRI results which will not influence catheter laboratory treatment decisions. The sub-study has ethics approval and all patients will give written informed consent.</p></sec></sec><ack id="ac0005"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to the patients who participated in this study.</p><p>We also thank our clinical research staff including Anna O'Donnell, Joanne Kelly, Jim Young, Zoe Nicholas, Hazel Forsyth, Fran Bamforth, Wendy Goddard, Samantha Jones, Matthew Lee, Ahmed Mahrous, Elizabeth Boyd, Nadeem Ahmed, David Corcoran, Teng Yue May Vannesa and Andrew Beck and all of the staff in the cardiac catheterization laboratories and cardiology wards in our hospitals.</p><p>We thank Alex McConnachie, biostatistician, Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow.</p><p>Clinical Event Committee: Andrew Hannah (Chair), Andrew Stewart, Malcolm Metcalfe (all Department of Cardiology, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, UK).</p><p>Trial Steering Committee: Robert Henderson (Chair), Kanrath Balachandran, Geoff Berg, Colin Berry (Principal Investigator), Gordon Baird (Patient Advocate), Arvind Sood, Nick Curzen, Raj Das, Ian Ford, Jamie Layland, Shahid Junejo, Keith Oldroyd.</p><p>Data and Safety Monitoring Committee: John Norrie, University of Aberdeen, UK (Chair); Saqib Chowdhary, University Hospital of South Manchester, UK; Andrew Clark, University of Hull, UK.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="d32e103"><label>&#x02606;</label><p>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivative Works License, which permits non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited</p></fn><fn id="d32e108"><p>RCT# 01764334</p></fn></fn-group></back><floats-group><fig id="f0005"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="f0010"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Gantt chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><label>Table</label><caption><p>FAMOUS NSTEMI study design</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Inclusion criteria</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Medically stabilized NSTEMI with an elevated troponin (&#x0003e;upper limit of normal for local reference range) with &#x02265;1 risk factor for CAD (eg, diabetes, age &#x0003e;65 y, prior CAD, prior peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x02265;1 noncritical coronary stenosis &#x02265;30% severity with normal coronary blood flow (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade III) in which FFR measurement might have diagnostic value</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Invasive management within 72 h of hospital admission or a history of recurrent ischemic symptoms within 5 d</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Exclusion criteria</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Ongoing ischemic symptoms not controlled by medical therapy</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Angiographic exclusion: highly tortuous or calcified arteries, left main stenosis &#x0003e;80% (ie, consistent with severe left main disease)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Life expectancy of &#x0003c;1 y</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;MI with persistent ST elevation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Intolerance to antiplatelet drugs</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Unsuitable for either PCI or CABG on clinical or angiographic grounds</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;CAD &#x0003c;30% reference vessel diameter</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Noncoronary cardiac surgery (eg, an indication for concomitant valve repair or replacement)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Inability to give informed consent</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Age &#x0003c;18 y (no upper age limit)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
