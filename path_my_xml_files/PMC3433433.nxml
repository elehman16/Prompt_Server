Here we investigated if a single bout of exercise can improve motor memory and motor skill learning. We also explored if the timing of the exercise bout in relation to the timing of practice has any impact on the acquisition and retention of a motor skill. Forty-eight young subjects were randomly allocated into three groups, which practiced a visuomotor accuracy-tracking task either before or after a bout of intense cycling or after rest. Motor skill acquisition was assessed during practice and retention was measured 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Differences among groups in the rate of motor skill acquisition were not significant. In contrast, both exercise groups showed a significantly better retention of the motor skill 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Furthermore, compared to the subjects that exercised before practice, the subjects that exercised after practice showed a better retention of the motor skill 7 days after practice. These findings indicate that one bout of intense exercise performed immediately before or after practicing a motor task is sufficient to improve the long-term retention of a motor skill. The positive effects of acute exercise on motor memory are maximized when exercise is performed immediately after practice, during the early stages of memory consolidation. Thus, the timing of exercise in relation to practice is possibly an important factor regulating the effects of acute exercise on long-term motor memory.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the Ludvig and Sara Elsass Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elsassfonden.dk">www.elsassfonden.dk</ext-link>).

Regular aerobic exercise, in particular, produces moderate yet robust improvements in the performance of some cognitive tasks, especially in those involving attention, processing speed and executive functioning <xref rid="pone.0044594-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Along with these behavioural improvements, aerobic exercise has also been shown to promote both functional and structural adaptations in the human brain <xref rid="pone.0044594-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Examples of these adaptations include increases in brain activation <xref rid="pone.0044594-Colcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, blood flow <xref rid="pone.0044594-Pereira1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, connectivity <xref rid="pone.0044594-Voss1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> as well as brain volume in areas such as the hippocampus <xref rid="pone.0044594-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and frontal and parietal cortices <xref rid="pone.0044594-Colcombe2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Physical activity programs including aerobic exercise may also confer neuroprotective effects, thereby reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline <xref rid="pone.0044594-Karp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and the progression of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lautenschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and Parkinson's disease <xref rid="pone.0044594-Ahlskog1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Sasco1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> as well as accelerating recovery after stroke <xref rid="pone.0044594-Globas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Ahlskog2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, there is mounting evidence that regular physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, is an effective yet inexpensive strategy to maintain a healthy cognitive status, improve recovery after brain injury and reduce the incidence of some age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Rather than focusing on the long-term effects of periodic bouts of aerobic exercise, other studies have explored the immediate effects that a single bout of exercise may have on cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0044594-Audiffren1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044594-Pontifex1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The rationale behind the use of acute exercise is usually founded upon psychological and biological grounds. Psychological theories postulate that an adequate level of exercise-induced arousal <xref rid="pone.0044594-Yerkes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> may optimize the allocation of mental resources and thus facilitate cognitive processing <xref rid="pone.0044594-Audiffren2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and consolidation of memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-McGaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. More biological perspectives <xref rid="pone.0044594-Cotman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, in contrast, attribute the benefits of acute exercise on cognition to an increased concentration of neurochemicals such as epinephrine <xref rid="pone.0044594-Cahill1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <xref rid="pone.0044594-GomezPinilla1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> during exercise, which facilitate memory consolidation and learning. The results of studies analyzing the immediate effects of exercise on cognition, however, are equivocal, with some studies reporting moderate effects while others showing no, or even detrimental effects <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Etnier1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Conflicting results might be explained from differences in the characteristics of exercise, when the cognitive task was performed in relation to exercise, when performance was measured, types of subjects studied and the type of cognitive function assessed <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Brisswalter1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Tomporowski1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>The majority of studies assessing the immediate effects of exercise on brain function have focused on low-level processing cognitive functions measured through neuropsychological tasks such as simple and choice reaction time <xref rid="pone.0044594-Audiffren1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Audiffren2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> involving discrete movements (e.g. finger tapping). In contrast, much less attention has been placed on other tasks involving complex movements, requiring high-level executive functions, which demand the integration of information from different brain areas. For example, only a small number of studies have investigated the acute effects of exercise on specific forms of memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-Pontifex1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044594-Tomporowski2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and learning <xref rid="pone.0044594-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and none of them specifically the effects on motor memory consolidation and motor skill learning. Furthermore, with few exceptions <xref rid="pone.0044594-Coles1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Labban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the majority of cognitive studies have focused on improvements in performance during practice (i.e. acquisition) or shortly after (e.g. short-term retention) <xref rid="pone.0044594-Pontifex1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044594-Tomporowski2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> rather than on the long-term effects of acute exercise on memory (i.e. long-term retention), which is perhaps a more representative measure of memory consolidation and learning <xref rid="pone.0044594-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is therefore uncertain if the potential benefits that acute exercise may have on some types of learning modalities can be extrapolated to other, more complex tasks involving other learning paradigms such as motor skill learning and whether these benefits can optimize the formation and long-term retention of motor memory.</p><p>Motor skill learning is of vital importance during different periods of the lifespan. In addition to childhood development, it is of particular importance during rehabilitation, when strategies to optimize the acquisition and retention of motor skills become critical to stimulate the recovery of motor function. We examined whether acute exercise can be used as a strategy to optimize motor skill learning in healthy young subjects. Specifically, we investigated whether an intense bout of cycling exercise could optimize the acquisition and retention of a motor skill. In addition, we explored if the timing of the exercise in relation to the practice of the motor task had any influence on motor memory and skill learning. This was assessed by comparing the acquisition and retention of a motor skill when the bout of exercise was performed either before (PRE) or after (POST) practicing a visuomotor accuracy-tracking task (AT) or after rest (CON). Motor skill acquisition was assessed during practice and retention was measured 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after practice.</p><p>We hypothesized that the performance of a single bout of exercise before motor practice (PRE) would improve the acquisition of the motor skill and that exercise after practice (POST) would mainly optimize its retention <xref rid="pone.0044594-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our results, however, revealed that acute exercise did not have any significant effect on the rate of skill acquisition. In contrast, regardless of the timing of exercise, participants engaging in acute exercise showed an overall better long-term retention of the motor skill in comparison to the non-exercise group (CON). In addition, the group that exercised after practicing the AT (POST) showed a better long-term retention of the motor skill than the group that practiced the AT after exercise (PRE).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The ethics committee for the Greater Copenhagen area approved the study and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation.

After practice, subjects in the CON and PRE groups were placed in a hospital bed where they rested for 1 hour. To ensure that all groups had the same resting time (1 hour) between the end of practice and the first retention test the POST group rested 40 min after exercise. To minimize changes in arousal and interferences in the consolidation of memory during the resting period, subjects were not allowed to listen to music nor sleep but were allowed to read. Improvements in performance during practice measured the rate of motor skill acquisition. To evaluate the impact of exercise on the short-term retention of the motor skill, a retention test of the AT was performed after the resting period (1 hour).

Briefly, the isometric torque applied to the handle was displayed as a cursor on the computer screen located in front of the subject. The cursor moved automatically across the screen from left to right at a constant velocity and subjects applied wrist flexion and extension muscle isometric contractions to move the cursor downward and upward respectively to track the double sine wave curve displayed on the screen. The second window provided visual feedback on the performance of the AT by displaying a series of white dots in a coordinate axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044594-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Each dot represented the cumulative error (distance) in a single frame between the trace of the subject and the target. The lower the position of the dot on the y-axis, the lower the error between the double sine wave curve and their trace and thus the better the performance.</p><p>Practice of the AT during motor skill acquisition (blocks 1&#x02013;3) consisted of 3&#x000d7;5 min blocks with 1 min of rest between blocks. The retention tests (blocks 4&#x02013;6), performed 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after practice, consisted of 1 block of 5 min of practice each. In all trials, the sine wave curve was displayed in frames of 6 sec with 1 sec between frames in which the visual feedback (i.e. white dot) was provided. Performance was measured as the average root mean square value of the error distance between the subject's torque signal and the displayed target across all sampled data points in each frame. Subjects performed 42 frames every 5 min of practice (252 frames in total) in addition to the 10 trials performed at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Assumptions of normality of the distribution for all variables were explored through histograms and normality plots and confirmed with the Shapiro-Wilk's normality test. Differences in exercise parameters (blood lactate concentration and perceived exertion) between exercise groups (PRE and POST) were compared with a student's t test. Performance among groups at baseline was compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences in the acquisition and retention of the motor skill were analysed with two ANOVA. First, acquisition (blocks 1&#x02013;3) was compared with two-way (block x group) repeated-measures ANOVA. Retention blocks (1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days) were compared with two-way (block x group) repeated-measures ANOVA. To analyze motor skill retention while factorizing for between-groups differences in skill level at the end of practice, performance of retention blocks was normalized to mean performance in the last block of practice (block 3). When the variances of the differences among different blocks (i.e. sphericity) were significantly different, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. When a significant main effect in the ANOVA was found, post-hoc pairwise comparisons for each block were performed with the student's t test. The level of statistical significance in the post-hoc comparisons was adjusted to a p&#x02264;0.017 using the Bonferroni's procedure (0.05/3). The effect size (<italic>d</italic>) for each retention test was calculated by dividing the difference between mean change scores of the experimental (PRE and POST) and control (CON) groups by the pooled standard deviation (SD). Unless otherwise stated, data were presented as means with standard error of the mean (SEM) and analyses performed with two-tailed probability tests with a statistical significance set at p&#x0003c;0.05. The reported p values are not adjusted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The workload during the blocks of high intensity cycling exercise in both exercise groups ranged from 200W-315W.

Second, is the timing of exercise in relation to the practice of the motor task important to modulate the effects of acute exercise on motor memory and skill learning? With regards to the first question, our results suggest that a single bout of exercise does not have any significant effect on either the rate of acquisition nor the short-term retention of the motor skill assessed 1 hour after practice. In contrast, this type of exercise appears to improve motor learning through an optimization of motor memory. This was confirmed by the fact that both exercise groups showed a better retention of the motor skill than the control group, especially when retention was assessed 24 hours and 7 days after practice. With regards to the second question, we found timing of exercise not to be relevant when retention was assessed 1 hour and 24 hours after practice. However, timing of exercise appeared to be critical in modulating the effects of exercise on the long-term retention of motor memory. This was confirmed by the fact that, compared to the group that exercised before practice (PRE), the group that exercised after practice (POST) showed a better retention of the motor skill 7 days after practice. It is important to reiterate that the groups of the study were matched for age, gender and fitness level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044594-t001">Table 1</xref>) and that there were not significant differences in motor skill level at baseline. Since both exercise groups showed very similar levels of blood lactate and level of perceived exertion after exercise it is also conceivable that the intensity of exercise was very similar. It is therefore unlikely that these results could be confounded by differences in the characteristics of the subjects or the exercise protocol.</p><p>The first important finding of the present study concerns the null impact that acute exercise appeared to have on the acquisition of the motor skill in the group that exercised before practicing the AT (PRE). On the basis of previous data revealing enhanced performance in some cognitive tasks following acute exercise <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> we speculated that the bout of exercise might also enhance the rate of motor skill acquisition during practice. Winter et al. <xref rid="pone.0044594-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, for example, reported that the acquisition of novel words during an associative vocabulary-learning task was accelerated by 20% after 2&#x000d7;3 min of intense (&#x0003e;10 mmol/l lactate) treadmill running. In contrast, in our study, all groups showed similar improvements in motor skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044594-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The positive influence of acute exercise on cognition is often manifested as facilitation during practice. However, gains in performance are highly selective to the type of cognitive task and the characteristics of the exercise protocol <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our results indicate that the potential effects of acute exercise on the identification and encoding of procedural information during practice of the AT did not translate into immediate observable gains in motor skill acquisition. Perhaps the performance of an intense bout of exercise prior to a motor task that focused heavily on accuracy diluted the benefits of acute exercise on motor skill acquisition. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that even exercise at moderate intensity may have detrimental effects on accuracy performance <xref rid="pone.0044594-McMorris1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It is not unlikely, for example, that while exercise had indeed optimized the rate of acquisition of the motor skill, the effects of underlying fatigue could have masked improvements in tracking accuracy during practice of the AT <xref rid="pone.0044594-Eysenck1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The coexistence of facilitative and hindering mechanisms during practice might well explain why intense exercise did not enhance nor impair motor skill acquisition.</p><p>In contrast to the null effects on acquisition, acute exercise optimized motor skill learning through an enhanced long-term retention of motor memory, as manifested in a better performance of both exercise groups in the retention of the motor skill 24 hours and 7 days after practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044594-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This finding is important because delayed retention is a better indicator of learning than performance at or shortly after acquisition <xref rid="pone.0044594-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although some investigations have revealed no significant <xref rid="pone.0044594-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Sjoberg1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Tomporowski3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or even detrimental effects on memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-Cian1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, pooled together <xref rid="pone.0044594-Lambourne2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the results of studies exploring how acute exercise modulates memory yield a positive, yet moderate, mean effect (<italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.30; 95% CI &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06,0.55) in cognitive tasks involving components of both short <xref rid="pone.0044594-Pontifex1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Coles1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Sibley1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Tomporowski2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Potter1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and long-term memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-Coles1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Labban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044594-Potter1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These studies, however, have targeted cognitive tasks mainly requiring explicit forms of memory such as verbal memory (e.g. recall a series of words). This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating the impact of acute exercise on motor memory and skill learning. Our findings add new evidence indicating that the benefits of this intervention on memory consolidation might generalize to other, more implicit, forms of memory and learning such as motor memory and skill learning. More studies will be required to determine if these promising results can be extrapolated to other motor skills and population groups.</p><p>It is unclear why, in contrast to the positive effects on long-term retention, acute exercise did not translate into a significantly better retention of the motor skill in the first retention test performed 1 hour after practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044594-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). One plausible explanation is that the proximity of the retention test to the intense exercise bout could have hindered the relatively short-term recall of the motor memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-Coles1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. There is some evidence that high arousal levels at encoding may temporarily increase inhibition of retrieval during memory consolidation <xref rid="pone.0044594-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, which would have detrimental effects on short-term recall (45). Another possibility is that the representation of the motor memory was still undergoing consolidation when the first retention test was performed and thus the benefits of acute exercise on memory had not yet taken place. Inconsistencies between immediate and delayed retention tests are not unusual in motor skill learning studies. Recently, Kantak et al. <xref rid="pone.0044594-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> reviewed 41 motor skill learning studies that employed both immediate and delayed retention/transfer tests and found that 19 studies showed significant differences between groups only in the delayed retention tests <xref rid="pone.0044594-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These discrepancies possibly reflect different stages of the maturation of the motor memory when retention is assessed <xref rid="pone.0044594-Shadmehr1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In our study, the apparent null effect of acute exercise on acquisition in addition to the optimization of the retention of the motor skill in the exercise groups reaffirm the importance of distinguishing learning from eventual improvements during or shortly after practice and emphasize the relevance of using delayed retention tests as a more reflective measure of motor skill learning <xref rid="pone.0044594-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking finding of the present study was the notable difference between exercise groups in the long-term retention of motor memory, as shown in the retention test performed 7 days after practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044594-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These differences in the retention of the motor skill suggest that the timing of exercise in relation to motor practice is indeed an important factor regulating the effects of acute exercise on motor memory. We speculate that these differences could be due to the specific effects that acute exercise performed at different stages of the formation of memory has on the retention of the motor skill. Regardless of the time when it is performed, acute exercise appears to enhance motor memory. However, exercise performed before practice possibly does so by mainly optimizing the detection and encoding of procedural information during motor practice while exercise after practice improves exclusively its consolidation into long-lasting memory. In order to test this possibility, it had been interesting to investigate if the performance of two bouts of exercise, one before and a second after practice of the AT, would have led to an even better retention of the motor skill. More experimental studies are required to determine the specific temporal patterns regulating the effects of acute exercise on the formation of motor memory and to test the hypothesis that the enhancement of motor memory is produced by different mechanisms depending on the timing of exercise.</p><p>In our study, the bout of exercise performed after practice optimized the long-term retention of the motor skill more so than when exercise was performed before practice. This result conflicts with a recent study which assessed the effects of acute exercise performed at different time points on verbal memory <xref rid="pone.0044594-Labban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this study <xref rid="pone.0044594-Labban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> the authors investigated the effects of 30 min of moderate aerobic exercise performed either before of after listening to two paragraphs (exposure) on the recall performance of these two paragraphs assessed 35 min after exposure. In comparison to a non-exercise control group, the group that exercised prior to exposure showed a significantly greater recall of words during retention although differences between exercise groups were not statistically significant. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between these results and our results might be in the differences in the characteristics of the task as well as the exercise protocol. It should be noted, however, that in the aforementioned study <xref rid="pone.0044594-Labban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> the group that performed the exercise bout after exposure had to perform the retention test immediately after exercise. Thus, it is not unlikely that the proximity of the retention test to the exercise bout could have disproportionally increased neural noise thus impairing the recall of words at retention <xref rid="pone.0044594-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Unfortunately, the authors did not include further delayed retention tests, which could have been useful to assess verbal memory excluding the potential confounding effects of exercise on recall.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single bout of intense exercise performed immediately before or after practicing a motor task was sufficient to improve motor skill learning through a better long-term retention of the skill. The positive effects of acute exercise on motor memory appeared to be maximized when exercise was performed after practice, during the early stages of memory consolidation. The effects of acute exercise on the optimization of the storage and retrieval of motor memory may have important practical implications. Our results suggest that this intervention can be used to boost motor skill learning through an optimization of the consolidation of motor memory, which has significant perspectives in both sports and rehabilitation. More studies are needed to investigate the exact mechanisms by which acute exercise optimizes motor memory consolidation. Only then, we will be able to be accurate in the prescription of personalized exercise interventions to optimize the acquisition and retention of motor skills.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0044594-Hillman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
