The trial was conducted in the peri-urban area of Ibrahim Hyderi in Karachi, Pakistan. Both groups received three doses of RV1 at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Seroconversion (anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies &#x02265;20 U/mL in subjects seronegative at 6 weeks of age) following three vaccine doses (6, 10 and 14 weeks) was determined at 18 weeks of age (primary objective) and seroconversion following two doses (6 and 10 weeks) was determined at 14 weeks of age (secondary objective).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Four hundred eligible infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the withholding breastfeeding and immediate breastfeeding arms. Overall, 353 (88.3%) infants completed the study according to protocol; 181 in the withholding breastfeeding group and 172 in the immediate breastfeeding group. After three RV1 doses, anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion was 28.2% (95% CI: 22.1; 35.1) in the withholding arm and 37.8% (95% CI: 30.9; 45.2) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -9.6% [95% CI: -19.2; 0.2] p=0.07). After two doses of RV1, seroconversion was 16.6% (95% CI: 11.9; 22.7) in the withholding arm and 29.1% (95% CI: 22.8, 36.3) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -12.5% [95% CI: -21.2,-3.8] p=0.005).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Withholding breastfeeding around the time of RV1 vaccine administration did not lead to increased anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion compared with that seen with a breastfeed at the time of vaccination. On the contrary, IgA seroconversion in infants immediately breastfed tended to be higher than in those withheld from a feeding. Our findings suggest that breastfeeding should be continued adlib around the time of rotavirus vaccination and withholding breastfeeding at that time is unlikely to improve the vaccine immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01199874">NCT01199874</ext-link>

Two oral rotavirus vaccines, 2-dose Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) (RV1) and 3-dose RotaTeq (Merck and Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) (RV5) are in use in in many countries. While highly efficacious (~85%) against severe rotavirus disease in industrialized countries, these vaccines show substantially lower immunogenicity and efficacy (~51%-66%) against severe rotavirus in lower income countries where most deaths from rotavirus occur [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127622.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Factors that could explain this difference in vaccine performance are increasingly becoming the focus of attention, given the potential for significant impact by even modestly improving the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries.</p><p>Breastfeeding has been postulated as one possible factor that might impair rotavirus vaccine performance [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Breast milk contains both secretory anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies as well as innate immune factors such as lactoferrin, lactoadherin, mucin and butyrophilin which are inhibitors of rotavirus replication [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study in which breast milk from Bangladeshi mothers was mixed with an equal volume of live serotype 1 rotavirus Wa strain, about 30% and 60% of breast milk samples neutralized 99% and 90% of the virus, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies by Moon <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that the titers of neutralizing activity (NA) against three rotavirus vaccine strains, RV1, RV5 G1 and 116E were higher in the breast milk of mothers in India compared with mothers in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127622.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This regional variation in NA could contribute to the difference in immunogenicity of RV vaccine in developed and developing countries if indeed infants are receiving vaccine at the time that breast milk is also present in sufficient quantity to reduce the effective inoculum.</p><p>If the high levels of NA and other factors in breast milk reduce the immunogenicity of the vaccine when breast milk is provided at the same time as RV vaccine, withholding breastfeeding for some time before and after vaccine administration could increase vaccine immunogenicity. While withholding a feed may be difficult to implement programmatically, it is important to understand if breast milk is an important factor contributing to the reduced performance of current live oral rotavirus vaccines in developing countries so that programmatic methods and/or new vaccines may be designed to overcome the effect. We therefore conducted a randomized trial in Pakistan (where virtually all mothers breastfeed their young infants), to compare the immunogenicity of RV1 in infants whose breastfeeding was withheld one hour before through one hour after vaccination with each RV1 dose withthat in infants who were breastfed at the time of vaccination. We also evaluated the effect of rotavirus neutralizing activity in breast milk on the immunogenicity of RV1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted in the peri-urban area of Ibrahim Hyderi in Karachi, Pakistan, where the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of Aga Khan University has conducted demographic surveillance, including pregnancy and newborn surveillance, since 2008. It is a low-income community of predominantly fishermen. Neonatal and under 5 year mortality in this population were 40.7 and 78.7 per 1000 live births in 2012, respectively.</p><p>Study recruitment was done from 11 April 2011 to 25 Jun 2012. Parents were informed of the study when their infants were four weeks of age, and if interested, written informed consent was obtained and their children enrolled at six weeks of age. Only infants whose mothers intended to breastfeed their babies for at least 18 weeks were included in the trial. Infants were excluded if they had a birth weight less than 1500 grams, received rotavirus vaccine outside of the study, had received any immunoglobulin or blood products since birth, were on immunosuppressive drugs, or had used any investigational drug or vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study vaccine. Final follow up of the last participant was completed on 24 Sep 2012. The trial was approved by the institutional review boards of Aga Khan University, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA, USA). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with good clinical practice guidelines; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT01199874.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>This randomized trial of 400 children included two intervention arms with treatment allocation of 1:1. Infants were randomized to one of two groups, according to computer-generated randomization codes provided in sequentially numbered and assigned envelopes. The study was partially blinded for logistical reasons; both participants and investigators were aware of the group assignment but the laboratory scientists testing for rotavirus antibodies were not.</p></sec><sec id="sec010" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Both study groups received three doses of the lyophilized formulation of RV1 at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. The regimen allowed for the assessment of the impact of breastfeeding in both the conventional two dose schedule as well as the three dose regimen which was being studied in a parallel trial [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mothers randomized to the withholding breastfeeding arm were instructed to withhold breastfeeding for one hour before and after each RV1 dose at the study clinic; mothers were allowed to breastfeed the infant in the clinic, if they desired, before the monitored withholding period began. At the end of the withholding period (one hour after RV1 receipt), mothers often left the clinic before resuming feeding so the exact duration of withholding beyond the second hour was not consistently available. In the immediate breastfeeding group, mothers were asked to breastfeed their baby for at least 20 minutes at the study clinic, and the child was administered RV1 as soon as possible after the completion of breastfeeding (maximum, 10 minutes after). The vaccination visits for the two arms occurred on different days of the week to ensure the appropriate feeding for each infant. The timing and minimum duration of the withholding time or breastfeeding and the timing of the RV1 dose were monitored closely and the success and timing of each step was documented by a study nurse. At each vaccine visit, breast milk samples were expressed by both groups of mothers before the dose was administered. RV1 was provided along with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) and pentavalent vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis, hepatitis B and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b), unless either had been administered earlier at another facility. Vaccinations were postponed if the child was suffering from fever &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C, had vomited during each of the last three feedings or met WHO criteria for some or severe dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Neutralizing antibodies, presumed to be maternally derived (MDNA), were measured in the infants' serum collected at 6 weeks using a neutralization assay against rotavirus strain 89&#x02013;12, the precursor to the RV1 vaccine strain, following methods previously described and expressed as the titer of the serum which represents 60% neutralization of the virus [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Anti-rotavirus IgA was measured in breast milk samples collected at 6, 10 and 14 weeks using an ELISA previously described and expressed as titers [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rotavirus neutralizing activity in breast milk (BMNA) was assessed in the sample collected at 10 weeks using a neutralization assay against the vaccine strain (RV1), following methods previously described [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Neutralizing titer in breast milk was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that showed greater than 70% reduction in the absorbance value compared with that in the virus-only control. The IgA and neutralizing assays used for the serum specimens were different from those used for the breastmilk specimens and hence titers cannot be directly compared.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Safety Assessment</title><p>All infants were observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccine administration and parents were asked to seek care at the study clinic for any illnesses in participants during the study period. All serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported to an independent safety monitor who characterized possible relationship to study product.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Seroconversion was defined as a serum concentration of anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies &#x02265;20 U/mL in subjects who were seronegative (IgA &#x0003c;20 U/mL) at 6 weeks of age. Seroconversion following three doses (6, 10 and 14 weeks) was determined at 18 weeks of age (primary objective) and seroconversion following two doses (6 and 10 weeks) was determined at 14 weeks of age (secondary objective).</p><p>Analyses were conducted on the per protocol cohort, which included infants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, who were anti-rotavirus IgA seronegative at 6 weeks, received RV1 vaccines and blood draws according to schedule with no significant deviations, and remained in the study through 18 weeks. The breastfeeding requirements for the per-protocol cohort included documentation that the observed pre-dose and post-dose withholding period were each &#x02265; 60 minutes (withholding arm) or infants received RV1 within 10 minutes after an observed successful breastfeed (immediate arm).</p><p>We expected that any independent role of BMNA in impacting seroconversion would be most likely revealed by examining infants in the immediate feeding arm with low MDNA. We chose <italic>a priori</italic> to measure BMNA in the 10-week breast milk sample for two reasons: 1) it is expected that the 10-week vaccine dose is less impacted by serum MDNA compared to the 6-week dose, thus the independent effect of BMNA would be better assessed with a sample collected at a later dose, and 2) many infants would likely seroconvert after two vaccine doses and hence evaluating BMNA around the third dose (14 weeks) would be less informative. Therefore, infants in the immediate arm were divided into a high and low BMNA groups using the median BMNA titer as the cut point, and similarly were also divided into high and low MDNA groups using their median MDNA titer, and comparisons were made of serconversion following RV1 administration in these sub-groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Serum rotavirus IgA seroconversion between the withholding and the immediate breastfeeding arms were compared using the Fisher Exact test and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the differences in seroconversion were calculated based on the Newcombe-Wilson method without continuity correction. Serum anti-rotavirus IgA geometric mean titers (GMT) were compared across arms using a t- test for all infants as well as seroconverted infants; t-test was used to compare the log-transformed titers and 95% CIs were constructed based on the t-test. GMTs and 95% CI of GMTs were results of anti log-transformation of the log-transformed results. A value of 10 U/mL was assigned to infants with a IgA level of &#x0003c;20 U/mL for statistical purposes. To assess the overall relationship between MDNA in the 6 week serum sample and BMNA in the 10 week sample, Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation was used for both arms combined.</p><p>Enrollment of 200 infants in each arm was estimated to provide 85% power to detect a 17.5% difference in seroconversion after three vaccine doses between the withholding arm and the immediate breastfeeding arm, using a 2-sided Chi Square test (alpha 0.05), assuming a 45% seroconversion in the immediate breastfeeding arm, 5% IgA seropositivity at 6 weeks, and a 20% drop out during the study.

In fact, to our surprise, IgA seroconversion after two RV1 doses at 6 and 10 weeks (the WHO recommended vaccination schedule) was significantly greater in immediately breastfed infants compared with those in whom breast milk was withheld, and this trend persisted after three RV1 doses although it did not remain statistically significant. Although serum rotavirus IgA is just one component of the immunological response to the vaccine and not necessarily a mechanistic correlate of protection, our findings suggest that substantially improved clinical protection is not likely with the strategy of withholding breastfeeding around the administration of RV1.</p><p>While immediate breastfeeding did not have a negative impact on IgA immune responses in our overall study population receiving two or three vaccine doses at young ages, some nuances need to be carefully considered. As has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], our results from infants in the immediate feeding arm with low MDNA suggest that ingesting breast milk with higher BMNA at the same time as vaccine may reduce the subsequent immune response in some infants. Additionally, the GMT in seropositive infants at 14 weeks was higher in the withholding arm compared with the immediate arm. These latter two observations indicate that breast milk interference may occur in a subset of young infants, such as those with low MDNA and ingesting milk with high BMNA at the time of a particular dose.</p><p>It is unclear why IgA seroconversion in infants immediately breastfed tended to be higher than in those who were withheld from a feeding, opposite to our hypothesis. Buffering of gastric acid at the time of vaccine administration has been recognized as an important requirement for oral rotavirus vaccine &#x02018;take&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; RV1 is buffered with calcium carbonate. Our findings may suggest that additional buffering (as with a feed) may be worthwhile to investigate for some populations. This could be examined by evaluating a similar population but among whom formula feeding is more common, so as to isolate the effect of the possible additional buffering action of a concomitant feed. It is also possible, however, that this is a chance finding, possibly from differences in wild-type rotavirus exposure between the arms despite randomization. In a group of infants enrolled concomitantly as subjects in this study from a nearby area who did not receive rotavirus vaccine, background anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion by age 18 weeks was 13.3% [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Our conclusion on lack of benefit of withholding a breastfeed is similar to that from a recent randomized trial from South Africa, which found that infants who were withheld a breastfeed for one hour before and after RV1 administration did not have improved immunogenicity (defined as &#x02265;4-fold rise in serum anti-rotavirus IgA) after one or two doses of RV1 at 6 and 15 weeks, respectively, compared with infants in which unrestricted breastfeeding was encouraged; unlike our study, a documented immediate feed was not required and initially seropositive infants were included in the analysis [<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Lack of overall benefit of withholding could be partially explained if a study population had very low levels of BMNA. Compared to BMNA from other populations reported from the same laboratory conducting our testing (but with a smaller number of samples for each population, and variable maternal and infant ages), the median titer of BMNA against RV1 in the 10-week samples from Pakistani mothers in our evaluation (titer 4) appears to be intermediate between that of US or Vietnamese (titer 2), Korean (titer 8) or South African mothers (titer between 8&#x02013;16), and lower than Indian mothers (titer between 32&#x02013;64); the infants in these studies had median age of about 3 months (range 4&#x02013;29 weeks)[<xref rid="pone.0127622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127622.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, withholding breast feeding around the time of rotavirus vaccination does not appear to improve rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity in our study population. Alternative avenues to further augment immunogenicity and ultimately effectiveness of these vaccines in developing settings should be pursued.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127622.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127622.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127622.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Serum anti-rotavirus IgA status in infants at age 18 weeks following a third dose of RV1, by their status at age 14 weeks following 2 doses of RV1.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127622.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127622.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127622.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127622.s004"><label>S1 Related Publication</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127622.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge all members of the rotavirus vaccine trial team in Pakistan for their hard work in conducting this trial.
