over the last two decades, yet quality of care gaps persist and mortality
rates remain high. The World Health Organization (WHO) Safe Childbirth
Checklist, a quality improvement tool, promotes systematic adherence to
practices known to save lives and prevent harm during childbirth. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial in 60 pairs
o facilities across 24 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India to test the
effectiveness of the BetterBirth program, an 8-month coaching-based
implementation of the Checklist, on a composite outcome of 7-day
maternal/perinatal mortality and maternal morbidity. Outcomes&#x02014;assessed 8-42
days post-partum&#x02014;were compared between study arms adjusting for clustering
and matching. We also compared birth attendants&#x02019; mean adherence to 18
essential birth practices in 15 matched pairs of facilities at 2 and 12
months after intervention initiation. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 161,107 eligible women, we enrolled 157,689 (98%) and determined 7-day
outcomes for 157,145 (99.7%) mother-newborn dyads. Of 4888 observed births,
birth attendants&#x02019; adherence to practices was significantly higher in the
intervention (I) than control (C) arm (I: 73% vs. C: 42% at 2 months,
p&#x02264;0.01; I: 62% vs. C: 44% at 12 months, p&#x02264;0.01). However, we found no
difference in the composite outcome (I: 15.1% C: 15.3%, RR: 0.99, 95% CI:
0.83-1.18, p=0.90). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The coaching-based WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist program produced increased
adherence to some essential birth practices, but did not reduce morbidity
and mortality. (Clinical Trials #NCT02148952; The Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates

mortality rates from 0.95 to 40.6 per 1000; and stillbirths from 1.2 to 56.3 per
1000, with low- and middle- income countries experiencing rates an order of
magnitude higher than high-income regions.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While we have made progress in
recent decades, there is substantial room for improvement.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3-5</xref> Despite a dramatic
shift from home to facility-based births, birth attendants often do not perform
practices known to reduce mortality and mortality rates have not decreased as
expected.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Research has shown that programs solely seeking to strengthen birth attendants&#x02019;
training or to improve supply availability are insufficient to meaningfully improve
patient care or outcomes.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Conversely,
interventions incorporating job aids and on-site coaching have proven effective in
improving individual clinical practices, such as newborn resuscitation or active
management of the third stage of labor, as well as outcomes.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8-12</xref> To bridge the gap between evidence and practice, the World
Health Organization (WHO) created the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a practical tool to
assist birth attendants in planning for and performing a more complete bundle of 28
essential birth practices.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These key practices address the most common
causes of avoidable mortality for women and newborns.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Studies have previously shown that, when well implemented at a small scale, the WHO
Safe Childbirth Checklist improves facility-based birth attendants&#x02019; adherence to
evidence-based care.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16-18</xref> We tested the
BetterBirth program, a coaching-based implementation of the Checklist, in a
large-scale, matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial in Uttar Pradesh,
India.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We intended our intervention to
support providers at multiple levels of the health system in using the Checklist
appropriately, to identify gaps in facilities&#x02019; quality of care, and to activate
resources (e.g. skills training and supply provision) within the existing healthcare
system to address these gaps (Figure 1). We hypothesized that the intervention,
implemented at the facility (cluster level), would improve quality of care in
facility-based childbirth by increasing birth attendants&#x02019; adherence to Checklist
practices. Further, we hypothesized that this increase in adherence to practices
would lead to a decrease in our composite outcome, consisting of maternal mortality
[day 0-7], maternal severe morbidity [day 0-7], early neonatal mortality [day 0-7],
and stillbirth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>We conducted a matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial in government
health facilities, which received either the BetterBirth program, a
coaching-based implementation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (60
facilities; Figure 1) or the existing standard of care (60 facilities). We
described the methodology of the BetterBirth Trial<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, the BetterBirth Program/intervention<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, and our Data Quality Assurance system<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Setting and Participants</title><p>The most populous state in India (204 million, 77% rural),<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Uttar Pradesh is a high-priority region for national and
international public-health organizations due to its persistently high neonatal
mortality rate (25 per 1000) and maternal mortality ratio (258 per
100,000).<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The Government of Uttar Pradesh permitted the trial to proceed in 38 districts,
where we identified 320 eligible facilities. We considered a facility eligible
if it was designated as a Primary, Community, or First Referral Unit Health
Center; had &#x0003e;=1000 deliveries annually; had &#x0003e;=3 birth attendants trained
as auxiliary nurse midwives (or higher); had no other concurrent quality
improvement or research programs; and had district and facility leadership
willing to participate. The final study sample included 120 facilities across 24
districts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement
1</xref>).</p><p>We matched facilities (i.e. clusters) on the following criteria prior to
randomization: geographic zone, functional classification, distance to a
district hospital, annual birth volume, and number of birth attendants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>). We
randomized facilities to study arm within the matched pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). After matching and randomization, we collected
baseline practice-adherence data in 10 sites to confirm successful matching
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Women registered for labor and delivery&#x02014;excluding women who delivered outside the
facility, women who were referred in from another facility, or women who were
managed for abortion&#x02014; were eligible for the study. At each intervention facility
and its matched control site, we began enrolling patients 2 months after
intervention initiation. Enrollment continued until the site&#x02019;s target sample
size was reached or for 24 weeks after intervention completion, whichever
occurred first with a 12-week minimum follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>We implemented the BetterBirth program following the Engage-Launch-Support model
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) piloted at non-study sites
in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, India.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Coaches (nurses) and Coach Team Leaders (physicians or
public-health professionals), unaffiliated with facilities and comprehensively
trained to apply a standard behavior-change framework, conducted site visits
over the 8-month Support phase.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We expected Coaches to conduct 43
day-long visits to each facility, beginning twice-weekly and tapering to monthly
visits. Coach Team Leaders accompanied Coaches on alternating visits (23 total
visits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Each facility chose at
least one staff member to serve as a Childbirth Quality Coordinator, a local
champion for the use of the Checklist and continued coaching. </p><p>Coaches motivated birth attendants to use the Checklist and to identify,
understand, and resolve barriers to providing quality care.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Coach Team
Leaders supported facility leadership in fostering team communication and
addressing gaps in care at facility and district levels by accessing resources
through the established healthcare system. Cloud-based data collection enabled
rapid feedback on a facility&#x02019;s progress. We provided no clinical-skills
training, financial support, or clinical supplies (except paper copies of the
Checklist).</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection and Outcomes</title><p>We measured a composite outcome of events occurring within the first 7-days
postpartum, incorporating stillbirth; early neonatal death; maternal death; or
self-reported maternal severe morbidity, including seizures, loss of
consciousness for &#x0003e;1 hour, fever with foul-smelling vaginal discharge,
hemorrhage, or stroke. We selected morbidity measures based on the WHO maternal
near-miss approach using questions previously validated for self-report.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27-30</xref> We calculated an additional composite
outcome consisting of mortality events only.</p><p>Secondary maternal outcomes by 7-days postpartum included maternal mortality,
maternal morbidity, inter-facility transfer (referral), cesarean section,
hysterectomy, blood transfusion, and return to the facility for a health
problem. Secondary newborn outcomes included stillbirth, early neonatal death,
and inter-facility transfer. We assessed all outcomes from facility register
information and by contacting women or close family members by telephone between
8 and 22 days post-partum. If we received no response by 22 days post-partum, a
fieldworker conducted a home visit.</p><p>Additionally, we selected a convenience sample of 15 matched pairs of facilities
in which trained nurse-data-collectors directly observed birth attendants
providing care over a 12-hour (daytime) shift at 2 months and 12 months after
intervention initiation (4 months after coaching cessation). These independent
observers measured practice adherence, including supply availability (Table 2).
Intervention staff and independent observers were not present at the same
facility simultaneously.</p><p>Due to the nature of the intervention, we were unable to blind any facility
staff, most trial staff, or any investigators to the identity of intervention
and control facilities. Call center staff, who collected the majority of outcome
data, were blinded to facility assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p><italic>A priori</italic>, we hypothesized a 15% reduction in the primary
composite outcome in the intervention arm. We estimated the intracluster (within
facility) correlation (ICC) to be 0.01 and the matching effect to reduce the
standard error by 45%, basing parameters on previous studies.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We aimed to enroll 171,964 women (85,982
per arm) to detect a decrease from 60 events per 1000 births (control arm) to 51
events per 1000 births (intervention arm) with 80% power and alpha=0.05.</p><p>Based on limited data available from Uttar Pradesh, the baseline rate of the
primary composite outcome may have been as high as 120 events per 1000 births.
The baseline rate used in calculations was purposively set lower than the
estimated due to limited information as well as inclusion of community-based
birth events in the available data, which may have elevated mortality rates.</p><p>In assessing practice adherence, we assumed an ICC (within facility) of 0.01 and
a design effect of matching of 0.75. With 15 matched pairs, we had more than
80% power at alpha=0.05 to detect an absolute difference of 8.5% in any
birth practice between study arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Using an intent-to-treat approach, we compared outcomes between study arms using
a Rao- Scott chi-square test, accounting for the matched-pair, cluster
design.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The main outcome was the
dichotomous composite outcome that was present if any of the 3 main outcomes
occurred (maternal mortality, stillbirth/early neonatal mortality, or maternal
severe morbidity). This variable was then used to estimate a composite relative
risk.<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33,34</xref> An additional secondary
composite outcome included maternal and perinatal mortality only. In secondary
analyses, each of the main outcomes were compared across arms; a Rao-Scott
3-degree-of-freedom test was used to assess the overall causal effect. No
adjustment for multiplicity of testing was made. </p><p>For the subset of directly observed births, we calculated adherence frequencies
for each measured practice at 2 months and 12 months after intervention
initiation. Further, we calculated an aggregate adherence score by summing the
total number of 18 non-conditional practices performed in each delivery
(Supplement 1). We generated the mean number of practices (presented as a
fraction of 18) performed in each study arm and compared the differences at each
time point, using a Rao-Scott chi-square test.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> For comparison of individual practices, we used a bias-corrected
logistic regression approach that can handle zero cells and complete separation
of points within strata and clusters.<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
We conducted all statistical analyses using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Compliance</title><p>Each facility&#x02019;s leadership provided facility-level consent for participation and
permission for trial staff to collect de-identified data on every eligible woman
from facility registers. Before patient discharge, we obtained verbal informed
consent and contact information from each woman or her surrogate for follow-up.
Data collectors reconfirmed verbal consent at start of the follow-up call or
visit. In directly observed births, women or their surrogates provided written
consent for observation.</p><p>At trial initiation, birth attendants and facility staff verbally agreed to
participate. Before an independent observer collected data, the birth attendant
verbally reconfirmed agreement. Electronic data were de-identified and stored in
a HIPAA-compliant database to ensure participant privacy.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the following ethical review boards: Community
Empowerment Lab (Ref no: 2014006), Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Ref no:
MDC/IECHSR/2015-16/A-53), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (Protocol
21975-102), Population Services International (Protocol ID: 47.2012), World
Health Organization (Protocol ID: RPC 501), and Indian Council of Medical
Research. The protocol was reviewed and reapproved on an annual basis. A Data
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met every 6 months after enrollment initiation,
including interim-analysis when 30% of data was collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Facility and Patient Characteristics</title><p>All 120 matched and randomized facilities initiated the study. During data
collection, 2 facilities closed for renovations, halting enrollment prematurely
for those facilities and their matched pairs. Of the 163,939 women registered
for labor and delivery (83,166 intervention; 80,773 control), 98.3%
(161,107) were eligible for study inclusion and 97.9% (157,689) consented
(Figure 2). We collected 7-day outcomes for all but 544 (0.3%) of the
consented women. We found no significant differences between intervention and
control arms in facility, maternal, or newborn characteristics (Table 1).</p><p>The BetterBirth Program was successfully implemented in all 60 intervention
facilities, achieving high fidelity to the expected number of coaching visits
(average 42.1 visits of 43 expected), interactions with facility leadership
(average 14.8 interactions of 11 expected), and facility data- sharing meetings
(average 8.6 meetings of 11 expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Adherence to Birth Practices</title><p>After 2 months of twice-weekly coaching, birth attendants in intervention
facilities (1259 observations) performed 73% of measured practices compared
to 42% in control facility attendants (1304 observations) (p&#x02264;0.01) (Table
2). Birth attendants performed specific practices, such as blood pressure and
temperature assessment, proper hand hygiene, and early newborn care, at
significantly higher rates in the intervention arm. Supply availability was
similar between study arms. In intervention sites, the Checklist was used at
admission in 56.8% of observed births and in 74.3% of births within the
first hour post-partum.</p><p>Although adherence in intervention facilities remained significantly higher than
control facilities, adherence in the intervention arm decreased to 62% of
practices per childbirth at 12-months, four months after coaching ceased. For
example, administration of oxytocin soon after delivery decreased by nearly one
third (from 79.5% to 53.9%) between 2 and 12 months. Similarly,
Checklist use declined in intervention sites at 12 months (17.4% at
admission; 35.1% within 1 hour post-partum). In control sites, overall birth
attendant adherence remained low at both 2 and 12 months (42% and 44%,
respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Mortality and Morbidity</title><p>We found no significant difference between intervention and control facilities in
our primary outcome (Intervention 15.1%, Control 15.3%, RR: 0.99,
95% CI: 0.83-1.18, p=0.90) or in any secondary outcomes (Table 3). We found
no difference in the rates of follow-up care required for women or newborns,
hysterectomy, blood transfusion, or inter-facility transfer (referral) for women
or newborns. In stratified analyses, we observed no differences between arms
based on phase of the intervention (intensive coaching, tapered coaching, and
four months post- intervention), time of delivery, or in-facility mortality rate
(data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Implementation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist and similarly constructed tools
have suggested impact on quality of care, but have lacked rigorous data evaluating
both adherence to essential birth practices and morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16-18</xref> In this large
matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial in Uttar Pradesh, India, we found
that the BetterBirth Program&#x02014;a coaching-based implementation of the WHO Safe
Childbirth Checklist&#x02014; demonstrated no impact on our primary composite
maternal/perinatal health outcome (nor on any secondary health outcomes), despite
significant improvement in birth attendant adherence to essential practices in
intervention facilities.</p><p>The majority of maternal and neonatal mortality happens around the time of birth and
within the first 7 days postpartum;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> thus, interventions to improve early
outcomes are desperately needed. The BetterBirth Program&#x02019;s theory of change&#x02014;that
improving the quality of childbirth- related care provided in facilities would
translate into improved patient outcomes&#x02014;reflects basic assumptions underlying
current childbirth work in global health. We found that the largely rural population
living in this resource-limited setting had a perinatal mortality rate (47 per 1000)
and a maternal morbidity rate (12%) much higher than anticipated;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and event rates varied widely across
facilities, with up to 10-fold differences observed (Supplement 1). Quality of care
in control sites, as measured through birth attendant adherence to practices, was
far lower than previously recognized.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37-41</xref>
Overall, birth attendants in non-intervention facilities performed just 40% of
measured essential practices in a typical birth, such as appropriate hand hygiene
(used in &#x0003e;1% of deliveries) or administration of oxytocin within the first
minute postpartum to reduce hemorrhage (used in &#x0003e;25%).</p><p>We appeared to achieve the first step in the theory of change, demonstrating that a
coaching- based implementation of the Checklist could produce broad-based
improvement in the quality of care of facility-based childbirth. In intervention
facilities, birth attendants substantially increased their performance of measured
practices. At two months, intervention sites saw significant improvement in almost
all of the practices that were rarely performed in control sites. Staff at
intervention facilities had a corresponding increase in Checklist use during the
coaching intervention. However, overall levels of adherence and Checklist use
diminished after coaching ceased, and some practices never improved compared to
controls. It is possible that Checklist use was not sustained due to lack of
Checklist stock, staff belief that they knew the items on the Checklist, lack of
enthusiasm, or other reasons. While we achieved relative success in improving the
quality of care delivered in int</p><p>A potential conclusion from our findings is that increasing adherence to these
practices is not a worthwhile goal, as these practices did not lead to improved
outcomes. We strongly believe this conclusion to be false. Each of the practices
incorporated in the Checklist (and therefore in the BetterBirth Program) has its own
evidence base, including effectiveness on improving maternal and/or neonatal
outcomes.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> At least one practice (proper hand hygiene) has evidence of
saving mothers and newborns stretching as far back as the 1840s.<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Several other factors may have affected the outcome. The measured levels of
improvement in adherence to essential birth practices may not have reached
sufficient levels to affect outcomes. For instance, hand hygiene reached only
35% adherence; although skin-to-skin initiation was 79%, maintenance at one
hour was just 19%; and magnesium sulfate administration did not increase despite
improved maternal blood pressure measurement. The measured levels of adherence may
have been misleading, if staff practiced markedly differently when unobserved.<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, we compared treatment effects
between sites with and without observation, finding no differences. Persistent gaps
in technical skills, complication management, quality as well as quantity of
supplies and medicines, access to supportive management and systems level
accountability&#x02014;which were mostly unmeasured&#x02014;could also have had a significant impact
on the ability to improve health outcomes. Factors not targeted by the BetterBirth
Program may have also limited the impact, including women&#x02019;s underlying health and
nutrition status, the quality of pre- and post-natal care, and the quality of
referral care for those with more complex needs.</p><p>In sum, we found that a coaching-based implementation of the WHO Safe Childbirth
Checklist appeared to drive substantial improvements in the quality of
facility-based childbirth care, but did not achieve impact on adverse maternal and
perinatal health outcomes. High-quality research on large-scale childbirth
improvement programs is feasible; such studies must continue to measure both
processes and outcomes of care. Further investigation is required to understand and
modify the complex interaction between quality of care, morbidity, and
mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Appendix</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="NEJMoa1701075_Semrau_SuppApp.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e639" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We recognize the Governments of India and Uttar Pradesh for collaboration and support
