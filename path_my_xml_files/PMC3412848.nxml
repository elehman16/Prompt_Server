While prompt antifungal therapy improves outcomes, empiric treatment based on the presence of fever has little clinical impact. &#x00392;-D-Glucan (BDG) is a fungal cell wall component detectable in the serum of patients with early invasive fungal infection (IFI). We evaluated the utility of BDG surveillance as a guide for preemptive antifungal therapy in at-risk intensive care unit (ICU) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients admitted to the ICU for &#x02265;3 days and expected to require at least 2 additional days of intensive care were enrolled. Subjects were randomized in 3&#x02236;1 fashion to receive twice weekly BDG surveillance with preemptive anidulafungin in response to a positive test or empiric antifungal treatment based on physician preference.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-four subjects were enrolled, with 1 proven and 5 probable cases of IC identified over a 2.5 year period. BDG levels were higher in subjects with proven/probable IC as compared to those without an IFI (117 pg/ml vs. 28 pg/ml; p&#x0003c;0.001). Optimal assay performance required 2 sequential BDG determinations of &#x02265;80 pg/ml to define a positive test (sensitivity 100%, specificity 75%, positive predictive value 30%, negative predictive value 100%). In all, 21 preemptive and 5 empiric subjects received systemic antifungal therapy. Receipt of preemptive antifungal treatment had a significant effect on BDG concentrations (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Preemptive anidulafungin was safe and generally well tolerated with excellent outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>BDG monitoring may be useful for identifying ICU patients at highest risk to develop an IFI as well as for monitoring treatment response. Preemptive strategies based on fungal biomarkers warrant further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00672841">NCT00672841</ext-link>

The majority of these infections are nosocomially acquired <xref rid="pone.0042282-Pfaller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and frequently complicate the management of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Most invasive <italic>Candida</italic> infections are due to <italic>C. albicans</italic> followed in frequency by <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, a species that is often fluconazole resistant, and other non-<italic>albicans Candida</italic> species <xref rid="pone.0042282-Pfaller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042282-Wisplinghoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042282-Pfaller2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Antifungal prophylaxis reduces the overall incidence and associated mortality of IC <xref rid="pone.0042282-Playford1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, but a cost-effective approach requires targeting patients with the highest-risk of disease.</p><p>Establishing a definitive diagnosis of IC is difficult. The accompanying signs and symptoms are nonspecific and may not be present until the disease is advanced or disseminated. Standard microbiologic methods such as blood culture are time consuming and insensitive for early onset IC. Culture-based treatment is therefore delayed, which in turn fuels poor outcomes <xref rid="pone.0042282-Falagas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Unfortunately, empiric fluconazole based on the presence of fever has little clinical impact <xref rid="pone.0042282-Schuster1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and adequate empiric therapy is received by less than 30% of patients despite the availability of newer antifungal drugs with broad spectrum activity <xref rid="pone.0042282-Parkins1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The limitations of empirical and culture-driven antifungal therapy have prompted investigation of alternative ICU strategies.

The clinical benefit of risk-factor based regimes, however, remains largely unproven. 1, 3-&#x003b2;-D-glucan (BDG) is a fungal cell wall constituent found in many pathogenic fungi including <italic>Candida</italic>. The &#x003b2;-D-glucan test (Fungitell<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Association (FDA) as an adjunct to the diagnosis of deep-seated mycoses. Serial measurement of fungal cell wall biomarkers with initiation of therapy in response to a positive test represents an exciting new approach to IC management. Additional proof-of-concept studies are required to establish BDG test performance and to assess the potential role of preemptive strategies in the ICU setting.</p><p>This is a single center, randomized, non-blinded, parallel group pilot study assessing the feasibility and utility of biweekly &#x003b2;-D-glucan testing as a guide for preemptive antifungal therapy in at-risk intensive care unit patients. We also assessed the outcome of biomarker driven preemptive therapy as compared to current practice (i.e., empiric treatment based on physician preference) for the management of IC. Overall, the purpose was to generate preliminary data to inform the design of a future, statistically powered multicenter clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042282.s001">Checklist S1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042282.s002">Protocol S1</xref></bold>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients</title><p>Between June 2008 and January 2011, adult patients (&#x02265;18 years) admitted to the Surgical ICUs for at least 3 days, who were also expected to require &#x02265;2 additional days of intensive care, were screened.

We waited at least 3 days to begin active surveillance in an attempt to avoid other BDG cross-reactive substances present in early in admission <xref rid="pone.0042282-Mohr1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or following surgery <xref rid="pone.0042282-Kanamori1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042282-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Using this delayed approach, significant proportions of subjects still had false-positive BDG results and were given anidulafungin. Changing the preemptive treatment threshold to require 2 sequential BDG values &#x02265;80 pg/ml would reduce the number of patients treated by approximately half (a reduction from 59% [26/45] based on the current protocol to 24% [11/45]), without missing cases of proven/probable IC.</p><p>Overall adherence to the BDG surveillance protocol was good, with &#x0003e; 85% of preemptive subjects managed appropriately. Only 4 subjects assigned to the preemptive group received antifungal therapy despite negative BDG results and repeatedly negative results were used to safely withhold antifungal therapy in the majority of cases (78.9%, 15/19). Given the medical complexity of ICU patients, these observations suggest an acceptance of the BDG-driven strategy and a reliance on the negative predictive value of the test. BDG testing with present assays, however, is relatively expensive and labor intensive. Future studies incorporating biomarkers might consider alternative sampling schemes or the development of more facile assays that are amendable to the workflow of a routine clinical laboratory.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the small number of subjects with proven/probable IC. Despite liberal inclusion criteria, we had a difficult time accruing patients not already receiving systemic antifungal therapy by day 3 of ICU admission. Targeted antifungal prophylaxis is routinely used for Duke solid organ transplant, peripheral blood stem transplant, high-risk leukemia/lymphoma and ventricular assist device patients. Reasons why potential subjects were already receiving systemic antifungal therapy was not documented as a part of the study screening process, however, we suspect that a significant proportion of ineligible ICU patients fell in to one of these categories. This may have biased study enrollment toward lower risk ICU subjects. In addition, we relied heavily on consent authorization obtained from patients&#x02019; legal representatives, but only half of all potentially eligible subjects had a designated surrogate available to discuss study participation during regular business hours. In the future, having the capacity to consent and screen both subjects in the evening and on weekends might modestly improve accrual. Perhaps more importantly, consideration should be given to initiating study enrollment/screening at the time of surgical or medical ICU admission, recognizing that some subjects will have a falsely elevated BDG level immediately following surgery. Antifungal therapy would then be withheld as a part of the protocol in selected subjects with a negative BDG test at baseline and during serial measurements.</p><p>In conclusion, this pilot study represents a first attempt at preemptive antifungal therapy based on the fungal biomarker BDG in busy tertiary care ICUs. Our results suggest that randomized studies of preemptive antifungal therapy in the ICU are feasible, but that these studies should ideally involve centers that do not routinely utilize fluconazole prophylaxis or employ protocols in which prophylaxis is held for selected patients with negative screening tests. Multicenter trials will ultimately be required to determine the efficacy, optimal algorithm, and cost-effectiveness of preemptive approaches for critically ill patients. Given the high mortality associated with delayed IC treatment and the ineffectiveness of empiric therapy based on fever, early preemptive approaches incorporating fungal biomarkers may have a substantial advantage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042282.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0042282.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042282.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0042282.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0042282-Falagas1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
