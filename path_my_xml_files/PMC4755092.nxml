About 3% of the population are suffering from chronic tension headache.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Tension headaches are often associated with lower quality of life and high levels of psychological discomforts.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In recent years, several meta-analyses evaluating the established pain treatments used today have shown that medical treatments, which may be effective in acute pain, are not effective with chronic pain and may, in fact, be causing further problems. Most of the pain treatments are designed for and useful for acute pain but if used in the long run may create more problems such as substance abuse and avoidance of important activities.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A common element in most of the pain treatments is that they emphasize on either avoiding pain or fighting to reduce pain. The pain in tension headache can be intolerable. Painkillers and pain management strategies can increase intolerance and sensitivity to pain. Therefore, the treatments that increase acceptance and tolerance to pain, especially chronic pain, are effective. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a new psychotherapy that appears to be effective in improving physical performance and psychological well-being in patients with chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the past two decades, Kabat-Zinn <italic>et al</italic>. in the US successfully used mindfulness for the relief of pain and illness related to pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recent studies on acceptance-based methods, such as mindfulness, show improved performance in patients with chronic pain. Mindfulness modulates the pain using nonelaborative awareness of thoughts, feelings and sensations, and an emotionally distanced relationship with internal and external experience.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Studies found that MBSR program can significantly alleviate medical illness related to chronic pains such as fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, chronic low back pain, and multiple sclerosis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] MBSR has significant changes in pain intensity, anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, well-being, adaptation, quality of sleep, fatigue, and physical functioning.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] But the programs for improving health status of patients with illness related to pain, such as tension headache, are often still in their infancy. Therefore, the study was conducted to assess the effects of MBSR on perceived stress and general mental health in patients with tension headache.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in 2012 in Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Kashan City. The Research Ethics Committee of the Kashan University of Medical Sciences approved this study (IRCT No: 2014061618106N1). The participants of the study included adults with tension headache who were referred by the psychiatrists and neurologists in Kashan. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Having tension headache according to the International Headache Classification Subcommittee, willing to participate in the study, not having a medical diagnosis of organic brain disorder or psychotic disorder, and not having a history of psychological treatment during the preceding 6 months. The patients who did not complete the intervention and missed more than two sessions were excluded from the study. The participants, who signed an informed consent form, completed the measures as a pretest. For estimating the sample size, we referred to another study in which changes in mean of scores of fatigue was 62 &#x000b1; 9.5 in the pretreatment period and 54.5 &#x000b1; 11.5 in the posttreatment period.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Then, by utilizing the sample size calculation, 33 participants (with attrition risk) in each group with &#x003b1; = 0.95 and 1 &#x02013; &#x003b2; = 0.9 were segregated. After sample size calculation, 66 patients with tension headache were selected via convenient sampling according to the inclusion criteria. Then, the patients were called and invited to participate in the study. If a patient agreed to participate, then he/she was invited to attend the study-briefing session and if not another patient was selected similarly. Then using a random number table, they were assigned either to the experimental group (MBSR) or to the control group that treated as usual. Finally, 3 patients were excluded from each group and 60 patients were included (30 patients in each group). The TAU group was treated only by antidepressant medication and clinical management. The MBSR group received MBSR training in addition to TAU. The patients in MBSR group were trained for 8 weeks by a clinical psychologist with PhD degree. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were administered before the first treatment session in the MBSR group, after the eighth session (posttest), and 3 months after the test (follow-up) in both groups. The TAU group was invited to Shahid Beheshti Hospital to fill out the questionnaires. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram depicting the flow of study participants.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram depicting flow of study participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-1058-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention group (MBSR) was trained in Shahid Beheshti Hospital. The eight weekly sessions (120 min) were held according to the standard MBSR protocol as developed by Kabat-Zinn.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Additional sessions were held for the participants who had missed one or two sessions. At the end of the training and 3 months later (follow-up), both MBSR and TAU groups were invited to Shahid Beheshti Hospital (the place of MBSR trial) and were instructed to complete the questionnaires. During the MBSR sessions, the participants were trained to be aware of their thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations nonjudgmentally. Mindfulness exercises are taught as two forms of meditation practices &#x02014; formal and informal. Formal type exercises include trained sitting meditation, body scan, and mindful yoga. In informal meditation, attention and awareness are focused not only on daily activities, but also on thoughts, feelings, and physical sensation even they are problematic and painful.

Absence of pain and the most intense disabling headache were characterized by 0 and 10, respectively. The mean of headache severity in a week was calculated by dividing the sum of the severity scores by 7. Moreover, the mean of headache severity in a month was calculated by dividing the sum of the severity scores by 30. The minimum and maximum scores of headache severity were 0 and 10, respectively. Headache diary was given to five patients and a neurologist and a psychiatrist confirmed the content validity of the instrument.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The reliability coefficient of Persian version of this scale was calculated as 0.88.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Brief symptom inventory (BSI)</title><p>Psychological symptoms were assessed with the BSI.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The inventory consist 53 items and 9 subscales that assess psychological symptoms.

Although MBSR is recognized as an effective treatment for stress symptoms and pain, there is a need to examine its efficacy for the treatment of mental health problems in patients with tension headache, which is one of the common complaints in the population.</p><p>The findings of our study demonstrate enhanced general mental health in the GSI index of BSI. In some study, significant improvements by MBSR intervention were reported on all indexes of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Studies showed significant reduction in psychological problems in the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) subscale such as anxiety and depression by MBSR after intervention and 1-year follow-up.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Reibel <italic>et al</italic>. showed MBSR in patients with chronic pain reported a decrease in medical symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and pain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown that tension headache and anxiety are accompanied with deficits in controlled cognitive processing such as sustained attention and working memory.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Negative emotions may amplify suffering associated with pain perception.</p><p>MBSR implements the following mechanisms to improve the patient's mental status: First, mindfulness leads to increased awareness for what is happening in each moment, with an accepting attitude, without getting caught up in habitual thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns. The increased awareness then gives rise to new ways to respond and cope in relation to oneself and the world around.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Mindfulness establishes a sense of self that is greater than one's thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensation such as pain. Mindfulness exercises, learned clients develop an &#x0201c;observer&#x02013;self&#x0201d;. With this ability, they can observe their thoughts and feelings in a nonreactive and nonjudgmental way that previously avoided, that previously avoided thoughts and feelings be observed in a nonreactive and nonjudgmental way. The clients learn to notice thoughts without necessarily acting on them, being controlled by them, or believing them.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Second, mindfulness helps the client develop persistence in taking steps in valued directions that are important to them. Most clients with chronic pain want to become pain free rather than living the vital lives of their choice. But the MBSR program trained them to engage in valued action despite the the pain. Studies have shown attention and emotional reaction to pain has an important role in becoming persistent the pain.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Emotional and cognitive components can modulate attention to pain and worry about it that could intensify pain and disrupt the patients activities.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Third, findings from some studies indicate that MBSR can alter the function of the brain that is responsible for affect regulation and the areas that govern how we react to stressful impulses, and this in turn may normalize body functions such as breathing, heart rate, and immune function.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Mindfulness practice reduces reactivity to distressing thoughts and feelings that comorbid and strengthen pain perception.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Also mindfulness may lessen psychophysiological activation related to stress and mood dysfunction by strengthening positive reappraisal and emotion regulation skills.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>The strength of this study is the use of a new effective psychotherapy in reducing the stress on a complaint that is less studied, but it is a common medical problem. The implications of our study are using a simple psychotherapy that does not make too much cognitive demand and is readily usable as a coping skill for the patient with tension headache. Therefore, the health-care professionals related to this complaint and the patient will be able to use this treatment. Also, MBSR will change the patient's lifestyle who would be exacerbated by his/her problem. The main limitation of this study was the lack of comparison between MBSR and the gold standard psychotherapies such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). It is suggested that future studies need to compare the efficacy of MBSR and other traditional and newer cognitive behavioral therapies in patients with tension headache.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study supports the hypothesis that patients suffering from tension headache can enhance their general mental health by participating in the MBSR program. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that MBSR can reduce pain-related anxiety and interference in daily activities in the short term. The unique features of mindfulness exercises are easy training and no need to complex cognitive abilities.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>AO contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
