Capsular Vi-polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines (Vi-conjugate vaccines) are immunogenic and can be used from infancy but there are no efficacy data for the leading candidate vaccine being considered for widespread use. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the efficacy of a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine using an established human infection model of <italic>S</italic> Typhi.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this single-centre, randomised controlled, phase 2b study, using an established outpatient-based human typhoid infection model, we recruited healthy adult volunteers aged between 18 and 60 years, with no previous history of typhoid vaccination, infection, or prolonged residency in a typhoid-endemic region. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single dose of Vi-conjugate (Vi-TT), Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS), or control meningococcal vaccine with a computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size 6). Investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation, and an unmasked team of nurses administered the vaccines. Following oral ingestion of <italic>S</italic> Typhi, participants were assessed with daily blood culture over a 2-week period and diagnosed with typhoid infection when meeting pre-defined criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants diagnosed with typhoid infection (ie, attack rate), defined as persistent fever of 38&#x000b0;C or higher for 12 h or longer or <italic>S</italic> Typhi bacteraemia, following oral challenge administered 1 month after Vi-vaccination (Vi-TT or Vi-PS) compared with control vaccination.

The composite criteria for typhoid diagnosis was met in 24 (77%) of 31 participants in the control group, 13 (35%) of 37 participants in the Vi-TT group, and 13 (35%) of 35 participants in the Vi-PS group to give vaccine efficacies of 54&#x000b7;6% (95% CI 26&#x000b7;8&#x02013;71&#x000b7;8) for Vi-TT and 52&#x000b7;0% (23&#x000b7;2&#x02013;70&#x000b7;0) for Vi-PS. Seroconversion was 100% in Vi-TT and 88&#x000b7;6% in Vi-PS participants, with significantly higher geometric mean titres detected 1-month post-vaccination in Vi-TT vaccinees.

The first capsular Vi-polysaccharide-protein conjugate (Vi-conjugate) vaccine efficacy trial, published in 2001, estimated efficacy at 89% following two doses of a prototype Vi-rEPA vaccine (Vi conjugated to recombinant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A) in children aged between 2&#x02013;5 years. Since then, only one other efficacy study assessing Vi-conjugate vaccines has been published. There are no efficacy trials of the Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT), which is currently being considered by WHO for licensure.

Both Vi-vaccines contained 25 &#x003bc;g of Vi-polysaccharide per 0&#x000b7;5 mL dose. The randomisation schedule was generated by an independent statistician using a fixed block size of six and stratified according to baseline anti-Vi IgG titre to ensure participants with pre-existing detectable antibodies were equally distributed between vaccine groups. The allocation sequence was implemented using a randomisation system to ensure allocation concealment.</p><p id="para140">The allocation ratio was subsequently altered to account for the expiry of the investigational vaccine (Vi-TT) in June, 2016. A sensitivity analysis was done to assess the effect of bias due to changing the randomisation ratio, specifically by analysing the primary endpoint separately within those participants that were randomised under the original allocation ratio.</p><p id="para150">Investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation, and an unmasked team of nurses administered the vaccines. Vaccine allocation and administration were coordinated by an unmasked team who were not involved in subsequent study procedures.

To account for 15% dropout between randomisation and challenge, the sample size was increased to at least 35 per group.

Time to diagnosis, time to development of fever, and time to bacteraemia were summarised using the Kaplan-Meier method, participants were censored on day 14 and group comparisons were done using a log-rank test. A post-hoc competing risk model for time to fever preceding a positive blood culture was fitted, in addition to a competing risks regression model with positive blood culture without fever treated as a competing risk.

The protective effect of Vi-PS identified from our study was similar to Vi-TT at 52%; however, this is notably less than that observed in field trials of Vi-PS, where efficacy is estimated at 69% within the first year following vaccination.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> This discrepancy in vaccine efficacy might be partly due to differences in participant populations, with healthy typhoid-naive adults enrolled in the challenge study versus pre-exposed individuals, including children living in endemic settings.</p><p id="para380">Historical typhoid vaccine challenge studies done by Woodward and colleagues<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> 60 years ago found that larger inocula of <italic>S</italic> Typhi (10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>7</sup> CFUs) produced higher attack rates (65%), but overwhelmed protection afforded by known efficacious vaccines (eg, the whole-cell inactivated parenteral vaccine).

In view of this high attack rate, it is plausible that vaccine-induced immunity in some Vi-vaccinees was overwhelmed by the large bacterial inoculum resulting in infection, despite the presence of Vi antibody.</p><p id="para390">The use of a composite definition of typhoid fever, to capture microbiological cases, and clinical presentations was necessary to ensure that all potential cases of infection were identified and treated promptly with antibiotics to safeguard participants.

In addition, the lower blood bacterial load in these individuals at the time of diagnosis, when compared with control participants, might suggest that after ingesting a high bacterial inoculum, the presence of Vi-antibody reduces the number of invading organisms or bacterial replication during the incubation period, resulting in an attenuated disease profile. This finding has also been observed in a previous typhoid vaccine challenge study using a live attenuated oral vaccine, M01ZH09.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A reduction in the severity of typhoid symptoms could lead to fewer undifferentiated fever presentations to pharmacies in high-burden settings, which would reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and assist with the management of the growing problem of <italic>S</italic> Typhi AMR.</p><p id="para410">Protection against <italic>S</italic> Typhi following Vi-vaccination is primarily antibody mediated.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In the Vi-PS group, those participants diagnosed with typhoid had lower total anti-Vi IgG titres, and in particular lower IgG2 titres, the main subclass known to target polysaccharide antigens after immunisation with plain polysaccharides,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> suggesting that antibody quantity and perhaps the type of IgG subclass induced by Vi-PS vaccination play an important part in protecting against disease. Interestingly, no significant difference in titres between diagnosed and undiagnosed participants was identified in the Vi-TT group, suggesting that antibody functionality is equally important for protection as absolute antibody quantity. Future work assessing functional Vi-antibody (such as those mediating bactericidal, opsonophagocytic, or antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity activity) is required to interrogate differences in antibody quality in protected individuals versus susceptible individuals.</p><p id="para420">Logistic regression modelling of the relation between anti-Vi IgG titre and the risk of developing typhoid disease suggests that higher anti-Vi IgG titres are associated with a lower risk of disease. Despite this, an absolute threshold of protection, above which individuals are 100% protected from disease, could not be identified from these data. This might be a phenomenon unique to the typhoid challenge model, a by-product of using a high <italic>S</italic> Typhi inoculum that might overwhelm vaccine-induced protection.

In addition, the mechanism of action of Vi antibody following vaccination might be related to lowering the infectious dose or degree of bacterial replication, rather than sterilising immunity at the mucosal surface, as indicated by experience with other polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines. By showing a relation between anti-Vi IgG titre and the risk of typhoid disease, we have shown that post-vaccination anti-Vi IgG titres will be a key component for assessing vaccine immunogenicity, particularly as more Vi-conjugate vaccines enter later stages of clinical testing. Evaluation from field trials in relevant endemic settings, such as those led by the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), will assist with validating these findings.</p><p id="para430">Logistical, ethical, and safety considerations in the study design limit the extent to which our findings can be extrapolated to typhoid endemic countries. Volunteers cannot be left untreated indefinitely, which potentially leads to underestimation of the attack rate. Furthermore, early treatment could prevent identification of self-limited infection and lead to an over-estimation of the clinical attack rate. Notably, the study population (healthy adult volunteers with no known previous exposure to typhoid infection) is not wholly representative of the populations where typhoid fever is endemic and Vi-TT might eventually be deployed. Nevertheless, immunogenicity in children immunised from 2 months of age,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> antibody persistence up to 8 years following vaccination,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> detection of higher avidity Vi-antibody,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and boosting of antibody titres with re-vaccination 2 years after priming<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> have all been shown using different TCVs in high-burden settings and contrast with findings for Vi-PS. Limitations of the currently available typhoid vaccines, in particular the absence of a licensed vaccine for children younger than 2 years of age, have contributed to the poor adoption of typhoid immunisation programmes in endemic settings despite a WHO recommendation in 2008 supporting their use. Further efficacy data from phase 3 studies in this young age group, in addition to cost-effectiveness studies and the assessment of direct versus indirect protection, will support the introduction of TCVs. For now, the efficacy results from our challenge study can be combined with the growing body of immunological evidence supporting the use of TCVs, and can be considered by both key decision makers and adopting countries when evaluating the future use of TCVs in typhoid endemic regions.</p><p id="para440">Typhoid vaccine candidates have been evaluated using experimental human challenge studies since the 1960s<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and have successfully supported the development of one of the currently licensed typhoid vaccines, Ty21a.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> 60 years on, we have used a controlled human infection model of typhoid fever to show that a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and prevents at least 55% of typhoid fever cases, though calculations of vaccine efficacy within the confines of a stringent challenge model are likely to be conservative estimates. This human challenge study provides further evidence to support the deployment of Vi-conjugate vaccines as a control measure to reduce the burden of typhoid fever because those individuals living in endemic regions should not be made to wait another 60 years.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mogasale</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Maskery</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ochiai</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Burden of typhoid fever in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic, literature-based update with risk-factor adjustment</article-title><source>Lancet Glob Heal</source><volume>2</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>e570</fpage><lpage>e580</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buckle</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>CLF</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever: systematic review to estimate global morbidity and mortality for 2010</article-title><source>J Glob Health</source><volume>2</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>10401</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Britto</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Voysey</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Blohmke</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An appraisal of the clinical features of paediatric enteric fever including a systematic review and meta-analysis of the age stratified disease occurence</article-title><source>Clin Infect Dis</source><year>2017</year><comment>published online March 27.</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix229" id="interrefs50">DOI:10.1093/cid/cix229</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crump</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Luby</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Mintz</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of typhoid fever</article-title><source>Bull World Health Organ</source><volume>82</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>346</fpage><lpage>353</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15298225</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Lanata</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Precise estimation of the numbers of chronic carriers of <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> in Santiago, Chile, an endemic area</article-title><source>J Infect Dis</source><volume>146</volume><year>1982</year><fpage>724</fpage><lpage>726</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7142746</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref60"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Shrestha</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Gautam</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bloodstream infection among children presenting to a general hospital outpatient clinic in urban Nepal</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><volume>7</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>e47531</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23115652</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref70"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Okeke</surname><given-names>IN</given-names></name><name><surname>Laxminarayan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhutta</surname><given-names>ZA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
