We used a two-center randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design. The participants followed a standard treatment (ST), which included the combination of a low-calorie diet achieved through creating a daily calorie deficit (500 cal) and an increased daily physical activity (7 MET-h/week). They were randomized to receive standard treatment plus placebo (ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL) or standard treatment plus polyglucosamine (ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG), respectively. Participants were instructed to take 2 &#x000d7; 2 tablets before the two meals containing the highest fat content for at least 24&#x000a0;weeks. Body weight, BMI, waist circumference and the time needed for a 5&#x000a0;% body weight reduction (5R) were taken as main variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average weight loss over a period of 25&#x000a0;weeks in the ITT population was 5.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.09&#x000a0;kg in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG group versus 4.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.94&#x000a0;kg in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL (pU&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023; pt&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010).

Both events have a tremendous impact on quality of life and are associated with numerous comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and certain cancers.</p><p>The financial implication of these conditions is a cause for concern since both direct and indirect costs of illness, care and rehabilitation services will only grow larger over time. Measures must be taken to reverse this upward trend and as yet, no gold standard has been established for the treatment of overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A guideline enabling practitioners and patients to make decisions about appropriate treatment and healthcare for specific clinical conditions as well as taking into account their personal circumstances, has been compiled by different professional associations in Europe as well as in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, medicines granted the marketing authorisation by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) but have failed to meet the expectations in their practical application will be withdrawn from the market. As a result of the increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal events, they recommended the suspension of marketing authorisations for sibutramin and rimonabant across the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, orlistat is the only prescription medicine available on the European market.</p><p>Some food and food supplements promise rapid and effective weight loss in a relatively short period of time without having to implement dietary and lifestyle changes or additional physical activities.</p><p>However, weight management incorporating the use of a medical device generally recommends implementing healthy eating habits and making other lifestyle changes.</p><p>In order to promote compliance and enhance the effects of the standard treatment, some therapists recommend the use of the medical device polyglucosamine (PG). This product works chemo-physically by binding to fat in the intestinal lumen to form a complex partially used by colonic bacteria as fuel and the remaining mass is eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result, the absorption of fat is inhibited and thereby impairs the absorption of energy through dietary fat restriction.</p><p>This clinical study was conducted to assess the efficacy of PG against placebo. Patients also made changes in behavior patterns such as establishing healthy eating and exercise habits in addition to taking the investigational product.</p><p>The evidence-based guideline &#x0201c;Prevention and Treatment of Obesity&#x0201d; recommends making dietary changes in terms of consuming a mildly hypocaloric diet providing a daily energy deficit of around 500&#x000a0;kcal which contains approximately 30&#x000a0;% of fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, the guideline in the current study was modified to include the additional intake of PG or placebo and an increased intake of dietary fat from 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;g per day to 60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;g per day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted in two centers according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and in accordance with the requirements of the Directive 92/43/EEC and DIN EN ISO 14155-1 and in conformance with the provisions in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Federal Data Protection Act/Italian Personal Data Protection Code including other applicable laws, regulations, mandatory standards and commendations were also taken into consideration.</p><p>The patients were randomized to receive in addition to standard treatment (ST) either PG or placebo, 2 x 2 tablets before the daily meals containing the highest fat content.</p><p>The trial protocol was submitted to the relevant Ethics Committee of the State Chambers of Physicians in Frankfurt, Germany for evaluation, consideration and review and given a favorable opinion before the study began.</p><p>In Italy, the trial protocol was sent for approval to the Comune di Rende.

Patients undergoing treatment for chronic cardiovascular diseases were accepted, provided no modification of the type of medication and dosage regimen were undertaken during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatments</title><p>Each patient took 2 tablets of placebo or 850&#x000a0;mg of PG twice daily before the two meals containing the highest fat content.</p><p>PG consists of the combination of a 125&#x02013;145 kD chitosan (low molecular weight chitosan or LMWC) with ascorbic acid and tartaric acid. The combination of these substances forms a linear polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that is defined as PG. Due to the fat binding capacity of the product, patients were instructed to take lipophilic medications of at least four hours apart. As a preventive measure, at least one meal should be taken with high-quality oils (extra virgin) and fats to provide the body with fat-soluble vitamins as well as essential fatty acids.</p><p>When the study started, weekly counseling and physical activity sessions were provided to the patients to achieve an average 6&#x02013;7 MET-h/week (daily cycling, aerobic dance, Nordic walking or swimming 2&#x02013;3 times a week). They also received a CD with information about instructions regarding daily physical activity.</p><p>In order to achieve an energy deficit of 500&#x000a0;kcal/day, all patients were advised to reduce their dietary fat intake by making changes to their diet according to the requirements and recommended guidelines for foods to be reduced or avoided.</p><p>Treatment began immediately after the enrollment and each subject received 3 packs of 48 tablets (about 36&#x000a0;days of treatment).

At a significance level of 5&#x000a0;% with a statistical power of 80&#x000a0;%, 18 patients were required in each group as determined by the Mann-Whitney-test according to the study protocol. Considering a dropout rate of up to 20&#x000a0;%, the enrollment target in each center was fixed to at least 23 cases / treatment group.

During the study period, patients received similar intervention using the standard treatment recommended by the associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The main components of this lifestyle intervention included making dietary changes according to the evidence-based guidelines (level 1 nutritional interventions) in combination with increased physical activity. The PG group had a statistically significant greater weight loss than group ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL.</p><p>Weight loss and mild short-term adverse effects not requiring medical attention in both groups, confirmed the success of this treatment. This outcome allows a population projection.</p><p>The possible amount of weight loss that may be achieved over a period of six months through an evidence level 1 nutritional intervention was between 3.2 and 4.3&#x000a0;kg. This conclusion made by the experts of the associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] is similar to the data obtained from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, an external validity of the data and findings of this study is ensured, since the result achieved showed that in the ITT population the placebo group experienced a weight loss of 4.0&#x000a0;kg (CI: 3.2&#x02013;4.9). The average body weight loss of an additional 1.8&#x000a0;kg obtained in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG group (weight loss of 5.8&#x000a0;kg, CI: 4.7&#x02013;7.0) is therefore attributable to the mechanism of action of PG.</p><p>Compare BMI ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG 2.14&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (CI: 1.72&#x02013;2.54) versus ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL 1.43&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (CI: 1.13 &#x02013; 1.74).</p><p>Compared to the 24-week clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], weight loss achieved in this study is particularly pronounced. The existing differences are explicable both in terms of types of chitosan and methodology.</p><p>There is no doubt that chitosans behave differently from the experimental and clinical point of view, depending on both the molecular weight and the combination with organic acids in their formulations.</p><p>PG is a low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) in a fixed combination with organic acids added to avoid the polymer chain entanglement, which tends to hide the positive charges of the glucosamine moieties. The main characteristic of PG is the linearity of the polymer composition that allows a more efficient fat binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This fat binding capacity allows lipids to reach the lower intestine where they can be used by bacteria as fuel. For this reason, the amount of fat detectable in feces will not be in the form of a steatorrhea. This observation has led some authors to claim that chitosan does not have the ability to significantly bind fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The experimental evidence that chitosans are a large family of compounds that can differ in their chemical and physical properties is an old finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and that the fat binding capacity can be enhanced by the combination of chitosan with ascorbic acid is even an older one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, most of the time, both concepts have been completely ignored despite the possibility that they could be variables that may improve the clinical activity of a given compound or formula.</p><p>In clinical trials conducted in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and in recent experimental studies, the main characteristics of chitosan have not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the meta-analysis conducted by Jull et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in 2009, most of the trials did not even mention the chemico-physical specifications of chitosan.</p><p>The results of the present study are similar to those of the authors treating overweight subjects with PG, in combination with light physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The outcome demonstrated a reduction in body weight, waist circumference and also in the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.</p><p>In the first 50&#x000a0;days of ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG treatment, 42.2&#x000a0;% of the subjects showed a 5&#x000a0;% body weight loss compared with 9.2&#x000a0;% in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL group.</p><p>Achieving the goal of the clinical trial within a short period of time is a good incentive for maintenance of body weight since it motivates the patients to continue with the treatment schedule and increases the patients&#x02019; confidence in their ability to manage their body weight. This aspect is important because it encourages the patients to persevere with treatment and achieve better results.</p><p>In the current clinical trial the daily fat restriction was limited to 80&#x000a0;g instead of the usual 60&#x000a0;g. Long-term fat restriction of twenty grams more per day (limiting intake to 60&#x000a0;g) can be frustrating.</p><p>A positive effect was the association between PG and a less severe dietary fat restriction, which helped to maintain continuation of participation in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG group.</p><p>Despite an increase in daily fat consumption between 40&#x02013;60 and 60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;g, the combined effect of ST and PG with a high fat-binding capacity led to an equally rapid and satisfactory weight loss.</p><p>One further aspect that needs to be considered in relation to the PG treatment concerns the evidence that almost 85&#x000a0;% of the results was obtained between 8 and 9 weeks with an evident progressive reduction of the body weight from 1 to 10&#x000a0;weeks. This suggests that in case PG does not produce a consistent activity (5&#x000a0;% body weight reduction) in the first two months of treatment, the patient has to be considered &#x0201c;not sensitive&#x0201d; and the intervention with PG will lose its cost-effectiveness ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The patients that obtained the 5R cut-off with PG after 9&#x000a0;weeks of treatment were three times more than those without (27 versus 9 subjects) and a consistent difference was maintained between the two groups until the end of the trial; 34 participants achieved 5R in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG group (64.1&#x000a0;%) compared to only 23 participants in the ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL group (42.6&#x000a0;%) (ITT) (p Fisher&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033).</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>%</term><def><p>Percent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5R</term><def><p>A body weight reduction of at least 5&#x000a0;% of the initial body weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDSG</term><def><p>German Federal Data Protection Act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body Mass Index/kg/m<sup>2</sup></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cm</term><def><p>Centimeter (metric system)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>g</term><def><p>Gram (metric system)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Kcal</term><def><p>Kilocalories</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kD</term><def><p>Kilodalton</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kg</term><def><p>Kilogram (metric system)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMWC</term><def><p>Low molecular weight chitosan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Monitoraggio Alimenti e Patologie</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET-h</term><def><p>Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) per hour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PG</term><def><p>Polyglucosamine (&#x000df;-1,4-polymer of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Severe Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Average (Standard Deviation)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ST</term><def><p>Standard treatment, recommended hypo-caloric diet, (&#x02212;500&#x000a0;kcal) plus additional physical exercises</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PG</term><def><p>Standard treatment plus polyglucosamine-tablets</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ST&#x02009;+&#x02009;PL</term><def><p>Standard treatment plus placebo-tablets</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>KP Participated in the design of the study and was responsible for the conduct of the study in Germany and drafted the manuscript.
