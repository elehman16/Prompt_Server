The neuropeptide oxytocin is known to promote maternal behavior and its reduction has been associated with postpartum depression risk and child neglect. Contrariwise, the observed decrease in testosterone level during early parenthood may benefit caretaking behavior, whereas increased testosterone may reduce attention to infants. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the interactive influence of testosterone and oxytocin on selective attention to and neural processing of the baby schema (BS). 57 nulliparous women performed a target detection task with human faces with varying degree of BS following double-blinded placebo-controlled oxytocin administration in a between-subjects design. Our results support the idea that oxytocin enhances attention to the BS. Oxytocin had a positive effect on activation of the inferior frontal junction during identification of infant targets with a high degree of BS that were presented among adult distractors. Further, activation of the putamen was positively correlated with selective attention to the BS, but only in women with high endogenous testosterone who received oxytocin. These findings provide initial evidence for the neural mechanism by which oxytocin may counteract the negative effects of testosterone in the modulation of nurturing behavior.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The survival of the offspring is crucial for one&#x02019;s reproductive success. Newborns may therefore carry specific features that act as key stimulus, which automatically captures attention and motivates actions such as caretaking. The baby schema (BS) is such a key stimulus. In the infant face it is defined as a combination of child characteristic features like big eyes, small nose, chubby cheeks, and higher forehead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Humans bear high costs in raising their offspring, because pregnancy and production of maternal milk are energetically expensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which should make newborns highly relevant, at least for mothers. But since humans practice alloparental care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and the BS is further known to be a universally relevant stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> the BS should be highly significant for women in general. The increased cuteness of infant faces in comparison to adults may therefore prioritize selective attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and may enhance evaluation of these stimuli as socially relevant for actions like caretaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">There is already evidence for an adaptive neural mechanism through which the perception of cuteness as a feature of the BS is most likely promoted in humans. Accordingly, cute baby faces have repeatedly yielded activations of regions of the mesolimbic reward system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, Glocker <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> observed an increase of activation in the nucleus accumbens in women while evaluating pictures of babies with increasing BS (i.e., low BS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;unmanipulated BS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;high BS). Interestingly, the mesolimbic reward system may also be highly responsive to the influence of two hormones that have opposing roles in human nurturing behaviors. Firstly, a high oxytocin (OT) receptor density can be found in the mesolimbic reward system of social mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and increased activation of the ventral tegmental area to images of crying infants after OT treatment suggested that OT influences the reward value of stimuli carrying the BS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Further, OT administration increased the preference for pictures of young children. This preference was determined through rs53576G homozygote participants (a polymorphism in the OT receptor gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Finally, OT has been consistently associated with higher maternal attachment and increased caretaking in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The androgen testosterone (T) may also have reinforcing effects in the mesolimbic reward system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Yet, in contrast to OT it may compromise behaviors associated with maternal care (e.g. nurturing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Previous studies have noted a reduced T level during early parenthood and this decline appeared to be associated with the quality of childcare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par4">However, the interactive influence of T and OT on neural processing of the BS currently remains elusive. Only a few behavioral studies have so far assessed their combined influence on aspects of nurturing behaviors. In the context of paternal caretaking behavior Weisman and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> found that OT administration led to an unexpected short-term alteration of endogenous T, whereby nurturing behaviors like social gaze also increased. Given that women are the main caretakers during the first months after childbirth when infants depend on maternal milk, and yet sometimes show impairments like postpartum depression or child neglect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, it is of crucial importance to take a closer look on these interactive influences in women as well. In nulliparous women a higher endogenous T reduced selective attention to infant targets in the context of adult distractors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, attention to infant stimuli increased after OT administration, but only in women with high endogenous T. This suggests that OT may oppose the negative effects of T on nurturing behavior in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. There are already some indications on the behavioral level that T and OT may have gender-specific impacts on parental behavior. Gordon and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> found that high T levels in fathers negatively influenced the association between OT and paternal behavior, whereas in mothers high T levels evoked positive associations. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying the effect of the OT by T interaction on selective attention to infants in general and the highly relevant key stimulus BS in particular remains elusive.</p><p id="Par5">In order to further our understanding of the nature of hormonal interactions in nurturing behavior, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a double-blind placebo-controlled OT administration between-subjects protocol to examine the influence of exogenous OT and endogenous T on selective attention to the BS in nulliparous women. To assess selective attention to the BS we used an implicit association task. Implicit association tasks have the advantage that the degree of attentional capture by an infant as opposed to an adult face can be determined implicitly by the mean reaction time (RT) of the participant, with a shorter RT indicating faster attentional processing of the baby schema and increased action. Previous neuroimaging studies combined passive viewing and explicit evaluation tasks (e.g., cuteness perception on a Likert-Scale), which are more vulnerable to experimenter demand effect. Further, these studies do not allow the assessment of the mechanism that promotes faster reactions to infants. Building on previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> we hypothesized that OT administration would compensate the negative effects of high endogenous T on attentional processing of the BS, probably through the modulation of activation in key nodes of the mesolimbic reward system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioral data</title><p id="Par6">The influence of the endogenous T concentration (measured out of one saliva sample that was collected directly before administration) on attention to babies was analyzed with a 3 (morph type: low BS, natural BS and high BS)&#x02009;&#x000d7; 2 (treatment: OT vs. placebo)&#x02009;&#x000d7; 2 (T: median split of the sample that was collected directly before administration) ANOVA.

Additionally, we found a positive correlation between selective attention to babies, as indicated by increasing Delta-RTs, and increased activation in the left putamen following OT treatment. Interestingly, this correlation was specific for women with high endogenous T. Collectively, these findings may provide a hint to the neural mechanism by which OT may support the sensitivity for the BS and may counteract the negative effects of T in the modulation of nurturing behavior.</p><p id="Par12">Based on our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> we expected that OT administration would modulate attention to infant faces especially in women with high endogenous T. In line with this hypothesis, we found an interaction between the degree of BS, the treatment group and endogenous T level. OT-treated women with high endogenous T showed an attentional bias towards babies (positive Delta-RTs) compared to OT-treated women with low endogenous T (negative Delta-RTs), but only for the natural BS and this result remained on statistical trend level. We could not find further differences in the attention to babies between high and low endogenous T concentrations in the OT group, but the Delta RTs of the conditions with lower and higher BS were positive in both T groups. We suppose that adult pictures could also represent salient stimuli for nulliparous women in reproductive age, which may have rendered any behavioral effects rather small (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> for review). Yet, the presence of a statistical trend in the OT-treated women with high endogenous T may conform to the idea that a system influenced by high levels of T may be more receptive to OT treatment, because in the female brain T could be directly converted into estradiol and thus modulate OT receptor density, which has been demonstrated in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">We found a positive effect of treatment (OT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;placebo) on processing of targets with higher BS in the left IFJ.

Recent research further demonstrated its specific involvement in the control of selective visual attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, action perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and the detection of behaviorally salient cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, the IFJ has been associated with the understanding of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, which may be considered as one basis of social cognition and empathy. Previous studies also detected increased activation during processing of infant faces in areas near our IFJ cluster.

Finally, the IFG has also been related to OT- induced emotional empathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In our study, the activation of the IFJ was limited to babies with a high BS. Previous observations indicating that babies with stronger BS were treated preferentially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and perceived as cuter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> provide some space for speculation, that the stronger BS could provoke an increased motivation to act. The findings of Glocker <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> who also found activation in the precentral gyrus (MNI coordinates: &#x02212;42&#x000a0;0&#x000a0;29; &#x02212;46&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;33; &#x02212;51&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;36) across the three BS conditions, which was located near our cluster, could also provide indications for this speculation. Yet, it is difficult to distinguish between participants who searched for the target or avoided the distractors, which makes it difficult to interpret the difference between the OT group (positive parameter estimates) and the placebo group (negative parameter estimates). This would be of great interest and should be taken into account in a future study.</p><p id="Par14">Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between activity in the left putamen and increased selective attention to babies in OT-treated women. The putamen belongs to the mesolimbic reward system and is part of the striatum. Equivalent to many other studies the detected activation appeared only in participants that were treated with OT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We suppose that this finding supports the idea that OT increases the reward value of babies, probably as an adaptation to motivate caretaking behavior through mesolimbic-reward pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This assessment is also supported by previous reports that have demonstrated OT-dependent activations in areas of the reward system as consequence of listening to crying babies (amygdala and insula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>), to laughing babies (amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>) and processing of child pictures (globus pallidus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). Yet, the OT-related response in the putamen did not parametrically change with the amount of BS inherent to the presented pictures. This indicates a rather general mechanism that may ensure reflexive attention to babies regardless of their cuteness.</p><p id="Par15">Even more importantly, the positive correlation between increased selective attention to babies and activation in the left putamen only remained significant in the high endogenous T group after OT administration. Only a few behavioral studies have so far examined the interactions between OT and T in women, and, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that used functional neuroimaging to assess the underlying neural mechanism. Here we used the T sample that was collected directly before administration to capture the current T state of the participant and not the habitual concentration, because we could not control for daytime fluctuations. This method also allows the comparability with previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The single T sample collection before administration provided the opportunity to analyze the real-time T concentration at the measuring time. But, for the same reasons, we cannot exclude further T fluctuations that might have occurred during scanning, which may have weakened the stability of this single measurement and might therefore constitute a potential limitation of this study. However, the T concentration before administration and post-test concentration after measurement were highly correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.447; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). This may suggest that T concentration may have been relatively stable during the actual scanning period.</p><p id="Par16">The present study shows that the reward system may be involved in this attentional bias towards babies. Little is known about the precise interaction of OT and T in the brain. In the female brain the majority of T may be converted to estradiol via aromatase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and estradiol can increase the number of OT receptors in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Yet, the observation of higher systemic T concentrations in women may indicate an impaired ability to convert it to estradiol, thus either leaving a higher amount of T in the circuitry that may counteract maternal behavior through an unknown mechanism or by leaving the number of OT receptors unaffected by reduced influence of estradiol. In a similar vein one may speculate that high OT concentrations may serve as a compensatory mechanism for high T concentrations, we presume that women with low T concentrations were less sensitive to OT administration, because low T concentrations should support nurturing behavior per se<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This would indeed explain why we could not find any activation in the brain reward system in women with low endogenous T after OT administration. But since babies nevertheless remain a strong social cue, this does not explain why neither in the low T nor in the placebo group the baby pictures were rewarding by themselves. We suppose that the young adult stimuli may also be socially salient for young participants, for instance as potential mates, and therefore could be equally rewarding and evoke similar activation in the brain reward system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our experimental design does not allow the isolation of the response to adult or infant faces, since pictures were always presented in combination, but only enables the identification of activational differences during processing of these stimuli. So we cannot answer this question. However, for reasons discussed before we presume that the brain of women with a high endogenous T concentration may be more sensitive to OT administration than women with a low endogenous T. One could therefore speculate that same age adult stimuli as well as infant pictures both constitute a strong social stimulus, but OT could function as an enhancer of reproductive behavior and direct attention towards infant stimuli in women with high T level, who may be more sensitive to OT. In this study, we focused on nulliparous women that reacted to unfamiliar infant or adult stimuli to investigate the neuroendocrine basics of the key stimulus in general. As oxytocin is especially known to influence attachment behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> it could be of great interest to use the same paradigm with familiar infants in further research. The results of this study are therefore limited to the general mechanism of the key stimulus BS and are not necessarily transferable to attachment behavior in mothers or other caretakers. Gordon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> found a positive interaction between increased T levels and OT on maternal touch in mothers, while the effect in fathers was in the opposite direction. Their results may indicate that the interaction between T and OT may be sexually dimorphic. Therefore, our results on nulliparous women may resemble those in mothers but it is possible that they deviate to the results in fathers and men who have never sired a child. Although the findings of Gordon and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> were focused on parents, we assume that the results in mothers support our previous findings that OT seemed to promote adult-infant discrimination and increased attention to baby pictures, but only in women with high endogenous T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. OT is a peptide hormone that is critically involved in mother-infant attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Especially lactating mothers show increased OT levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The artificial increase through intranasal administration could be closely related to the concentration found in new mothers (see Weisman <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> for the active drug effects reflected in saliva). Although there already exists excellent research about the active drug effects and reflection in saliva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, a direct comparison of mothers and non-mothers salivary OT concentration with and without OT administration would be of great interest. But yet, aside from oxytocin, postpartum hormonal changes have large transitions which makes the results of nulliparous women not necessarily comparable with mothers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The detected activations in the putamen correspond well with the literature and accentuate the previous research on oxytocin and maternal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Since we know very little about the interactions of T and OT in the female brain, we abstained from using an <italic>a priori</italic> region-of-interest approach and analyzed our data on whole brain level. However, findings in the IFJ are not common in the context of OT administration studies and in an <italic>a priori</italic> region-of-interest approach the IFJ would have probably not been included. This might limit the interpretation of this finding, although the activation of the IFJ survived the correction for multiple testing on a whole-brain basis. Future studies will therefore be necessary to show if this finding can be replicated in this context.</p><p id="Par18">All of the participating women used hormonal contraceptives and were tested in the pill-phase. This was done to control for a potential pregnancy and to prevent cyclic changes in steroid hormone levels. But it&#x02019;s important to note that previous research showed that the intake of oral contraceptives increased performance in affective responsiveness and that affective responsiveness was positively influenced by oral contraceptives (pill-intake phase versus pill-free week)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Further, testosterone in females on oral contraceptives may be downregulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, using participants on hormonal contraceptives for an OT-intervention study may not represent the ideal model to detect OT sensitivity, that may be modulated by T. Yet, ethical concerns (increased pregnancy risk in women with a natural cycle), the fact that T level fluctuates across the natural cycle (e.g., rises during the first half), as well as our previous results in women on oral contraceptives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, led to our decision to test only women who received hormonal contraception in this between-subjects fMRI design. As a future direction, it would be of great interest to further examine normal cycling women and the influence of the intake of oral contraceptives on the recent results.</p><p id="Par19">Collectively, the present findings support the idea of an adaptive hormonal mechanism that promotes selective attention to babies. Here, we demonstrate that an increased BS was associated with enhanced activation of the IFJ after OT treatment, a brain region implicated in cognitive control and the motivation to act. We also found that OT may modulate selective attention to babies through the recruitment of the reward system. We found a positive correlation between activity in the putamen and attention to baby faces. However, after accounting for endogenous T level, this correlation only remained significant in women with a high T concentration. These results are consistent with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and may indicate that OT possibly compensates high T concentrations and the reduced attention to infant stimuli through an enhancement of the reward value of babies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par20">Sixty nulliparous female university students (mean age&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.08 years) participated in the study.
