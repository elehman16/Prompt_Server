These trials<xref rid="pone.0041297-The1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041297-Malekzadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> showed significant reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol, but estimates of the magnitude of the effects varied, and were lower than those expected from previous research. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> There are several reasons for this. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> The four previous Polypill trials underestimated efficacy because of poor adherence to treatment in the treated group or unscheduled treatment in the control group. In two trials the proportion of participants who stopped taking their treatment was 16% <xref rid="pone.0041297-The1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and 23% <xref rid="pone.0041297-PILL1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; in a third trial 30&#x02013;35% were reported as not having taken their allocated pills <xref rid="pone.0041297-Soliman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; in the fourth trial <xref rid="pone.0041297-Malekzadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> more than 68% of controls took the Polypill components and the authors acknowledged that the trial could not estimate the risk factor reduction on the Polypill used. All four previous trials used a parallel group design in which participants who either stopped taking their treatment or took additional treatment needed to be included in an intention-to-treat analysis to avoid selection bias but at the cost of underestimating efficacy.</p><p>The uncertainty over the true efficacy prompted us to conduct a trial of a Polypill, intended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people selected only on the basis of age (50 years and over). This Polypill consisted of three blood pressure lowering agents (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg), all at half standard doses and simvastatin 40 mg (standard dose). We used a randomized crossover design to avoid the under-estimation of the risk factor reduction that may have occurred in the previous trials.<xref rid="pone.0041297-The1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041297-Malekzadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> The aim of the study was to quantify the effect of this Polypill on blood pressure and serum LDL cholesterol and to compare the observed effects with those previously predicted. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethics Committee approval was obtained from the North London Research Ethics Committee 1 and a clinical trials authorization obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN Register (ISRCTN36672232).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Trial Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial of the Polypill described above, manufactured for the study group by Cipla, India. To help achieve high adherence during the trial, participants were recruited from individuals already taking simvastatin and blood pressure lowering drugs as part of a cardiovascular disease prevention programme. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Individuals were eligible to participate in the programme and, therefore, also the trial if they were aged 50 or over without an upper age limit, had no self reported history of cardiovascular disease, and were not taking drugs contraindicated with the Polypill components. Participants were not selected based on blood pressure or cholesterol measurements. Recruitment to the trial was limited to people who lived in London or could easily travel to London, where the trial was conducted. Written consent was obtained from the participants.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041297-g001">Figure 1</xref> is a flow chart of the trial. Trial participants took the Polypill (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) for 12 weeks, and an identical placebo for 12 weeks, the sequence being allocated at random. Neither the participants nor the investigators knew the sequence (ie. &#x0201c;double-blind&#x0201d;). Study treatment was taken once a day in the evening because of the greater efficacy of simvastatin when taken in the evening than in the morning. Existing blood pressure and cholesterol lowering treatments were discontinued at randomisation and no participant received additional blood pressure or cholesterol lowering treatment during the study. The randomization sequence was generated in advance by a computer random number generator, in blocks of 4. Date of birth, height, weight, and sex were recorded at randomization.</p><fig id="pone-0041297-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0041297.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of crossover trial.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0041297.g001"/></fig><p>Blood pressure and lipid measurements were taken at the end of each 12 week period (usually between 10am and 2pm). Twelve weeks on the placebo was judged sufficient time for the drugs in the Polypill to have &#x0201c;washed out&#x0201d;, avoiding any carry-over effects because it has been shown that LDL cholesterol returns to pre-treatment levels within 4 weeks of stopping statin treatment <xref rid="pone.0041297-Cilla1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and it is standard practice to allow the same time period for blood pressure lowering treatment. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Mulatero1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Blood pressure was measured, seated, after five minutes rest, with an automated sphygmomanometer (Omron, model 705IT, Kyoto, Japan); the average of two measurements, taken from the same arm, five minutes apart, was used. Venous blood samples were refrigerated, spun within 2 hours of collection and analysed within 6 hours in the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, London. Direct quantitative determinations of serum lipids were performed, using a Beckman Coulter Synchron analyser, to avoid the need for fasting.</p><p>The trial was not designed to assess side-effects of the Polypill but, as a safety measure, at the end of each 12-week treatment period participants completed a questionnaire on recognized side-effects of the component medications (cough, muscle ache or pain, ankle swelling, flushing, rash, tongue and lip swelling) and answered an open question on any other symptoms that might be attributable to the study medication. Adherence was assessed by a study investigator counting the remaining pills in each participant&#x02019;s blister pack at the end of each treatment period. At the end of the trial participants continued on the Polypill.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The main statistical analysis was a comparison of the mean within-person absolute and relative differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the five lipid measurements (LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride and ApoB) after taking the polypill compared with after taking the placebo. Paired t-tests were used to calculate statistical significance. Statistical power calculations indicated that 80 participants would provide a greater than 90% power with an alpha level of &#x0003c;0.05 (two tailed) if the LDL cholesterol reduction was at least 1.3 mmol/L (standard deviation 1 mmol/L) and diastolic blood pressure reduction was at least 9 mmHg (standard deviation 6 mmol/L).</p><p>The observed effects of the Polypill were compared with those expected from meta-analyses of the individual components. <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> The cholesterol meta-analysis yielded the estimates that 40 mg simvastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by 37%, a relative reduction that was independent of the pre-treatment LDL cholesterol value, while the absolute cholesterol reduction (in mmol/L) increased with pre-treatment level. The blood pressure meta-analysis showed that the three blood pressure lowering drugs used in our Polypill would lower blood pressure by 19.9 mmHg systolic and 10.7 diastolic from pre-treatment values of 150 mmHg, and 90 mmHg, respectively, and published regression equations <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were used to predict the reductions from lower pre-treatment blood pressure levels.

Our results show that the original predictions were accurate and not overestimated as has been suggested.<xref rid="pone.0041297-The1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-VanGils1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Our trial has important strengths. The crossover design, with each participant being his or her own control, has the advantage of providing more precise and accurate estimates of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering effects with many fewer participants than would be needed using a parallel group design to achieve the same level of precision and, unlike a parallel group trial, participants who discontinue treatment can be excluded without introducing bias (two participants in our trial). A parallel group trial design would require four to five times as many participants to yield results with the same level of precision assuming 100% adherence to the allocated treatment, which is rarely achievable in practice with such a design. In our trial we achieved high adherence by recruiting participants already taking Polypill components. However, achieving a high adherence to treatment in this way means that the trial also has two limitations. First, the observed adherence rate cannot be used to estimate adherence in the general population. Second, the results on tolerability cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of side effects in people who have not previously taken Polypill components. In spite of this, the results revealed an increased prevalence of muscle ache associated with statin use that was not severe enough to stop treatment. Previous work has estimated side effect rates. In one study 7% of individuals did not tolerate one or more of the drugs used in our Polypill <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (1.25 mg bendrofluazide used instead of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide); about half of this 7% needed modification of the regimen (4%) and half (3%) stopped treatment.</p><p>The Polypill we used excluded folic acid and aspirin. Folic acid was excluded because obtaining regulatory approval for a Polypill that included folic acid was judged to be uncertain given the lack of proven efficacy in clinical trials. Aspirin was excluded because the risk of bleeding in people without existing cardiovascular disease might be unacceptable in relation to the expected benefit although recent work indicating a protective effect against cancer may alter this assessment.<xref rid="pone.0041297-Rothwell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald6" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Given the composition of the Polypill we used, and the observed LDL cholesterol and blood pressure reductions, the predicted effect in reducing ischaemic heart disease events is 72% and in reducing stroke is 64% based on evidence of the quantitative relationship between the two risk factors and risk.<xref rid="pone.0041297-Wald2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041297-Law4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041297-Cholesterol1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> This Polypill, designed principally for primary prevention, therefore has considerable potential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0041297.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
