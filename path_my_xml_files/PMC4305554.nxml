rehabilitational sliding machine and conventional neurological physical therapy on the
balance of stroke patients. [Subjects] Forty patients with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke were divided into a rehabilitational sliding machine exercise group (ST group,
n=20) and a conventional neurological physiotherapy group (C group, n=20). [Methods] The
STG underwent training with a rehabilitation sliding machine for 30 minutes per day, five
times per week for eight weeks. The CG underwent training with a conventional neurological
physiotherapy for 30 minutes per day, five times per week for eight weeks. [Results] The
balance ability of both groups significantly improved. Although there were significant
differences between the groups, the CG showed weight bearing on the affected side, an
anterior range within the stability limits standing, and a posterior range within the
stability limits standing. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that
conventional neurological physiotherapy is a more dedicated, effective intervention than
rehabilitational sliding training methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitational sliding machine training</kwd><kwd>Conventional neurological physical therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a very serious disease and is accompanied by motor disturbance, sensory
disturbance, perceptual disturbance, language disturbance, cognitive disorder, and urinary
incontinence according to the area of the brain lesions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia is commonly
associated with a decrease in balance ability. The balance of stroke is an important factor
that can impede standing or gait, and their postural sway is twice as high as that of
healthy people in their age range<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
limit of stability (LOS) of stroke patients is defined as a decrease in the maximal distance
to the center of gravity while maintaining balance without detaching the feet from the
ground<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the rehabilitation treatment methods for stroke patients, exercise is essential for
functional recovery. There are many conventional treatments, such as neurodevelopmental
treatment and sensory stimulation, which are designed to make patients shift their weight to
the affected side. Currently, the exercise treatment that makes patients conduct diverse
functions by stimulating normal exercise modes is performed in physical therapy rooms, and
exercise treatment programs include a range of motion exercises, extension exercises, and
muscle strengthening exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
a lot of equipment is available to improve the functions of stroke patients. In order to
improve the muscle strength of the lower extremities of stroke patients, weight
equipment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, elastic bands<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and isometric equipment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> have been employed. Using a tilt table
composed of a rail system and a carriage with wheels, Trees et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> applied a weight load exercise to four patients with burns
who had difficulty with weight load training in a standing position. They reported
improvement in lower extremity muscle strength of the patuents. Byun et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> applied a rehabilitational sliding machine
to the treatment of patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke and reported that their
muscle strength, spasticity, gait ability, balance ability, and daily activities
improved.</p><p>Therefore, many treatment methods for reduction of problematic factors and improvement of
balance and gait ability have been studied and developed. There are diverse methods for
treatment of patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke, and although many efforts have
been made to improve the effect of each treatment method, research has not shown whether one
treatment method is superior to others<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Few studies have applied and compared treatment method using different equipment and
existing neurological rehabilitation exercise. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the
effects of exercises using equipment and one-on-one therapeutic exercises in stroke patient
therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUBJECT AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from stroke
by a rehabilitation doctor practicing at N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a rehabilitational sliding machine training group (STG: 10
males, 10 female) and a conventional neurological physical therapy group (CG: 11 males, 9
female). The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the STG was 51.4&#x000b1;40.6&#x02005;years, 167.0&#x000b1;9.5&#x02005;cm,
and 64.1&#x000b1;13.1&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eleven of the patients had right hemiplegia, and nine had
left hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.8&#x000b1;6.1 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight
of the CG was 50.8&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;years, 165.9&#x000b1;8.6&#x02005;cm, and 63.9&#x000b1;5.2&#x02005;kg, respectively. Nine of the
patients had right hemiplegia, and 11 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 13.4&#x000b1;8.2
months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Korean version of the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). All the subjects
understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The STG underwent training with the rehabilitational sliding machine for 30 minutes per
day, five times per week for eight weeks. We used a rehabilitational sliding machine. This
machine had a rail system, a patient-supporting carriage, a footplate that moved up and
down, and a leg elevation device that was connected to the patient support carriage. The
footplate could be moved up and down to change the maximal angle of knee flexion. The
goniometer showed the degree of inclination of the sliding board, and Velcro straps were
fixed to the patient&#x02019;s body and ankles for safety. We fixed the degree of inclination of the
sliding board at 30&#x000b0;<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise
program for the CG was based on a training program proposed by Gjelsvik<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method is widely used for the rehabilitation of
patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke and includes a range of motion exercises,
muscle extension exercises, exercises for hip joint stability, leg joint exercises, knee
joint exercises, bridging exercises, sitting to standing exercises, weight supporting
exercises, and forward walking exercise in a standing position. This experiment was
conducted for 30 minutes, five times per week for a total of eight weeks.</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 BioRescue, RM
lngenierie, Rodez, France) was used to determine weight bearing, anterior range LOS, and
posterior range LOS in the affected side in a static standing position.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS lnc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, a
paired t-test was used to compare the variations in weight bearing on the affected side when
standing, the anterior LOS standing, and the posterior LOS standing. The significance of
differences between the two groups was investigated using an independent t-test. Statistical
significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results for the weight bearing rates on the paretic side in each group were as follows.

one-on-one sit-to-stand exercises focusing on external feedback, such as verbal instruction.
Manual contact with a therapist showed a significant increase in the weight load rate on the
paretic side compared with another group instructed to do sit-to-stand exercises with a
task-oriented approach that focused on internal feedback<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shin et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>
noted that the weight support ability of stroke patients was correlated with functional
performance ability, and moving the weight left or right in a standing position was related
to motor function, an independence in daily life, and the length of time until the patient
returned home. The reason for this was that the ability of the stroke patients to move
weight left or right was directly related to gait. In the present study on weight bearing in
the affected side when standing, the forward and backward movement LOS in a standing
position were compared, and the results showed a significant effect in the CG and
statistically significant differences between the two groups. Gouglidis et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> applied visually induced weight movement
exercises to subjects and found significant differences in stability ranges. In the present
study, visual elements were not used, but an increase in forward and backward movement LOS
in a standing position improved the proprioceptive senses of the patients in the ankle
joints, increasing their balance in the forward and backward movement range. The symmetrical
weight bearing exercise influenced the stability of stance phase and gait. Song<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that convenient neurological
physiotherapy had a greater effect than functional electrical therapy on gait ability for
chronic stroke patients. Ma<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that convenient neurological physiotherapy had a greater effect on the balance ability of
stroke patients.</p><p>According to the results, conservative exercise treatment with verbal instructions from and
manual contact with a therapist resulted in a more significant improvement. The present
study showed that for functional improvement of patients with hemiplegia resulting from a
stroke, factors affecting conservative exercise treatment should be taken into account, such
as the personal characteristics, muscle strength, endurance, senses, proprioceptive senses,
cognition, and motives of the patients. In addition, when exercise treatment is conducted in
a hospital, intervention by a therapist using an instrument that allows individual stroke
patients to adjust their characteristic movement pattern and abnormal tension is considered
necessary during an exercise. A rehabilitational sliding machine can be effectively used to
increase the balance and gait ability of inpatients during free time and at time when they
are not receiving treatment time.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mahabir</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickram</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gulliford</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke in Trinidad and Tobago: burden of illness and risk
