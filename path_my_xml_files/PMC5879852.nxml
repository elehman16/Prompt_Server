It has been observed that many pathophysiological states associated with menstrual dysfunction have an increased incidence in the recent past. Over the years, it has been established that stress and drugs could have a potential to affect the menstrual cycle in various ways.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is defined as a state of abnormal uterine bleeding without any clinically detectable organic, systemic, or iatrogenic cause.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Data from the WHO's multicenter survey report the prevalence of excessive menstrual bleeding ranging from 8% to 27%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] DUB is most common in extremes of the reproductive age. Among women aged 30&#x02013;49 years, one in twenty consults the general practitioner each year with menorrhagia, making DUB one of the most commonly encountered gynecological problems. About 30% of all women report having had menorrhagia, and it accounts for two-thirds of all hysterectomies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The prevalence of the occurrence of DUB is found to be ovular (10%) and anovular or oligo-ovular (90%), the latter being the most common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Among psychological factors, stress is the most imperative factor affecting the menstrual cycle. Stress influences all the body systems through other neurohormonal connections, the hypothalamo&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (H-P-A axis) as well as hypothalamo&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;ovarian axis (H-P-O axis). Studies demonstrate that the glucocorticoids released due to the stress put forth an inhibitory action on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thereby distressing the ovarian function. Elevated levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cortisol also suppress the GnRH secretion and consequently decline ovulation. Thus, stress could significantly diminish reproductive functions in an effort to maintain homeostasis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Previous studies have found that the stress influences the incarcerated women leading to high rates of amenorrhea and menstrual irregularity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Evidence also suggests an association of sleep disturbances and disturbed circadian rhythm with menstrual disorders.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Abnormal uterine bleeding is also associated with loss of health-related quality of life when compared to healthy women with the same age. DUB leads to significant direct and indirect costs as well as loss of productivity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The most common conventional management of DUB involves progestin therapy in varied doses based on the age. Low-dose combination hormonal contraceptive therapy (20&#x02013;35 &#x003bc;g ethinylestradiol) is the mainstay of treatment for adolescents up to the age of 18 years. For women aged 40 years or older, before menopause, the treatment consists of cyclic progestin therapy, low-dose oral contraceptive pills, levonorgestrel intrauterine device, or cyclic hormone therapy. Although these treatments are found to be effective, they do have adverse effects on the overall health of the women. The drawback to medical therapy, in addition to side effects, is that the benefit lasts only while the patient takes the medication. Surgical options have concentrated mainly on endometrial ablation and hysterectomy, and it is unclear whether one is superior to the other in terms of long-term outcome and patient satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>With the advent of adversities with conventional management, patients have started exploring complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for managing DUB.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] According to a survey, CAM therapies are commonly used by women for menstrual disorders to reduce pain and discomfort and yoga is among the top 5. The CAM therapies are found to be safe and known to enhance the quality of life in women.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>It has been demonstrated that regular practice of yoga has beneficial effects on both phases of the menstrual cycle by bringing physical and psychological well-being and by balancing neuro-endocrinal axis.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In India, yoga therapy is commonly recommended for treating various noncommunicable diseases and for overall well-being.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Yogic therapy helps in improving hormonal and biochemical changes related to H-P-O and H-P-A axes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Yoga Nidra is reported to be beneficial in managing the psychological impact of menstrual disorders.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Overall, yoga is known to be beneficial in the general well-being of individuals in health and disease.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reporting the effects of yoga practices on the health status of patients suffering from DUB. Given the vital role of yoga in the management of several disorders relating to women, the current study was executed to ascertain the role of an integrated yoga module in the management of DUB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>The present study was a parallel-arm controlled pilot trial to compare the outcome of participants assigned to experimental (yoga and conventional care) group with that of a wait-listed control (conventional care alone) group.

One participant from each group dropped up during the follow-up period and therefore finally 14 participants in each group were assessed and interpreted. Participants were recruited from the gynecology departments of three leading hospitals in Central India. Participants satisfying the age range of 20&#x02013;50 years and diagnosed for primary DUB with no underlying systemic pathology were included in the study.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin was assessed as a fundamental indicator of blood loss as well as the general health as it signifies the nutritional support for all the systems in the body.

There were no significant changes observed between groups in the hemoglobin, ET, or the PBAC. Although there was a significant increase in hemoglobin in the control group when compared to baseline, the mean postvalue of hemoglobin in the control group remained lower than that of the yoga group. In addition, a mean change of 0.4 g% may not be considered clinically significant. There was no deterioration of hemoglobin levels in the yoga group when compared to baseline. The global scores of PSQI were significantly improved following the practice of yoga and were primarily associated with reduced sleep disturbances and the need for sleep medications.</p><p>The role of yoga in reducing stress is well documented,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and our study concurs with the findings of earlier studies on yoga practices in menstrual disorders. An earlier study comparing the autonomic functions and psychological well-being of females suffering from premenstrual syndrome demonstrated enhanced autonomic functions and psychological well-being following the practice of yoga.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There was evidence of significant reduction of the anxiety score in women suffering from PCOS.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Nidhi <italic>et al</italic>. also demonstrated enhanced hormonal profile in women suffering from PCOS following a 12-week integrated yoga intervention.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Another study compared the practice of Yoga Nidra, a relaxation technique in yoga, practiced for 6 months by the patients suffering from menstrual irregularities with nonpractitioners. The results of this study reported a significant improvement in psychological well-being and general health following the practice of Yoga Nidra.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The current study indicated beneficial effects of yoga practice on sleep in patients with DUB. Earlier studies on yoga show improved sleep quality in different populations.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Improvement in the sleep quality may also play a potential role in the regulation of menstruation, by restoring the overall hormonal balance.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>The role of perceived stress and anxiety in modulating the hormonal status is well documented.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] We postulate that yoga may influence the CRH and corticosteroid levels through reduction of perceived stress and anxiety. These hormones are known to inhibit the GnRH secretion and thereby responsible for the ovarian dysfunction in patients suffering from DUB.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Therefore, IAYT might be useful in reducing the stress and anxiety and thereby balancing the H-P-O and H-P-A axes. The endocrinal profile could be used as a variable in future studies to understand the underlying mechanisms of beneficial effects of yoga in DUB.</p><p>The observations from the current study suggest that there could be an improvement in the hormonal status of the individuals with menstrual disorders due to reduced anxiety, stress, and an improved sleep quality following the practice of yoga.</p><p>We speculate that the trend of improvement observed in the variables of the current study could reach statistical significance with a larger sample size. These results therefore warrant further large-scale trials to establish the efficacy of yoga as a treatment modality for patients with DUB. Yoga, being a cost-effective and easy-to-adapt lifestyle intervention, could be a beneficial tool to complement the conventional therapies involved in managing DUB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Although the current study failed to substantiate the benefits of yoga in the objective variables in patients with DUB, the changes in subjective measures were significant to ascertain the beneficial changes.
