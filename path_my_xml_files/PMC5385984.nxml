safety of care.<sup>(<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> A frequent issue
that these patients experience is the development of pressure ulcers (PUs), which
are usually related to global and local hypoperfusion as well as exposure to
excessive pressure, shearing forces, limited mobility, malnutrition, and other
conditions. Pressure ulcers have also been associated with higher mortality and
decreased quality of life.<sup>(<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> Therefore, the incidence and
severity of PUs have become indicators of the quality of care and safety of patients
in the intensive care unit (ICU).<sup>(<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>Prevalence and incidence studies indicate that PUs are common. Among different
reports, prevalence rates range from 0.38% to 53.2%, and incidence can vary from
1.9% to 71.6% across Europe, Japan, China, the Middle East, the USA, Australia and
Canada.<sup>(<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> The estimated incidence of PUs in acute care
settings varies widely as well, from 3.3 to 53.4%.<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>Few published studies have analyzed the incidence of PUs in Latin America, apart from
Brazil, where there is a high incidence of PUs that have been reported in some
regions. For example, one ICU in Brazil recorded an incidence of 53%; however,
Brazil reports wide variability, with incidence varying from 5.8 to 55%.<sup>(<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>A recently published study conducted in our ICU between 2010 and 2012 aimed to
describe the evolution of selected physical and psychological symptoms after
discharge in ICU survivors who had received more than 48 hours of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and detected serious issues regarding the incidence of PUs. At one
month post-discharge, 75% of patients presented with PUs in addition to other
physical consequences.<sup>(<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>To address this complication as part of a quality-of-care program, we designed a
multifaceted intervention that focused on patients with prolonged acute MV (MV
&#x02265; 96 hours).<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> Our aim
was to determine the effectiveness of this program in reducing the incidence and
severity of PUs in this critical care population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental, before-and-after study that was conducted in a 14-bed
medical-surgical ICU within a university-affiliated hospital. ICU patients who were
adults (&#x02265; 15 years old), who were consecutively enrolled and who required MV
&#x02265; 96 hours were included in this study.<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> Patients who had do-not-resuscitate orders and
pre-existent PUs were not included in this study. The Ethical Review Board of the
<italic>Hospital San Mart&#x000ed;n de La Plata</italic> approved this protocol
(number: 001513; date: 01/01/13). Written, informed consent was obtained from
relatives before the patients were included in the study.</p><p>This study consisted of a pre-intervention period of 7 months (Pre-I, June-December
2013) and a post-intervention period of 9 months (Post-I, April-December 2014);
these periods were separated by the implementation of a multifaceted
multidisciplinary intervention. During the Pre-I period, standard care was provided,
which consisted of patient repositioning during every nursing shift (repositioning
occurred only when the patients were hemodynamically stable, had normal intracranial
pressure and had a closed abdomen) and use of hydrocolloid moisture-retentive wound
dressings, heel floats and air mattresses. Thereafter, a 3-month "wash-in" phase
ensued to allow time for full implementation of the protocol wherein standard PU
care was maintained.</p><p>When developing the intervention, we first focused on the reality that there was only
one dermatologist who specialized in soft tissue lesions and who was available for
the entire hospital. Consequently, a "process improvement" task-force was formed to
maximize the expertise of the specialist in an extremely limited time frame. The
team was composed of 16 ICU nurses, 1 dermatologist, and 3 critical care
specialists. Two physicians and 2 nurses were appointed as team leaders, had direct
contact with the dermatologist and designed a multifaceted educational
intervention.</p><p>Next, the ICU medical and nursing personnel were instructed by the dermatologist on
lesion classification, wound cleansing methodology, and treatment indication as well
as discussion of the different therapeutic options (i.e., the type of wound care
product and the need for consultation with a surgical specialist) during four
educational sessions. Thereafter, a daily head-to-toe inspection of the skin was
performed, and upon completion of the inspection, a paper form for PU monitoring and
treatment that was designed by the team was completed at the patient's bedside each
time a change occurred or at least once during every 48-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Form designed for monitoring and managing pressure ulcers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbti-29-01-0039-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>Afterward, the use of the Whatsapp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> smartphone application was
implemented to monitor and communicate therapeutic decisions concerning PUs on a
daily basis. For this task, 2 groups were formed to streamline communication. The
main group who made decisions regarding patient care included team leaders and the
dermatologist, and this group conducted systematic evaluations, which included
photographing the lesions, making sure not to include any identifying patient
features. The second, larger group, which followed the instructions provided by the
main group, included the entire nursing staff and received all the photographs and
staging and management instructions but did not consult directly with the
dermatologist due to the size of the nursing pool. All staff members were educated
on the ethical considerations of using photographs for educational and therapeutic
purposes, and great care was taken to ensure that no identifying patient features
were included in the photographs.</p><p>Finally, the last component added to the intervention was the involvement of the
patient's family. After the family received training from the staff, family members
who volunteered to participate in the "family prevention bundle" agreed to perform
pre-specified, limited activities for a minimum of two hours per day, twice a day,
seven days a week. The bundle included daily monitoring of skin for the detection of
new skin lesions and for the evolution of older lesions, daily application of
lotions and vitamin A creams for hydration or silicone sprays for bony prominences,
and assisting in rotating the patient together with the nursing staff. Most families
took advantage of the open visitation policy, were present throughout the day and
enthusiastically conducted their bundle duties.</p><p>In each period, we recorded the epidemiological variables, the reasons for admission,
the severity-of-illness score on admission using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation - APACHE-II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment on admission -
SOFA<sub>24</sub> scores, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length
of the ICU stay as well as the in-hospital mortality, and the nurse:patient
ratio.<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> The outcome measures were calculated as
indicators for the prevention and treatment of PUs. The risk of developing PUs was
evaluated using the Braden Scale. The scale ranges from 6 to 23 points: grade 0,
without risk (19 to 23 points); grade 1, mild risk (15 to 18 points); grade 2,
moderate risk (13 to 14 points); grade 3, high risk (10 to 12 points); and grade 4,
severe risk (6 to 9 points).<sup>(<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup>
This scale was selected because it is one of the most widely used scales in the
critical care arena. Other outcome measurements that were calculated included the
rate of patients using pressure-prevention mattresses, the incidence and location of
PUs as well as the number of days it took to develop them, the number of PUs per
patient, the incidence of advanced-grade PUs (3 or 4),<sup>(<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> the rate of patients with PUs at the time of ICU
discharge, and the rate of family participation.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data are presented as percentages, mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), or
median and interquartile ranges (IQR 25 - 75%). Comparisons were made between
the Pre-I and Post-I groups. Continuous variables were compared using
<italic>t</italic>-tests or the Mann-Whitney U test, according to their
distribution, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-square
test.</p><p>A logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent
variables that were related to the development of advanced-grade PUs.
Predetermined variables, and those that were significantly associated with
advanced-grade PUs in the univariate analysis (p &#x0003c; 0.20) were included in the
multivariate analysis. The model was calibrated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test;
discrimination, using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For all
comparisons, a p-value of &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All analyses were performed with STATA 11.1 software. The SQUIRE
2.0 guideline was used for quality improvement reporting.<sup>(<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup> The sample size was
calculated after taking a baseline PU incidence of 75% into
consideration.<sup>(<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>
Anticipating a Post-I reduction in PUs of at least 45%, a two-sided &#x003b1; of
0.05 and a power of 80%, the number of patients required per period was &#x02265;
48. After adding 20% for possible losses, the final total N required was
&#x02265; 116.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 418 patients who were admitted to the ICU during the study period, 263 were not
included because the time that they spent on MV was &#x0003c; 96 hours. Of 155 eligible
patients (70 in the Pre-I group; 85 in the Post-I group), an additional 31 patients
were excluded (22 had pre-existing PUs, and 9 had do-not-resuscitate orders).
Consequently, 124 patients met the inclusion criteria of MV &#x02265; 96 hours and an
absence of previous lesions; 55 patients were enrolled in the Pre-I period, and 69
patients were enrolled in the Post-I period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). Relevant patient characteristics for both periods are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">table 1</xref>. Briefly, this population was young and
acutely ill; the mean patient age was higher in the Post-I period. Medical diagnoses
and severe organ failure predominated, and both multiple trauma and acute brain
injury were frequent causes of admission. These patients exhibited a prolonged
duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, and the mortality was
high. The nurse:patient ratio remained unchanged throughout the study in both
periods.</p><p>

of the implementation of a multidisciplinary team for the management of PUs, a
smartphone application as a telemedicine tool for lesion oversight, and the
participation of families in patient care decreased the incidence and severity of
lesions. Furthermore, we found that SOFA<sub>24</sub> score and mechanical
ventilation duration - both markers of acute, severe disease - were independent risk
factors for the occurrence of advanced-grade pressure ulcers. Notably, the
multifaceted educational intervention acted as the only protective predictor.
Additionally, the onset of lesions was significantly delayed in the Post-I period,
and the percentage of patients discharged without lesions was higher.</p><p>The risk of developing PUs in our ICU is high. Taking into consideration the entire
population screened during the study period, the total incidence of PUs for all ICU
patients was 23% in the Pre-I period and 15% in the Post-I period (data not
presented). Considering only patients with MV &#x02265; 96 hours, the incidence of
PUs was even higher (75% in the Pre-I period and 54% in the Post-I period); these
patients were at the highest risk given their high grades (3 and 4) on the Braden
Scale, prolonged MV duration, and immobilization due to shock, as well as the high
incidence of multiple trauma and traumatic brain injury. Considering this scenario,
no matter how comprehensive the protocol is that we design, PUs will still develop
in some patients. Therefore, our multifaceted approach had the ultimate goal of
reducing not only the global incidence of PUs, but also the number of advanced-grade
lesions; we succeeded in this latter goal, with the incidence decreasing from 49% to
10%.</p><p>Another issue that complicated the high incidence of PUs is that the possibility of
discharge to tertiary care institutions in Argentina - as well as Latin America in
general - is limited; therefore, patients may remain in the ICU for months.
Furthermore, the nurse:patient ratio in our ICU is clearly insufficient (1:2.4 -
2.5), with values similar to those in Latin America, (1:1.8 [1.0 - 2.6]), which are
some of the lowest in the world.<sup>(<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup> Insufficient clinical care staff is a well-known predictor of
adverse outcomes.<sup>(<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>For evaluating and improving quality-of-care, the "monitoring system" approach
focuses on the performance and periodic evaluation of selected indicators, while the
PDSA (<italic>Plan, Do, Study, Act</italic>) cycle first identifies a problem,
analyses it, and finally, proposes improvements<sup>(<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup> to respond to the question "What can we
improve?"<sup>(<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> Our study
combined both approaches and commenced with identifying the problem, applying the
improvement strategy, and finally, establishing monitoring guidelines.<sup>(<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>It is generally accepted that multicomponent interventions might be more effective
than any individual approach for the prevention of PUs (e.g., the use of devices for
pressure relief, such as advanced static mattresses or static overlays).<sup>(<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> In a recent ICU
study in the US, a multifaceted prevention program reduced the incidence of PUs from
10% to 3%.<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> Many other studies
that have attempted to decrease the development of PUs only used singular
interventions. For example, the <italic>turn team</italic> proposed in a study by
Still et al. reduced lesions by turning patients every two hours.<sup>(<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup> In the Behrendt et al. study, PUs
were reduced by continuous bedside pressure mapping.<sup>(<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>Some elements of our approach have been used in limited degrees by other researchers.
For example, in the de Araujo et al. study, the authors used digital photography
over three months to classify lesions; however, of the 42 patients who participated
in the study, only 47 grade 1 and 2 lesions were identified.<sup>(<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</sup> Our study catalogued more than
1,500 photographs over a 16-month period and recorded all four grades of PUs. We
maintained the standard practices for care of PUs as indicated above but also
incorporated other elements, such as the smartphone application and the family
prevention bundle. To our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate this
combination of different approaches.</p><p>Incorporating WhatsApp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> enabled the team to maximize the limited
time of the specialist by focusing on the most severe lesions. Photographs of the
lesions were simultaneously sent to all staff members, which allowed for timely
monitoring and instantaneous comparison with the prior state of the lesion. The
sheer number of photographs that were evaluated during the study dramatically
increased the less-trained staff's exposure to the evaluation and treatment of PUs
since not all personnel had the same knowledge on the prevention and treatment of
this complication. This discrepancy in knowledge has also been noted in other
studies.<sup>(<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>Family participation is a controversial issue for critical care staff. Most studies
have explored the intention of family members to involve themselves in patient care,
but few have reported active participation in specific tasks without overstepping
boundaries with the staff, as we have successfully illustrated in the present
study.<sup>(<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</sup> It has been well documented that the presence of
family aids in patient recovery.<sup>(<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup> In two previous
studies, family members expressed that massages were one of the main elements of
healthcare they could most readily provide to increase a feeling of mutual
well-being.<sup>(<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</sup> Thus, we harnessed the curative
aspects of the family presence and then added specific, yet limited, tasks that
family members could provide while reducing the burden on the limited nursing staff.
This engagement was possible due to the open visitation policy, which allowed family
members to be present for extended periods.<sup>(<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>The findings of a recent American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force on
Models of Critical Care also supported many of our conclusions: (1) an
intensivist-led, high-performing, multidisciplinary team dedicated to the ICU is an
integral part of effective care delivery; (2) process improvement is the cornerstone
of achieving high-quality ICU outcomes; and (3) standardized protocols including
care bundles and protocols to facilitate measurable processes and outcomes should be
used and further developed in the ICU setting.<sup>(<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup>
</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it was conducted in only one public center, which
compromises its external validity; however, the simplicity of the intervention
allows for eventual generalization. Age was also a limitation in that this was a
relatively young population (47 <italic>versus</italic> 39); therefore, we cannot
completely rule out age as a predictor. However, in our model, age was not
independently associated with more advanced-grade PUs. Another limitation was that
we only evaluated family participation and not family satisfaction. As none of the
family members refused to participate or quit, our impression was that their feeling
of usefulness increased their involvement in their loved one's recovery. Finally, we
cannot discard that awareness of good clinical practices by nurses could have
contributed to better clinical outcomes, as they knew they were being observed
(Hawthorne effect), regardless of any intervention. However, this is a collateral
benefit that has been frequently described in before-after quality studies.</p><p>The main strength of this study is the possibility of generalization to any hospital
setting, no matter the available resources. For example, in hospitals with generous
nurse:patient ratios and support staff, educating family members on specific tasks
such as the application of lotions or creams can offer them a feeling of usefulness
in a situation in which they might otherwise feel helpless. In contrast, in
hospitals with limited staff, incorporating family members in controlled tasks can
serve as an invaluable resource. Another strength of the study is that there was no
monetary cost or increase in staff associated with the implementation of the
intervention. Of course, time, education and organizational costs applied, but these
are inherent to all hospital settings, and these costs were negligible. Associated
with cost is the idea presented in the previously mentioned US study that highlights
the overall cost-savings for the hospital through the implementation of this kind of
intervention.<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>
