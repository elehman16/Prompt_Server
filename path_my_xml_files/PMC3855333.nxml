The two-spot ladybird beetle (<italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic>) has been the focus of many studies of mating and sexual selection, yet the costs of mating for males are unknown. The mating system of <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> involves a spermatophore nuptial gift ingested by females after copulation. In this study, we investigate the cost to males of mating and of transferring spermatophores in terms of lifespan, ejaculate production and depletion of nutritional reserves. We found that males faced a strong trade-off between mating and survival, with males that were randomly assigned to mate a single time experiencing a 53% reduction in post-mating lifespan compared to non-mating males. This is among the most severe survival costs of a single mating yet reported. However, spermatophore transfer did not impact male survival. Instead, the costs associated with spermatophores appeared as a reduced ability to transfer spermatophores in successive matings. Furthermore, males ingested more food following spermatophore transfer than after matings without spermatophores, suggesting that spermatophore transfer depletes male nutritional reserves. This is to our knowledge the first report of an effect of variation in copulatory behaviour on male foraging behaviour. Overall, our study highlights the advantages of assessing mating costs using multiple currencies, and suggests that male <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> should exhibit mate choice.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors were supported by scholarships from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC, to JCP and CTT), the Entomological Society of Canada (JCP), and the Government of Ontario/Dr. F.

Yet although the costs of mating for female <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> have been investigated <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, costs for males are entirely unknown. Despite the fact that nuptial gift production can impose high costs in other species <xref rid="pone.0081934-Boggs1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, the costs to males of producing the spermatophore nuptial gift are likewise unknown. One might expect male mating costs to be considerable in <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>, given that males transfer a relatively large ejaculate (&#x0223c;4% of male body mass <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry5" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>) and mate for several hours <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

First, to examine trade-off costs between male reproduction and longevity, we test the effects of mating and spermatophore transfer on male post-mating lifespan by assigning males to a mating or non-mating treatment and recording spermatophore transfer among mating males. Second, we examine trade-offs between current and future reproduction by testing male ability to mate and transfer spermatophores in multiple matings. Finally, to assess the energetic demands placed on males by spermatophore transfer, we examine how spermatophore transfer relates to male feeding rates after mating, and compare the results to a previous finding that mating has no impact on male food intake <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We detected costs of both mating and spermatophore transfer for males, including an extreme longevity cost of mating, a decreased ability to transfer sequential spermatophores, and a post-mating increase in male foraging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>The two-spot ladybird beetle <italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an aphid predator with Holarctic distribution.

In the North American population we investigated, mating involves the transfer of a single ejaculate, including seminal fluids that solidify into a spermatophore capsule in the female reproductive tract. Females eject and eat the spermatophore following most matings (60&#x02013;90%, depending in part on male nutritional state <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry5" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). The ladybirds used in these experiments were of the second and third generation reared in our laboratory, with the original stock obtained from a commercial supplier (Natural Insect Control, Stevensville, Ontario, Canada). Late-instar larvae were separated and the emerging adults grouped by sex.

Males were maintained on excess pea aphids prior to the mating trial. To conduct the mating trial, males were introduced individually to a petri dish (50 mm&#x000d7;12 mm), which contained a virgin female for males assigned to the mating treatment.

After 250 minutes, we transferred the male to a new feeding arena until 24 h post-copulation. We weighed the food remaining in each arena after male removal and generated measures of male feeding over the two intervals by subtraction. We corrected the estimate of the mass of food eaten by subtracting the mean mass loss of food in control feeding arenas that did not contain a ladybird.

We tested the likelihood of spermatophore transfer in two sequential matings by calculating binomial probabilities. We tested for an effect of spermatophore transfer on male feeding rate by a one-way analysis of variance.

We find that both are costly, and that costs manifest in distinct ways for each. We demonstrate a dramatic trade-off cost between mating and longevity: median lifespan was reduced 53% by a single mating, among the most severe longevity costs from a single mating that we are aware of from any species. Remarkably, this longevity cost is male-specific: female <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> experience no decline in lifespan from a single or even multiple matings, under similar nutrient-limited conditions <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This cost of mating is distinct from the costs associated with spermatophores, as the decrease in lifespan following mating was independent of spermatophore transfer. Instead, spermatophore costs involved a trade-off between current and future reproductive investment, with males rarely able to transfer spermatophores in successive matings. Furthermore, males ingested more food after transferring a spermatophore, indicating that spermatophore transfer depletes male nutritional reserves and alters their post-mating behaviour. This is to our knowledge the first report of the consequences of mating for male foraging behaviour. Below, we discuss each result in the context of the existing literature on the costs of mating and nuptial gifts for males.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Mating costs</title><p>We show that mating entails a survival cost to male <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> that is independent of spermatophore transfer. The magnitude of this cost of mating was extreme. In comparison, males of three other coccinellid beetles experience less severe lifespan effects from mating 5 times, ranging from a &#x0223c;5&#x02013;9% reduction in <italic>Propylea dissecta</italic> to a marginal reduction in <italic>Cheilomenes sexmaculata</italic>, and even a &#x0223c;40% increase in <italic>Coccinella septempunctata</italic>, compared to not mating <xref rid="pone.0081934-OmkarMishra1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Further study is required to elucidate the basis of this variation. Although one might suppose that the spermatophore nuptial gift produced by male <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> indicates a more complex and therefore more costly ejaculate, spermatophores are also produced by <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> and sometimes eaten by females <xref rid="pone.0081934-Obata1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In other insects, experimental studies have reported either no or only minimal reduction in male lifespan from a single mating (in the butterflies <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic>

In general, although male longevity costs from mating are widespread <xref rid="pone.0081934-Scharf1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the magnitude of cost is extremely variable.</p><p>The survival cost of mating cost might be related to the costs of producing sperm and ejaculate components other than the spermatophore capsule, which might be substantial given that these non-spermatophore components represent &#x0223c;4% of male body mass in a single mating <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry5" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Alternatively, the survival costs of mating might stem from the energetic demands of copulation, which typically takes over two hours in this population <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry5" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Mating costs might also result from energy invested in courtship, as demonstrated in other species <xref rid="pone.0081934-South1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but excessive courtship costs are unlikely in <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>. Courtship is very minimal, and it is rare to observe resistance to mating by reproductively mature, non-mated females in good nutritional condition, like those used in these experiments.</p><p>Despite the survival costs of mating, we found that males maintained a willingness to mate in two successive matings, even though they were less likely to transfer a spermatophore in a second mating. Some sperm transfer is possible even when spermatophore ejection after mating is not observed (unpublished data), and thus it may benefit males to mate even when unable to transfer a full ejaculate. It is clear that males manage this trade-off between mating opportunities and ejaculate investment in a variety of ways across species, with males of some species delaying re-mating during ejaculate replenishment <xref rid="pone.0081934-Hettyey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081934-Sakaluk1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and males in other species re-mating and transferring smaller ejaculates <xref rid="pone.0081934-Ferkau1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> or ejaculates depleted in certain components <xref rid="pone.0081934-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

First, our finding of increased male food intake after spermatophore transfer implies that males modify their foraging behaviour to recoup the energetic expenditure associated with spermatophore transfer. Interestingly, the energetic demands of spermatophore transfer do not translate into longevity costs even when males are prevented from recouping that energy through feeding (first experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081934-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that investment in spermatophores might instead trade-off with future reproductive investment, which is consistent with our findings, or with other aspects of life history (e.g., immune function) not examined here. We have previously reported a minimal effect of mating itself on male food intake <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and by comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081934-g002">Figure 2</xref> of this study with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081934-g001">Figure 1(a)</xref> of that study, it is evident that food intake by males that did not transfer a spermatophore falls within the range of non-mating males.</p><p>A second form of cost was that males had only a limited ability to transfer spermatophores in two consecutive matings, implying that investing in current reproduction comes at the cost of future mating performance. We have discussed above the diverse strategies males use to manage this trade-off. Such declines in performance with additional matings are common <xref rid="pone.0081934-Scharf1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but not universal <xref rid="pone.0081934-Bissoondath1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The costs associated with spermatophore transfer might include those of producing the spermatophore nuptial gift itself, as well as any other ejaculate components correlated with spermatophore transfer. For example, the failure to transfer sufficient quantities of the seminal fluids that form the spermatophore capsule might be associated with lower overall seminal fluid or sperm transfer. However, the failure to transfer a spermatophore does not represent a complete absence of ejaculate transfer, as we have frequently observed sperm transfer in matings that did not involve spermatophore transfer (unpublished data). In general, it is challenging in any species to experimentally isolate the costs of endogenous nuptial gift production (as opposed to gifts that males acquire from the environment, such as prey items <xref rid="pone.0081934-Albo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>) from other costs of mating, because it is difficult to randomly assign nuptial gift production to males. Other correlative evidence for the costs of nuptial gifts comes from orthopterans, including lengthy delays in male re-mating <xref rid="pone.0081934-Simmons2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Sakaluk1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Simmons3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, comparative evidence that males take longer to re-mate in species that produce larger nuptial gifts <xref rid="pone.0081934-Vahed1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and evidence that spermatophore production trades off with immune function in a cricket <xref rid="pone.0081934-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the value of assessing male mating costs using several currencies. We detected a trade-off with longevity for mating itself and a trade off with future reproduction for spermatophore nuptial gift transfer. Furthermore, males increased their rate of foraging after transferring a spermatophore, implying energetic costs. Our findings that both mating and spermatophore transfer are costly for males implies that male <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> should be choosy about their mates. This prediction is at odds with our previous observation that male ladybirds readily attempt mating with female in poor condition <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081934-Perry3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, even if pre-copulatory male mate choice is indeed limited, male <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> might engage in cryptic mate choice by directing more ejaculate towards high-quality females. Both forms of male mate choice remain open questions in this well-studied mating system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank L. Rowe for discussion and P. Carazo, L.
