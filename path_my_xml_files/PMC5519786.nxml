In recent phase III trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer, fluorouracil plus leucovorin plus irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) showed a clear benefit with respect to OS compared with gemcitabine alone.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> FOLFIRINOX also showed delayed HRQOL deterioration compared with gemcitabine alone,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> while gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was associated with longer quality-adjusted survival than gemcitabine alone based on non-patient-reported health utilities.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, because of their associated toxicities,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> these two regimens require a good patient performance status and close monitoring.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> A desirable regimen with a good balance between OS and HRQOL for patients who cannot receive the two regimens should be investigated.</p><p>In Japan, the oral fluoropyrimidine derivative drug S-1 has been used to treat pancreatic cancer since the early 2000s.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The randomised phase III GEST (Gemcitabine and TS-1 Trial) study for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer investigated the superiority of gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) and the non-inferiority of S-1 alone versus gemcitabine alone on OS. The study confirmed the non-inferiority of S-1, but not the superiority of GS.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The non-inferiority of S-1 alone and the superiority of GS for progression-free survival (PFS) were shown.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The detailed results for another secondary endpoint of HRQOL are reported in this article.</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare longitudinal HRQOL among the three treatments in the GEST study. The impacts of adverse events and tumour response on HRQOL of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The full study details were reported previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Briefly, in this open-label randomised phase III study, eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer, age of 20 to 79 years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 1 were enrolled. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive gemcitabine alone, S-1 alone or GS using a minimisation method with stratification by disease extent (locally advanced or metastatic disease) and institution. Patients assigned to gemcitabine alone received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Patients assigned to S-1 alone received S-1 at a dose of 80, 100 or 120&#x02009;mg/day orally twice daily according to body surface area on days 1 through 28 of a 42-day cycle. Patients assigned to GS received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 8 plus S-1 at a dose of 60, 80 or 100&#x02009;mg/day orally twice daily according to body surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Assessment of HRQOL, adverse events and tumour response</title><p>HRQOL was assessed using the validated EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D) questionnaire, which comprises five items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) with three status levels.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Completion of the EQ-5D questionnaire was defined as responses to all five items. Patients&#x02019; responses to the five items were converted into a single health utility score using a prescribed algorithm based on societal preferences for health status in general populations.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> EQ-5D scores of 0 and 1 represented death and perfect health, respectively. EQ-5D scores were assessed at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 after initiation of the study treatment.</p><p>All adverse events during the study treatment were assessed in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0. For each adverse event, the worst grade every 12 weeks was reported. Tumour response to treatment was assessed by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.0 based on CT or MRI performed every 6 weeks until disease progression.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted in the full analysis set (FAS). In the GEST study, sample size was calculated for the primary endpoint of OS. The resulting sample size was considered to be enough for HRQOL analyses to detect clinically significant difference between the treatments.</p><p>For the first hypothesis, longitudinal EQ-5D scores over 72 weeks were compared using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures adjusted for baseline EQ-5D scores. Two types of analysis were conducted to handle the problem of truncation by death<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>: analysis of EQ-5D scores including scores after death as 0 and analysis of only EQ-5D scores until death.</p><p>For the second hypothesis, quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) and quality-adjusted progression-free months (QAPFMs) were compared. Assuming EQ-5D scores at death as 0, individual QALMs and QAPFMs were calculated as the area under the curve of measured EQ-5D scores from randomisation to events defining OS and PFS with linear interpolation, respectively. QALMs and QAPFMs were analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the generalised Wilcoxon test. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for censoring (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/esmoopen-2016-000151.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary file</title></caption><p>

Based on the reported minimally important differences,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> definitive HRQOL deterioration was defined as a &#x02265;0.1&#x02009;point decrease in EQ-5D scores from baseline without a further 0.1-point improvement from baseline or missing scores during the postprogression period after the last completed EQ-5D assessment. Death in the absence of previous definitive HRQOL deterioration was treated as an event. TUDD was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test and Cox regression.</p><p>Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the impacts of five non-haematologic adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue and anorexia) and tumour response on HRQOL. Tumour response was categorised into four levels (complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease) or deemed not evaluable. The associations of EQ-5D scores with the grades of these five adverse events and tumour response levels immediately before each EQ-5D assessment were analysed using linear mixed-effect models.</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS V. 9.1, V. 9.2 and V. 9.4 (SAS Institute). All p value evaluations were two sided. Values of p&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant without multiplicity adjustment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient characteristics and EQ-5D questionnaire completion</title><p>In total, 834 patients were enrolled from July 2007 to October 2009.

Exploratory analyses suggested that fatigue and anorexia impaired HRQOL, while better tumour responses improved HRQOL.</p><p>The analyses that included scores after death as 0 showed that the mean HRQOL profile in the GS group was significantly better than that in the gemcitabine group. This result partly reflects the prolonged trend in OS in the GS group (median, 10.1 months) compared with the gemcitabine group (median, 8.8 months).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The QALMs in the GS group were also significantly longer than those in the gemcitabine group. QALMs is a measure that explicitly takes both OS and HRQOL into account. Based on these results, GS accomplished a good balance between OS and HRQOL. Depending on patients&#x02019; characteristics and monitoring circumstances, GS may be a viable treatment option for some patients.</p><p>Another reason for the better HRQOL associated with GS could be related to the better tumour response. Associations between tumour response and HRQOL have been reported for other types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer and lung cancer, based on phase III randomised study data.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> The exploratory analyses in this study also indicated that better tumour responses would improve the HRQOL of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The objective response rate in the GS group was 29.3% in the GEST study, while those in the gemcitabine and S-1 groups were 13.3% and 21.0%, respectively.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The HRQOL benefit from the higher response to S-1 alone may have been cancelled out by negative factors such as fatigue and anorexia, which significantly affected HRQOL in the exploratory analyses. In terms of other regimens for advanced pancreatic cancer, FOLFIRINOX also had a higher objective response rate and delayed HRQOL impairment than did gemcitabine alone.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> In contrast, gemcitabine plus erlotinib and gemcitabine plus capecitabine, which did not achieve better HRQOL compared with gemcitabine alone,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> had objective response rates similar to those with gemcitabine alone.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 18</xref>
</p><p>The HRQOL results were similar between the S-1 and gemcitabine groups in all relevant analyses in this study. These results indicate that S-1 alone is equivalent to gemcitabine alone with respect to HRQOL. The additional HRQOL results in this study support the conclusion suggested by Ueno <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> that S-1 alone can be used as a convenient oral first-line chemotherapy alternative to gemcitabine alone for advanced pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Some limitations should be taken into account in interpreting the results of this study. First, missing HRQOL data cannot be avoided in randomised studies assessing HRQOL. Because the baseline characteristics were not changed by excluding approximately 10% of patients who did not respond to the baseline questionnaire,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the results of this study are generalisable to the original FAS population. Some of the missing scores after randomisation were likely to arise through deterioration of patients&#x02019; health, especially after disease progression. This could produce upward bias in the mean EQ-5D profiles; however, if equal amounts of missing scores occurred in each group, the bias between groups would be offset.</p><p>The second limitation is that patients with both locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer were enrolled in the GEST study. The GEST study was planned before the recommendation that patients with locally advanced disease should be studied separately from patients with metastatic disease.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The subgroup analyses of EQ-5D scores indicated that the results for S-1 could be applicable to the two entities, while GS could be remarkably beneficial for locally advanced disease.</p><p>In conclusion, longitudinal HRQOL in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer given GS as first-line chemotherapy was significantly better than that in patients given gemcitabine alone. GS is considered one of the regimens that can accomplish a good balance between OS and HRQOL benefits. The longitudinal HRQOL of S-1 alone was similar to that of gemcitabine alone. Better tumour responses with appropriate supportive care for cancer-related fatigue and anorexia could contribute to maintenance of good HRQOL in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors appreciate all of the patients and their families who participated in the study, as well as the investigators and medical staff who were dedicated to the study.
