It has been known for many years that the negative effects of tobacco smoking on health are numerous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Tobacco smoking is involved in the appearance of different types of cancer. It is also the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the most common known cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and many other health problems. Despite wide knowledge on the subject, the prevalence of tobacco smoking is still high. According to the 2006 National Health Survey, 31.56% of adult men and 21.51% of women are daily smokers, of whom 79% of men and 70% of women smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day.</p><p>Smoking cessation is beneficial for health at any point in life, both in healthy people and in people already suffering from a smoking-related disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, smoking cessation is not an easy task, given that nicotine is a drug that generates great addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>According to article 12 of the Spanish Act 28/2005 (art. 12 Ley 28/2005) based on health measures for tobacco smoking and the regulation of its sale, supply, consumption and the advertising of tobacco products, the Spanish public Administrations are to promote the development of health programmes for smoking cessation in the Spanish Health System, especially in Primary Care. Likewise, National Health System strategies for cancer, ischemic cardiopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include reducing the prevalence of tobacco smoking amongst their objectives.</p><p>Although many smokers claim to have quit smoking on their own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], others require specific help. Primary care doctors and nurses see most of the smokers at least once a year in their practice and have an excellent opportunity to diagnose tobacco smoking, evaluate the motivation behind it, and help them quit smoking. There is growing evidence on how healthcare professionals can help smokers end their addiction through pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The latter include: brief advice given by a doctor or a nurse, the delivery of self-help materials or more complex or intensive interventions based on motivational interviews and cognitive-behavioural techniques for psychological support, sometimes combined with pharmacological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The majority of non-pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation use the so-called transtheoretical model of change described by Prochaska and DiClemente at the beginning of the 90s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. According to this model, the smoker goes through a series of phases during his/her smoking cessation process: pre-contemplative (the smoker does not contemplate quitting smoking), contemplative (the smoker begins to be unhappy with his/her addiction and starts thinking about quitting smoking within the next 6&#x02009;months), preparative (the smoker is prepared to quit smoking), smoking cessation and the eventual relapses that re-start the cycle.</p><p>The brief advice given by a healthcare professional can achieve between 1&#x02013;3% smoking cessations after 6&#x02009;months, taking into consideration that an additional 2&#x02013;3% manage to quit smoking without help. Therefore, this measure is moderately effective, although it has a great impact across the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the percentage can be increased if the advice is not as brief and/or if it is accompanied by self-help and/or follow-up materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In order to increase the rates of smoking cessation by means of brief advice, another strategy could be the evaluation of the physical effects of smoking using physiological measures that offer the smoker some feedback on the effects of smoking, as happens with hypertensive patients and blood pressure readings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>These interventions are based on the hypothesis that one of the reasons why people continue smoking, in spite of knowing the harmful effects of tobacco, is that they underestimate the personal risk of becoming ill because of it. In this sense, the interventions will offer motivational feedback to promote awareness of the risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has been suggested that some smokers who manage to quit smoking are more aware of the adverse effects of tobacco or to have had their health seriously compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Three different types of feedback have been established: the first type analyses biomarkers of exposure to tobacco (nicotine, carbon monoxide); the second offers information regarding the risk of tobacco-related diseases (predisposition to lung cancer according to the CYP2D6 genotype); and the third describes the harmful effects of smoking (atherosclerotic plaques or worsening of pulmonary function) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Isolated studies have provided mixed results regarding the effect of biomedical risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] concludes that, due to the lack of good quality evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions. The following methodological recommendations are made: use adequate sample sizes, use allocation concealment procedures, agree on a definition of &#x0201c;abstinence&#x0201d; and systematically introduce measures to biochemically confirm it and, finally, carry out analyses by intention to treat. The measurement of CO levels in exhaled air by CO-oximetry is used to evaluate the degree of smoking by the smoker given that, in general, there is a direct relationship between the levels of CO and the number of cigarettes smoked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The measurement of exhaled CO is also the preferred measurement to confirm tobacco abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>It has been observed that the measurement of CO in exhaled air in smokers could be an indicative test of immediate and future harm to their health as a consequence of smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and this could increase their motivation to stop smoking, which could lead to smoking cessation in these patients. In the review mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], three studies that measured the direct effect of CO-oximetry on smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] were identified. Two of them were carried out in primary care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. No positive changes in the rate of smoking cessation were observed.</p><p>The measurement of CO levels in exhaled air by CO-oximetry is an inexpensive, non-invasive, fast technique that requires little technical training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] making it a technique for risk assessment in smokers that can be easily applied in primary care and, if proven effective, could serve as a reinforcement aid in smoking cessation intervention activities.</p><p>Therefore, we think it would be interesting to study its possible effect on smoking cessation to a greater extent through the design of a new study incorporating the methodological recommendations given by the experts, and by providing more robust results to determine efficacy.</p><p>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of the CO-oximetry technique, together with brief advice, in smoking cessation at month 12 in smokers in contemplative or pre-contemplative phase compared with brief advice alone. Furthermore, the study also aims to evaluate the efficacy of the CO-oximetry technique together with brief advice in the reduction of the number of cigarettes and in the variation of the motivation to quit smoking at month 12 in smokers in contemplative or pre-contemplative phase compared with brief advice alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design and settings</title><p>A randomised, parallel, single-blind clinical trial in a primary health care setting in Majorca (Spain). The subjects will be randomised to either Control Group (CG) or Intervention Group (IG). Participants in CG will receive brief advice; participants in IG will receive brief advice with CO-oximetry.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study population is made up of smokers &#x02265;18&#x02009;years that attend a primary care consultation for any medical problem.</p><p>Inclusion criteria will include smokers &#x02265;18&#x02009;years in the pre-contemplation or contemplation phases described by Prochaska and DiClemente. According to the WHO, a smoker is someone who has smoked daily at least during the past month, irrespective of the amount of cigarettes he/she has smoked. A smoker in the pre-contemplation phase is someone who is not aware that he/she has a problem or thinks he/she is not able to change, does not see his/her behaviour as a reason for concern, and does not consider changes within the next 6&#x02009;months. A smoker in the contemplation phase is characterised by ambivalence, he/she simultaneously considers and rejects the idea of changing, oscillates between worry and lack of worry as well as between the motivations to change or to continue without changing, and intent to change is established in the long-term without specifying when [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Exclusion criteria will include smokers in the preparation phase (prepared to quit smoking in a month&#x02019;s time); people with a terminal illness or whose health status does not allow them to understand the study or complete the informed consent either due to mental illness or transitory psychiatric deterioration at the moment of inclusion; pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of subjects</title><p>Every person consulting a general practitioner (GP) or a nurse will be asked about their smoking behaviour and their attitude toward quitting smoking. To establish the patient&#x02019;s phase or period of change, he/she will be asked the following: &#x0201c;have you ever seriously thought that you should quit smoking within 1&#x02009;month?&#x0201d;, following the model of question used in the ISTAPS project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>If the subject fulfils the inclusion criteria, information on the study will be released, the subject invited to participate and, upon acceptance, will provide signed informed consent. Subsequently, the participant will be randomised to either CG or IG.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, and estimating a rate of loss to follow-up of 10%, 471 subjects in both the control group (CG) and the intervention group (IG) are required in order to detect a difference equal or superior to 5% between groups. A proportion of 5% smoking cessation is estimated in the CG. In total, a sample size of 942 subjects is required.</p><p>Forty-eight health care professionals from 16 health care centres will participate in the study. It is expected that each professional will include approximately 20 subjects to attain the sample size required.</p></sec><sec><title>Random allocation to study arms</title><p>The randomised scheme will be carried out in blocks of 20, using a computer program. The allocation of each patient will be determined using a table of randomised numbers, and this number will be indicated on a report placed in closed, opaque envelopes sequentially numbered. Each professional will have 20 envelopes, one for each subject. The professional will not know the randomisation scheme. The socio-demographic variables, together with those on the smoking habits of the participants that decline to participate in the study, will be collected in a separate report. The inclusion period for subjects will be 12&#x02009;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention applied to the CG will be brief advice, which will be serious, firm, concise, personalised and appropriate for the phase of change. The brief advice attempts to encourage subjects in a clear, firm and personalised way to quit smoking, inform more than oblige, facilitate information on the negative effects of tobacco on health, highlight the main advantages of quitting smoking and ask them to identify and examine the main obstacles when quitting smoking. Once the brief advice to stop smoking has been carried out verbally, the patients will be given a written document with advice and several guidelines. The healthcare professionals will receive training on how to give the brief advice.</p><p>In the IG, apart from giving the brief advice in exactly the same way as for the CG, a CO-oximetry test will also be carried out on each subject. Before it is performed, the basics of the test and what it measures will be explained to patients. Once the subject has properly understood how the technique works and if he/she is at an optimum moment for it to be carried out (having not smoked one hour prior to the test/having not smoked for more than 10 hours), the levels of carbon monoxide in expired air will be measured in parts per million (ppm) and recorded in the data collection booklet (DCB) and in a personal report that will be given out to the subject, together with an explanation and definition of CO-oximetry and an interpretation of the possible results.</p><p>The two interventions will be carried out by the healthcare professional including the patient in the trial, irrespective of whether he/she is a GP or a nurse. It will only be performed once, during the first visit following the inclusion of the patient into the study. Each professional will conduct one intervention or the other, depending on what intervention is assigned to the subject during randomisation.</p><p>The evaluation at months 6 and 12 will be done by a nurse blinded to patient allocation. At 6&#x02009;months there will be a telephone evaluation and at 12&#x02009;months an evaluation in the primary health centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessment</title><sec><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>Sustained smoking cessation at 12&#x02009;months confirmed by a urine cotinine test.

As such, all interventions that can be done to protect health and motivate smoking cessation are welcomed, especially if they are simple, non-aggressive, accessible and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. If this intervention is performed in primary care, where 90% of the population come over 5&#x02009;years, the population effect is highly relevant and of great benefit to Public Health.</p><p>Although our intervention is addressed to all current smokers, it has been specially designed for those smokers who, due to their great physical and psychological dependence and their balance between positive and negative smoking cessation factors, opt in favour of smoking maintenance. These smokers require forceful information directly related to the effects on their health to change the balance of these factors and allow an opportunity for smoking cessation to take place.</p><p>One of the limitations of studies evaluating personal risk relates to those cases in which the results generated by the technology used are normal and, in consequence, reinforce the smoker&#x02019;s perception about the harmless effects of smoking.
