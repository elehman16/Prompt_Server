Being a reliable measure of arterial stiffness, Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) has been suggested as a better marker of arterial stiffness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] With the awareness of arterial stiffness, clinicians have started adding measurement and treatment of underlying arterial stiffness in their clinical practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] International healthcare societies like the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) have included PWV measurement in their 2003 guidelines for management of hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The pulse pressure wave travels to the peripheral arteries and reflects back from the vasculature. In normal subjects, the reflected pulse pressure wave reaches the origin (aortic root) during the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle. This reflected pressure wave increases the Diastolic Pressure (ADP) gradient at the aortic root, which facilitates the Coronary Artery Blood Flow (CBF). But in the presence of arterial stiffness, the PWV is increased. As a consequence of this increased PWV, the pulse pressure wave is reflected prematurely and much early in a cardiac cycle. This leads to an elevation of the Aortic Systolic Pressure (ASP), decrease in ADP, and a rise in the Aortic Pulse Pressure (APP).</p><p>The rise in systolic pulse pressure is called as an augmentation pressure and its ratio to the APP is called as Augmentation Index (AIx). This augmentation of ASP leads to increased afterload and gives rise to the Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH). Studies have shown that AIx correlates with the left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Its association with an increased risk of stroke has also been suggested. As the role of increased in ASP and AIx is multifold, its measurement can be used as a surrogate and supplementary measure for arterial stiffness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Device and method, which can non-invasively measure both the PWV and Central blood pressure, will be of immense help for carrying out large population-based studies on arterial stiffness.</p><p>Since the aortic pressure values are deemed to be an outcome of the brachial pressure as well as the PWV, and PeriScope, which has a provision for recording brachial blood pressures and PWV, it is suggested that PeriScope may be capable of finding aortic pressures. In a unpublished pilot study at cardiac catheter laboratories during angiography, the values of invasive aortic pressures found by a fluid-filled catheter method were compared with brachial pressures and cfPWV obtained by PeriScope using multivariate statistical analysis. There was a good correlation in ASP and ADP and the regression equations applied were found to convert the brachial blood pressure and PWV values into equivalent aortic pressures. Thus, the aim of the present study was to validate a novel method determining aortic systolic, diastolic, pulse, augmentation pressures along with AIx based on an oscillometric method using four limb-cuff pressure waveforms and two lead ECG (PeriScope) with a validated tonometric Pulse Wave Analysis System (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical Pty Ltd, West Ryde, Australia).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study Population</title><p>Patients (with hypertension, CAD, and DM) attending the outpatient department of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India, were enrolled in the study.

It is important to treat patients with elevated arterial stiffness. Additional estimation of aortic blood pressure with this device will significantly enhance its usage in clinical practice. Since there is a relationship between arterial stiffness, brachial blood pressure, and central pressure, it is logical to explore the possibility of adding central blood pressure parameters to the existing device, which was successfully implemented.</p><p>Pulse wave velocity, which is a relevant indicator of arterial stiffness, can be measured non-invasively with a variety of automatic devices. A novel index for estimating arterial stiffness as &#x02018;QPV interval&#x02019; Was determined by means of surface ECG and Doppler ultrasound of the brachial artery simultaneously .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] This method is complex and requires a skilled operator.</p><p>The present method was further validated by comparing it with an established method of Generalized Transfer Function (GTF) using tonometry. The results obtained by the new PeriScope method were compared with that obtained by SphygmoCor, which is a widely used device with tonometry and GTF. Our study showed that the results obtained by these two methods correlated well, with no significant differences. The PeriScope method is able to calculate the central aortic pressure non-invasively which can be applied in routine clinical setting. Being simple and operator-independent, the new device can thus be useful in large population-based studies for identifying patients with a high risk of CVD mortality and morbidity associated with increased arterial stiffness. Since PeriScope is an automated device without any user intervention, the variations are significantly low.</p><p>The Bland&#x02013;Altman analysis shows proper spreading of residues, and therefore no dependence on mean and difference. The analysis showed that the measurements were well within the tolerance band set up by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). However, in case of AIx, though the mean difference is low, the SD is high. This could be attributed to the formula for AIx, in which the ratio of Augmentation Pressure to pulse pressure is multiplied by 100.</p><p>i.e. Augmentation Index=100*(Augmentation Pressure/Aortic Pulse Pressure), where Augmentation Pressure is the increase in Aortic Systolic pressure due to arterial stiffness. This determination of the AIx gives large scope of variation even with a small change in Augmentation Pressure or APP value.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>With the new method of transforming the cfPWV and brachial blood pressure values into aortic pressure values appears reasonable. The good correlation between the results obtained by tonometric GTF method and oscillometric PWV method shows that the latter can be used non-invasively to find the aortic pressure in patients. However, more studies are warranted in large patient population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn
