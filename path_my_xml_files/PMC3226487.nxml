RESPIRE (Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure.</p><p>Objectives: We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention, compared with open fire use, would reduce ST-segment depression and increase heart rate variability (HRV).</p><p>Methods: We used two complementary study designs: <italic>a</italic>) between-groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment, and <italic>b</italic>) before-and-after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial. Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38&#x02013;84 years of age, and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves. HRV and ST-segment values were assessed for each 30-min period. ST-segment depression was defined as an average value below &#x02013;1.00 mm. Personal fine PM [aerodynamic diameter &#x02264; 2.5 &#x003bc;m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram.</p><p>Results: PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure means were 266 and 102 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> during the trial period in the control and intervention groups, respectively. During the trial, the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 (95% confidence interval, 0.08&#x02013;0.90) for ST-segment depression. We found similar associations with the before-and-after comparison. The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV.</p><p>Conclusions: The stove intervention was associated with reduced occurrence of nonspecific ST-segment depression, suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>biomass fuel</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>electrocardiography</kwd><kwd>indoor air pollution</kwd><kwd>RESPIRE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Approximately 3 billion people depend on biomass (e.g., wood, crop residues, animal dung) and coal for household cooking and heating (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2004</xref>). Most of this solid fuel use occurs in developing countries, where poor households generally use open wood fires or inadequately vented stoves (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">Rehfuess et al. 2006</xref>). These fuel-stove combinations result in high indoor levels of fine combustion-generated particles and other pollutants, and epidemiological evidence suggests a substantial global burden of disease from respiratory health effects (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2004</xref>). Numerous epidemiological investigations have concluded that ambient combustion particles and secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Brook et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Dockery et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz 1993</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">Thun et al. 1999</xref>), but to our knowledge no such studies have been published on the effects of indoor air pollution from woodstoves on cardiovascular disease. Notwithstanding potentially important differences between these pollution mixtures, this evidence on ambient particles and SHS, combined with the wood smoke&#x02019;s toxicological properties, particularly the promotion of inflammation, blood coagulation, and oxidative stress (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Naeher et al. 2007</xref>), raises concern about potential cardiovascular effects of household wood smoke. Fortunately, simple, inexpensive household-energy interventions can dramatically reduce indoor pollution (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Albalak et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Ezzati and Kammen 2002</xref>; <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Naeher et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 1993</xref>), providing unique opportunities to understand and prevent the health effects of chronic exposures to these pollutants. A recent risk assessment analysis estimated that 560,000 cardiovascular deaths could be prevented by introducing 150 million low-emission stoves in India over the next decade (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al. 2009</xref>), but this estimate relies on the assumption that fine particles [aerodynamic diameter &#x02264; 2.5 &#x003bc;m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)] in ambient air and those from using biomass stoves have similar effects on ischemic heart disease, which is supported by little direct epidemiological evidence.</p><p>The RESPIRE (Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects) project, the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the health effects of reducing air pollution exposures over a period of many months in a general population, installed improved chimney woodstoves in households using open wood fires for cooking in highland villages (elevation, 2,200&#x02013;3,000 m) in rural Guatemala (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2006</xref>). The intervention stove has been shown to reduce kitchen concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and carbon monoxide (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Albalak et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 1993</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The trial focused on acute lower respiratory infections in infants but also created an opportunity to study the potential cardiovascular health benefits of reduced air pollution exposures. Given the limited size of the study population and duration of the trial period, we focused on subclinical measures of physiological change relevant to cardiovascular risk. Evidence that this intervention reduces blood pressure was reported previously (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. 2007</xref>). Because combustion particles from other sources have been associated with occurrence of ST-segment depression and decreased heart rate variability (HRV) (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Chahine et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al. 2005</xref>), we also measured these electrocardiogram outcomes. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether the stove intervention influences the occurrence of ST-segment depression or levels of HRV during everyday activities.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>Study population</italic>. The study area for the RESPIRE project comprised 23 rural villages spread over an area of about 94 km<sup>2</sup> in the towns of San Lorenzo and Comitancillo, San Marcos, in the western highland region of Guatemala, home to a primarily agricultural indigenous population living at an elevation of 2,200&#x02013;3,000 m above sea level. A baseline survey of these villages in 2002 showed that nearly all households used solid biomass fuels (primarily wood and crop residues) for cooking, and most burned these fuels indoors with open fires. Eligibility criteria for the RESPIRE project included exclusive use of open fires for cooking. Households (<italic>n</italic> = 534) were recruited and randomized into control and intervention groups from October 2002 through May 2003 (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2006</xref>). The RESPIRE trial protocols were approved by the human subjects committees at each participating center, and all participants gave informed consent before data collection.</p><p>From 8 July 2003 to 4 November 2004, after randomization to the intervention (chimney stove) and control (open fire) groups, we recruited for the cardiovascular substudy women who cooked daily, were &#x0003e; 38 years of age, lived in one of 19 villages closest to the study headquarters, and were generally the grandmothers of children in the acute lower respiratory infection study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Response rates were 75% and 54% among control and intervention households, respectively, resulting in 119 participants. The control and intervention groups were similar on all measured baseline characteristics, and their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have been described previously (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of recruitment into the cardiovascular substudy within RESPIRE trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ehp.1002834.g001"/></fig><p>At the end of the trial, the control households received the chimney stove, which allowed a before-and-after comparison.</p><p><italic>Measurements.</italic> Baseline subject characteristics, such as age, ownership of assets (radio, television, bicycle, etc.), exposure to SHS, and use of a wood-fired sauna for bathing, were attained before randomization.</p><p>We measured personal suspended PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the 24 hr before each Holter session by asking the participants to wear air samplers that included an Apex pump with flow set to 1.5 L/min (Casella Inc., Bedford, UK), a Triplex Sharp-Cut Cyclone for particle size selection (BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with inlet clipped above waste height, and a 37-mm Teflon filter inside a metal filter holder (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. 2007</xref>). Then participants were outfitted with a Performer model 9000 Holter monitor (Applied Cardiac Systems, Laguna Hills, CA, USA) and monitored over 20-hr periods. The protocol was repeated on two or three occasions for most participants. Repeated measures within subjects were taken at least 3 weeks apart, and each subject&#x02019;s set of two or three sessions was completed over a period of 184 days on average (range, 21&#x02013;420 days). To avoid confounding by study period, on each measurement day during the trial period we measured one intervention subject and one control subject, which for convenience were chosen from the participating households that were nearest to each other.</p><p>We scanned Holter recordings from the modified V5 lead and calculated the ST-segment value 60 msec after the J-point of each beat and its deviation relative to the P-R isoelectric (resting baseline) value. We defined an ischemic episode by transient ST-segment depression &#x0003e; 1.0 mm (0.1 mV) compared with the resting baseline (i.e., 0 mV), lasting &#x02265; 1 min, separated by &#x02265; 5 min from other episodes, and with horizontal or downward-sloping ST-segment morphology. We also calculated 30-min average ST-segment values as a measure of nonspecific changes in ventricular repolarization, and we created a dichotomous variable for whether this value was below &#x02013;1.0 mm (&#x02013;0.1 mV), regardless of the slope of the ST-segment.</p><p>HRV, also calculated over 30-min intervals, was measured as standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and low-frequency (LF; 0.04&#x02013;0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.15&#x02013;0.4 Hz) components of variability. Average heart rate was also recorded for each 30-min interval.</p><p>A questionnaire conducted before and after each electrocardiogram monitoring session was used to collect information on recent exposures, such as use of a wood-fired sauna. Daily average temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall were collected by a weather station near the center of the study area.</p><p><italic>Statistical analyses.</italic> To estimate the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure by study group and period, we log-transformed the PM<sub>2.5</sub> measures and used mixed models with random intercepts for subjects to provide more accurate CIs that account for correlation among repeated measures.</p><p>We fitted logistic regression models for the occurrence of 30-min average ST-segment depression and linear regression models for the natural-log&#x02013;transformed measures of HRV. To account for correlation among repeated measures, we assessed the intervention effects using generalized estimating equations in SAS PROC GENMOD (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), selecting autoregressive covariance within subjects and reporting sandwich estimators of variance. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>The between-groups study design compares the control and intervention groups during the trial period. Although randomization is expected to produce two comparable groups, because of the small sample size and postintervention selection, we adjusted for potential between-subjects confounders selected <italic>a priori</italic>, namely, age, body mass index (BMI), ever smoking, SHS, ownership of a wood-fired sauna, recent use of wood-fired sauna, an asset index as a measure of socioeconomic status, and time of day. The asset index is the sum of binary indicators for having a bicycle, a radio, and a television.</p><p>The before-and-after study design estimates the within-subject effect of the intervention among control subjects by comparing ECG data collected before and after adoption of the chimney stoves. People serve as their own controls, so these estimates can only be biased by factors that vary over time, and we adjusted for several time-varying covariates, including age, day of week, season (wet/dry), daily average temperature and relative humidity, daily rainfall, interactions of weather variables with season, recent use of wood-fired sauna, and time of day.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses for ST-segment depression included adjusting for average heart rate during the 30-min intervals and modeling the counts of 30-min intervals with ST values &#x02264; &#x02013;1.0 mm per Holter session as a Poisson variable using generalized linear mixed models (SAS PROC GLIMMIX). To assess potential bias due to varying numbers of observations per subject, we repeated the between-groups and before-and-after analyses for ST-segment and HRV using only each subject&#x02019;s last Holter session during the corresponding study period. We also evaluated all associations with the stove intervention within age groups &#x0003c; 52 and &#x02265; 52 years and within BMI groups &#x0003c; 25 and &#x02265; 25 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and tested for interaction between these age and BMI groups and the stove intervention. Because the difference in mean personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure between the groups appeared to be less during the first 3 months of the trial compared with the rest of the trial, we tested for an interaction between the stove intervention and study period (first 3 months vs. the rest of the trial period). All interactions were tested by adding a term for the product of the two variables to the models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> summarizes baseline characteristics of participants in the control and intervention groups. The median age was 50 years, and the median BMI was 24 kg/m<sup>3</sup>; these two important predictors of ST-segment depression were similar, on average, in the two groups. The women in this study lived at an elevation of around 2,600 m above sea level, on average. Most women in both groups had none or only one of the assets included in the index used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status (bicycle, radio, television), and the proportion of women from households with access to electricity was around 70% in both groups. Percentages of women who reported ever smoking or other sources of household air pollution, such as wood-fired saunas, kerosene lamps, and SHS exposure, were also similar between the two study groups.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of women in the RESPIRE electrocardiogram study, by randomized group.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="0"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control open fire (<italic>n</italic> = 70)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention chimney stove (<italic>n</italic> = 49)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p</italic>-Value<italic>a</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.6 &#x000b1;

Reductions in indoor biomass smoke were maintained over a period of many months by introduction of chimney stoves in households previously cooking over open fires. We recruited women from the intervention and control households and examined whether the chimney-stove intervention was associated with occurrence of ST-segment depression or measures of HRV. After adjusting for several potential confounders, we found that the rate of nonspecific ST-segment depression was 74% lower among women from intervention households during the trial period. Using a complementary study design examining this association within subjects, we similarly observed that women had a 72% lower rate of ST-segment depression events after receiving the intervention stove. We found no significant association between the stove intervention and HRV. Given the fundamental differences between these two study designs in the potential sources of bias, the findings together strongly suggest that the wood smoke exposure-reduction intervention reduced the occurrence of ST-segment depression.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate associations between electrocardiogram measurements and wood smoke or any long-term (several months) air pollution exposure. Our findings add to the growing evidence that pollutants from combustion of biomass produce many health impacts similar to those from fossil fuels and tobacco smoke (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Naeher et al. 2007</xref>). The public health implication is grave because these other forms of combustion-generated air pollution have been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in numerous studies (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Brook et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">Tonne et al. 2007</xref>; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2006) and because high exposures to indoor air pollution from household use of solid biomass fuels are common in poor countries.</p><p>Associations between daily fluctuations in ambient particles and electrocardiogram changes related to ventricular repolarization, such as ST-segment depression, have been observed in previous studies. Among 45 subjects with stable coronary heart disease in the Helsinki ULTRA study, risk of ST-segment depression during exercise tests was associated with particulate air pollution 2 days before the clinic visit (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">Pekkanen et al. 2002</xref>), and the association was stronger with PM<sub>2.5</sub> originating from local combustion sources (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Lanki et al. 2006</xref>). Among active elderly Bostonians, each observed up to 12 times during a 4-month period, ambient black carbon concentration during the previous 12 hr and 5 hr before testing was associated with increased risk of ST-segment depression among subjects with at least one ST-depression episode (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al. 2005</xref>). In the present study, we examined the association between stove intervention and ST-segment depression among the subset of 38 control and intervention subjects with at least one 30-min average ST value &#x0003c; &#x02013;1.0 mm and found a stronger association (OR = 0.17 vs. 0.26; data not shown), similar to findings by <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al. (2005)</xref> on the association with ambient black carbon. In a double-blind, randomized crossover study among 20 men with prior myocardial infarction, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al. (2007)</xref> found that 1-hr diesel exhaust exposure during exercise was associated with greater ischemic burden, as measured by the magnitude and duration of ST-segment depression. <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Henneberger et al. (2005)</xref> found that ambient particle levels were associated with changes in repolarization duration, morphology, and variability, which could produce the type of ST-segment changes that we observed.</p><p>The mechanisms by which combustion-generated particles affects cardiovascular function are not entirely understood, but oxidative stress and inflammation are central in leading hypotheses (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Brook et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2007</xref>). Although the toxicological evidence on wood smoke is less complete than that on ambient particles, experimental evidence suggests that wood smoke influences similar pathways. Using a controlled experiment among healthy adults, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Barregard et al. (2006)</xref> found increased systemic inflammation markers, blood coagulation factors, and lipid peroxidation after 4-hr wood smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures in the range of 240&#x02013;280 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, levels similar to the daily averages we observed among women cooking over open fires. <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Lai and Kou (1998)</xref> found that wood smoke stimulates bronchopulmonary C-fibers, which have been shown to be involved in the pulmonary reflexes that in rats mediate both cardiac oxidative stress and electrophysiological changes due to ambient particles (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Ghelfi et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that wood-smoke&#x02013;induced stimulation of pulmonary reflexes leading to oxidative stress may have contributed to the electrocardiographic changes we observed. Specifically, elevated oxidative stress resulting in alterations in myocardial action potentials and changes in ventricular repolarization may explain the greater frequent ST-segment depression among women cooking over open fires. Future studies should examine whether air-pollution&#x02013;induced changes in ST-segment values and other electrocardiogram measures, such as QT intervals and T-wave morphology, occur in association with increases in cardiac oxidative stress.</p><p>Although previous evidence of associations between air pollution and HRV motivated our study (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Chahine et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al. 2005</xref>), this is not the first study to fail to find evidence of overall association between air pollution and HRV. <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler et al. (2006)</xref>found that ambient particles in Atlanta, Georgia, were associated with increased HRV among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and with decreased HRV among individuals with recent myocardial infarction. Other studies have reported that air pollution&#x02013;HRV associations were significantly modified by genetic or environmental factors (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Therefore, our null findings may be explained by the participants not being susceptible to the autonomic effects of combustion particles, perhaps because they were generally healthy, or by opposing associations within subgroups of the study population. We did not find any consistent evidence of effect modification by age or BMI on the association between stove intervention and HRV (data not shown). Another potential explanation for the lack of evidence of an association between the stove intervention and HRV is that wood smoke particles may have only short-term effects on HRV without changing a person&#x02019;s average HRV level. A final possibility is that there may be an exposure level above which reductions in PM<sub>2.5</sub> will not substantively improve HRV, and the average PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure in the intervention group (102 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>), which was much higher than ambient levels associated with HRV in previous studies (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Chahine et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler et al. 2006</xref>), may be within this plateau region in the exposure&#x02013;response association.</p><p>A key feature of our study, in contrast to the above ambient air pollution studies that evaluated short-term associations, is that we examined differences in electrocardiograph measures between groups or periods with persistently high or low exposure levels. We aimed to address a relevant policy question about the effect of a more permanent change in air pollution exposure. With the between-groups study design, the exposure concentration contrast between groups was substantial, roughly a mean difference of 164 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and was created by a stove intervention that we assigned randomly, reducing the likelihood of confounding. Consistent with the smaller contrast in exposure we observed during the first 3 months of the trial compared with the rest of the trial, we found that the effect of the chimney stove on ST-segment depression was significantly greater after 3 months of follow-up, suggesting that the full benefit of the stove may be achieved after an adaptation period. With the before-and-after study design, a mean within-subject reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure concentration of 92 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> was attained and subjects served as their own controls, eliminating concern of confounding by between-subject differences.</p><p>Although the two study designs we employed have major strengths, they are not without potential limitations. We recruited the women from randomized groups, but the number of subjects was not large, and the proportion of eligible women participating was differential by study group (75% for control group, 54% for intervention group). If participation was also associated with ST-segment depression or HRV, selection bias may have produced study groups that were not comparable. We found, however, that the study groups were similar according to all baseline covariates we analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, as reported previously, we found no meaningful difference between the baseline characteristics of eligible women in the RESPIRE trial according to whether they participated in this cardiovascular add-on study (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. 2007</xref>). The before-and-after comparisons rely on the assumption that, conditional on time-varying covariates included in the models, ST-segment and HRV values would not have changed in the control subjects over time if the chimney-stove intervention had not occurred. We feel that this is a reasonable assumption, but unmeasured time-varying confounders cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The exposure assessment strategy we employed was successful for estimating the average effect of the stove intervention on personal PM<sub>2.5</sub>, but there are two important limitations that should be addressed in future studies. The first is that the few personal exposure measures we took do not allow accurate estimation of each subject&#x02019;s typical exposure during the trial or of their time-resolved exposures over several days before electrocardiogram sessions. Based on analyses of child exposures in RESPIRE, which had similar between- and within-subjects variance components (data not shown), <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al. (2009)</xref> showed that, because of wide daily variability in exposure, a larger number of repeated measures would be required to provide estimates of a subject&#x02019;s long-term (over several months) exposure that are accurate enough for use in exposure&#x02013; response modeling of chronic health effects. In addition, assessment of recent exposure history, perhaps hourly for up to 5 days before each Holter session, would allow analyses that are more sensitive for detection of acute health effects that may occur over several hours or days. The second limitation of our exposure assessment strategy is that we did not measure potentially important pollutants, such as ultrafine particles, the volatile aldehydes and ketones in wood smoke, or particle-bound polyaromatic hydrocarbons. It would be valuable to characterize the specific wood smoke constituents that have cardiovascular effects because some interventions may reduce some constituents more than others, particularly when the combustion conditions or fuels are substantially modified.</p><p>The clinical significance of 30-min average ST-segment values below &#x02013;1 mm in this population is unclear. The classical definition of ST-segment depression indicative of overt ischemia requires an episode that is reversible and ST-segments that are horizontal or downward sloping, usually assessed during exercise stress testing (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e1;link&#x000e1;s et al. 2002</xref>). However, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Cannon et al. (1997)</xref> evaluated hospital admission electrocardiogram recordings among resting subjects and found that ST-segment values &#x02264; &#x02013;1 mm and &#x02264; &#x02013;0.5 mm predicted death or myocardial infarction within 1 year, without taking the slope of the ST segment into account. Moreover, although we did not incorporate an exercise protocol, subjects in our study live in a hilly area at high altitude and are involved in agricultural work, firewood collection, and washing of clothes by hand, among other strenuous activities that are likely to challenge that cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, we conclude that the differences in the rates of ST-segment depression we observed represent a change in ventricular repolarization but acknowledge that the potential pathophysiology underlying these changes is unknown and may or may not involve ischemia. We cannot rule out the possibility that these differences may have been caused by subject position (e.g., open fires are typically on the floor, and the improved stove is used while standing) or other technical factors not related to air pollution, but studies of ambient particle exposures at much lower concentrations, including one study using the same type of ST-segment depression measure among people conducting their everyday activities (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2008</xref>) and another study finding nonspecific ST changes among healthy subjects at rest (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2009</xref>), support the conclusion that fine combustion particles in wood smoke are responsible for the associations we observed with the improved stove intervention. Controlled exposure studies with more detailed clinical evaluations may prove useful in clarifying the etiology and prognostic value of ST-segment depression associated with biomass smoke exposure.</p><p>To our knowledge, the RESPIRE trial was the first study to examine the association between exposure to wood smoke from household stoves and an electrocardiographic outcome. The risk of ST-segment depression associated with use of traditional open fires may have health implications for the nearly 3 billion people living in rural areas of less developed countries who rely on solid biomass fuels. Household air pollution in developing countries is already estimated to be a leading risk factor for disease globally, because of evidence of respiratory effects (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2004</xref>), and our study adds to concern that previous risk assessments may have underestimated this burden by not including cardiovascular health effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) fieldworkers for their dedication to the project, the Guatemalan Ministry of Health for providing clinical space at the San Lorenzo health center, and G.
