The cost of cigarette
smoking to society is estimated at 193 billion USD each year due to lost
productivity and direct healthcare costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>
Additionally, smoking causes about 30% of all cancer deaths and 80% of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) deaths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>
Smoking is such a costly problem that it is a focus of many government sponsored
programs. Smoking cessation education is mandated by the Joint Commission for
certain disease states when a patient is admitted to the hospital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> It is also a goal for Healthy People 2020 to
decrease the cigarette smoking percentage to 12% by 2020.3</p><p>Recent literature describes the use of pharmacists and student pharmacists to educate
inpatients about smoking cessation to fulfill Joint Commission requirements and to
help patients achieve smoking cessation long term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> The Transtheoretical Model of
Change describes states of behavioral change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Based on this model, patients should be counseled differently

counseling on how to quit if he is not even willing to consider quitting at that
point. Moving a patient forward in their stage of change is considered an important
step to long term behavioral change.</p><p>Currently the respiratory therapy department at our institution provides education in
the form of an information packet with general information about the consequences of
cigarette use and strategies for smoking cessation. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the impact of individualized tobacco cessation counseling provided by
pharmacy residents and students compared to the standard of care for patients in the
inpatient setting at an academic medical center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design, Setting, and Population</title><p>This was a prospective, non-randomized, cohort study approved by the University
of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. The study
population included patients who identified themselves as being either current
cigarette smokers or as a smoker within the last year. Recruitment for the study
was from January 1 through February 28, 2010. Patients were first screened for
inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included patients had to be 18 or older,
English speakers, and admitted to the Family or Internal Medicine teaching
services at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Patients were excluded
if they were admitted to the intensive care unit, had suspected or confirmed
tuberculosis, were mentally incapacitated, or were receiving only comfort
measures. </p></sec><sec><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Individuals who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were interviewed and medical
records were reviewed to obtain demographic data (age, sex, race, level of
education). During the interview, self-reported smoking history (how long he/she
smoked, how many packs per day, previous quit attempts) were obtained, and the
patient was staged according to the Transtheoretical Model of Change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>
The Fagerstr&#x000f6;m test for nicotine dependence was also administered to each
subject.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> Patients admitted to the
control group, the Internal Medicine service, received no additional education.
Patients admitted to the intervention group, the Family Medicine service,
received individualized counseling by pharmacy students and residents on tobacco
cessation strategies and pharmacologic interventions and were provided with an
outpatient cessation program referral. Outpatient programs for referral included
the telephone quit line which is free for Tennessee residents at 1-800-QUIT-NOW
or the Freedom from Smoking program offered by the American Lung Association at
the University of Tennessee Medical Center. The smoking cessation class required
a small deposit which was refunded upon completion of the curriculum regardless
of smoking status making this a free resource as well.</p><p>Prior to providing counseling, students and residents were educated about smoking
cessation and cessation strategies by a pharmacist faculty member who had
completed the Rx for Change&#x000ae; program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>
Therapy was individualized based on each patient&#x02019;s quit stage assessed using the
Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange system recommended in the current
clinical practice guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> and
materials from the Rx for Change&#x000ae; program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> Educational handouts and worksheets from Rx for Change&#x000ae;
focused counseling on areas appropriate to a patient&#x02019;s quit stage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These interventions were provided
in addition to the informational packet provided by respiratory therapy, the
current standard of care. Patients on Internal Medicine service were the control
group receiving only the standard education provided by respiratory therapy
staff. In addition, all patients had access to educational videos while in the
hospital.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definitions of Quit Stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 1: Precontemplative</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not ready to quit within 30 days</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 2: Contemplative</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ready to quit within 30 days</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 3: Action</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recent quitter within the last 6 months</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 4: Maintenance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Former smoker who quit six months to one year

telephone calls to each intervention patient. Data collected during those calls
included self-reported smoking cessation status, participation in an outpatient
treatment program, quit stage, counseling by another healthcare provider, and
pharmacologic therapy being used. The follow-up calls also allowed for further
counseling including relapse prevention strategies, discussion of medication
use, and encouragement. For non-intervention patients, the same data was
recorded, but those patients received only one follow-up call approximately four
weeks after discharge. If patients could not be reached by phone after 5
attempts at different times of the day, they were excluded from data
collection.</p><p>After four weeks, a comparison was made between the two groups for rates of
self-reported smoking cessation, participation in an outpatient cessation
program, receiving counseling from another healthcare provider, change in quit
stage, and use of pharmacotherapy. These criteria were used to assess whether
utilizing pharmacy residents and students to provide individualized counseling
and medication education is effective as an adjunct to standard therapy. </p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p> The alpha value for all statistical tests was established as 0.05. The
demographics of age, years as a smoker, Fagerstr&#x000f6;m score, and packs per day
were compared using independent samples t-test. Previous quit attempts were
compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test due to the violation of
Levene's test for homogeneity of variances when using the independent
samples t-test. Pearson chi squared analysis was used to compare sex and
education, and the Fisher's exact test was used to determine if race was
equitably distributed between the two groups. The Fisher's exact test was
needed due to the sample size of one of the populations being less than five.
Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare groups for
abstinence and use of pharmacotherapy. The evaluation of quit stage change,
utilization of an outpatient treatment program, and provision of counseling by
another healthcare professional was a comparison of percentages between
groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Initially, we screened 118 patients from both the intervention and control groups. We

healthcare system, any opportunity for educating and counseling patients on smoking
cessation should be optimized. In addition, tobacco abuse often takes multiple
attempts to quit. Therefore, it is important to assess a patient with each
healthcare system encounter and offer counseling where appropriate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></p><p>There has been an increased interest in educating healthcare professionals and
encouraging them to offer counseling to smokers and recent quitters. Several trials
have assessed the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided smoking cessation counseling
in the inpatient, community, or clinic setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>
Our study focused on providing smoking cessation counseling to patients in the acute
care setting on the teaching services usually staffed with pharmacy students,
residents, and preceptors. We hoped to show benefit for patients while implementing
this counseling program as part of the resident and student learning experience.
These groups were also chosen due to the similarity of the patient populations.
Although the demographic information between groups was very similar, at baseline,
the intervention patients smoked more packs per day and had fewer previous quit
attempts. This difference would seem to make it more difficult to show a benefit in
the intervention group. Despite this, the results trend toward benefit in the
intervention group for pharmacologic therapy use and abstinence; however, they are
not statistically significant. An additional finding is that none of the patients in
the intervention group regressed in their quit stage, compared to 36.8% of control
patients. These results are encouraging, especially since the intervention group had
a more significant smoking history than the controls. Future studies in this area
should include a larger study sample with a longer period for recruitment and
follow-up.</p><p>There are several limitations to the study. The sample size in both groups was
prohibitively small, and the sample size between groups was inequitable.
Furthermore, the short time frame for recruitment and follow-up limited our study
population, and recruitment was slower than expected. Another confounder is that
smoking status was self reported and not verified by laboratory means. These issues
may have limited our ability clearly to demonstrate a statistically significant
difference in the intervention group. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results showed a trend toward significance for abstinence and increased use of
outpatient pharmacotherapy in patients provided Transtheoretical Model of
Change-based smoking cessation counseling conducted by pharmacy students and
residents. However, our sample size and study period limit conclusions that may be
drawn. While the initial findings of this pilot study are encouraging, more
extensive study should be conducted to show definitive benefit.. Smoking cessation
counseling by resident and student pharmacists is mutually beneficial as it provides
a valuable learning experience for patients, students, and residents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledgement Robert E. Heidel, M.S., Ph.D. for
