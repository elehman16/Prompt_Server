Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Heimberg, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Rodebaugh, Holaway, &#x00026; Heimberg, 2004</xref>). However, a significant number of individuals do not benefit from CBT (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Arch &#x00026; Craske, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, new behavioral treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hayes, Strosahl, &#x00026; Wilson, 1999</xref>) have emerged that draw from Eastern mindfulness meditation practice, and preliminary evidence supports their effectiveness for anxiety disorders (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Eifert &#x00026; Forsyth, 2005</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms that drive treatment response is essential for optimizing their delivery and improving outcomes (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin, 2007</xref>). The goal of the current study was to examine possible mediators of treatment outcome in two treatments for social anxiety disorder&#x02014;CBT and ACT&#x02014;to better understand why these treatments work.</p><p id="P6">Testing mediators in randomized controlled trials can tell us why and how treatments are effective (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer, Wilson, Fairburn, &#x00026; Agras, 2002</xref>), and comparison of mechanisms across two active treatments may ultimately help us tailor treatment approaches based on an individual&#x02019;s presentation. For a rigorous test of treatment mediation, the mediators must be tested during treatment and preferably at multiple time points. Doing so ensures that the mediator temporally precedes the outcome (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2002</xref>), and assessing mediators at multiple time points throughout treatment allows assessment of change in mediators over time. Multilevel modeling is optimal for nested designs where repeated measures are collected within individuals (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kenny, Kashy, &#x00026; Bolger, 1998</xref>). In addition, multilevel modeling handles missing data effectively. As reviewed below, few studies have examined treatment mediators using this rigorous approach.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Evidence for Treatment Mediators in CBT and ACT</title><p id="P7">The cognitive model for social anxiety disorder posits that reductions in negative cognitions in relation to social situations explain subsequent symptom reduction following CBT (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Craske, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2008</xref>). In support of this purported mediator, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann (2004)</xref> found that reduction in social cost ratings (patient ratings of &#x0201c;How bad would it be?&#x0201d; if a feared social outcome occurred) from pre- to post-treatment predicted symptom reduction. However, since social cost ratings were not measured during treatment, rigorous testing of the mediator as a temporal precedent to the outcome was not conducted. In another study, session-by-session ratings of the probability of a negative social outcome predicted subsequent fear reduction (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Smits, Rosenfield, McDonald, &#x00026; Telch, 2006</xref>). The mediator was measured during treatment and prior to the outcome, and the authors used multilevel modeling to model change in the mediator over time. However, to fully understand whether a mediator is specific to CBT (as opposed to common treatment processes), it is necessary to compare CBT mediators with those of another active treatment (see <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Arch &#x00026; Craske, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P8">ACT (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 1999</xref>) has been shown to be effective for anxiety disorders (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Eifert, et al., 2012</xref>), and in one randomized controlled trial, ACT was effective for social anxiety disorder in particular (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Dalrymple &#x00026; Herbert, 2007</xref>). ACT aims to promote mindfulness, acceptance, and cognitive defusion (learning to detach from thoughts and observe them more dispassionately) with the ultimate goal of increasing psychological flexibility and promoting behavior change that aligns with one&#x02019;s life values (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 1999</xref>). Decreased experiential avoidance, or becoming more willing to experience uncomfortable physical sensations and emotions, has been proposed as a possible mechanism of change (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In a study of ACT for social anxiety disorder, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Dalrymple and Herbert (2007)</xref> found that greater increases in acceptance and cognitive defusion by midtreatment predicted better outcomes posttreatment, whereas greater perceived control over anxiety (a more CBT consistent mediator measure) did not. However, the meaningfulness of these results was limited by the fact that the mediator was assessed only once midtreatment, and difference scores were calculated to assess the effect of the mediator on treatment outcomes. Repeated measurement of the mediator at multiple time points throughout treatment and subsequent analysis using growth curve modeling would allow for a more fine-grained assessment of how the mediator changes throughout treatment.</p><p id="P10">To our knowledge, only one study has compared treatment mediators in CBT and ACT. <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, and Craske (2012)</xref> examined treatment mediators in CBT and ACT for individuals with a variety of anxiety disorders. Participants with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia were randomized to 12 sessions of either CBT or ACT. Participants completed measures of purported treatment mediators (negative beliefs in CBT and cognitive defusion in ACT) repeatedly throughout treatment. Using multilevel modeling, both purported mediators were found to change significantly in both treatments, with experiential avoidance and negative cognitions decreasing more in ACT than in CBT. Also, change in both purported mediators significantly predicted symptom reduction and increased quality of life in both treatments, suggesting similarity in the change mechanisms in ACT and CBT.</p><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>CURRENT STUDY</title><p id="P11">The current study included analysis of session-by-session data from a treatment study in which ACT and CBT were compared for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Patients in both treatment groups demonstrated significant symptom reduction following completion of treatment, and the two groups did not significantly differ posttreatment, or at 6- or 12-month follow-ups (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We assessed the following research questions: First, do CBT and ACT affect negative cognitions and experiential avoidance, which have been posited as mediators of treatment outcome in CBT and ACT, respectively? In accordance with the theoretical models underlying each treatment approach, we hypothesized that negative cognitions would decrease more in CBT than in ACT, and that experiential avoidance would decrease more in ACT than in CBT. Even though previous research showed that experiential avoidance <italic>and</italic> negative cognitions decreased to a greater extent in ACT than in CBT, we linked our hypotheses to theory in the absence of replicated empirical data to the contrary.</p><p id="P13">Second, we addressed whether negative cognitions and experiential avoidance mediated treatment outcomes. The <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> approach to mediation requires that the independent variable <italic>X</italic> is related to the outcome <italic>Y</italic>. Although no differences were found between treatment groups (<italic>X</italic>) on treatment outcome (<italic>Y</italic>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2014</xref>), more recent approaches to testing mediation no longer require a significant relationship between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, &#x00026; Sheets, 2002</xref>). <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fritz and MacKinnon (2007)</xref> suggest that the original <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> approach is underpowered and increases the likelihood of Type II error. In addition, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Arch and Craske (2008)</xref> argue that even in the absence of significant differences in treatment outcome, the examination of mediators can address important questions about similarities and differences in how these two treatments produce change. Thus, we proceeded with testing mediation in this trial despite no group differences in treatment outcome.</p><p id="P14">In line with the respective theoretical models, change in negative cognitions should mediate outcomes in CBT, whereas change in experiential avoidance should mediate outcomes in ACT. Therefore, we hypothesized that negative cognitions would predict greater improvement in CBT than in ACT, whereas experiential avoidance would predict greater improvement in ACT than in CBT. Again, this hypothesis was not supported in previous research, in which reductions in negative cognitions and experiential avoidance similarly predicted treatment outcome across ACT and CBT (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>), but in the absence of replicated empirical data, we deemed it more logical to hypothesize based on theorized mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Method</title><sec id="S8" sec-type="subjects"><title>PARTICIPANTS</title><p id="P15">Seventy-one participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a principal or co-principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, generalized type, were randomized to ACT (<italic>n</italic> = 34) or CBT (<italic>n</italic> = 37).

Thirty-eight participants completed measures at all five sessions, 11 completed four measures, 1 completed three measures, and 2 completed two measures.

For the outcome measures (symptoms, quality of life, and anhedonic depression), 4 participants were missing data at baseline with 2 participants missing only the quality-of-life measure and 2 missing all three measures.

These estimates represent the direction and steepness of curvature for each participant. Positive curvature indicates that the curve is convex, or that change occurs more quickly at the beginning of treatment and levels off toward the end.

In particular, we were interested in whether avoidance of uncomfortable internal experiences (experiential avoidance) decreased to a greater extent in ACT than in CBT, and whether negative cognitions in social situations decreased to a greater extent in CBT than in ACT. Experiential avoidance showed a nonlinear decline in both treatments, with ACT showing a convex curve (steeper at the beginning of treatment) and CBT showing a concave curve (steeper at the end of treatment). As hypothesized, experiential avoidance decreased to a greater extent in ACT than in CBT. This finding is not surprising given that ACT directly targets experiential avoidance in the first five sessions. However, during the second half of treatment in which exposure to reduce fearfulness is emphasized in CBT and exposure to increase living a valued life is emphasized in ACT, the rate of decline in experiential avoidance increased in CBT and slowed in ACT. This suggests that the cognitive defusion approach used in ACT and the behavioral exposure approach used in CBT may have the most pronounced effect on willingness to experience uncomfortable internal experiences, although this cannot be directly tested in the current study. This finding replicates previous research, which showed greater decreases in experiential avoidance in ACT than in CBT (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Negative cognitions also decreased significantly in both treatments. The decrease was nonlinear and convex (steeper at the beginning of treatment) in ACT, and was linear in CBT. Contrary to hypotheses, at the beginning of treatment, negative cognitions decreased more quickly in ACT than in CBT. However, by the end of treatment, both groups had shown the same reduction in negative cognitions as the decline slowed in ACT but remained constant in CBT. This finding replicates previous research, which showed greater decreases in negative cognitions in ACT than in CBT (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>). Again, although not directly tested, the cognitive defusion approach used in ACT and the behavioral exposure approach in CBT seem to have caused the greatest reduction in negative cognitions. This finding is surprising given that ACT does not directly aim to change thinking patterns while CBT does. However, cognitive restructuring has been compared with thought suppression (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 1999</xref>) because it labels certain cognitions as &#x0201c;faulty,&#x0201d; which may encourage suppression of those thoughts. Suppression is thought to be counterproductive, according to the ACT framework, as it can result in increased intrusion of suppressed thoughts (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Wegner, 1994</xref>). In addition, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Eifert and Forsyth (2005)</xref> have argued that focusing attention on the content of negative thoughts maintains the ruminative cycle. These findings lend support to the idea that mindfulness and acceptance may be a more effective way of reducing negative thoughts than cognitive restructuring, while behavioral exposure to feared situations in CBT may prove to be more effective at reducing negative thoughts than the values-driven approach emphasized in ACT. In other words, despite similarities between the behavioral approaches in ACT and CBT, the differences in framing and structure appear to yield differential effects on cognitive change.</p><p id="P51">The second goal of the study was to examine experiential avoidance and negative cognitions as mediators of treatment outcome. We tested whether the curvature (or nonlinear effect) of experiential avoidance and negative cognitions mediated outcome differentially in ACT and CBT (moderated mediation), and if there were not group differences, whether the mediators were shared between the two treatments. If neither mediation model was significant, we tested a prediction model. Using the MacArthur guidelines as outlined by <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al. (2002)</xref>, the curvature in experiential avoidance emerged as a significant mediator of social anxiety symptom reduction and depressive symptom reduction in ACT and not in CBT such that participants with greater reduction in experiential avoidance at the beginning of treatment had better outcomes only within ACT. Consistent with hypotheses and contrary to previous results examining treatment mediation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>), experiential avoidance was a mechanism of treatment outcome only within ACT. Although curvature in negative cognitions did not differ between the two treatments and therefore was not a significant mediator, it was a predictor of improvement regardless of group such that greater reduction in negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment predicted better outcome. These findings indicate that how quickly negative cognitions change in treatment is an important factor in improvement across both treatments.</p><p id="P52">It is important to note that no significant differences in treatment outcome emerged between ACT and CBT, which makes interpretation of mediation results more complex. For experiential avoidance, greater reductions were found in ACT than in CBT, and experiential avoidance was related to better treatment outcome more so in ACT than in CBT. These findings imply better outcomes in ACT than CBT, but we did not find such differences. There are at least two factors that may explain this contradiction. The first is an additional mediator that decreases to a greater extent in CBT than in ACT may not have been measured in the current study. Possibilities include control over negative thoughts, self-efficacy, behavioral avoidance, or adherence to behavioral exposures. The second possibility is that ACT did, in fact, work better than CBT, but that we did not have sufficient power to detect this difference. As indicated in <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al. (2014)</xref>, we had enough power to detect only a large effect size difference between ACT and CBT. That being said, differences between ACT and CBT did not even approach significance in the complete sample, and for some outcome measures, participants in CBT showed marginally greater symptom reduction than did those in ACT (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Niles, Mesri, Burklund, Lieberman, &#x00026; Craske, 2013</xref>). In another study comparing ACT and CBT across multiple anxiety disorders with a larger sample size, no group differences were found (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Eifert, et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that ACT would have outperformed CBT had our sample been larger. It is more likely that the key mechanism of change for CBT was not measured in the current study.</p><p id="P53">These findings provide evidence that the rate of change in experiential avoidance and negative cognitions, particularly at the beginning of treatment, does, in fact, explain a significant portion of the variance in treatment outcome (approximately 15&#x02013;20%), albeit differentially in ACT and CBT. This is the first study to show that change mechanisms may differ in ACT and CBT. Given that experiential avoidance is the primary target of change in ACT, it is not surprising that experiential avoidance was a significant mediator only for ACT. However, the results conflict with an earlier study with a mixed anxiety disorder sample (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>), where differential mediation in ACT and CBT was not established. One possible explanation of the contradictory findings is that treatment mechanisms differ for a social anxiety sample and a mixed anxiety sample. The studies also differed in the way the mediators were measured and treated in analyses. For the ACT-specific mediator, the current study used the AAQ, which is more widely validated than the Believability of Anxious Feelings and Thoughts Questionnaire used in the previous study. The CBT-specific mediator for the current study was a cognitive measure specific to social situations, whereas the measure in the previous study, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, was intended to capture cognitive mechanisms across anxiety disorders. Finally, the current study examined nonlinear change of the mediators and used simultaneous regression models to test mediation, while the previous study assessed linear change for the mediators and tested mediation using two separate models. Therefore, although both approaches can be used to assess mediation, the different methods used in the two studies could explain the difference in findings.</p><p id="P54">Several study limitations should be noted. First, we were only able to test one hypothesized mediator of each treatment model given that measurements were taken repeatedly throughout treatment and concerns about participant burden limited the number of mediators that could be assessed. Future studies may aim to assess additional mediators, including controllability of negative thinking, self-efficacy, or the content of anxiety-related thoughts for CBT, and acceptance, cognitive defusion, behavioral commitments, or values clarification for ACT. Second, ACT and CBT were matched on the number of sessions spent on exposure exercises, which likely minimized group differences in mediation pathways. Comparing cognitive therapy to a mindfulness-based approach to anxiety treatment would likely result in greater group differences in mediation. Third, our assessed mediators and outcomes were based on self-report questionnaires. Future studies would benefit from integrating behavioral and brain-based measurements of mediators and outcomes. Fourth, the SSPS was developed for use in a public speaking context and reflects cognitions that individuals with social phobia report following public speaking. We therefore cannot be certain that the negative cognitions captured with this measure are the same as those experienced in other social situations. Fifth, the test&#x02013;retest reliability of the AAQ-9 was only .64, which indicates that the measure may not be sufficiently stable over time. The 16-item version, however, demonstrated a correlation of .86 between Sessions 8 and 10 of treatment, indicating that within our sample, the measure was quite stable. Sixth, the AAQ and SSPS were significantly correlated (<italic>r</italic> ranged from .47 to .71), indicating that these measures assess similar constructs. Despite significant overlap, however, it is notable that mediation results differed between the two measures. Finally, our sample was relatively young, well educated, and more likely to be single compared with the population. Therefore, it is possible that our results would not generalize to a more diverse sample.</p><p id="P55">In conclusion, these findings shed light on how cognitive processes change in ACT and CBT for social anxiety disorder and how these processes relate to treatment outcome. For both treatment approaches, negative thoughts decreased and willingness to have uncomfortable internal experiences increased, indicating that these treatment approaches overlap significantly in terms of their effect on cognitive change. <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Arch and Craske (2008)</xref> reviewed the similarities between these two treatment approaches, and the current project adds to existing research on these similarities (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., 2012</xref>). Patients whose negative thinking decreased more quickly at the beginning of treatment demonstrated the greatest symptom reduction across both treatment approaches, and those with the fastest increase in willingness to experience uncomfortable sensations had greater symptom reduction in ACT but not in CBT. In other words, faster reduction in negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment predicted overall improvement, and faster reduction in experiential avoidance predicted improvement only for ACT.</p><p id="P56">These findings have a number of important implications for treatment. First, change in the core mechanisms of psychopathology early in treatment may enable subsequent symptom change to occur in the time remaining before the end of treatment. By extension, the role of early change may differ if symptom change was examined over a lengthier interval. Second, these findings could indicate that change in negative beliefs is central to social anxiety psychopathology independent of treatment approach, whereas change in acceptance is less relevant to psychopathology in general, but more relevant to the effects of a specific treatment strategy. Third, early change in core mechanisms may allow other critical mechanisms, such as engagement in exposure and values-driven activities, to take place, which may contribute to better symptom outcome. Finally, these findings highlight the importance of strategies specifically designed to reduce negative cognitions and experiential avoidance early in treatment, such as emphasizing cognitive defusion and exposure within the first few sessions of treatment. Overall, these findings add to a growing body of literature on treatment mediation for anxiety disorders and begin to shed light on differences in mechanisms between ACT and CBT for social anxiety disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><p>This project was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health R21 MH081299 (PIs: Craske, Lieberman, and Taylor).
