TPM is a holistic medicine, and its therapeutic advice is based on individual differences among patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The first-line intervention for treatment of the chronic disease as well as constipation (<italic>E&#x02019;ateghql-e-batn</italic>) is correcting the lifestyle of the patients based on TPM suggestion.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Modern medicine has defined changing lifestyle as an important way for treatment of functional constipation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Recent studies revealed the effect of facilitation of natural anthraquinone drugs such as <italic>Senna</italic>, cascara, <italic>Frangula</italic>, and <italic>Olea</italic> for stool defecation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Besides, most patients with chronic constipation prefer to use available, simple, and safe ways and take natural laxative rather than chemical medicine to cure their problems.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of the combination of lactulose plus TPM suggestions and lactulose without TPM suggestions.</p><p>As lactulose is metabolized by the colonic bacterial flora to produce short-chain fatty acids, one would expect that its laxative effect would be associated with a notable production of gases including carbon monoxide, methane, and hydrogen. Most of the common side effects attributed to lactulose such as abdominal pain, bloating, and flatus are thought to result from this colonic fermentation. In oral drugs, laxatives have been used very frequently in constipated patients.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have focused on the comparison of different medicaments with lactulose. Polyethylene glycol is a well-tolerated medicine which has been repeatedly compared to lactulose in constipated patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] On the other hand, some herbal medicaments such as a <italic>Senna</italic>-fiber combination (10 ml/daily) have also been compared to lactulose (15 ml/twice daily) and a matched placebo in geriatric constipation. During a period of 14 days in that study, the mean daily bowel frequency as well as ease of evacuation and stool consistency scores was found greater in <italic>Senna</italic>-fiber as compared to lactulose.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In this study, both treatment methods had similar efficacy in relieving the symptoms, and most patients in both groups were did not have ROME III criteria of constipation. Pain sensation during defecation decreased more in patients who received lactulose only compared to the patients of the other group; the recent result needs to be investigated further, but also this may be referred to palliative effect of lactulose.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] These results reveal that the lactulose plus TPM advice group was better than the lactulose group in practice and patients verbally.</p><p>No significant adverse events were reported by the patients. The lesser chance of recovery in this study may be due to chronicity of the disease in most of the patients and history of receiving multiple drugs and tolerance to medication. Finally, it should be noted that the study was designed as a pilot, the number of the cases was low, and the intervention period lasted only for 1 month.</p><p>Preventive measures (six basic principles) and therapeutic schemes according to TPM sources maintain the health of other body organs, especially alleviating GI problems and constipation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] According to this study, preventive measures recommended by TPM sages show their positive effects gradually and more prominent by reducing the consumption dosage of lactulose by patients located in B group. These measures are safe and inexpensive; however, having a healthy lifestyle based on TPM recommendations seems difficult at the starting point. Many patients are interested in using TPM recommendations and prioritize it to conventional medicines.</p><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The blinded trial and close follow-up were done in the study.
