Research has shown that this is effective. However, a potential harm is excessive protrusion of the lower front teeth. This is associated with gingival recession, loss of tooth support, and root resorption. This trial evaluates a method of reducing this problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par4">The study is a single-center, randomised, assessor-blinded, superiority clinical&#x000a0;trial with parallel 1:1 allocation.&#x000a0;Male and female young people (10&#x02013;14 years old) with prominent front teeth (class II, division 1) will be treated in one orthodontic clinic. Group 1 will be treated with the conventional Herbst appliance with dental anchorage and group 2 with the Herbst appliance with indirect skeletal anchorage for 12&#x000a0;months. The primary objective will be to compare the proclination of the lower incisors between the Herbst appliance with dental anchorage and skeletal anchorage. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the changes occurring between the groups in the mandible, maxilla, lower and upper molars, and in gingival recession and root resorption at the end of the treatment. Additionally, the young patient&#x02019;s experience using the appliances will be assessed. The primary outcome measure will be the amount of lower incisor proclination at the end of treatment. This will be assessed by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) superimposition. Secondary outcome measures will be the changes in the mandible, maxilla, lower and upper molars at the end of treatment assessed by tomography superimposition and the young patient&#x02019;s experience using the appliances assessed by self-reported questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The randomisation method will be blocked randomisation, using software to generate a randomised list. The allocation concealment will be done in opaque envelopes numbered from 1 to 40 containing the treatment modality. The randomisation will be implemented by the secretary of the Department of Orthodontics of Rio de Janeiro State University before the beginning of the study. The patients and the orthodontists who will treat the patients cannot be blinded, as they will know the type of appliance used. The technician who will take the CBCT image and the data analyst will be blinded to patients&#x02019; group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par5">If this new intervention is effective, the findings can change orthodontic practice and may also be relevant to other forms of treatment in which appliances are fixed to the bones of the jaws. However, if the bone anchoring is not effective, the trial will provide much needed information on the use of this comparatively new development.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">ClinicalTrials.gov, protocol ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02411812?term=NCT02411812&#x00026;recrs=ab&#x00026;rank=1">NCT0241812</ext-link>.

This may range from the correction of a few crooked teeth to severe problems associated with craniofacial anomalies. One of the most common orthodontic problems is prominent upper front teeth (class II malocclusion). The prevalence of this condition is high and comprises approximately 50% of orthodontic problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prominent teeth are associated with low perception of appearance. This may result in psychosocial problems and teasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, upper front teeth are at risk of being traumatised with subsequent damage or even loss.</p><p id="Par18">Different types of braces have been developed for the treatment of class II malocclusion. These are called functional appliances and they correct the position of the incisor teeth. A popular type of functional appliance is the Herbst appliance. This is fixed to the teeth and has been shown to be very effective. Nevertheless, there are concerns that this appliance can result in harm to the teeth and supporting bone. This is because it moves the lower incisors forwards (proclination). This may result in recession of the gums, resorption of the roots and general concerns about the long-term health of the lower incisors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">With the intention of solving these problems, we developed a version of the Herbst appliance that is fixed to the bone of the lower jaw and not attached to the teeth (skeletal anchorage); thus, removing the forward directed force on the lower incisors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par20">The primary objective is to compare the effects of the Herbst appliance with either skeletal anchorage or dental anchorage on the position of the lower incisors in the treatment of young people with class II malocclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par21">

The Herbst appliance is a fixed functional appliance, which is becoming widely used worldwide. One of the side effects observed after its use is a vestibular inclination of the lower incisors. If this is not controlled the probability of relapse and other harms may be high.</p><p id="Par81">This trial will only be the second trial of the Herbst appliance and the first to evaluate the potential of skeletal anchorage. As a result, the trial will generate much needed evidence for this rather complex form of orthodontic treatment. It will also serve as a model for other trials of orthodontic treatment techniques.</p><p id="Par82">If we find that this new intervention is effective, the findings will change orthodontic practice and may also be relevant to other forms of treatment in which appliances are fixed to the bones of the jaws. However, if the bone anchoring is not effective, the trial will provide much needed information on the use of this comparatively new development. Finally, this will be the first trial that uses CBCT technology to measure tooth and skeletal bone change. This would be an important development and be a model for future research that uses this new method of image capture and analysis.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par83">The trial has been recruiting since August 2015, with an expectation to finish the recruitment in August 2018.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Safety reporting</title><sec id="Sec40"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par84">In the case of adverse events, we will consider two types of adverse event:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par85">Non-serious adverse event: this will be any kind of adverse event resulting from the treatment.
