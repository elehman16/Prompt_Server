There is a range of treatment options, including several topical and oral antibiotics, however, these are only partially effective and side effects may limit their use<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> Also, there are global concerns about the increasing rates of resistance to antibiotics resulting from their widespread use, particularly with long-term use in chronic conditions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For example, the United Kingdom Standing Medical Advisory Committee now recommends the fewest number of antibiotic courses should be prescribed for the shortest period possible.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Among the alternative therapies to antibiotics, medical-grade kanuka honey is of interest due to its potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref> The pathophysiological rationale underlying its use is that rosacea is an inflammatory disorder, and that antigenic proteins related to the bacterium <italic>Bacillus oleronius</italic> isolated from the <italic>Demodex folliculorum</italic> mite, which infests the skin in rosacea, exacerbates this inflammatory response.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, people with rosacea express abnormally high levels of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, which promotes the inflammatory response in rosacea.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>A recent pilot study of topical medical-grade kanuka honey as a treatment for rosacea found it to be an acceptable and potentially effective treatment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The addition of 10% glycerine to the honey has resulted in a product that is easier to apply to the skin. In this randomised controlled trial, we have investigated the efficacy of kanuka honey in the treatment of rosacea. We designed the trial to overcome the recognised limitations of previous studies, in particular to ensure that there was blinded investigator assessment of rosacea severity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This parallel group, randomised, controlled trial with assessor blinding was undertaken at a hospital-based research facility and four community-based research and/or primary care sites in New Zealand. Ethics approval was obtained from the Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee (13/CEN/118). Adults aged 16 or over with a doctor's diagnosis of rosacea on the face, and a baseline blinded Investigator Global Assessment of Rosacea Severity Score (IGA-RSS) of facial rosacea of &#x02265;2 were recruited. The IGA-RSS is a 7-point scale (from 0: &#x02018;clear&#x02019;, to 6: &#x02018;severe&#x02019;) that provides an integrated assessment of rosacea severity based on the principal facial signs of papules/pustules, inflammatory lesions, erythema and telangiectasia<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (see online supplementary table S1). Participants were identified at the time of first presentation or, with their primary care practitioner's consent, from pre-existing databases, or by public advertisement.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included current requirement for systemic corticosteroids, or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the 4&#x02005;weeks prior to visit 1, current requirement for oral or topical antibiotic therapy for rosacea, current requirement for topical corticosteroid treatment for rosacea, known or suspected allergy to honey, or Cetomacrogol control cream, or any other condition which, at the investigators discretion, it was believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results.</p><p>Participants attended for 3 visits (see online supplementary table S2). Visit 1 (week 0) consisted of consent, baseline assessments (the IGA-RSS), a participant-rated rosacea severity visual analogue score (VAS-S) on a 100&#x02005;mm scale (0&#x02005;mm being &#x02018;mildest possible&#x02019; symptoms and 100&#x02005;mm being &#x02018;worst possible&#x02019; symptoms), and a participant-rated dermatology quality of life index (DLQI),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> followed by randomisation to Honevo or Cetomacrogol cream (control). At visit 2 (week 2) and visit 3 (week 8), as well as the IGA-RSS and the DLQI, participants completed a subjective rosacea &#x02018;change in severity&#x02019; visual analogue scale (VAS-CS) on a 100&#x02005;mm scale (0&#x02005;mm being &#x02018;much worse&#x02019; and 100&#x02005;mm being &#x02018;much improved&#x02019;). Participants&#x02019; diaries were used throughout the study to capture each participant's weekly subjective VAS-S, their use of randomised treatment throughout the 8-week study period, and any general comments including adverse events throughout the study.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Treatment allocation was randomised using a computer generated sequence concealed to investigators by enclosing the proposed treatment arm in an opaque envelope that was opened only by primary investigators after informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the topical application of Honevo or control cream. Owing to the nature of Honevo, it was not possible to blind the participants and primary investigators to the treatment allocation. An independent investigator at each site remained blinded to the treatment allocation throughout the study to perform the blinded IGA. The blinded investigator undertook only the IGA-RSS assessment for this study, and was not involved in any other study procedures. Participants were instructed not to communicate with the blinded investigator during the assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomised treatments</title><p>The Investigational Product was topical medical-grade kanuka honey with 10% glycerine content (Honevo).

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The participants were instructed to apply an appropriate amount of cream to the affected area twice daily for 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min per application, for 8&#x02005;weeks, and to remove the treatment with warm water as desired. Participants were asked not to use any additional treatment for their rosacea for the duration of the study, as per the exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants who had a &#x02265;2 improvement (reduction) in the IGA-RSS at week 8 (designated &#x02018;responders&#x02019;). This measure represents a clinically meaningful improvement in severity of rosacea. The secondary outcome measures included the change from baseline in IGA-RSS at weeks 2 and 8; the participant-rated VAS-CS at weeks 2 and 8; the change from baseline in participant-rated VAS-S at weeks 2 and 8; the weekly diary-documented Rosacea severity VAS-S from participant diaries; the change from baseline in the participant-rated DLQI<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> at weeks 2 and 8; withdrawals due to worsening of Rosacea; adverse events; and the daily self-reported use of Honevo (applications per day).

About one-third of participants had a clinically significant improvement in the IGA-RSS after 8&#x02005;weeks of Honevo treatment, twofold greater than that observed with the control treatment. We recommend consideration of the use of kanuka honey as a treatment for rosacea.</p><p>There are a number of methodological issues that are important in the consideration of the study findings. There are no standard validated tools for assessing the severity of rosacea, which is inherently difficult due to its varied clinical characteristics. The priority with this study of a honey product was to reduce potential bias by blinding of clinical assessments where possible, as the participant could not be blinded due to the appearance and smell of Honevo. It was for this reason we chose to use the seven-point IGA-RSS representing a global assessment of severity of rosacea that was undertaken by an investigator who was blinded to treatment.</p><p>The primary outcome variable identified the proportion in each treatment arm who had a two-point reduction or more in IGA-RSS, representing a clinically meaningful improvement in severity of rosacea, for example, a change from &#x02018;severe&#x02019; to &#x02018;moderate&#x02019;, or from &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; to &#x02018;mild&#x02019;. Thirty-four per cent of those who were randomised to Honevo had an IGA-RSS improvement of two or more at 8&#x02005;weeks compared to 17% of the placebo group, and 13% achieved full resolution of rosacea compared to 3% in the placebo group. Although these point estimates are consistent with effectiveness, the CIs are wide which could be consistent with a small effect or quite large effect. This is especially the case for the post hoc analysis of IGA-RSS for the proportion of participants with complete resolution, which although it favours the active treatment, could be consistent with quite a small effect. The estimate of the location shift for the difference between the treatments was &#x02212;1, (95% CI &#x02212;1 to 0) at both weeks 2 and 8 and the estimated change in IGA-RSS at week 8 adjusted for baseline was &#x02212;0.6 (95% CI &#x02212;1.1 to &#x02212;0.2). These findings reflect the variability in response to Honevo, perhaps dependent on subtypes of rosacea which were not assessed in this study.</p><p>In addition, we assessed patient-reported outcomes, based on participant's assessment of current severity of symptoms (VAS-S), participant's perceived change in severity (VAS-CS), and the DLQI questionnaire, to provide a comprehensive assessment of efficacy. The VAS-CS at the 2-week and 8-week clinic visits was significantly better with Honevo. However, there was no difference with the 2-week and 8-week DLQI assessments or the weekly diary VAS-S measures. Thus, the patient assessments were not completely consistent with the other assessments of efficacy. This could mean that the variability in these led to insufficient statistical power to detect a difference, or in the context of rosacea, that an ideal measurement related to efficacy that is sensitive to change needs further development. The rosacea quality-of-life instrument has been recently reviewed in addition to the DLQI and a generic health-related quality-of-life instrument, the SF-36, in rosacea, and may be a suitable instrument for future research.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the absence of a validated VAS for rosacea severity, it is difficult to comment on the clinical relevance of a reduction of 11 points from baseline in the VAS-S or the 12.3 improvement in VAS-CS in the Honevo group compared to the control group after 8&#x02005;weeks. As these outcomes were participant assessed and participants could not be blinded to the interventions, there is a risk of detection bias in this methodology. The DLQI is a questionnaire non-specific to rosacea and may not have been sensitive enough to capture changes associated with this condition alone. The drop-out rate for this study was greater than anticipated, which will need to be factored into future research in similar clinical studies. The greater number of withdrawals due to worsening rosacea in the control group (12% vs 4%), and overall withdrawals is likely to have led to an underestimation of the efficacy of Honevo, as these participants did not undergo assessment of the secondary outcome variables following withdrawal.</p><p>Cetomacrogol cream was chosen as a comparator as it is a non-ionic moisturising cream, often used as a vehicle for delivery of topical medications.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The treatment was administered for 8&#x02005;weeks to allow both the speed of onset and the duration of effect to be assessed. This identified that honey had efficacy within 2&#x02005;weeks of treatment, with further efficacy obtained during the 8-week treatment period. Adverse event data did not allow us to reliably ascertain whether the rosacea-specific adverse events such as burning, itching, peeling, stinging, dry skin and pain were associated only with the application of the investigational medicine or whether they were ongoing rosacea symptoms. However, it was reassuring that the number of participants with rosacea-specific adverse events was similar between Honevo and the paraffin-based emollient control cream.</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations of comparing different primary outcome variables utilised in other studies of rosacea, it is interesting to note the findings from placebo-controlled studies of topical metronidazole or azelaic acid, two of the more commonly used treatments for rosacea.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> In studies of topical metronidazole, the relative risk of improvement with the physician's global evaluation of improvement was 1.95 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.6), and in studies of azelaic cream the relative risk of participant-assessed improvement was 1.52 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.8).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In our study, the relative risk of IGA-RSS improvement with Honevo was 2.0 (95%CI 1.1 to 3.7), and in the post hoc analysis the relative risk of resolution was 4.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 20.4). It is difficult to indirectly compare the results of these studies of two other active treatments against placebo with the study reported here, as the characteristics of the research participants may have been quite different and the outcome variable of global improvement may not correspond to that used in this study. Despite this, we have found sufficient evidence of efficacy, albeit with wide CIs, that a reasonable next stage is to conduct randomised controlled trials comparing Honevo with topical metronidazole or azelaic cream.</p><p>The mechanism of action was not assessed in this study, however, there are a number of potential mechanisms relevant to the efficacy demonstrated with kanuka honey in this study. First, kanuka honey has a number of different anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of neutrophil superoxide production,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reduction in inflammatory leucocyte infiltration and arachidonic-induced oedema,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and stimulation of macrophage release of tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a cytokine with a crucial role in wound healing.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These properties may be relevant as rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder, characterised by inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular dilation and tissue oedema.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, kanuka honey has high antibacterial activities against a wide range of bacteria, including <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium acne</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> properties which may be beneficial in view of the proposed role of <italic>B. oleronius</italic> in the inflammatory response in rosacea. The effect of honey on <italic>B. oleronius</italic> and the <italic>Demodex folliculum</italic> mite requires further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomised controlled trial has demonstrated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of 90% medical-grade kanuka honey and 10% glycerine (Honevo) in the treatment of rosacea. Honevo can be recommended for the treatment of rosacea; however, further randomised controlled trials comparing Honevo with topical metronidazole and azelaic acid are now required to determine its relative efficacy and side effect profile compared to these agents.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Guarantor:</bold>Dr I Braithwaite had access to all the data on the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and accuracy of the data analysis.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JF, JK, MH, MW and RB contributed to study concept and design.
