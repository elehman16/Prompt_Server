This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot PE intervention on physical activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were 139 children aged 10&#x02013;11 years from four schools. For six weeks children in two schools received a twice-weekly pilot &#x02018;Born to Move&#x02019; (BTM) physical activity (PA) and fitness intervention alongside one regular PE lesson. Children in the two comparison (COM) schools received their regular twice weekly PE lessons. Outcomes were lesson time and whole-day light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), and MVPA, and sedentary time, muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and lesson-specific perceived exertion, enjoyment, and perceived competence. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), midway through the intervention (T1), and at the end (T2) using ANOVAs and ANCOVAs. Intervention fidelity was measured using child and teacher surveys at T2 and analysed using Chi-square tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The BTM group engaged in moderate PA for significantly more lesson time (29.4&#x000a0;%) than the COM group (25.8&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.009, d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.53). The amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during the T1 BTM lesson contributed 14.0&#x000a0;% to total MVPA, which was significantly more than the COM group&#x02019;s T1 PE lesson (11.4&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001, d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.47).

Despite evidence highlighting the positive health effects of active lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the majority of children and young people do insufficient physical activity of at least a moderate intensity (MPA) to achieve current guidelines for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, physical inactivity and increased prevalence of sedentary behaviours in youth are associated with negative health indicators such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) positively influences cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, which promote a number of health-related benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but both of which have declining levels among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further, accumulation of light intensity physical activity (LPA) in place of sedentary time may benefit children&#x02019;s health through associations with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, physical activity intervention efforts in youth are warranted, particularly when they promote MVPA and fitness. Intervention approaches set in and delivered through school environments hold promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as they can facilitate a range of physical activity and fitness opportunities, including discretionary periods between lessons and at break times, and through more structured and formal periods such as physical education (PE) lessons. Evidence indicates that school-based interventions can be effective in enhancing physical activity, cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, psychosocial outcomes associated with physical activity such as enjoyment, and other markers of health status in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>PE lessons are the formal opportunity in schools for direct delivery of health-related physical activity and fitness. For this reason PE is often viewed as the primary vehicle for promoting these outcomes in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that PE-based interventions result in children spending 10.4&#x000a0;% more lesson time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared to regular PE lessons, which could have a significant contribution to total daily physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that PE interventions can positively impact on health-related fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and motivational constructs, such as enjoyment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In England, PE is a mandatory subject in schools through all years of compulsory schooling (ages 5 through 16&#x000a0;years). Schools align their curricula to the National Curriculum programmes of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which typically emphasise traditional competitive games-based activities. This narrow curriculum structure is however, not suited to all children, some of whom prefer activities that are more movement and exercise oriented. Such activities that explicitly promote physical activity, fitness, and health may appeal to, and also reflect recreational participation of a wider range of youth than more traditional PE activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot PE intervention programme on selected physical activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes known to influence physical activity engagement. The specific objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot intervention on children&#x02019;s: objectively measured LPA, MPA, vigorous physical activity (VPA), MVPA, and sedentary time during lessons and during the whole-day, muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, lesson enjoyment, perceived exertion, and perceived competence. We also sought to examine intervention fidelity, and to provide the necessary information to calculate the sample size for a cluster RCT evaluation of the intervention programme. The study is reported in accordance with the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and recruitment</title><p>The study was a non-equivalent groups pilot trial of a PE-based physical activity and fitness intervention in primary schools and was delivered between November and December 2015. Homogenous purposive sampling was used to recruit schools local to the university that were known to advocate PE and physical activity initiatives promoting children&#x02019;s health and wellbeing. Four co-educational primary schools from West Lancashire in north-west England were initially identified from 51 schools in local School Sport Partnership. Following meetings between the School Sport Partnership Manager, the principal investigator, and school head teachers all four of the schools agreed to participate in the project. The schools were located in areas of relatively low deprivation according to their location postal codes (i.e., deciles 7&#x02013;9 of the 2015 English Indices of Multiple Deprivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The percentage of children eligible for free-school meals ranged from 5.5 to 23.1&#x000a0;%, which was lower than the national average of 26.6&#x000a0;%.</p><p>All Year 6 children (age 10&#x02013;11 years; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;147) in the schools were informed about the project by their class teachers and those children that expressed an interest were given an information pack to take home and share with their parents/carers. Written informed consent and assent were required from the parents/carers and children respectively, before children could participate in the project. These documents were returned to the research team via the schools in accordance with the project approvals granted by the University Research Ethics Committee (reference # SPA-REC-2015-182). Children were included if they provided the required informed consent, assent, and medical screening forms which indicated an absence of any medical conditions or disabilities which prevented participation in the data collection and/or regular PE lessons.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Allocation to conditions</title><p>Two of the four schools were able to reorganise their timetables to accommodate the intervention lessons, but due to time pressures to deliver numeracy and literacy, and demands on the limited indoor spaces for PE, this was not possible in the other two schools. This meant that the intervention schools were allocated prior to baseline data being collected to allow time for reorganisation of curricula and class allocations to indoor PE spaces. The two schools that did not receive the intervention acted as comparisons delivering their regular curricula. All four schools were situated in similar geographical areas so the children were as closely matched by catchment areas and exposure to community-based initiatives promoting physical activity, fitness, health and wellbeing.</p><p>Informed consent to take part was obtained from 139 children (94.6&#x000a0;% participation rate; 73 children in the intervention group, 66 in the comparison group; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Non-consenting children participated in BTM and PE lessons with the rest of their classes but no research data was collected from them. Sample size was not determined by a formal calculation as this was deemed unnecessary for a pilot study of this nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The sample was representative of the target study population (i.e., Year 6 children in West Lancashire who regularly participate in PE lesson) and was based on relatively equal class sizes in the participating schools. Moreover, our sample size was larger than the median of 30 participants per arm reported for pilot studies in the UK with continuous variable endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3550_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>This study piloted a structured class-based physical activity and fitness programme entitled Born to Move (BTM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lesmills.com/borntomove">http://www.lesmills.com/borntomove</ext-link>). BTM is an age-adapted portfolio of class-based physical activity and fitness programmes set to music with an emphasis on enjoyable and inclusive activity. The classes teach age-appropriate motor skills designed to improve health-related and skill-related fitness. The activities were delivered through eight combined movement categories (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) set to contemporary music tracks of varying tempo. The format of the lessons was specifically designed for mixed-sex groups of children in the 8&#x02013;12 years age range. The lessons were designed to be enjoyable, differentiated, and inclusive, yet challenging and requiring concentration and physical effort. The lessons were intended to last for at least 30 min and were taught in the schools&#x02019; PE halls to the intact mixed-sex and mixed ability Year 6 classes. All of the BTM lessons were taught free of charge by one trained female instructor of 10&#x000a0;years experience who is a BTM UK instructor trainer. She adhered closely to the child-centred principles that are central to the BTM instructor training. These include understanding how children learn, group observation and interaction, role modelling, demonstrating a positive attitude to physical activity, and having flexible teaching strategies to meet the needs of different groups and individuals. The intervention&#x02019;s emphasis on enjoyable and inclusive lesson content delivered by an expert instructor is consistent with the Youth Physical Activity Promotion Model (YPAPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) which provided a conceptual framework for the intervention evaluation. The YPAPM recognises that children&#x02019;s physical activity is influenced to varying degrees by predisposing, enabling, reinforcing, and personal demographic factors, and their mutual interactions. Predisposing factors in particular are highlighted in the model as significant predictors of physical activity participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and include self-evaluative constructs (e.g., perceived competence) and a cognitive assessment of the perceived outcomes of activity (e.g., enjoyment, interest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Born to Move intervention movement categories</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Movement</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Move</td><td>Simple movements for warm-ups and active rests</td></tr><tr><td>Punch</td><td>Combinations of punches, strikes, and high knees designed to raise heart rates</td></tr><tr><td>Kick</td><td>Technical kicks taught with an emphasis on accuracy and focus</td></tr><tr><td>Jump</td><td>Plyometric and sport-based movements to increase muscular fitness</td></tr><tr><td>Dance</td><td>Dance sequences which gradually progress in complexity</td></tr><tr><td>Core</td><td>Fun-based full body movements using body weight exercises</td></tr><tr><td>Games</td><td>Interactive and fun games designed to fully engage the children</td></tr><tr><td>Yoga</td><td>Simple yoga sequences designed to promote flexibility and concentration</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Each week for six consecutive weeks, children in the intervention schools received two BTM lessons in addition to one regular PE lesson. The regular PE lessons lasted between 30 and 45&#x000a0;min and were taught by the usual Year 6 class teachers or teaching assistants in accordance with the planned PE curricula for those weeks. The BTM instructor and Year 6 teachers in the BTM schools were fully aware that their classes were receiving the intervention. The research team were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention and knew the children only by their study identifier numbers. Children from the two comparison schools (COM) did not receive the BTM intervention and instead took part in their regular twice-weekly PE lessons which covered activities including netball, benchball, hand-tennis, cricket, dance, and fitness circuits. These lessons were taught by the usual Year 6 class teachers and were intended to last between 30 and 45&#x000a0;min. At the end of the six-week intervention all consenting children in the BTM and COM groups received a &#x000a3;10 gift voucher that could be used in a variety of online and high street retailers. Following completion of the project BTM after-school clubs were planned in all four participating schools for the 2016 summer term, after which a BTM community programme would be implemented in the local leisure centre. These programmes would be delivered by trained instructors based in the schools and local community.</p><p>Baseline data collection (T0) commenced in the week of 19th October 2015 which was followed by a one-week half-term break. The intervention pilot began in the week of 2nd November 2015 and ended the week of 7th December 2015. Data were also collected halfway through the intervention (T1) and at the end (T2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot BTM programme were assessed at T0 before the 6-week intervention, at T1, and where measured, at T2. The primary study outcomes were: LPA, MPA, VPA, MVPA, and sedentary time during lessons, muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness, and enjoyment, perceived exertion, and perceived competence during lessons. Secondary outcomes were: whole-day, school-day, and after-school through evening physical activity and sedentary time. These outcomes were measured on a selected BTM or PE lessons day rather than averaged across the entire week. All data collection measures were administered by trained researchers who were un-blinded to the classes&#x02019; allocations to the BTM and COM groups.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Socioeconomic status</title><p>Area level socio-economic status was calculated using the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] derived from parent/carer reported home postal codes.

Height and sitting height were measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a portable stadiometer (Seca 213 height measure, Seca UK, Birmingham, UK). Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg using calibrated digital scales (Seca 877 digital scales, Seca UK, Birmingham, UK). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and body mass as a proxy measure of body composition (kg&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>), and BMI z-scores were assigned to each child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Age and sex-specific BMI cutpoints were used to classify children&#x02019;s weight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Gender-specific regression equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] were used to predict children&#x02019;s maturity offset (i.e., age from peak height velocity), which was used as a proxy measure of somatic maturation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Muscular fitness</title><p>The FITNESSGRAM push-up test was administered as a measure of upper body muscular fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The children completed as many repetitions as possible and the test was terminated if the children did not maintain the prescribed cadence or they did not achieve a 90&#x000b0; angle with the elbow. The standing long jump test was used as a measure of lower body muscular fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The longest distance jumped was recorded in cm from the best of three attempts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cardiorespiratory fitness: Andersen test</title><p>Children completed a modified version of the Andersen Test which is a 10-min 20&#x000a0;m intermittent shuttle run/rest test of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]). The test has recently been shown to be valid and reliable for providing group level estimates of CRF in 10&#x000a0;year old children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Due to indoor space restrictions in the schools, the distance between the two lines was modified to 10&#x000a0;m rather than the usual 20&#x000a0;m. Prior advice on this modification was taken from the test&#x02019;s author, who highlighted that reducing the shuttle run distance would increase the number of times the children would need to turn, which would likely lead to an underestimation of CRF because of the additional energy cost associated with the extra turning (personal correspondence, October 2015). As all of the schools would use the 10&#x000a0;m adaptation of the test and therefore between- and within-group differences would be consistent, it was decided to proceed with this modification. The test consisted of the children shuttle running from one end line to the other for 10&#x000a0;min. Every 15&#x000a0;s a digital audio cue sounded which signaled for the children to stop and rest, or resume running. The research team counted the number of shuttles completed in 10&#x000a0;min, after which the test ended. The children were encouraged to keep running at their own pace as per the test protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Total distance completed was recorded and peak VO<sub>2</sub> was estimated using sex-specific equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Post-lesson questionnaire measures</title><p>At the end of BTM and PE lessons children were asked to rate their perceived exertion for the lesson overall by completing the Children&#x02019;s OMNI Perceived Exertion Scale for Stepping Exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Enjoyment and perceived competence in relation to BTM or PE lessons were assessed using four items from the short-form Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which measures underlying constructs of intrinsic motivation and has been used previously in PE research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The short-form IMI has demonstrated satisfactory construct validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and was developed for use in school settings when data collection time is limited. Items were modified to make them situational-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and responses were recorded on a 7-point Likert scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time</title><p>Physical activity and sedentary time were objectively measured using triaxial accelerometers (Actigraph GT9X, ActiGraph LLC, FL, USA). The Actigraph monitor has demonstrated validity and reliability in estimating children&#x02019;s physical activity and sedentary time across a range of ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Children wore the monitors on their non-dominant wrists during selected T0 and T1 PE and/or BTM lessons. On a selected T1 day when children were scheduled for BTM or PE, the monitors were also worn from waking to bedtime to investigate the contribution of the BTM and PE lessons to overall physical activity and sedentary time. It was not logistically possible to measure whole-day activity during T0 because timetabling of PE between schools occurred on the same day or on consecutive days. As a consequence, the limited number of available accelerometers meant that concurrent monitoring in different schools was not possible. Greater timetable flexibility in the second half of the term allowed whole-day monitoring during T1. To be included in the whole-day analysis, children needed to wear the accelerometer for at least 540&#x000a0;min. Accelerations were recorded at a frequency of 30&#x000a0;Hz and were subsequently converted to counts per 1&#x000a0;s epochs. Percentages of BTM/PE lesson time, and whole-day, school-day, and after-school through evening minutes spent sedentary, and in light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and total physical activity (total PA; i.e., LPA through to VPA) were calculated based on wrist count cutpoints developed by Chandler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

A simple &#x02018;yes/no&#x02019; structure was used with children asked about their perceptions of BTM. Questions related to areas such as perceived challenge (e.g., &#x0201c;Did you find the BORN TO MOVE lessons a challenge?&#x0201d;), motivation (e.g., &#x0201c;Did the BORN TO MOVE teacher motivate you to try hard?&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Did doing the BORN TO MOVE lessons to music motivate you to try hard?&#x0201d;), and adaptability (e.g., &#x0201c;Did the BORN TO MOVE teacher change or adapt any movements or skills that seemed difficult so they were easier to do?&#x0201d;). The intervention class teachers were asked to complete a free-text evaluation of the programme, which asked them to comment on the delivery of the BTM lessons, and the intervention&#x02019;s influence on the children&#x02019;s lesson engagement and competence, classroom learning, and general wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Preliminary analysis</title><p>Preliminary analyses checked the distribution of the variables by group (BTM vs. COM). Across the three time points, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed that the majority of variables were not normally distributed. Logarithmic and reciprocal transformations were applied to the data and while these normalised some of the variables for at least one time point, this outcome was not consistent across all variables and time points. Thus, on the basis that ANOVA models are generally robust to violations of the normality assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] it was decided to proceed with parametric tests. The exception to this was where the data were categorical, or where the data were skewed and there was no need to include covariates in the main analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Baseline data analysis</title><p>The initial analysis of T0 data investigated equivalence between the BTM and COM groups.

Subsequent analyses of PE/BTM lesson physical activity and sedentary time included baseline physical activity or sedentary time values as covariates. Group (BTM vs. COM) x sex ANOVAs were employed to check for differences in outcomes between boys and girls in the BTM and COM groups. For push-ups there was a significant sex x group interaction effect (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.021) which indicated that the BTM boys&#x02019; performance was superior to the girls, whereby the COM boys and girls performed similarly. The same sex x group interaction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001) and data trends were observed for standing long-jump. As a consequence, sex was included as a covariate in the main analyses of push-ups and standing long jump.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Main analysis</title><p>As children were nested within schools, the variability between school-level data was examined via multilevel analyses. Little variability was seen between schools for all outcome measures (all ICCs&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]), therefore further multilevel analyses were deemed unnecessary, and child-level data were analysed to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Intervention effects on the primary and secondary outcomes were assessed using group (BTM, COM) x time (T0, T1, T2) ANOVAs or ANCOVAs. Appropriate prognostic covariates were included in these analyses based on their known influence on the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

One-way between-group ANCOVAs compared differences in the absolute and percentage of BTM or PE lesson time spent in different physical activity intensities. These analyses controlled for T0 values of the outcomes, and BMI z-scores. The percentage contribution of the BTM and PE lessons to overall MVPA and to the 60&#x000a0;min/day MVPA minimum recommendation for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] were compared using Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests.

The corresponding absolute difference in MVPA lesson engagement was 4.5&#x000a0;min. This was in line with the ~4.5&#x000a0;min difference between intervention and regular PE MVPA reported in a review of elementary school PE physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], but was less than the 10.4&#x000a0;% difference reported in a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of MVPA during PE interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this review over 25&#x000a0;% of the interventions were based on PE delivery through &#x02018;fitness infusion strategies&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The nature of the studies included under this heading suggests that the intervention lessons involved integration of high-intensity CRF-promoting activities. The BTM intervention employed variable intensity activities and movements such as CRF fitness-promoting (e.g., high intensity kicks), muscular fitness-promoting (e.g., body weight activities), and sedentary relaxation activities. Thus, it was expected that differences in MVPA between the BTM and regular PE lessons would be less than those reported in previous fitness-oriented PE interventions. The 14.0&#x000a0;% contribution of BTM lesson MVPA to whole-day MVPA was though greater than or similar to that found in the small number of previous accelerometer studies reporting PE&#x02019;s contribution to daily physical activity (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of regular PE classes to make an important contribution to health-enhancing MVPA. Further, our results suggest that the BTM intervention model made a significantly greater contribution to whole-day MVPA than regular PE lessons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Physical activity and sedentary time beyond BTM and PE lessons</title><p>The unadjusted between-group differences in mean MVPA for BTM vs. PE (4.2&#x000a0;min) and the whole-day (4.1&#x000a0;min) suggest that the whole-day differences were attributed to the superior MVPA during BTM compared to regular PE lessons. A 6.6&#x000a0;min between-group difference in school-day MVPA however, infers that outside the BTM lesson an additional 2.5&#x000a0;min of MVPA was accumulated over the school day. While the precise mechanisms for activity accumulation are unknown, it is plausible that individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors may have interplayed in the BTM group to stimulate additional school-day physical activity beyond the BTM lessons. The physical, social, and pedagogical environments that children interact with at school influence activity-related behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and it has been suggested that some children may be stimulated to accumulate more physical activity when presented with active opportunities during school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Moreover, it is possible that the significant between-group differences in school-day and whole-day sedentary time were related to these increased activity levels. In particular, improvements in LPA and displacement of sedentary time may be important for children&#x02019;s health through associations with adiposity, cardiometabolic risk, and other health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There were though no between-group differences in physical activity and sedentary time during the after-school through evening period, which suggest that the BTM group were relatively less active by around 2.5&#x000a0;min in the before- or after-school periods or in the evening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Because these findings are based on data from a single day we are unable to ascertain whether the BTM group truly compensated for their greater school-day MVPA by reducing their out of school activity through biologically-driven &#x02018;activitystat&#x02019; regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness</title><p>At T0 and T2 29 and 72&#x000a0;% of the BTM group, and 35 and 51&#x000a0;% of the COM group, respectively, achieved the FITNESSGRAM Healthy Fitness Zone criterion standard of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7 push-ups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The BTM group&#x02019;s improvement may have been partially influenced by the nature of the floor-based body weight-bearing movements included in the BTM lessons. The repeated administration of the push-up test protocol at T0 through T2 and resultant learning effect also likely increased test familiarisation and therefore performance among children in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Standing long jump performances of the children in both groups were comparable or superior to those observed in other European children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Although a learning effect likely influenced standing long jump performance to some degree, variation in neuromuscular maturation and therefore appropriately coordinated technique possibly contributed more to the lack of observed intervention effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>Distance covered during the Andersen test and estimated VO<sub>2</sub> peak values were lower in both groups than reported in Danish children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and significantly decreased between time points. Though this decrease over time was unexpected, we do not believe it reflects a true attenuation of the children&#x02019;s CRF levels. The Andersen test requires children to self-pace and for some this appeared challenging over the duration of the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. We observed that during the 15-s rest periods some children&#x02019;s concentration waivered, and this was reflected in fluctuations in running speed during the subsequent running periods. Moreover, some children&#x02019;s motivation to complete as many shuttles as possible appeared low, which was manifested in some cases by very slow running and even walking. Children&#x02019;s motivation during field tests of CRF is recognised as a threat to validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and it has previously been observed that children&#x02019;s motivational reactions to shuttle run fitness tests are extremely variable, depending on each child&#x02019;s goal profile, performance, and perceived success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. For these reasons the Andersen test results should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Enjoyment and perceived competence during BTM and PE lessons</title><p>The BTM lessons were rated as significantly more enjoyable than regular PE. This has important implications for children&#x02019;s motivation to engage in physical activity as well as maintaining participation, as evidence demonstrates that experiencing enjoyment in physical activity settings, such as PE, can enhance intrinsic motivation and increase the likelihood of continued participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Both groups demonstrated increased perceived competence in the T1 BTM and PE lessons. Harter&#x02019;s competence motivation theory posits that successful attempts to master a skill can increase perceived competence, leading to increases in intrinsic motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. This theory has been applied in PE settings with perceived competence being shown to significantly influence children&#x02019;s motivation and physical activity behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In addition to the independent influences of enjoyment and perceived competence on physical activity motivation, both factors influence each other in a reciprocal manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Low perceived competence in children is associated with lower levels of physical activity enjoyment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], and enjoyment is known to increase when perceived competence is enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This is especially true for girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], a point which is supported by our results showing significant improvements in girls&#x02019; perceived competence alongside increased enjoyment (albeit non-significant) during T1 BTM lessons relative to T0 PE lessons. This previous research lends credence to our findings where the BTM group increased enjoyment and perceived competence. Since these aspects of motivation are known to influence engagement and adherence to physical activity, programmes such as BTM can play a role in increasing physical activity during PE and school hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>Data from the T2 survey on fidelity of lesson delivery demonstrated that the children found the BTM lessons to be challenging, motivating and adaptable to their skills levels. These favourable factors are linked to increased intervention adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] as well as being predictors of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Although based on limited data, results indicated that intervention fidelity was good and that intervention school teachers saw BTM as a positive influence on the children that provided motivation for physical activity engagement. Buy in and support from key stakeholders such as teachers is essential for the success of any behavioural intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The Diffusion of Innovations model identifies stakeholders such as teachers as essential for transfer of interventions into practice through input in the decision to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Teachers also help to provide access to the target participants, and as was the case in BTM, their continuing support is important for institutionalisation of interventions and increased likelihood of sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The pilot BTM intervention, while brief in duration, was highly regarded by teachers and children. Findings indicate that in future iterations of the programme, they and others may be likely to contribute to its diffusion into practice. The fact that after the study some of the teachers attended BTM instructor training to enable them to lead BTM after-school clubs is evidence of this. It should though also be noted that individual schools or school partnerships would usually be required to pay a monthly BTM licence fee. Notwithstanding the positive findings in relation to feasibility and fidelity, this cost implication may be a barrier to some schools accessing and/or sustaining the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Sample size for a cluster RCT</title><p>Sample size calculations indicated that a future RCT would need 442 children to detect a between-group difference of 6.5&#x000a0;min of MPA during PE. Our pilot data suggest that this increase is feasible and would help contribute to MPA during PE as well as the whole-day. Moreover, based on our pilot data, 6.5&#x000a0;min of MPA would equate to a 10.1&#x000a0;% difference between a BTM intervention and regular PE group, which is comparable to the average MVPA difference of 10.4&#x000a0;% reported in a recent systematic review (51) of MVPA during PE interventions. Based on our observed MPA and VPA pilot data this increase would also amount to 50&#x000a0;% of BTM lesson time in MVPA which reflects recommendations for health-enhancing PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Major strengths of this pilot study were the quasi-experimental control group design used to evaluate an existing intervention programme in &#x02018;real world&#x02019; school settings. Involvement of a lead BTM instructor ensured high quality delivery of the intervention that was made available to all Year 6 children in the intervention schools. A small number of schools participated in the study and the modest sample size may not have been powered to detect differences between groups. Further, the schools were a convenience sample selected based on their advocacy for PE and physical activity initiatives. It is possible that this may have limited the observed intervention effects, particularly in Comparison schools that strongly emphasised PE and physical activity engagement. Though it would not be the intention to exclude such schools from any future RCT, randomised sampling procedures would be applied to limit threats to internal validity. Moreover, to limit recruitment bias in a future RCT, schools would need to commit to having sufficiently flexible timetabling arrangements for them to be allocated to intervention or comparison conditions after baseline data collection. To limit the impact on BTM and PE lesson time, questionnaire and physical activity data were collected on two occasions. It is likely that there were between-lesson variations in the children&#x02019;s engagement and physical activity which may not have been captured. Whole-day physical activity and sedentary time was assessed at T1 using single-day rather than multiple day accelerometer measurement protocols. The schools were reluctant for the children to take the monitors home over multiple days, so it was not possible to know whether the observed whole-day activity and sedentary levels accurately reflected the children&#x02019;s typical levels of activity. The modified Andersen Test possibly compromised the accuracy of the measure of CRF. Subsequent measurement of CRF would be undertaken using alternative methods that may be less prone to variations in individual-child motivation and pacing capabilities. Intervention fidelity was investigated using a &#x02018;light touch&#x02019; approach through the T2 child and teacher surveys. Though more in-depth process evaluation measures (e.g., lesson observations, focus groups) would have been desirable, limited staffing resources and the need to limit the study&#x02019;s impact on school curriculum time prevented this.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The BTM pilot programme was effective in engaging children in significantly more MPA than during regular PE. The amount of MVPA that the BTM children took part in during lessons contributed significantly more to whole-day MVPA compared to MVPA during regular PE. Moreover, enjoyment levels during the BTM lessons were significantly higher compared to regular PE. On the days when BTM lessons were scheduled, the intervention children did significantly more whole-day and school-day physical activity and less sedentary activity than COM group peers. Improved push-up and reduced CRF test performances were observed in both groups. This study has demonstrated that the BTM pilot programme was feasible to deliver in English primary schools, was enjoyed by the children, valued by the teachers, and provided favourable results indicating its potential to positively impact on physical activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes. On the basis of these results there is scope for this study to inform the design of a modified larger-scale cluster RCT evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BTM</term><def><p>Born to move intervention/group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COM</term><def><p>Comparison group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMD</term><def><p>Indices of Multiple Deprivation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPA</term><def><p>Light intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPA</term><def><p>Moderate intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p>Physical education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VPA</term><def><p>Vigorous intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YPAPM</term><def><p>Youth Physical Activity Promotion Model</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to thank the participating schools, children, and teachers for their efforts.
