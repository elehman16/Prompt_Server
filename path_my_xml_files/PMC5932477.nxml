A further, long-term study showed that brexpiprazole maintenance therapy reduced the risk of relapse vs placebo over the course of a year. The study described in this paper is an extension of these 3 studies, which was designed primarily to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole treatment. The study also enrolled patients who had not previously been in a brexpiprazole study. For up to 1 year, patients received open-label brexpiprazole that was flexibly dosed in the range of 1&#x02013;4 mg/d. No unexpected safety or tolerability issues emerged, and the safety profile was consistent with the previous brexpiprazole studies in schizophrenia. Overall, this study adds to the evidence-base demonstrating that brexpiprazole is a generally well-tolerated antipsychotic in the long-term.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s6"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, associated with considerable disability and requiring lifelong treatment. Current antipsychotics are generally efficacious in treating the acute symptoms of schizophrenia, with small differences in efficacy between agents (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>). Antipsychotics as a group are also efficacious for the prevention of relapse in the long term (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2012</xref>). However, individual patient response to a particular agent is highly heterogeneous (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the symptoms and disease course of schizophrenia vary greatly between patients, and antipsychotics are not able to manage the broad spectrum of symptoms in all patients (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Lecrubier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2016</xref>). Current antipsychotics show considerable differences in their propensity towards adverse events (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2017</xref>). Patient preference, based on concerns about specific adverse effects, is another factor that can influence the choice of an antipsychotic treatment (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2013</xref>). Consequently, selection of a specific antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia is an individualized risk&#x02013;benefit decision based on short- and long-term issues, including the relative clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of available antipsychotics (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>). Finding an antipsychotic that works &#x0201c;well enough&#x0201d; and is tolerated &#x0201c;well enough&#x0201d; for an individual patient is a substantial challenge in the day-to-day clinical management of individuals with schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Brexpiprazole is a serotonin&#x02013;dopamine activity modulator that acts as a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and noradrenaline &#x003b1;<sub>1B/2C</sub> receptors, all with similar, subnanomolar potency (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). Brexpiprazole has a low potential to induce D<sub>2</sub> agonist-mediated adverse effects and D<sub>2</sub> antagonist-like adverse effects (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). Relative to its D<sub>2</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor affinity, brexpiprazole has a moderate/low affinity for histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>), which may limit the risk for sedation and weight gain (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nasrallah, 2008</xref>). The efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole have been demonstrated in a Phase 3 schizophrenia program comprising two 6-week, fixed-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention study with a withdrawal design (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>). Brexpiprazole is approved in the US, Canada, and Australia for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, and also in the US as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.</p><p>Long-term maintenance treatment is recommended to control the symptoms of schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2013</xref>); therefore, safety monitoring for longer than the period required to treat an acute exacerbation is warranted. The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of open-label treatment with brexpiprazole (flexible dose 1&#x02013;4 mg/d) in patients with schizophrenia. The long-term efficacy of brexpiprazole treatment was also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were recruited at 202 sites across 18 countries in Asia (Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan), Europe (Croatia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine), Latin America (Colombia, Mexico), and North America (Canada, Puerto Rico, United States). The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guideline, and local regulatory requirements, and the protocol was approved by the governing institutional review board or independent ethics committee for each investigational site or country, as appropriate. All patients provided written informed consent prior to the start of the study.</p><p>Patients rolled over from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies of brexpiprazole in schizophrenia (Vector, NCT01396421; Beacon, NCT01393613; and Equator, NCT01668797). In addition, new (de novo) patients were enrolled who had not previously participated in a brexpiprazole clinical study. Vector and Beacon were acute 6-week studies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>), whereas Equator was a relapse-prevention study comprising a 12- to 36-week stabilization phase and a maintenance phase of up to 52 weeks (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>). Equator was terminated early following demonstration of efficacy vs placebo at a prespecified interim analysis (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The present open-label study included male and female outpatients (or inpatients from Equator) aged 18 to 65 years who, in the investigator&#x02019;s judgment, could potentially benefit from monotherapy treatment with oral brexpiprazole. Rollover patients were required to have completed their respective studies (in addition, patients could be rolled over from Equator if they had withdrawn from the maintenance phase of the study due to impending relapse). De novo patients were required to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia for at least 3 years as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>); to be currently treated with an oral antipsychotic (other than clozapine) or to have a recent lapse in antipsychotic treatment; to have been stable on an antipsychotic regimen for at least one 3-month period in the last year; and, in the investigator&#x02019;s judgment, to be in need of chronic treatment with antipsychotic medication. Exclusion criteria included a positive pregnancy test or currently breastfeeding; a DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia; acute depressive symptoms in the previous 30 days requiring antidepressant therapy; antipsychotic-resistant or refractory schizophrenia; a significant risk of violent behavior or suicide; meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse or dependence in the previous 180 days; a clinically significant neurological, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal disorder; or requiring prohibited concomitant therapy during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study, conducted from 15 September, 2011 to 25 February, 2016. The study comprised a screening process, an as-needed phase for converting de novo patients from baseline antipsychotics to brexpiprazole, and a 52-week open-label brexpiprazole treatment phase.</p><p>Rollover patients were screened for eligibility at the last visit of their respective Phase 3 study (week 6 for Vector and Beacon; week 52 or the time of withdrawal for Equator). Eligible patients entered the 52-week brexpiprazole treatment phase directly.</p><p>De novo patients underwent a 2- to 28-day screening process to assess eligibility and to washout from prohibited concomitant medications, if applicable. Eligible patients entered the 52-week brexpiprazole treatment phase directly if they had not taken an antipsychotic within 7 days; otherwise, they entered a conversion phase. In the conversion phase (weekly visits), de novo patients were cross-titrated to oral brexpiprazole 2 mg/d over a period of 4 weeks, as follows: days 0&#x02013;13, brexpiprazole 1 mg/d (no change in concurrent baseline antipsychotic); days 14&#x02013;20, brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/d (baseline antipsychotic decreased); days 21&#x02013;27, brexpiprazole 2 mg/d (baseline antipsychotic decreased); day 28, brexpiprazole 2 mg/d (baseline antipsychotic discontinued).</p><p>In the 52-week open-label treatment phase (visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8, then at 6-weekly intervals), all patients began with oral brexpiprazole 2 mg/d (or 1&#x02013;4 mg/d for patients from Equator, based on their last dose). Doses could be adjusted within the range of 1&#x02013;4 mg/d, in 1-mg increments, for reasons of efficacy or tolerability, according to the investigator&#x02019;s judgement.</p><p>Safety follow-up comprised telephone contact or a clinic visit 30 (+2) days after the last dose.</p><p>Two amendments were made to the protocol after the study had started. The first, following the early termination of Equator, was to allow the entry of patients who were withdrawn from Equator (any phase) at the time of early termination. The second was a reduction of the study duration from 52 to 26 weeks for all patients who enrolled after the date of the amendment. The reason for this amendment was that the safety profile of brexpiprazole was considered to be well established in the completed double-blind and long-term studies, together with the population in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of oral brexpiprazole as monotherapy in adults with schizophrenia. Safety was assessed by spontaneous reporting of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; primary outcome), clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs, body mass index, and ECGs. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were formally assessed using the Simpson&#x02013;Angus Scale (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Simpson &#x00026; Angus, 1970</xref>), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 1989</xref>), and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>). Suicidality was assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Posner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The secondary objective of the study was to assess the long-term efficacy of oral brexpiprazole as monotherapy in adults with schizophrenia. Efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 1987</xref>), Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>), and the Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP; a measure of social functioning and behavior; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Morosini et al., 2000</xref>). The PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I were administered at each visit; the PSP was administered at weeks 2, 8, 26, and 52. The efficacy outcomes were the mean change from baseline to each visit in PANSS Total score, Positive and Negative subscale scores, Excited component score (a measure of aggression/agitation; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Montoya et al., 2011</xref>), and all 5 Marder factor scores (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Marder et al., 1997</xref>); the mean change in CGI-S score; the mean CGI-I score; the mean change in PSP Total score; the response rate (defined as a reduction of &#x02265;30% from baseline in PANSS Total score, or a CGI-I score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved]); and the discontinuation rate due to lack of efficacy.</p><p>Information regarding the extent of medical care sought by patients while participating in the study was collected using a resource utilization form.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The sample size was determined by the number of eligible rollover patients, plus approximately 200 de novo patients, rather than by statistical power considerations.</p><p>The enrolled population comprised all patients who enrolled in either the conversion phase or the open-label treatment phase.

The efficacy population comprised all patients in the safety population who had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation on the PANSS in the open-label treatment phase.</p><p>The primary outcome variable was the frequency and severity of TEAEs in the open-label treatment phase. All safety variables were presented using descriptive statistics for the safety population. Efficacy variables were presented using descriptive statistics for the efficacy population, using observed cases at each visit. PANSS Total, CGI-S, and PSP Total outcomes were also stratified by the treatment received prior to rollover (i.e., prior brexpiprazole, prior placebo, or de novo).</p><p>Baseline was defined as the last available measurement prior to the first dose of brexpiprazole in the open-label treatment phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Results</title><sec id="s13"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 1072 patients were enrolled in the study, either into the conversion phase or directly into the open-label treatment phase.

The results indicate that long-term treatment with brexpiprazole at flexible doses of 1&#x02013;4 mg/d is generally well tolerated. The proportion of patients who discontinued the study due to TEAEs was low: 14.6% during the open-label brexpiprazole treatment phase. The most frequently reported TEAE was schizophrenia, and the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to withdrawal were schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, reflecting a worsening of the underlying disease state in this patient population, which is generally observed in long-term schizophrenia studies (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Kasper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Cutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Durgam et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas other D<sub>2</sub> partial agonists (aripiprazole and cariprazine) are associated with activating TEAEs such as akathisia, insomnia, and anxiety (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chrzanowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Cutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Durgam et al., 2017</xref>), this does not appear to be the case for brexpiprazole, even in the long term. For example, in a 52-week, open-label study of aripiprazole in stable schizophrenia, insomnia, and anxiety had incidences of 23.8% and 9.9%, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chrzanowski et al., 2006</xref>), compared with 8.6% and 2.2%, respectively, in the present brexpiprazole study. This is supported by an open-label, randomized, exploratory study in acute schizophrenia (n=97), in which aripiprazole was associated with a greater incidence of EPS-related TEAEs than brexpiprazole (30.3% vs 14.1%), predominantly akathisia (21.2% vs 9.4%) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Citrome et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The safety and tolerability results of the present study are generally similar to those observed in prior short- and long-term studies of brexpiprazole in schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>). No safety concerns with brexpiprazole were noted in the adverse event profile, laboratory test values, ECG, weight, or vital sign parameters. The mean overall weight gain in the present study was 1.3 kg in patients who completed 26 weeks of treatment and 2.1 kg in patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment, consistent with the previous long-term study, Equator, in which a mean weight increase of 0.8 kg was observed in the stabilization phase, and a mean weight decrease was observed in the maintenance phase (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>). The incidence of &#x02265;7% body weight increase in the present study was 18.6%, higher than that observed in the stabilization phase of Equator (11.3%; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>) but generally on the low side compared with incidences reported in long-term, open-label studies with other second-generation antipsychotics (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chrzanowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Citrome et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Cutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Durgam et al., 2017</xref>). In this regard, brexpiprazole is similar to aripiprazole, which has shown a low propensity for weight gain in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chrzanowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that brexpiprazole is also well tolerated when used as an adjunctive treatment by patients with major depressive disorder and inadequate response to antidepressants (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Current antipsychotics are limited by adverse events including EPS and activating side effects (akathisia, restlessness, agitation, anxiety, insomnia), sedation, weight gain, metabolic side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and elevated prolactin levels (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Correll, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2017</xref>). There is heterogeneity among different second-generation antipsychotics with regard to activating and sedating adverse events, with some agents being primarily activating, some being primarily sedating, and some displaying the potential for both activating and sedating properties (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2017</xref>). A recent analysis of absolute risk increase with second-generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia found that only brexpiprazole and paliperidone were neither activating nor sedating (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2017</xref>). Weight gain is also a problem with the majority of antipsychotics; a comprehensive meta-analysis conducted prior to the availability of brexpiprazole data reported that almost all antipsychotics were associated with increased body weight, and that only amisulpride, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone could be considered weight neutral (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bak et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to weight gain, metabolic side effects such as elevated lipids, glucose, and prolactin are a serious concern with some second-generation antipsychotics (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Rummel-Kluge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the introduction of brexpiprazole may provide an additional, well-tolerated treatment option in schizophrenia.</p><p>The present study investigated efficacy as a secondary endpoint. Long-term open-label treatment with brexpiprazole was associated with sustained improvement in efficacy measures and functional outcomes. PANSS Total and CGI-S scores indicated a mean improvement from mild-to-moderately ill at baseline to mildly ill over 52 weeks of treatment. The magnitude of improvement in PANSS Total score (12.2 points) was comparable to that observed in the 12- to 36-week stabilization phase of Equator (15.1 points; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>). Since the majority of patients in the present study had already received brexpiprazole prior to entry, the observed improvement is in addition to any previous benefit.</p><p>Deficits in psychosocial functioning are a core feature of schizophrenia and an important outcome in clinical studies of new antipsychotic agents (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Burns and Patrick, 2007</xref>). In the present study, patients showed a mean improvement in PSP Total score of 7.7 points over the course of treatment to a total of 68.3 points. This is above the threshold for potentially clinically meaningful response in stabilized patients with schizophrenia (an increase of 4&#x02013;7 points; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nasrallah et al., 2008</xref>) and close to functional remission (a total score of &#x0003e;70 points; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pinna et al., 2013</xref>). For rollover patients, this continued improvement in psychosocial functioning over 52 weeks is in addition to that observed in prior studies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Baseline efficacy scale scores varied according to prior exposure to brexpiprazole at the start of open-label treatment. Some patients entering the open-label treatment phase of this study had no previous exposure to brexpiprazole, having received placebo in the acute studies (Vector and Beacon). De novo patients, in contrast, were generally not brexpiprazole-na&#x000ef;ve at the start of open-label treatment, the majority having received brexpiprazole for 4 weeks during the conversion phase. Similarly, patients who received placebo in the maintenance phase of Equator had previous exposure to brexpiprazole for 12 to 36 weeks during the stabilization phase of Equator. In the present study, the subgroup of patients who previously received placebo had the highest baseline PANSS Total score. De novo patients had the lowest baseline PANSS Total score, the majority having improved on brexpiprazole during the conversion phase prior to open-label treatment. In the open-label phase, treatment benefits were observed in all subgroups, irrespective of prior treatment.</p><p>This study is limited by having no comparator and an open-label design; however, the open-label design also increases the real-world relevance of the results. Outcomes may have been influenced by the variation in prior patient exposure to brexpiprazole, since some patients were rolled over from acute studies, and others from a long-term maintenance study. For example, inclusion of patients from Equator (the maintenance study) may have enriched the study population, in part, for those who had previously demonstrated tolerability to brexpiprazole. However, this is also a strength of the study: the inclusion of patients who completed the 52-week double-blind maintenance phase of Equator on brexpiprazole means that brexpiprazole safety data are available for more than 2 years of treatment for a limited number of patients. Finally, the design amendments following the early termination of Equator complicated the interpretation of the results, albeit for a minority of patients.</p><p>In conclusion, this open-label study showed that treatment with brexpiprazole 1&#x02013;4 mg/d (flexibly dosed) was generally well tolerated for up to 52 weeks in patients with schizophrenia. No unexpected safety or tolerability issues emerged, and the safety profile was consistent with other brexpiprazole studies in schizophrenia. Furthermore, open-label treatment with brexpiprazole 1&#x02013;4 mg/d was associated with continued improvement in efficacy measures and functional outcomes in the long term.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology</italic> online.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>Andy Forbes, Mary Hobart, John Ouyang, Lily Shi and Stephanie Pfister are full-time employees of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &#x00026; Commercialization Inc.
