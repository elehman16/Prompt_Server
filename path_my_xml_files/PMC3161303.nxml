Current treatment guidelines promote a stepwise approach starting with lifestyle and metformin and adding a next agent as soon as target HbA<sub>1c</sub> values cannot be sustained below 7% (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). None of the presently advocated pharmacological interventions, most of which were already used in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), address the underlying pathophysiological factors of type 2 diabetes, especially &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Because of this progressive decline of &#x003b2;-cell function in the presence of additional glucose toxicity, the majority of patients will require polypharmacy and eventually insulin therapy to maintain acceptable glycemic control (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, novel treatment options specifically addressing the &#x003b2;-cell function defect are eagerly awaited.</p><p>Exenatide (EXE) is the first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) that improves blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes by many different mechanisms (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). EXE predominantly lowers postprandial glucose by a glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, inhibition of an inappropriate glucagon secretion, and by slowing down gastric emptying (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Additionally, EXE promotes satiety, decreases food intake, and reduces body weight (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that EXE, as compared with insulin glargine (GLAR), improved pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretory function against a background of similar glycemic control (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, these findings were not sustained after a 4-week off-drug period, thus it was not possible to demonstrate disease modification (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this extension study was to assess the long-term effects of EXE and GLAR on glycemic control, body weight, and safety, after an additional 2-year treatment period and during a 12-week off-drug period. During the off-drug period, clamp-derived measures of &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin sensitivity were assessed after 4 weeks.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The study was performed between September 2004 and December 2009 at three study sites in Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands. The 1-year data were previously reported (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In total, 150 patients were screened of which 69 patients were randomized using a permutated block randomization scheme stratified by site and screenings for HbA<sub>1c</sub> to receive EXE or GLAR in addition to ongoing metformin treatment. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 30&#x02013;75 years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.5&#x02013;9.5%, BMI 25&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and metformin treatment at a stable dose for at least 2 months. No other blood glucose&#x02013;lowering agents were allowed within 3 months prior to screening. The study protocol was approved by each site&#x02019;s ethics review committee and was in accordance with the principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participating patients gave their written informed consent prior to screening.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Patients randomized to EXE (<italic>n</italic> = 36) initiated treatment at a dose of 5 &#x000b5;g b.i.d., injected 15 min before breakfast and dinner for a period of 4 weeks, followed by dose increase to 10 &#x000b5;g b.i.d. EXE was titrated to a maximum dose of 20 &#x000b5;g t.i.d. or the maximum tolerated dose when HbA<sub>1c</sub> ranged 7.1&#x02013;7.5% at two consecutive visits or when HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x02265;7.6% at any given visit. Patients randomized to GLAR (<italic>n</italic> = 33) started at an initial dose of 10 IU once daily (q.d.), which was injected at bedtime. Patients were instructed to increase the daily dose based on their fasting self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) levels (&#x0003c;5.6 mmol/L) according to a prespecified treat-to-target algorithm (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). When necessary, the importance of proper titration of insulin was emphasized.</p><p>After completing the 1-year main treatment period of the study, patients were asked to return to their randomly assigned study medication for an additional 104-week treatment, which was followed by a 12-week off-drug period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0291/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). Forty-six patients gave their written consent to participate in the extension phase and continued their allocated treatment with EXE (<italic>n</italic> = 21) or GLAR (<italic>n</italic> = 25). During the extension phase, patients visited the study centers at 12-week intervals until the end of the treatment period (week 168). At that point the patients stopped the EXE or GLAR treatment and continued their ongoing metformin treatment, which they had been using in an unchanged dose during the total 168-week treatment period. After a 4-week off-drug period, patients returned to the center for their final combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp with arginine stimulation. The final study visit was at week 180 (approximately 3.5 years after randomization).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp with arginine stimulation</title><p>Insulin sensitivity and C-peptide secretion measures were measured during a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp procedure as previously described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0291/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Clamps were performed prior to randomization, following 52 weeks of treatment, after a 4-week off-drug period (week 56), and finally after a 4-week off-drug period following the total 3 years of treatment (week 172) as previously described (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). During the clamp at week 52, patients randomized to EXE were given the study drug 15 min prior to the onset of the hyperglycemic clamp, and patients randomized to GLAR received their last insulin dose the night before at bedtime. During the clamp at week 56 and week 172, patients did not receive either EXE or GLAR. Arginine was administered at t = 260 min during the hyperglycemic clamp to estimate maximum insulin secretory capacity at a steady-state glucose concentration of 15 mmol/L (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Whole-body insulin&#x02013;mediated glucose uptake (M value) was calculated as the mean glucose infusion rate during the last 30 min of the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp between 90&#x02013;120 min (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). First- and second-phase C-peptide secretion was calculated as area under the curve (AUC) 180&#x02013;190 min and AUC 190&#x02013;260 min, respectively. Arginine-stimulated C-peptide secretion (AIR<sub>arg</sub>) was calculated as the incremental AUC 260&#x02013;270 min above the C-peptide concentration prior to the start of the hyperglycemic clamp (t = 175 min). The disposition index (DI), a measure of &#x003b2;-cell function and adjusted for insulin sensitivity, was calculated by multiplying the first-phase incremental C-peptide secretion with the M value (AIR<sub>gluc</sub>*M) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> (normal range: 4.3&#x02013;6.1%, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT]-standardized Bio-Rad assay), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and safety parameters were measured by a central laboratory (Quintiles, Livingston, U.K.) prior to randomization and during each follow-up visit until the end of the 12-week off-drug period. Plasma glucose concentrations during the clamp were measured using a YSI 2300 STAT Plus (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) in Sweden and the Netherlands, and a Beckman-Coulter Glucose Analyzer 2 (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) in Finland. C-peptide samples were analyzed at the VU University Medical Center using a single batch immunoradiometric assay (Centaur; Bayer Diagnostics, Mijdrecht, the Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The extension study&#x02019;s primary efficacy end point was the treatment effect on the &#x003b2;-cell function measured as the first-phase glucose-stimulated C-peptide secretion adjusted for the M value. Nonnormally distributed data were base-e transformed prior to statistical analysis. Outcome measures were compared between the two treatment groups using an ANCOVA model. The dependent variable used in the model was the change from pretreatment for the &#x003b2;-cell function parameters (AIR<sub>arg</sub>, first phase, second phase). For all other end points, the dependent value used was the mean at the corresponding visit. The model included factors for treatment group (EXE/GLAR), site (the Netherlands/Sweden/Finland), and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> stratum (&#x02264;8.5%/&#x0003e;8.5%), and the pretreatment variable of the corresponding dependent variable as a covariate. If the parameter did not approximate the normal distribution after base-e transformation, a nonparametric test was used (DI statistics using Mann-Whitney test). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 for Mac OS X (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All inferential statistical tests were conducted at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided).

The anti-EXE antibodies had no predictive effect on the magnitude of an individual&#x02019;s glycemic response or the incidence of adverse events. Most reported adverse events with GLAR treatment were treatment-related minor hypoglycemia, 28%; gastrointestinal disorders, 16%; and vomiting, 8.0%. No major hypoglycemia and no treatment-related withdrawal because of hypoglycemia were observed in both the EXE and GLAR groups. In the GLAR-treated group, one patient (4.0%) withdrew his consent as a result of a cerebrovascular incident.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s16"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The main result of this 3-year follow-up study in patients treated with EXE is the sustained improvement in first-phase glucose-stimulated C-peptide secretion, adjusted for prevailing insulin sensitivity (the DI) 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. No significant effect was seen in the GLAR-treated patients despite achievement of similar glycemic control. Additionally, EXE treatment was associated with continued weight loss and improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity. Both EXE and GLAR were generally well tolerated with nausea and minor hypoglycemia being the most frequently reported adverse event in the EXE and GLAR groups, respectively.</p><p>Although human data are not available, exposure to GLP-1 and GLP-1RA in the preclinical setting results in &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, islet neogenesis, and inhibition of &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis in (human) cell lines, primary rodent islets, and in vivo in different rodent species (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It has therefore been hypothesized, although human islet-cell biology differs widely from that in rodents, that long-term GLP-1RA treatment may enhance &#x003b2;-cell mass or health in humans, thereby potentially modifying the progressive course of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The current study, particularly the 3-year data presented herein, reports that EXE treatment may lend some support to this idea, whereas following 1-year EXE exposure, the treatment-related improvement of &#x003b2;-cell function was lost after 4-week drug cessation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The current 3-year treatment data show a small but statistically significant effect on the DI following a 4-week off-therapy period. Our results therefore suggest that a 3-year treatment with a GLP-1RA (such as EXE) is necessary to delineate an effect on &#x003b2;-cell function. This beneficial effect was not enough to sustain glycemic control. Additional factors, such as duration of type 2 diabetes and achieved glycemic control and body weight reduction, may play a role in the ultimate efficacy of the GLP-1RA. An even longer treatment or intervention at an earlier stage of the disease may be necessary given the chronic nature of the disease. Additionally, our results confirm findings in diabetic fatty Zucker rats that prolonged EXE treatment in humans does not result in tachyphylaxis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Prolonged exposure to elevated glucose and lipid concentrations is detrimental to &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These combined glucolipotoxic effects result in impaired insulin secretion and &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis, and may contribute to the loss of &#x003b2;-cell function in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Our results show a similar reduction in hyperglycemia, i.e., glucose toxicity, in the EXE and GLAR groups after 3-year treatment. Although we did find a 0.2% greater HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction in the EXE-treated group, this finding did not reach statistical significance because of the decreased number of participants left in the study. Since glycemic control was similar for both treatments, this improvement cannot be solely attributed to an improvement of glycemic control; therefore, a GLP-1RA&#x02013;related factor should be considered.</p><p>In as much as &#x003b2;-cell function integrity is determined by the combined effects of variables related to &#x003b2;-cell stress versus &#x003b2;-cell health, it is important to note that 3-year EXE versus GLAR treatment resulted in body weight reduction of approximately 8 kg with concomitant improvement of insulin sensitivity. Body weight reduction per se has been shown to improve &#x003b2;-cell function in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Interestingly, the improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function reported in our article cannot be explained fully by the reduction in body weight alone. Most patients treated with EXE experienced a reduction in body weight. However, in about half of the patients treated with EXE, a combined improvement in body weight and DI was observed. Additionally, there appeared to be no statistical correlation between the body weight reduction and the DI improvement in both EXE- and GLAR-treated patients. Unfortunately, additional post hoc analysis is not possible because of the small sample size.</p><p>We recently demonstrated that EXE predominantly reduces trunkal fat mass, whereas lean body mass was not affected (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The observed 39% improvement in M value may at least partly be because of a lowering of the (trunkal) body fat mass. Obesity-related insulin resistance is a key feature of type 2 diabetes and is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular complications (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The landmark study by Zander et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) was the first to report a beneficial effect of continuous GLP-1 infusion on clamp-measured &#x003b2;-cell function as well as insulin sensitivity in the presence of concomitant weight loss of 1.9 kg in spite of the mere 6-week duration. Subsequent clinical studies using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance do not provide a clear view of the effects of GLP-1RA on insulin sensitivity and suggest that such an effect may be secondary to the weight reduction (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Because insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell secretory function are closely interrelated, it is essential to measure both when studying (long-term) therapeutic interventions that may affect insulin secretion and body weight (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The DI adjusts for the interaction between changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion as differences in insulin sensitivity must be balanced by reciprocal changes in insulin release in order to maintain glucose tolerance (and prevent hypoglycemia). In the case of EXE, given the observed weight loss&#x02013;related improvement in insulin sensitivity (+39%), one may have expected that if &#x003b2;-cell secretory function had remained unaltered, the C-peptide response would rather decline. However, inasmuch as the C-peptide remained substantially unaltered (compared with pretreatment), one may conclude that &#x003b2;-cell function, following 3 years of EXE exposure, was improved (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Additionally, no correlation was observed between treatment-related changes in DI and body weight (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0291/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. A2</ext-link>). Recently, DeFronzo et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) demonstrated a similar phenomenon following 20-week EXE monotherapy as compared with the combination of EXE and rosiglitazone (ROSI). The DI was similar in the EXE alone and EXE/ROSI groups, although the amount of insulin secreted in response to glucose alone or with arginine during the hyperglycemic clamp was markedly reduced in the group receiving EXE/ROSI combination therapy. These findings are in agreement with our results. Interestingly, DeFronzo et al. also showed an improvement in the DI calculated from the second-phase C-peptide secretion, a finding we did not observe in our study. In contrast to the former study, we did not administer EXE prior to the hyperglycemic clamp. This differential study design may account for the observed difference. Additionally, a DI that is not derived from the rapid C-peptide response to intravenous glucose may not present correct physiology (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The strength of our study is the long-term follow-up and the use of state-of-the-art gold standard methodology to quantify of insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function in the study population. Additionally, as patients did not receive study medication prior to the hyperglycemic clamp at the end of the extension phase, the effects of a 3-year treatment period on &#x003b2;-cell health were measured rather than the acute effects of EXE administration. One limitation of our study is the relatively modest proportion of randomized patients who completed the entire study. Fifty-two percent (36/69) of all randomized patients completed the entire 3-year treatment period. Of the original 51 patients who completed the 64-week main study, 46 agreed to participate in the extension phase. From these, 78% completed the additional 2-year treatment period, with similar numbers remaining in both treatment arms. Most patients withdrew their consent and did not participate in the 2-year extension phase of the study because of the demanding nature of the study protocol including long-term follow-up, which included a total of 30 visits (during 3.5 years) to the study center. The proportion of patients who did enter the additional 2-year treatment period show characteristics comparable to those participating in large intervention studies in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Only three patients discontinued the 2-year extension phase because of loss of glycemic control (EXE: <italic>n</italic> = 2; GLAR: <italic>n</italic> = 1). Finally, three patients dropped out as a result of an adverse event: one patient randomized to GLAR experienced an ischemic stroke, and two patients randomized to EXE dropped out as a result of nausea following reinitiating of EXE treatment during the first weeks of the extension period. Generally, both EXE and GLAR were well tolerated during the 3-year study period, and reported adverse events were mainly mild to moderate in intensity, confirming previous long-term study tolerability results (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). No renal function deterioration and no pancreatitis were observed. Interestingly, no patients randomized to EXE withdrew their consent during the 3-month off-drug period, whereas four patients in the GLAR group did. After cessation of GLAR, patients continued their SMBG measurements. Of the patients randomized to GLAR, 30.6% did not want to continue with the off-drug period of the study as they observed an increase in SMBG, confirming the important role SMBG plays in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, 3-year EXE treatment in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes resulted in sustained improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function and progressive weight reduction. Long-term follow-up in a wide variety of patients at earlier stages of type 2 diabetes is needed to study possible disease modifying effects of GLP-1RA.</p></sec>
