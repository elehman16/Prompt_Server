The limited number of cases highlights the variable and dynamic aspects of ARIA-E with both static and changing areas of edema and a wide range for time to onset and resolution in both placebo (PBO) and solanezumab (SLZ) treatment groups. Case studies were selected based on their ability to address several important clinical aspects of ARIA-E and its implications on treatment. All cases in these trials were asymptomatic.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>Data were obtained from two completed double-blind trials (EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION 2) and their ongoing open-label extension trial (EXPEDITION-EXT, data up to July 31, 2014) of solanezumab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD. The specific details of the double-blind trials and baseline demographics have been described previously <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MRIs were obtained at baseline, endpoint and at scheduled visits. Unscheduled MRIs were obtained any time at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>MRIs were assessed centrally by trained and validated neurologists. The neurologists are board certified and licensed physicians with subspecialty board certification in Radiology by the American Board of Radiology and specialty training in Neuroradiology with Certificates of Added Qualification in Neuroradiology, granted by the American Board of Radiology. The readers have been the central readers for the evaluation of ARIA on an average of 30 Alzheimer's trials each.</p><p>FLAIR sequences were evaluated for the presence of ARIA-E presenting either within the brain parenchyma or as sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity. ARIA-E severity was characterized as mild (confined to focal area), moderate (nonfocal, involving more than one site), and severe (multi-site, with extensive areas of involvement). When ARIA-E was detected, infusions were held unless otherwise noted, and follow-up MRIs were suggested at 4&#x02013;6-week intervals. GRE sequences were obtained and evaluated for the presence of ARIA-H. Patients were not excluded due to the presence of ARIA-H in most countries except for the United Kingdom and France where patients with &#x0003e;2 ARIA-H were excluded. ARIA-H were counted and reported as categories 0, 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 10 and &#x0003e;10, according to the number of ARIA-H seen. Co-localization of ARIA-E and ARIA-H was defined as occurrence or development of both in similar locations (within approximately 1&#x000a0;cm) in relatively similar time frames, although development may be separated temporally.</p><p>MRI was obtained at 221 imaging centers across 16 countries for which MRI standardization training was performed. Imaging was conducted on platforms including three MRI vendors (Siemens, General Electric, and Philips) and MRI field strengths of 1.5 or 3.0&#x000a0;Tesla <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. 2D FLAIR protocol was harmonized across manufacturers and field strength with range of values: Echo Time&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;94&#x02013;140&#x000a0;ms; inversion time&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2200&#x02013;2800&#x000a0;ms; repetition time&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9000&#x02013;10000&#x000a0;ms; slice thickness&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;mm with 1&#x000a0;mm gap <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The percentages of patients with ARIA-E and ARIA-H were compared between treatment groups in EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION 2 using a Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test for general association controlling for study. For patients originally assigned to placebo during the double-blind studies, the entire observation period was reported; however, when they developed ARIA-E during solanezumab treatment in the open-label study, they were considered as solanezumab-treated patients. Final MRI outcome was determined using the last available MRI obtained. Some patients may have continued infusions without scheduled or unscheduled MRIs. Therefore, if ARIA-E did occur, it was not associated with any symptoms. As some analyses were conducted on data from patients in the ongoing study EXPEDITION-EXT, changes in some data may occur on subsequent final data lock.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>Two cases of ARIA-E were detected during screening of patients for the double-blind studies EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION 2, and these patients were excluded from the studies <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. During the double-blind treatment period, ARIA-E occurred in both placebo- (PBO, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) and solanezumab-treated patients (SLZ, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.131; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Seven cases occurred during the open-label study EXPEDITION-EXT, with one patient, Patient B, in both groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). There was a mix of sulcal (nine instances) and parenchymal (13 instances) and mixed sulcal and parenchymal (one instance) ARIA-E (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Adverse events were reviewed for events preceding detection of and during ARIA-E, and all cases were asymptomatic. One patient (C) reported a headache and nausea approximately 1 month before the scheduled MRI and again 2 days after the scheduled MRI showed ARIA-E. However, the headache and nausea resolved each time within 48&#x000a0;hours after treatment with paracetamol, whereas the ARIA-E was only partially resolved at the last MRI obtained 149&#x000a0;days after the initial observation.</p><p>In placebo-treated and solanezumab-treated patients, ARIA-E occurred throughout the observation period with a range of onset between 73&#x02013;566 and 22&#x02013;1295&#x000a0;days, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). The range for time to resolution and/or partial resolution was also variable for placebo-treated and solanezumab-treated patients, ranging from 22&#x02013;316 and 51&#x02013;300&#x000a0;days, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). One patient (H) assigned to placebo in the feeder studies developed ARIA-E, switched to open-label solanezumab for 14 infusions and then stopped dosing; the patient then had complete resolution after an additional 303&#x000a0;days (661&#x000a0;days from onset). Complete resolution was observed in 10 patients (three PBO and seven SLZ) and partial resolution in 5 patients (two PBO and three SLZ; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Some solanezumab-treated patients had limited follow-up; four had no change, and four had increased ARIA-E at the last MRI obtained (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>In 19 of 22 of the ARIA-E patients, <italic>APOE</italic> genotype was available. Eleven of 19 (58%) ARIA-E patients with <italic>APOE</italic> genotyping were <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers compared with 1098 of 1866 (59%) of the overall study population (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 allele is not over represented in the cohort of patients with ARIA-E. However, six of the 19 ARIA-E patients (32%) were <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 homozygotes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>), compared with 242 of 1866 (13%) of the overall study population. This suggests that patients with two <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 alleles are at increased risk of developing ARIA-E.</p><p>In the pooled trial population at baseline, 1639 of 2019 (approximately 80%) patients had no ARIA-H at baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). In addition, there were no significant differences in the categorical distribution of ARIA-H between treatment groups at baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). During the double-blind treatment period, 7.3% and 9.1% of placebo and solanezumab-treated patients had changes in ARIA-H, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.14). In addition, there was no significant difference in the degree (number) of increases in ARIA-H between the placebo and solanezumab treatment groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.08; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B). At the time of ARIA-E detection, 3 of 23 patients (one patient was counted twice) had no ARIA-H and in two patients, ARIA-H status was not analyzable (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Sixteen of 21 patients (76%) with ARIA-E and scans assessable for ARIA-H experienced increases in ARIA-H at the time of ARIA-E (PBO, 3/5: 60% and SLZ, 13/16; 81%; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).

After complete resolution of this occurrence of ARIA, the patient was re-challenged, remained in the study for an additional year and had no further ARIA-E. Patient L was originally treated with solanezumab during EXPEDITION 2 and had ARIA-E at Week 12 (four infusions). After complete resolution of mild right and left-frontal ARIA-E, the patient received an additional 14 solanezumab infusions in EXPEDITION 2 with no recurrence of ARIA-E. Patient L then enrolled in EXPEDITION-EXT and discontinued after approximately 2&#x000a0;years and 8&#x000a0;months due to patient decision regarding inability to tolerate further MRI without an another MRI or incidence of symptomatic ARIA-E.

The incidence of ARIA-E is significantly greater during treatment with some agents that target amyloid compared with placebo-treated patients <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is thought that more ARIA is associated with treatment with anti-amyloid antibodies such as bapineuzumab and gantenerumab that target the N-terminal region of A&#x003b2; because those epitopes are exposed in amyloid plaques <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and are available for antibody binding. It has been suggested that during bapineuzumab treatment, parenchymal plaque is transiently relocated to the cerebral vasculature <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and either the increased cerebrovascular amyloid or removal of amyloid in weakened vasculature leads to ARIA-E and ARIA-H <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Solanezumab binds to the mid-domain of A&#x003b2; and does not bind deposited amyloid plaque, presumably because this domain is unavailable. Because solanezumab binds only soluble A&#x003b2; with very high affinity, it should not be associated with translocation of amyloid to or direct removal from the cerebral vasculature and therefore be associated with less ARIA than N-terminally directed antibodies that target deposited plaque. ARIA in placebo-treated subjects may occur from other mechanisms such as disease-mediated changes in amyloid production and/or clearance or local inflammatory processes <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>In double-blind phase 3 trials of solanezumab, asymptomatic ARIA-E occurred in placebo-treated patients (0.5%) and solanezumab-treated patients (1.1%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.131; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). In both treatment groups, ARIA-E was a variable dynamic process with a range of severity, sometimes occurring in one or more brain regions. In placebo-treated and solanezumab-treated patients, ARIA-E occurred with a wide range of time to onset and time to resolution with some patients having no change or increased ARIA-E at their final study MRI. No cases were clearly related to concomitant symptoms.</p><p>Phase 2 studies of bapineuzumab have reported an incidence of ARIA-E in treated patients of 9.7%, with a dose-dependent increase in incidence of up to 26.7%, whereas the incidence in placebo-treated patients was 0.8% <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In a combined retrospective reanalysis of MRIs from the two phase 2 studies and an open-label extension study of bapineuzumab, 17% of bapineuzumab-treated patients had ARIA-E with a dose-dependent increase in risk <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The mean number of infusions (every 13&#x000a0;weeks) before detection of ARIA-E was 2.4 (SD 1.7; range 1&#x02013;7). Most ARIA-E cases (25 of 36; 69%) were identified after the first or second infusion. ARIA-E was not observed &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;years after the first exposure to bapineuzumab. The median duration of ARIA-E for the 31 of 36 patients whose ARIA-E was resolved on follow-up scans was 113&#x000a0;days (IQR, 61&#x02013;182) <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Phase 3 studies of bapineuzumab have reported an incidence of ARIA-E in placebo-treated patients of 0.2% compared with a dose-dependent increase in incidence of 14.2% in the 2.0-mg/kg <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 noncarrier group and 15.3% in the 0.5-mg/kg <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carrier group <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Similar to the phase 2 studies, most ARIA-E cases in the phase 3 studies occurred within the first 3 doses (&#x0223c;39&#x000a0;weeks or 273&#x000a0;days) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a phase 1 study, two of eight patients treated with 200-mg gantenerumab (every 4 weeks) developed ARIA-E after 2 or 4 doses (every 4 weeks) <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>A lower percentage of patients in the reanalysis of the bapineuzumab phase 2 studies <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> had ARIA-H at baseline (9.2%, 19 of 207) compared with our studies (18.8%). In these studies, incident ARIA-H occurred in 24 of 294 patients (8.1%) patients; however, treatment effect on incident ARIA-H was not reported in this analysis. In the phase 3 bapineuzumab studies, incident cerebral microhemorrhage and cerebral hemosiderin deposition were only reported as serious treatment-emergent adverse events at a much lower rate of 0.4% of <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 noncarriers and 0.7% of <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers treated with bapineuzumab (0.5% combined) compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, supplemental material). Incident ARIA-H was similar between our studies (PBO, 7.3% and 9.1% SLZ) and the reanalyzed bapineuzumab phase 2 studies (8.1%) <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although statistical analysis of treatment differences between placebo and bapineuzumab <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and placebo and gantenerumab <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> were not reported, the treatment difference between placebo and solanezumab for incident ARIA-H was not statistically significant.</p><p>A similar percentage of <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 allele carriers was seen in solanezumab-treated patients with ARIA-E compared with the overall trial population (58% vs 59%), suggesting that the <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 allele is not overrepresented in the cohort with ARIA-E. However, the percentage of homozygous <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 patients with ARIA-E (32%) is higher than in the overall study population (13%) suggesting that <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 homozygotes have an increased risk of developing ARIA-E. In patients with ARIA-E who had <italic>APOE</italic> genotyping in the retrospective review of the phase 2 bapineuzumab trials, the <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 allele was present in 86% compared with 65% of the overall cohort <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Similar to the EXPEDITION studies, a greater percentage of patients who developed ARIA were <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 homozygotes compared with the percentage of <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 homozygotes in the overall trial population (36% vs 16%, respectively) <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Using Cox proportional hazards models, an increased risk of ARIA-E was determined of approximately 3-4-fold and 7-fold in <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the phase 3 bapineuzumab studies after central read of the MRIs, ARIA-E was reported in <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers at 1.1% in placebo-treated patients and 16.9%&#x02013;34.5% in bapineuzumab-treated patients and in noncarriers at 0.6% and 5.6%&#x02013;19.9% in placebo-treated and bapineuzumab-treated patients, respectively <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, the two patients treated with 200-mg gantenerumab in the phase 1 study who developed ARIA-E were homozygous for <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Other data have suggested that <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers have a higher vascular amyloid burden <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> which could lead to increased ARIA-H and/or vascular permeability <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Other data also suggest an interrelationship between ARIA-H and ARIA-E as in many cases, new ARIA-H was seen in the location of ARIA-E before it occurs or after it has resolved <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In our studies, 71% (15 of 21) of patients with ARIA-E and scans assessable for ARIA-H, experienced increases in ARIA-H at the time of ARIA-E; 48% (10 of 21) had colocalization of ARIA-H changes with ARIA-E. In the retrospective review of the phase 2 bapineuzumab studies, 82% (14 of 17) of bapineuzumab-treated patients had co-incident ARIA-H and ARIA-E, and 57% (8 of 14) of patients had co-localization <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, the two gantenerumab-treated patients who developed ARIA-E also had coincident ARIA-H <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Taken together, these data support a relationship between incident ARIA-H and ARIA-E. However, interestingly, the one patient in the EXPEDITION studies that had two instances of ARIA-E (Patient B, one during PBO treatment and one during SLZ treatment) had no detectable ARIA-H at baseline and no detectable changes in ARIA-H before ARIA-E or after resolution.</p><p>Important clinical issues of ARIA-E include management of associated symptoms and withdrawal or continuation of treatment during ARIA-E. In our trials, when ARIA-E was detected, no intervention was performed beyond holding solanezumab infusion, and although some patients had very long time to resolution or the ARIA-E was ongoing at their last study MRI, all patients remained asymptomatic. In the phase 2 study, 6 of 12 of the bapineuzumab-treated patients with ARIA-E had symptoms of headache, confusion, vomiting, and gait disturbance, with one patient requiring treatment with steroids <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Some answers to whether patients can be treated through asymptomatic ARIA-E may be obtained from patients that continued treatment during very subtle asymptomatic ARIA-E that was not initially recognized and discovered only after retrospective review of MRIs. In our trials, eight patients were dosed though ARIA-E (range 3 to 17 infusions) with no associated symptoms and a variable outcome from complete resolution to increased severity at the final MRI. In the bapineuzumab phase 2 and 3 trials, an increased incidence of ARIA-E was discovered after rereview by central readers <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; these additionally identified ARIA-E patients continued treatment while mild, asymptomatic ARIA-E was present. Taken together, these data suggest that the treatment may continue during the presence of mild asymptomatic ARIA-E.</p><p>The ability to restart therapy after resolution of ARIA-E is another important aspect of clinical management. Four patients with ARIA-E were treated with or re-challenged with solanezumab after complete resolution of ARIA-E (range, 50&#x02013;75&#x000a0;days) and 3 of 4 had no additional reoccurrence over approximately 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;years additional exposure. In the phase 2 study, after resolution of ARIA-E, 6 bapineuzumab-treated patients restarted treatment with 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg and were titrated up to 50% of the original dose without reoccurrence of ARIA-E <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, two patients with ARIA-E detected after the central reread in the bapineuzumab phase 2 studies developed ARIA-E again when re-challenged <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Preclinical animal models suggest that repair and remodeling of cerebral vasculature occurs <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> after ARIA <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> that may prevent further occurrence <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. If similar mechanisms are functioning after ARIA in humans, it would explain the ability to rechallenge patients without further occurrence of ARIA-E with solanezumab or bapineuzumab in some patients <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and the differential location of 2 instances of ARIA-E in one patient in our trials.</p><p>One limitation of our data is the extent of follow-up after ARIA-E due to the patients' willingness or ability to return for unscheduled MRIs. Another limitation is that testing for evidence of amyloid pathology was not a required inclusion criterion for these studies. However, as ARIA is associated with the presence of amyloid pathology, all patients who developed ARIA are presumed to be amyloid positive. In addition, only three patients in the ARIA-E cohort participated in the optional amyloid-PET addendum and only one placebo patient had an endpoint PET scan, limiting the assessment of correlation between location and amount of amyloid plaque change and ARIA-E.</p><p>Although the presentation of ARIA-E is variable among patients participating in clinical trials, when it occurs, it appears to be manageable with close monitoring, withholding investigational therapy, treatment of any potential associated symptoms and re-initiation of treatment. Additional data and analyses will help to further guide clinicians in the management of ARIA in their patients with AD.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: The authors searched available literature using PubMed and OVID search engines to identify articles.
