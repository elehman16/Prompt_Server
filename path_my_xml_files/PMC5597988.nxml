This will impose a significant economic burden on the community. For example, by 2060 in Australia spending on dementia is predicted to overtake any other health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Groups at risk for cognitive decline include older adults free of dementia but with Subjective Memory Complaints (SMC) or with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The prevalence of MCI and SMC increases with age and we have previously shown that it affects 10.6% and 46% of community-dwelling women 70&#x000a0;years and older, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Regular physical activity appears to be one of the strongest factors to delay or prevent cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For optimal health benefits, older adults need to perform at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on five days each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, unfortunately levels of PA decline with age. For example in Australia only one in three men and one in five women aged 75&#x000a0;years or over undertake sufficient physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Changing sedentary behavior is difficult, with 50% of those starting an exercise program giving up by six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Groups with health problems face an even greater challenge than healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Few studies have investigated strategies that change behavior to initiate the uptake of PA and enhance long-term maintenance in people with SMC and MCI who have an increased risk of AD.</p><p id="Par61">Older adults prefer home-based over center-based physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We have previously shown that a 6-month individualized home-based PA intervention based on the stages of change and social cognitive models increases PA and improves the cognitive function of older adults with SMC and MCI in the short and long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">In behaviour change research, goal-setting has been used as a method of intervention as well as a measurement tool to assess the efficacy of interventions. Goal-based approaches have been used successively in frail older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and healthy older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Bangor Goal-Setting Interview (BGSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] allows researchers to select an area of behaviour that is relevant to a study and provides a structure to elicit individual goals and standardise the method of rating the individual&#x02019;s attainment in relation to the identified goals.</p><p id="Par63">Mentoring has been used in other activities and settings as well as the PA setting to develop skills and change behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For programs to be successful, older adults need informed advice, and using peer volunteers to deliver programs may improve the translation of evidence-based PA programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Peer mentors, that is, non-professional individuals who have appropriate training, provide a unique resource to motivate same-age adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In a study that compared peer-mentoring with counselling by young trained professionals in a structured exercise setting, improvements in perceived physical, mental and social functioning were observed in the peer-mentored group but not with younger mentors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A peer-delivered theory-based advice and support program reported no difference in moderate and vigorous PA after 16&#x000a0;weeks compared to an intervention similar to that offered in the community but after 18&#x000a0;months follow-up, the group with the peer-delivered program had significantly greater increases in moderate and vigorous PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further, a telephone-based physical activity intervention delivered by professional staff and peer mentors resulted in similar improvements in physical activity but the peer delivered program was shown to have more versatility and comprehensiveness in the quality of intervention content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Thus peer mentoring has the potential to provide a novel delivery model for PA promotion programs and the dissemination of PA information in the community. There are several questions that need investigation. First, can peer mentors be adequately trained to delivered a theory based intervention in people at increased risk of AD; second, can this be effectively delivered by telephone; third, can peer mentoring be successful in a home-based setting; fourth, will the program lead to greater PA adherence than programs without peer mentoring; and fifth, is the program cost effective?</p><p id="Par65">In addition, little is known about the effect of mentoring on the mentor&#x02019;s self-efficacy to mentor, their own subsequent PA behavior and well-being. Is the mentoring process beneficial to mentors? Studies on volunteers and counselling have reported improvements in well-being, mental health and self-esteem for counsellors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, providing a valued service can lead to an increase in well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A novel aspect of this study is that we will evaluate the mentor&#x02019;s self-efficacy, skills and PA behavior.</p><p id="Par66">The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) among insufficiently active older adults at increased risk of developing AD is to determine whether a 6-month home-based physical activity (PA) intervention with individual goal-setting and peer mentors (GM-PA) leads to a significantly greater increase in PA compared to a the same PA program delivered with standard education and peer contact only (CO-PA). We hypothesize that participants randomized to the GM-PA intervention with peer mentors will show a significantly greater increase in their PA at the end of the intervention compared to participants randomized to the control group (CO-PA). A secondary aim is to determine if the GM-PA programs leads to better health outcomes compared to controls. Another secondary aim is to evaluate the health outcomes of peer volunteers.</p><p id="Par67">The Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study, the participants gave written consent to participate and the project complies with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par68">This is a single blind RCT, which is based on CONSORT guidelines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and includes a health economics analysis.

Decision analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] will be used to compare the downstream consequences of GM-PA versus CO-PA. The incorporation of Markov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and life-tabling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] techniques will allow for the modelling of outcomes beyond the 12-month duration of the study. The main output of interest is incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of net costs per unit of health gain. Net costs will comprise the costs of GM-PA minus costs saved from the reduction in downstream health services utilization. Health gains will be measured in a variety of ways. Years of life gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained will be estimated, both enabled by the collection of time-to-outcome data and quality of life data, as described above. All health economic analyses will be undertaken in accordance with recommended approaches, such as 5% discounting of estimated future costs and health gains. To account for any uncertainty in the data inputs for health economic modeling, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses will be undertaken via Monte Carlo simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par123">Participants who withdraw during the trial will be invited to return for the follow-up assessments to allow for an intention-to-treat analysis (primary analysis).</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par124">The primary outcome will be the change in PA at follow-up as measured by the pedometer in steps/day. We have shown that a mean difference of 1200 steps between experimental and control groups would have clinical implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A study sample size of 53 per group was estimated to give 80% power at &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 to detect a difference of 1200 steps/day between the groups. Given our previous experience with PA interventions in sedentary older adults we have accounted for a potential 25% attrition rate and also adjusted for the intra-class correlation generated by having one mentor with more than one participant. We calculated the inflation factor 1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;r (c-1), in which, on average, each mentor will have 2 participants (c), and we have assumed an intraclass correlation of 0.15 (r), which is considered of medium size with an estimate of 76 participants per group. For the secondary outcome, quality of life this size sample will also allow us to detect a mean difference between groups of 4.5 standardized units, as measured by the SF-36. We also estimate that this would detect an improvement of 20% in the mentoring self-efficacy scale in mentors with 80% of power at &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par125">Continuous variables with normal distribution will be described using means and standard deviations; median and inter-quartile range will be used for those without a normal distribution. Categorical variables will be described using frequency tables. The efficacy of the intervention will be primarily assessed with an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis at the end of the intervention with secondary analysis for the 12-month time point. This effect will be tested as the interaction between the allocation group (intervention and control) and time, on the primary and secondary outcomes. We will apply multilevel regression models (mixed models) with baseline value of each outcome included in the model as a covariate. In a complementary analysis, we will apply imputation by chained equations to perform an ITT analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures. Alpha will be set at 5% and all statistical tests reported will be two-tailed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par126">If this study is able to demonstrate that a PA program utilising individual goal-setting and peer mentors leads to a significantly greater increase in PA compared to a the same PA program with standard education and peer contact it will provide evidence that the use of peer mentors to promote the uptake and maintenance of PA in previously insufficiently active older adults at risk of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease is both effective and acceptable. Further, it will support the use of the BGSI as both a measurement tool and intervention strategy. Our modified version of the BGSI with a focus on physical activity behavior used in this study will also provide information on the feasibility of its use in a home-based setting with individuals with SMC or MCI who may have additional challenges in initiating the uptake of PA and maintaining the change in PA behavior in the long-term. In addition to the usual barriers to initiating or reaching recommendations for PA for older adults this target group may also experience difficulty in articulating goals, organizing priorities, planning, remembering and carrying out action plans. The structure of the interview around the 4 areas of physical health, physical activity, physical function and every day function with more detailed attention to specific areas of physical activity, physical function and the processes involved as well the reinforcement and support of the mentors on a regular basis will potentially provide a potent strategy for behavior change.</p><p id="Par127">We will also be able to determine whether this change in PA behavior has an effect on other physical, health and cognitive measures. These findings would be highly significant as it has been estimated that 13% of all cases of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease are potentially attributable to physical inactivity and that a 10&#x02013;25% reduction of physical inactivity would prevent between 380,000 to 1 million AD cases worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Currently there are no effective pharmacological strategies to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and AD, resulting in an increasing call to focus on reducing modifiable risk factors such as midlife hypertension, diabetes mellitus, midlife obesity, depression, smoking, cognitive and physical inactivity. It has been estimated that worldwide about one-third of the AD cases might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The authors also proposed that with a 10% reduction in each of these risk factors per decade by 2050 there would be a reduction in the prevalence of AD by an estimated 8.3%. Targeted, effective and economically viable PA education and intervention strategies will be needed to achieve these reductions. The current intervention has the potential to be such a program.</p><p id="Par128">Attrition rates for PA interventions in older adults of up to 12&#x000a0;months have ranged from 27% to 50% with most of the attrition occurring in the first 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In a 16-week group-based peer mentor delivered PA intervention 17% attrition was reported at 16&#x000a0;weeks but at 18&#x000a0;months this had increased to 62% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This study demonstrated a significant increase in moderate to vigorous intensity increase in the peer- delivered compared to the community program after 18&#x000a0;months. Our study differs from these earlier studies using peer mentors in that it is home-based, has peer support via telephone and employs a PA focused individualized goal-setting measurement tool and behavior change program. Effective strategies for increasing the PA levels of older adults or indeed preventing the increase in sedentary behavior by active older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] that are cost effective and able to be translated into the community are long overdue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Potentially using the resources within the community that are already health or PA focused such as physically active peer mentors is an attractive approach that will improve the cost effectiveness and make this intervention more translatable into community or clinical settings.</p><p id="Par129">To our knowledge this is the first trial to investigate the effects of a goal-orientated home-based PA program with peer mentoring on PA levels in previously inactive older adults with SMC or MCI. Should the main hypothesis be confirmed, we will contribute new knowledge on how to successfully motivate insufficiently active individuals at increased risk of AD to increase their PA. Further this study has been designed to provide training and resources for peer mentors as well as a ready tool for the measurement of PA goals and the implementation of a PA and goal-setting program that could be translated into the community. If the GM-PA program is successful in increasing the PA levels of this target group this program delivered via peer mentors has the potential to provide a cost effective strategy and community resource that can be readily translated into practice.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACTR</term><def><p id="Par8">Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p id="Par9">Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADAS-cog 13</term><def><p id="Par10">Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale 13 &#x02013;
