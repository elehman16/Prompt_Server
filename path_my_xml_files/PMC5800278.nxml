The largest proportion of hospitalisations now occurs in older patients, with high rates of multimorbidity and complex care needs. In Australia, this population is usually managed by hospital inpatient general internal medicine units. Adherence to consensus best-practice guidelines is poor. Ensuring evidence-based care and reducing length of stay may improve patient outcomes and reduce organisational costs. This study aims to evaluate an alternative model of care designed to improve adherence to four Level 1 or 2 evidence-supported interventions (routine corticosteroids, early switch to oral antibiotics, early mobilisation and routine malnutrition screening).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The IMPROVing Evidence-based treatment Gaps and outcomes in community-Acquired Pneumonia (IMPROVE-GAP) trial is a pragmatic, investigator-initiated, stepped-wedge randomised trial. Patients hospitalised under a general internal medicine unit who meet a standard case definition for community-acquired pneumonia will be included. Eight general internal medicine units at two Australian hospitals in a single health service will be randomised using concealed allocation to: (i) usual medical, nursing and allied health care delivered according to existing organisational practice or (ii) care supported by a dedicated &#x0201c;community-acquired pneumonia service&#x0201d;: a multidisciplinary team deploying algorithm-based implementation of a bundle of the four evidence-based interventions. The primary outcome measure will be length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures include inpatient mortality, 30 and 90&#x000a0;day readmission rates and mortality and health-service utilisation costs. Protocol adherence will be measured and reported, and serious adverse events (rates of hyperglycaemia requiring&#x000a0;new insulin; falls during mobilisation) will be collected and reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">IMPROVE-GAP represents an important and unique precedent for testing a new service-delivery model for improving compliance with a number of evidence-based interventions. Its stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial design provides a means to address some significant ethical, organisational and other methodological challenges to evaluating the effectiveness of health-service interventions in complex hospital populations. The new service-delivery model will effectively be fully implemented by trial completion, facilitating rapid, seamless translation into practice should care outcomes be superior.

In Australia, community-acquired pneumonia is responsible for more hospital admissions than any other single illness (61,000 hospital admissions per year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and incurs direct healthcare costs of more than AU $300 million annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prolonged length of stay can increase organisational costs and is strongly associated with adverse patient outcomes, including loss of function due to de-conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and a higher incidence of hospital-acquired adverse events, such as hospital-acquired infections, intravascular-device associated complications and antibiotic-related side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the modern era, in developed countries, a majority of the population hospitalised for community-acquired pneumonia are elderly and have a high prevalence of multimorbidity, which is independently associated with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This group also incurs the highest costs, owing to longer hospitalisations, higher readmission risks and poor functional outcomes. Multimorbidity also increases complexity of care, which makes it more difficult to maintain compliance with evidence-based guidelines. In Australia, acute unplanned non-surgical hospital admissions of multimorbid patients are largely managed by general internal medicine units, who therefore now manage the largest proportion of patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. With population ageing, the elderly and highly multimorbid population treated by general internal medicine units is likely to constitute the bulk of Australia&#x02019;s future health-service burden for community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">We have identified four key interventions (adjunctive corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, early mobilisation and routine malnutrition screening) that are now supported by Level 1 or 2 evidence demonstrating improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.</p><p id="Par14">At the time this trial was designed, a body of evidence had accrued to support the efficacy of adjunct corticosteroids, including results from two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showing that they (1) reduced treatment failure in severe community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and (2) shortened time to clinical stability and time to effective hospital discharge without an increase in adverse complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although there is a slightly higher risk of hyperglycaemia, this can be effectively treated with insulin with no long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Meta-analyses had also confirmed these findings and demonstrated an overall lower rate of complications in corticosteroid-treated patients, including a reduction in the need for vasopressors or mechanical ventilation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia routinely prescribed corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Early mobilisation safely and effectively reduces length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as does an early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent randomised trial of both these interventions found that length of stay was shortened by two days compared with standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis of malnourished medical inpatients (including those admitted with community-acquired pneumonia), systematic screening for malnutrition risk and targeted nutritional therapy reduced non-elective readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Despite this high-level evidence, these interventions are poorly or not routinely deployed in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, they represent areas where there is significant scope to improve the translation of evidence into clinical practice, demonstrating a clear &#x0201c;evidence-practice gap&#x0201d;. The notoriously poor adherence to consensus guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia is consistent with a broader general problem of widespread delays and inconsistency in translation of evidence into healthcare practice in a variety of fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This results in poorer patient outcomes and a greater healthcare and societal burden. Therefore, improving this &#x0201c;evidence-practice gap&#x0201d; has been recognised as a leading priority for the medical research establishment in Australia and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Innovative health-service approaches, including alternative models of care, will be required to bridge this gap and it will be important that their effectiveness is measured in a suitably robust fashion. Evaluations should therefore: (1) be conducted in appropriately &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; settings in representative populations that enable generalisability throughout the health system and (2) be appropriately statistically powered and designed in a way that minimises potential for confounding and bias that could lead to misleading conclusions regarding the presence, or lack thereof, of a real impact of the intervention. However, in practice there are very important and difficult methodological challenges to designing evaluations of this type, especially for conditions like community-acquired pneumonia, which now largely manifests in patients who may be difficult to enrol into studies utilising conventional research designs. In particular, high rates of cognitive impairment, confusion or drowsiness, general frailty, severe or life-threatening illness and (in populations such as ours) high proportions from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are extremely challenging to enrol into interventional studies based on individual randomisation and consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This has resulted in a very well-documented phenomenon, where the usefulness of clinical trial data comes into question, owing to its poor generalisability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, health-service interventions are fundamentally designed to be deployed on a large scale (e.g. organisation-wide), meaning that deployment on a small scale (e.g. based on individual randomisation) is impractical. Therefore, it is more appropriate to utilise designs where the unit of randomisation is larger &#x02013; ideally based on a practical sub-division of the existing health system that can then be used as the unit for randomisation to determine which cluster does or does not receive the intervention. The relatively recent development of stepped-wedge study designs may provide a very effective tool in this context. Stepped-wedge studies are effectively a type of cluster RCT. However, unlike conventional cluster RCTs, in stepped-wedge approaches, after a baseline period during which none of the clusters receives the intervention, the intervention is then progressively &#x0201c;rolled out&#x0201d; in constant increments in several clusters over time so that, by study conclusion, all clusters are receiving the intervention (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This design is therefore analogous to an &#x0201c;upscaling&#x0201d; that effectively mimics the way an intervention might be deployed in practice and is therefore particularly well-suited to implementation and health-service research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Statistical analysis principles have now been established to ensure that the effects of cluster and variation in outcomes across time periods are appropriately modelled and accounted for when developing estimates of treatment effect from these designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This approach has significant logistic, financial and ethical advantages over conventional cluster and individual RCT approaches, particularly where collected outcomes are part of usual care, minimising additional burden to researchers and participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. On conclusion of the study, all clusters will be receiving the intervention (implemented across the whole service), which could then be continued indefinitely if it proves effective. This approach allows a seamless transition to local implementation and can reduce the time to clinical translation significantly when compared with conventional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Stepped-wedge rollout of community-acquired pneumonia service by general internal medicine unit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2407_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">A key barrier to translation involves changing clinician behaviour; we therefore hypothesise that an effective way to meet the challenge of improving compliance with a number of evidence-based interventions simultaneously in a complex patient group, is to utilise an independent syndrome-based clinical service for community-acquired pneumonia, analogous to those applied in other areas (e.g. stroke services) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our proposed community-acquired pneumonia service would have core responsibility for ensuring comprehensive and rigorous current evidence-based best practice by recommending that clinical teams align treatment with a standardised set of management algorithms incorporating interventions supported by at least Level 2 evidence. This novel service-delivery approach therefore represents the intervention being tested in our stepped-wedge study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objectives</title><p id="Par17">The primary objective of the IMPROVing Evidence-based treatment Gaps and outcomes in community-Acquired Pneumonia (IMPROVE-GAP) trial is to estimate the effect that a translation community-acquired pneumonia service delivering four evidence-based interventions has on length of hospital stay, when compared with usual hospital care.

General internal medicine services manage the largest proportion of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in our health service, with 47% of admissions for community-acquired pneumonia managed by general internal medicine from 2012 to 2013 (average age, 75&#x000a0;years, with proportions with at least 1, 2 or 3 active comorbidities of 70%, 43% and 27% respectively).

Importantly, our supervising human research ethics committee granted approval for waiver of consent for enrolment on the basis that (1) the intervention represented a systematic implementation of standardised evidence-based best practice, rather than the testing of an unproven novel treatment, (2) study outcomes are already routinely collected by the health service and (3) the study&#x02019;s rationale and proposed methods met each of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council&#x02019;s criteria for appropriate use of a waiver of consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Its stepped-wedge design is better suited than other RCT approaches to evaluating a health-service intervention in a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; operational context. It also has pragmatic advantages in that once the study is completed, the intervention has effectively been implemented in the health system in which it has been tested and, should the implementation be found to be financially and clinically effective, can then be continued indefinitely. It may therefore demonstrate the power of stepped-wedge trial designs to accelerate the &#x02018;time to translation&#x02019; when implementing clinical trial evidence in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This has value both to patients, who benefit from improved outcomes and, if the intervention also has an efficiency dividend, to the health system. We acknowledge the possibility that, despite considering patients masked to allocation owing to the waiver of consent, that it is possible that some patients were aware of study interventions. However, we feel that the risk of selection bias was minimised, as allocation to treating unit was determined by established practice according to day of admission or previous admitting unit. Our design also aimed to minimise attrition bias (by using routinely available outcome measures, such as length of stay, clinical cost and inpatient mortality) although readmission rate may be susceptible to attrition bias, as readmission to other health services was not routinely available nor collected.</p><p id="Par100">An extremely important aspect of our study design was the decision by our supervising human research ethics committee to grant a waiver of consent for this study. This approach required very careful deliberation by both the investigating team and the human research ethics committee and represents an important precedent for conducting health-service research of this type, especially as it will allow enrolment of a study population that is truly representative of a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; scenario, generalisable to the population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in developed countries and health care systems where most patients are now elderly, with high rates of multimorbidity and complex care needs. We believe this will be vital for high-quality health-service research in the future, by enabling a robust means of prospectively measuring the effectiveness of new health-service interventions in representative populations. We also strongly believe that this approach is ethically justifiable, based on its use of routinely available data, application of an intervention based on best practice (supported by a high level of existing evidence) and its concordance with current official ethical guidelines for use of a waiver of consent. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the approach represents a departure from existing conventional clinical trial designs and could still be considered controversial. In particular, there can be subjectivity and disagreement within the clinical and scientific community as to the quality and applicability of evidence from previous clinical trials. This may undermine our assertion that our intervention represents &#x02018;best practice&#x02019;, which is fundamental to our argument of ethical defensibility. It is also notable that many aspects of our intervention that we deemed well-supported by evidence are yet to be incorporated into official consensus guidelines. In particular, the most widely cited community-acquired pneumonia management guidelines are those of the&#x000a0;Infectious Diseases Society of America; these have not been updated since 2007. We decided, however, that these have been superseded by more recent studies and that the most ethically defensible approach therefore was to provide our patients with the benefit of knowledge accrued from large RCTs and meta-analyses performed more recently. However, we acknowledge that there was potential for subjective interpretation as to how we assessed the existing body of evidence in its entirety. It is also possible that the evidence on which we based our interventions will, in turn, be superseded by subsequent clinical trials. For these reasons, it is therefore possible that human research ethics committees in other settings and who operate under different guidelines might decide to rule against granting a waiver of consent for a study of this type. Regardless, IMPROVE-GAP represents an important precedent that should be a starting point for ongoing discussions regarding the best ways to prosecute future health-service research, particularly translation of best practice, in this ethically complex and challenging environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par101">The trial is ongoing and is actively enrolling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec38"><p>
