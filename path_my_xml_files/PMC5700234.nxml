This genetic disorder is caused by mutations in either the <italic>TSC1</italic> or the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene, which results in aberrant activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Increased mTORC1 signaling results in growth of hamartomas, which may begin in utero, in several organs throughout the body, including the kidneys, skin, brain, liver, lungs, and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Although classified as benign, TSC-associated tumors may have significant negative impacts on organ function. Many patients with TSC exhibit cortical tubers and develop subependymal nodules (SEN) in the brain prenatally or early in life, which can continue growth as slow-growing glioneural tumors known as subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), which may lead to serious complications such as acute hydrocephalus and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Renal angiomyolipomata are a common TSC-related manifestation, occurring in up to 80% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These lesions typically occur bilaterally, and patients often present with multiple tumors in each kidney that comprise smooth muscle-like cells, abnormal blood vessels, and adipose-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Renal angiomyolipomata, often identified by adolescence, grow with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Angiomyolipoma size (&#x0003e;3 cm in the longest diameter) and serial growth are risk factors for complications such as developing aneurysms that can rupture, resulting in hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Growing angiomyolipomata also have the potential to slowly compress or infiltrate healthy renal tissue, compromising function and increasing the risk for renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a result, they are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with TSC, highlighting the need for early detection and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Everolimus, an oral mTORC1 inhibitor, was assessed as a treatment for renal angiomyolipoma in the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous sclerosis complex (EXIST-2; NCT00790400). Based on the superior response rate for everolimus versus placebo (42% vs 0%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; after a median duration of treatment of 38 weeks for everolimus and 34 weeks for placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], everolimus was approved for the treatment of TSC-associated angiomyolipoma in adult patients. More recently, longer-term interim analysis of the data demonstrated a further improvement in response rate to 54% after approximately 2.5 years during an extension phase of EXIST-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a prior study, EXIST-1 (NCT00789828), a phase 3, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with TSC-associated SEGAs, treatment with everolimus had achieved a superior SEGA response rate compared with placebo during the double-blind core phase (35% vs 0%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; after a median duration of treatment of 42 weeks for everolimus and 36 weeks for placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This led to the approval of everolimus for the treatment of SEGA in adult and pediatric patients, its first TSC indication. Everolimus is currently not approved to treat TSC-associated angiomyolipomata in pediatric patients owing to a lack of data in this subpopulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Many patients with TSC enrolled in EXIST-1 also had angiomyolipoma, making possible an evaluation of the effect of everolimus on angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients. The median age of patients who received at least one dose of everolimus in EXIST-1 was 9.5 years (range 1.1&#x02013;27.4 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The long-term extension phase of EXIST-1 was recently concluded, and the final analysis reported sustained efficacy in SEGA reduction for approximately 4 years of treatment, with 57.7% of patients achieving a SEGA response at any time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This confirmed a durable response to everolimus for the indicated treatment of pediatric and adult patients with TSC-related SEGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Renal angiomyolipoma response rate was a predefined exploratory end point of EXIST-1 in the subset of patients with &#x02265;1 target angiomyolipoma (longest lesion diameter &#x02265;1.0 cm) at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An angiomyolipoma response rate of 53% was observed in the everolimus arm compared with a response rate of 0% in the placebo arm during the double-blind core phase in patients primarily aged &#x0003c;18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In brief, patients of any age with a diagnosis of TSC and serial SEGA growth were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive everolimus or placebo in the primary core phase of the study. Everolimus was orally administered and initiated at a dose of 4.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area per day and subsequently titrated to blood trough levels of 5&#x02013;15 ng/ml subject to tolerability. The primary end point of the study was SEGA response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a &#x02265;50% reduction in the sum SEGA volumes relative to baseline, with no worsening of nontarget SEGA lesions, no new SEGA lesions (&#x02265;1 cm in the longest diameter), and no new or worsening hydrocephalus.</p><p id="Par10">After achieving positive results during the core phase (time from the start of the trial to the time when the last patient had received study treatment for 6 months), the study continued with a preplanned open-label extension phase in which all patients remaining in the study could receive everolimus.

In general, this population had primarily normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with some patients having hyperfiltration. Mean (SD) GFR remained stable over the course of the stud, as shown in the Electronic Supplementary Material. None of the patients had a renal bleeding episode while on everolimus. Most patients (<italic>n</italic> = 26; 78.8%) also had negative protein results on urinalysis at baseline. Intermittent proteinuria occurs in TSC-related renal disease, and the level of proteinuria was exacerbated in 9 patients (27.3%) who had a protein urinalysis value of 2+ or higher at least once during the study. These measurements, however, were primarily interspersed among mostly trace or negative results. Only one patient had consistent dipstick measurements of 2+ or higher after 800 days of treatment. Proteinuria was reported as an AE in only two patients. No renal aneurysms were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">The EXIST-1 trial demonstrated the effectiveness of everolimus in reducing SEGA volume with sustained responses over approximately 4 years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A preplanned secondary analysis was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in the subgroup of pediatric patients with renal angiomyolipoma. Results from this analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of everolimus in reducing renal angiomyolipoma volume in these patients, with approximately 76% of patients achieving an angiomyolipoma response. Most patients (&#x0003e;80%) achieved angiomyolipoma volume reductions of at least 30% over the duration of the study, and reductions of least 50% from week 24 onward, thus highlighting the sustained efficacy of everolimus for treating TSC-related renal angiomyolipoma in this pediatric subgroup. Furthermore, everolimus clearly modified the trajectory of renal angiomyolipoma growth in all pediatric patients who had originally received placebo during the double-blind phase of EXIST-1, with clear volume reductions following the initiation of open-label everolimus.</p><p id="Par26">Although everolimus is currently not indicated for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients, the results in the current pediatric subpopulation are consistent with those seen in adult patients. In the EXIST-2 trial, an interim analysis after approximately 2.5&#x000a0;years of treatment found that everolimus was associated with a renal angiomyolipoma response rate of 54% in patients with TSC- or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although a higher angiomyolipoma response rate was reported in the current analysis (76% vs 54%), it should be noted that patients in EXIST-2 had more severe disease (i.e., target angiomyolipoma &#x0003e;3 cm in the longest diameter in EXIST-2 vs &#x0003e;1 cm in EXIST-1), and the values reported in that article were after a shorter duration of time (median 28.9 vs 44.8 months). It is also possible that in EXIST-1 the measurements may not have been as precise because of the relatively smaller target lesion size, which may be more difficult to measure given the slice thickness of the imaging measure. Everolimus dosing should also be considered. Whereas EXIST-1 dosing focused on a targeted trough level (5&#x02013;15 ng/mL), EXIST-2 used a starting dose of 10 mg, which could be subsequently adjusted in the event of toxicity without monitoring of the trough level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Controlling the growth of angiomyolipomata is an important goal of treatment to avoid the development of future complications. The growth of angiomyolipomata may lead to the loss of normal renal tissue and result in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequent renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The vasculature of renal angiomyolipomata is often abnormal, resulting in the development of aneurysms and increasing the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Risk factors for angiomyolipoma-related hemorrhage include angiomyolipoma size (i.e., &#x0003e;3 cm), aneurysm size &#x0003e;0.5 cm, and serial tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Angiomyolipoma-related renal hemorrhage is less common in the pediatric setting, but cases have been previously reported, even in children with small tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Close monitoring of renal angiomyolipomata throughout life is warranted, along with early treatment to control the growth of these tumors and potentially reduce the risk for spontaneous renal hemorrhages. In this analysis, everolimus effectively reduced angiomyolipoma size, with reductions being sustained over a period of approximately 4 years. Therefore, treatment with everolimus to prevent the development of large lesions (i.e., &#x0003e;3 cm) in patients with serial growth or aneurysm size &#x0003e;0.5 cm may be a means of reducing the risk of bleeding and/or CKD among high-risk pediatric patients.</p><p id="Par28">The AE profile in this subgroup of pediatric patients was generally consistent with those previously reported for everolimus in the TSC setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although all patients had &#x02265;1 AE, with convulsion, mouth ulceration, stomatitis, and cough being the most frequently reported events, individual grade 3 or 4 events occurred in no more than 4 patients (12.1%) each, and discontinuation due to an everolimus-related AE was reported in only 2 patients (6%). As expected, AEs associated with everolimus therapy were frequently reported in this pediatric subgroup, which is consistent with the findings of higher incidence rates of mouth ulceration (32% vs 5%) and stomatitis (31% vs 21%) for everolimus versus placebo during the primary core phase of EXIST-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although convulsions were frequently reported in this subgroup (45.5%), no differences were observed between the everolimus and placebo arms during the primary core phase of EXIST-1 (23% vs 26%), and a similarly high incidence rate (30%) was reported in the overall population during the long-term extension phase of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the incidence of convulsions as a newly emergent event declined substantially over time, with 21.6% reported during the 1st year of treatment and 7% during the 5th year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Other AEs that occurred with similar frequency between the everolimus and placebo arms of EXIST-1 included vomiting (17% vs 13%), cough (13% vs 10%), and nasopharyngitis (18% vs 23%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Regarding infections, incidences of individual infections in the pediatric EXIST-1 angiomyolipoma population had some variation compared with adult patients in the long-term interim analysis of the EXIST-2 study. Nasopharyngitis occurred in few patients in the EXIST-1 subgroup compared with EXIST-2 patients (24.2% vs 42.9%); however, upper respiratory tract infection (21.2% vs 14.3%) and sinusitis (21.2% vs 12.5%) occurred in slightly more patients in the EXIST-1 pediatric patient subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It should also be noted that nearly all patients (99%) required additional therapy (drug or nondrug) to treat an AE at some point in the study. This should be taken into consideration, as the addition of more therapies may have an impact on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life.</p><p id="Par29">Although a deeper analysis into the effects of everolimus on growth and sexual maturation were beyond the scope of this secondary analysis, related AEs such as amenorrhea were observed in 2 out of 10 at-risk female patients. This rate is similar to that found in the entire EXIST-1 cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Even though the event in one patient of this subgroup was ongoing at study end, in general, most cases of amenorrhea tended to resolve either spontaneously without intervention or with dose modification (reduction or temporary dose interruption). A more detailed analysis of the effects of everolimus on sexual maturation and menstrual irregularities using pooled data from three major studies (EXIST-1, EXIST-2, phase 2 study in SEGA) is currently in development. With regard to patient growth, in previous reports of the entire population of pediatric patients from EXIST-1, no differences in SD scores were seen in height and weight before and during treatment with everolimus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">There appeared to be no appreciable change in renal function based on mean calculated GFR in this pediatric subgroup. The interim analysis of EXIST-2 also showed a similar finding in adult patients with angiomyolipoma treated with everolimus, with no significant decline in mean GFR over time. However, it should be noted that the mean GFR at baseline in EXIST-2 appeared to be lower than that of pediatric patients in the current analysis, but this observation is most likely attributed to the use of different methods to estimate GFR, and higher patient age and more advanced disease in EXIST-2. The majority of patients in the current analysis from EXIST-1 had mostly negative or trace protein results on urinalysis, with proteinuria being reported as an AE in only 2 patients, and persistently elevated urinary protein levels occurring in 1 patient. It should also be noted that some patients in the study were taking antiepileptic medications, including topiramate. Topiramate has been shown to induce metabolic acidosis accompanied by an alkaline urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Alkaline urine (pH &#x0003e;7.5) can lead to false-positive results for proteinuria on urine dipstick tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, to ensure safety, proteinuria should be monitored in everolimus-treated patients.</p><p id="Par31">This analysis of EXIST-1 is associated with a number of limitations that should be considered. First, the open-label design of the long-term extension phase and the lack of a comparator arm may introduce bias and limit the ability to draw overall conclusions on the long-term use of everolimus. Additionally, the analysis was not adequately powered to assess this subgroup, because of the small sample size of this subset of pediatric patients with angiomyolipoma. Furthermore, although urine dipstick assessment is an acceptable method of detecting elevated urinary protein levels, the presence of proteinuria should be confirmed by a quantitative measurement, such as the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Last, there is an inherent risk of measurement errors in smaller lesions. The abdominal MRI performed used 5-mm cuts, and at baseline lesions of 1 cm would only have two possible cuts for evaluation. As such lesions shrink, the accuracy of measurement decreases, even though the shrinkage is real.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">Although everolimus is currently not indicated for use in treating renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients, in this pediatric population with renal angiomyolipoma being treated for TSC-associated SEGA, renal angiomyolipoma volumes were reduced, and these reductions were maintained over the approximately 4-year study. Observed AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus in TSC, and no appreciable effect on renal function was observed. Therefore, these findings support the efficacy and safety of everolimus in treating pediatric patients with renal angiomyolipoma and SEGA requiring everolimus treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
