Approximately 50% of men will present with PHL by the age of 50, increasing to &#x0003e;70% of men by the age of 80.<xref rid="b1-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The incidence of PHL in women is somewhat lower, occurring in 3&#x02013;13% of women under 40 years, increasing to 32&#x02013;54% in women over 70 years.<xref rid="b2-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The psychosocial impact of PHL can be profound in many individuals, resulting in loss of self-confidence, pre-occupation and depression. The impact is less profound in men and many retain a high level of personality function,<xref rid="b3-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but in contrast, PHL in women has been identified as substantially more distressing and is associated with negative body image and a pattern of less adaptive functioning.<xref rid="b4-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The pathology of hair loss is complex, and there remain significant gaps in understanding, particularly for FPHL. In normal hair growth, the hair follicles cycle through distinct phases.<xref rid="b5-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Growth, known as anagen, where the hair shaft is actively generated and extends, can last as long as 6 years on the human scalp before entering a period of rest. In the rest period, the follicle regresses (catagen), which is followed by a period of quiescence (telogen) and release of the hair shaft (exogen). The signals that induce the transition between the different phases of the hair cycle are not fully understood; however, complex signaling cycles between the root sheath and the dermal papillae (DP), involving a number of protein families including the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), bone morphogenic proteins, sonic hedgehog and Wnt signaling, are thought to be crucial.</p><p>In normal hair cycling, ~90% of follicles are in anagen phase, 1% in catagen phase and 9% in telogen phase at any given time,<xref rid="b6-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> with the proportion of follicles in anagen phase declining with age.<xref rid="b7-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In PHL, there appears to be a dysfunction and imbalance in hair cycling, resulting in a reduced length of anagen phase, increased proportion of hair in catagen/telogen phase and a shift toward the production of fine, short hairs (~&#x0003c;2 cm), with a lack of pigment known as vellus.<xref rid="b6-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Ultimately, this leads to follicle miniaturization and hair follicle dormancy, which in the most extreme cases can progress to total hair loss.</p><p>The mechanisms that lead to the imbalance in the phases of the hair cycle and follicle miniaturization are not fully characterized, and there are significant gaps in the knowledge of mechanisms of PHL. In men, androgens are involved in many cases, and this has led to the umbrella term of androgenetic alopecia being generally applied to PHL. However, the underlying causes are poorly understood, particularly in women, and PHL may actually have a number of etiologies, a scenario that is perhaps reflected in the modest response rates to many current treatments (&#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section). Nevertheless, it is known that in many men dihydrotestosterone (DHT), synthesized from testosterone by 5&#x003b1; reductases, is a major player (reviewed in Kaufman<xref rid="b8-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The intracellular signaling cascade after androgen receptor binding by DHT is poorly understood, but receptor binding leads to increased production of cytokines, such as transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x003b2;1), which promote telogen and DP cell senescence. In women, there is less evidence regarding the involvement of androgens. The higher prevalence of FPHL in post-menopausal women has led to the association of hormonal changes in the etiology, but such changes may also be attributed to life-course reduction in hair density that only becomes visibly apparent later in life.<xref rid="b9-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Largely, the mechanisms underlying FPHL remain unknown.</p><p>There are only 2 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for hair loss, finasteride and minoxidil, alone or in combination. Finasteride, a 5&#x003b1; reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT,<xref rid="b10-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> has proven useful in the treatment of MPHL (reviewed in Mella et al<xref rid="b11-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, finasteride is associated with a number of side effects, including sexual dysfunction that in some cases persists after ceasing therapy.<xref rid="b12-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Despite a small number of studies showing efficacy, the use of finasteride in women is controversial, and only off-label, uncontrolled studies and anecdotal evidence have reported positive results.<xref rid="b13-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Finasteride treatment in pre-menopausal women is also problematic, requiring concomitant contraceptive treatment due to the teratogenic nature of the compound.<xref rid="b14-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Minoxidil was initially developed for the treatment of hypertension. Hypertrichosis was noted as a side effect of treatment,<xref rid="b15-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the product was repurposed as a hair loss therapy. Topical minoxidil is the only known treatment that is effective in both men and women; however, the mechanism of action is unknown.<xref rid="b16-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Minoxidil is generally well tolerated but is associated with a number of side effects, including an initial increase in hair shedding and exacerbation of hair loss after withdrawal from treatment.<xref rid="b17-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>FGF5 was identified as a determinant of hair length through seminal studies of <italic>FGF5</italic> knock-out mice that displayed the angora long-haired phenotype and were observed to have an abnormally extended anagen phase.<xref rid="b18-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Importantly, in a recent work by Higgins et al,<xref rid="b19-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> FGF5 was identified as a crucial regulator of hair length in humans, with mutations in <italic>FGF5</italic> underlying familial trichomegaly. Individuals with this mutation have longer hair and a greater proportion of hair follicles in anagen phase compared with ethnically matched controls.</p><p>Studies in rodents have found that FGF5 messenger RNA (mRNA) is upregulated during late anagen phase,<xref rid="b20-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> DP cells that express the receptor for FGF5 (FGFR1)<xref rid="b21-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> are responsive to FGF5 in vitro<xref rid="b22-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and FGF5 inhibits DP cell activation.<xref rid="b23-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Such findings demonstrate that FGF5 signaling to DP cells through FGFR1 is a critical regulatory process. Furthermore, FGF5 accumulates in the outer root sheath and in small macrophage-like cells surrounding the follicle, and the expression at these sites is increased at late anagen phase.<xref rid="b18-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Alternate mRNA splicing of FGF5 results in the translation of long (FGF5) and short (FGF5S) isoforms, which are known to act in concert. FGF5S acts as an antagonist to the catagen-inducing effect of FGF5,<xref rid="b25-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and in this vein there is potential for exogenous inhibitors of FGF5 to promote hair growth, as demonstrated by Ito et al.<xref rid="b26-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The evidence that FGF5 inhibits hair growth and is involved in the transition from anagen to catagen led us, in our previous work,<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> to screen botanical extracts for FGF5 inhibitory activity. We identified <italic>Sanguisorba officinalis</italic> root extract (SO extract) as an effective FGF5 inhibitor and demonstrated that SO extract enhanced the multiplication of outer root sheath cells in vitro. Further, in vivo analyses indicated that while SO extract did not enhance the onset of growth, it significantly reduced the number of telogen-phase follicles and increased hair length. We subsequently tested a topical solution containing SO extract in a cohort of human participants vs. a placebo group in a double-blind study over a 4-month period. We observed significantly reduced number of shed hairs (~70% less shed hairs) and decreased number of soft hairs (vellus), while hair growth rate and anagen:telogen (AT) ratio were increased. Subjective assessments of effectiveness indicated that the extract was rated as somewhat effective, effective or very effective for 74% of the treated group vs. 25% of the control. We have since marketed a product containing SO extract under the brand name &#x000e9;volis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>We describe here the results of a secondary screening program of FGF5 inhibitory activity in plant extracts and, importantly, single-molecule isolates of botanical origin. As with our previous work, we utilized an FGF5 responsive cell line, but with the addition of a secondary in vitro screening system using a DP cell culture method. The 2-stage in vitro testing has supplanted any reliance on animal testing. In our screening program of numerous botanical isolates, we identified a number of compounds from the monoterpenoid family as having FGF5 inhibitory activity. Monoterpenes are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and constitute the major volatile components of essential oils from plants, including citrus<xref rid="b28-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and eucalyptus species.<xref rid="b29-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Monoterpenes are C10 compounds that may be cyclic or acyclic with the generalized cyclic structure illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-10-071">Figure 1</xref>. Numerous monoterpenoid compounds of botanical origin are known to have pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities, growth modulation and anti-tumor actions.<xref rid="b29-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Our secondary objective was to test the lead extract identified in the FGF5 inhibitory screening in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. We assessed the ability of the new topical formulation of product to improve the hair growth profiles of men and women with early-stage PHL. Participants were monitored over 16 weeks (112 days), with periodic measurements of AT ratio, hair fall and expert visual grading. We also performed scientifically matched photography and image analysis for a small subset of participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>In vitro study</title><sec><title>Tested compounds</title><p>We screened a series of botanical extracts for FGF5 inhibitory activity, including the FGF5 inhibitory SO extract (Maruzen Pharmaceuticals, Onomichi, Japan) described in our previous work,<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

Dose&#x02013;response activity for a number of test conditions was measured for 6 compound concentrations and performed in triplicate. Compound concentrations (in mg/mL) were MTP3&#x02013;MTP6 (0, 0.0123, 0.0370, 0.111, 0.333, 1); EPT extract (0, 0.0123, 0.0370, 0.111, 0.333, 1) and SO extract (0, 0.0021, 0.0063, 0.019, 0.056, 0.169).

The number of viable cells was quantified using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), based on the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reaction. Absorbance (450 nm) measurements for triplicate experiments were averaged and adjusted for background absorbance, and the % cells for each test condition were calculated by comparison to wells with the compound concentration of 0 (negative control). Dose-dependence curves were plotted, and inhibitory concentration 50 (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for IL-3 (a measure of nonspecific inhibition) and FGF5 were calculated manually for each compound.

Dose&#x02013;response activity to various compounds was measured in triplicate against cells in culture medium either supplemented with GSK3 inhibitor IX (500 ng/mL) (Calbiochem) alone or against GSK3 inhibitor IX (500 ng/mL), plus FGF5 (10 ng/mL) (Oriental Yeast). Compound concentrations (in mg/mL) were MTP3&#x02013;MTP6 (0, 0.0185, 0.0556, 0.167, 0.5, 1.5); EPT extract (0, 0.062, 0.0185, 0.0556, 0.167, 0.5) and SO extract (0, 0.0001, 0.00031, 0.00094, 0.00282, 0.00845). Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and the cell number was counted via the MTT reaction as described earlier. ALP enzymatic activity was subsequently measured via the following protocol: 27.5 &#x000b5;L of 1% NP-40/water (Wako Chemical), 7.5 &#x000b5;L of 0.5 M Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.8) (Wako Chemical) plus 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and 15 &#x000b5;L of 1.0 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (Enzo Life Science, Farmingdale, NY, USA) were added to each assay well and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Wells were colorized for 5 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and absorbance measured at 490 nm in a microplate reader. Cell numbers and % cells for each condition were calculated as earlier. Background subtracted absorbance values were indicative of ALP levels, from which a corrected value of ALP/cell was calculated. To determine the relative recovery of ALP compared to control cells, we first calculated the change from baseline (relative amount of ALP/cell with respect to that seen at the compound concentration of 0), and a recovery factor was calculated by a comparison of the change from baseline for the treated samples, as calculated earlier, to that of the control experiment at each specific concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Clinical study</title><p>All clinical efficacy experiments and safety testing were performed by an independent, FDA-registered, GCP/GLP-compliant and ISO 9001-certified laboratory (AMA Laboratories Inc., New City, NY, USA) following standard operating procedures.

The product for each treatment arm was supplied in bottles that were coded and de-identified as to their contents.

We first assessed the ability of test compounds to inhibit FGF5-induced proliferation of the engineered FGF receptor 1-expressing BaF3 cell line.<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The BaF3 cell line used in the study is a cell line engineered to express FGFR1c, originally used to study the splice variant of FGF5 known as FGF5s.<xref rid="b26-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The BaF3 cell lineage is IL-3 dependent and responds to the presence of IL-3 by proliferating. The cell line is commonly used in signaling research as it is readily transformed.<xref rid="b37-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The transfection of the BaF3 cell line with FGFR1c also makes it responsive to FGF5, proliferating in its presence. The use of IL-3 in this assay is thus a control that only indicates test compound non-specific inhibition of cell culture growth. When this is compared to specific inhibition of cell growth via blocking interaction of FGF5 with its receptor expressed on the engineered BaF3 cells, we can identify true FGF5-inhibiting compounds. The inhibitory efficacy was determined by the ratio of the IC<sub>50</sub> of the test compound in the presence of FGF5 against the IC<sub>50</sub> of the test compound in the presence of IL-3. The former indicating FGF5-dependent inhibition, and the latter being representative of non-specific inhibition of cell growth. Large differences in the specific and non-specific inhibition of cell growth by the test compounds were indicative of high efficacy of FGF5 inhibition, in contrast to non-specific effects on cell viability, which tended to occur at high concentrations. An example of a curve from an individual experiment is shown for illustrative purposes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ccid-10-071">Figure 3B</xref>. Analysis of these data showed that MTP3 had significant inhibitory efficacy: 1.6-fold higher than crude EPT extract (<italic>p</italic> = 0.065) and close to 7-fold more efficacy than SO extract (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0024), while having 2.4-fold, 1.9-fold and 4.8-fold higher mean efficacy measures than MTP4 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.013), MTP5 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.036) and MTP6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0018), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ccid-10-071">Figure 3A</xref>). Data from samples that only had low activity are not shown.</p><p>We also tested the FGF5 inhibitory activity of MTP3 in vitro with our DP cell-based assay, using ALP activity as an indicator of the anagen period. We use this method as an anagen/catagen transition model with exogenous FGF5 interacting with FGFR1 on the DP cells, inducing catagen and correspondingly reducing ALP activity. FGF5-inhibiting compounds, when added to the cell culture alongside exogenous FGF5, should stimulate the recovery of anagen and hence increase ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner. An anagen recovery factor was calculated by comparing the maximum increase of ALP activity over baseline for FGF5-inhibited cells to the ALP activity over baseline for the test compound alone at that specific concentration. An example from 1 experiment is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ccid-10-071">Figure 4B</xref>. We observed that MTP3 had the strongest ability to recover anagen phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ccid-10-071">Figure 4A</xref>), with an average recovery factor double that of SO extract (0.69 compared with 0.32) and improved performance compared to the other monoterpene isolates.

The in vitro screening process removes the need for animal testing in pre-clinical programs, and additionally, the analysis of single molecules rather than crude isolates is a significant progression in the precision of our approach. We observed potent FGF5 inhibitory activity for a number of the botanically derived monoterpenoid molecules using both in vitro assays. Exposure of the engineered cell line that proliferates in the presence of FGF5 to a number of monoterpenoid compounds revealed significant inhibition of cell growth, with inhibitory efficacy scores for the isolate MTP3 up to 7 times greater than those for the previously published FGF5 inhibitor SO extract.<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Further evidence of FGF5 inhibition was provided by a second assay, where activated DP cells in culture recovered anagen activity (measured via ALP activity), compared to control cells and in a dose-responsive manner, when the monoterpenoids were added to cells alongside FGF5. The recovery response seen for MTP3 was at least double that seen for SO extract and approximately double or triple that of the other monoterpene isolates. Such recovery of anagen in the presence of FGF5, which should initiate the termination of the anagen phase, further highlighted the ability of MTP3 to block FGF5 activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Clinical study highlighted improved outcomes in individuals with PHL</title><p>As the assays earlier indicated that MTP3 was an excellent inhibitor of FGF5, we developed a number of formulations containing MTP3 (0.095% and 0.5%), for clinical testing as a topical treatment. We recruited 32 individuals for a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 3 treatment arms: placebo of tonic formulation base, tonic with 0.095% MTP3 and tonic with 0.5% MTP3. Participants were treated for 112 days and results compared to baseline at day 56 (8 weeks) and day 112 (16 weeks). We observed significant improvements for all tested parameters, particularly after 112 days. Participants receiving placebo did not show improvement in any parameter.</p><p>In adults who are not experiencing hair loss, 80&#x02013;90% of hair follicles should be in anagen,<xref rid="b6-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> while those experiencing hair loss tend to present with low anagen ratios. FGF5 is important in the transition of hair follicles out of anagen in humans,<xref rid="b19-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and therefore, blocking its activity should result in the lengthening of anagen for individual follicles,<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> resulting in an apparent increase over time in the ratio of hair follicles in the anagen phase to those in telogen phase. As mutations in FGF5 have similar effects in both men and women,<xref rid="b19-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and as the shortening of anagen phase is common to both male and female hair loss, we would expect antagonism of FGF5 to be effective in both men and women. For those individuals treating their scalps with both the MTP3 formulations, we observed significant increases in the proportion of hair roots in anagen, with many participants improving by up to 20 percentage points (improvement in AT ratio of 0.2), and some treated individuals recovering to ~80% anagen. There were no significant differences at any time point in the placebo-treated group. Such observations are indicative of FGF5 inhibitory effects resulting in less hair follicles prematurely entering telogen. Although it was not a primary objective of this study, statistical analysis after separation of the cohorts into male and female participants, despite low power due to small sample size and high variance in the female placebo group, identified highly significant differences from baseline in both females and males, highlighting the utility of FGF5 inhibition in the treatment of both male and female hair loss.</p><p>We did note some non-significant differences in the baseline anagen measurements between groups and a larger spread of values in the placebo, particularly in females, likely due to the small sample size, which consequently may have influenced the statistical analyses and led us to approach the interpretation of these data carefully. We also noted that several participants had very low anagen measurements at some sampling time points, likely due to sampling errors and the relatively small number of hairs that are excised from the scalp for this measurement. However, when the overall trends in the data compared to baseline are analyzed, the consistent mean and median increase in anagen for most participants in both treatment groups and for both genders over the course of the study, in contrast to placebo where the median change was 0, is more reflective of a response to treatment, than sampling-based inconsistencies, normal hair cycling or natural variation around a baseline. The placebo group showed no clear pattern over the course of the study.</p><p>Hair fall is also a useful indicator of hair cycling, with increased cycling of follicles out of anagen and into catagen/telogen resulting in a higher number of shed hairs. Application of topical formulations containing the FGF5 inhibitory compound MTP3 resulted in significant decreases in shed hair overall and in both males and females. We did note a trend in all cohorts for decreased hair fall at day 56. However, this was only statistically significant for the MTP3-treated groups. Such a trend in hair fall for all groups at day 56 could represent a normal variation in hair cycling or effects through variation in sampling technique. Importantly, statistically significant differences in hair fall were only observed in the MTP3-treated groups, and similarly, the trend for continued reduction in hair loss compared to baseline over the course of the study was only observed in the MTP3 treatment arms. Some imbalance in the baseline hair fall for all 3 cohorts was apparent, with the 0.5% MTP3 group showing higher hair fall at day 0. As with the AT data, the slight imbalances in allocation are likely due to the relatively small sample sizes used in this study. Such imbalance had no effect on the intra-group comparisons, but when comparing magnitude of change with respect to baseline, such imbalance may result in underestimation of biological responses, that is, if starting with a low hair fall baseline, such as in the 0.05% MTP3 group. Nevertheless, we observed a significant reduction compared to baseline for both treatment arms after 112 days of treatment with &#x0003e;90% of participants showing improvement, with significant differences from baseline evident in both males and females. In contrast, 70% of the placebo group had increased hair fall measured at day 112.</p><p>Additional evidence of improved hair retention and density was provided by visual grading. Despite being carried out by an identity-blinded independent trained expert evaluator, such assessment remains a subjective measure of hair thickness. However, the striking results seen in this evaluation provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of the topical formulation with MTP3 in blocking FGF5 and reducing hair loss in both males and females. All participants in the 0.095% MTP3 treatment group improved in hair grading over the course of the study, 7 of 11 participants in the 0.5% MTP3 arm increased their visual grading scores and 6 of 7 females overall improved their grading scores. The placebo group had only 2 of 9 participants improve in score. Such findings are supported by our sub-cohort study using scientifically matched serial photography. Quantification of the photography showed improvements in hair density of all measured individuals, and the majority of these continued to increase over the 112 days of the trial. The global photographic method used was somewhat influenced by hair combing, particularly in the male subjects, but this is a feature that could also be influenced by changes in hair density. As such, this method is a limitation of our study, and the data are provided only as supporting information. In larger clinical trials of our FGF5-inhibiting compounds, we plan on assessing hair growth using more sophisticated techniques such as phototrichography.</p><p>The earlier findings demonstrate that participants treated with MTP3, the newly identified FGF5-inhibiting monoterpenoid compound, performed significantly better for all measures of hair recovery. We observed improvements in the AT ratio indicating increased hair follicles in the anagen (growth) phase, decreased shedding of hair and improved volume and appearance in the MTP3-treated groups. It appeared that the 0.095% MTP3-treated group performed better than the 0.5% MTP3 group for all measures, and as such, this concentration of MTP3 should be taken forward into larger studies to further confirm efficacy and also to monitor improvements over longer time periods. Performing additional large studies will address the limitation of this small study in terms of sample size and statistical power and will help us further address the efficacy of our FGF5-inhibiting compounds in both genders.</p><p>As there are no standardized methods for assessing response of individuals with PHL to treatment, it remains difficult to objectively compare the results of our efficacy study to other hair loss treatments. However, cursory comparisons of our study to those of other botanical extracts do highlight the efficacy of the FGF5-inhibiting active MTP3. For example, treatment with rice bran extract resulted in only modest changes in hair density (10% increase), with significant improvements only observed in males.<xref rid="b38-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Likewise, methyl vanillate treatment resulted in a 6% increase in hair count and 12% increase in hair mass index.<xref rid="b39-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The same is true for comparisons of this study against our previous efficacy trial of SO extract, where participants were also from a different ethnic background (Japanese). Nevertheless, an improvement in shed hair after MTP3 treatment was evident compared to our previous trial of FGF5-inhibiting SO extract: 80% reduction in hair fall at day 112 for the MTP3-treated groups vs. 68% at 4 months.<xref rid="b27-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>There is a paucity of published information regarding the efficacy of minoxidil, with many studies reporting subjective measures rather than quantitative data.<xref rid="b40-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Although significant improvements over placebo are generally reported in men, many of the improvements are modest, with increases in hair growth of ~20% on average (reviewed in Gupta),<xref rid="b42-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and reported for only limited proportion of the study group, for example, in 52% of enrolled participants.<xref rid="b43-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Similar results were observed for women with mean hair count increases of ~23%.<xref rid="b44-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> It will be interesting to directly compare demonstrated FGF5 inhibitory products such as the monoterpenoid MTP3 against the FDA-approved treatments in our preparation for larger trials in men and women. One consistently reported feature of minoxidil treatment is an initial increase in hair shedding as follicles transition to anagen phase and existing telogen hair shafts enter exogen.<xref rid="b45-ccid-10-071" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Such initial shedding can impact on patients&#x02019; compliance and continued use of hair loss products containing minoxidil. As FGF5 inhibition acts to extend the anagen phase, and therefore gradually increases the number of anagen follicles on the head over time, we would not expect any shedding to occur, and this is supported in our data where reductions in hair fall and improvements in density were noted after 6 weeks.</p><p>Our FGF5 inhibitor screening process has identified novel potent inhibitors of FGF5 activity, with many members of the monoterpenoid family showing inhibitory activity. Our current novel 2-step in vitro screening approach has removed the need for animal testing and has allowed us to rapidly probe for inhibitory extracts enabling the identification of individual inhibitory molecules. We have translated this in vitro data into treatments with significant clinical effects. With such promising results, we aim to further characterize compounds acting as FGF5 inhibitors and their biochemical effects on hair growth, in order to improve outcomes in individuals affected by pattern hair loss.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified isolates from the monoterpenoid family as potent inhibitors of FGF5 activity using a well-defined novel 2-step in vitro protocol. Such FGF5 inhibition was reflected in a clinical setting by increases in AT ratios, reduced hair fall, improved hair density and improved appearance in both males and females affected by thinning hair.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Associate Professor Graham Robertson for his comments during the preparation of this manuscript.
