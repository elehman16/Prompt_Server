capacity, balance, and treadmill time in patients with thermal burn injury. [Subjects and
Methods] Burned adult patients, aged 20&#x02013;40 years (n=30), from both sexes, with second
degree thermal burn injuries covering 20&#x02013;40% of the total body surface area (TBSA), were
enrolled in this trial for 3 months. Patients were randomly divided into; group A (n=15),
which performed an aerobic exercise program 3 days/week for 60&#x02005;min and participated in a
traditional physical therapy program, and group B (n=15), which only participated in a
traditional exercise program 3 days/week. Maximal aerobic capacity, treadmill time, and
Berg balance scale were measured before and after the study. [Results] In both groups, the
results revealed significant improvements after treatment in all measurements; however,
the improvement in group A was superior to that in group B. [Conclusion] The results
provide evidence that aerobic exercises for adults with healed burn injuries improve
aerobic physical fitness and balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Aerobic physical fitness</kwd><kwd>Burn injury</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A burn injury is one of the most traumatic injuries that a child or adult can
experience<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Advances in acute burn care
have improved survival rates after burns, and this highlights the importance of physical
therapy rehabilitation programs after recovery from a burn injury in overcoming long-term
burn-related complications and extensive physical and functional limitations<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Pulmonary function (PF) can be compromised as a result of complications caused by smoke
inhalation, direct thermal damage to the respiratory tract, pulmonary edema, and respiratory
tract infection<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thermal injuries result
in a reduction of pulmonary function, which is typified by an initial obstructive pattern of
disease lasting up to 2&#x02005;years and then the restrictive pattern of pulmonary function, which
lasts into convalescence, and patients who survive thermal injury might not regain normal
cardiopulmonary functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The evidence pertaining to the effect of impaired pulmonary function on exercise capacity
in burn injury patients is equivocal. Mlcak et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that burn injury patients with inhalation injuries
displayed a ventilatory rather than a cardiac limitation to exercise. Furthermore, Bourbeau
et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> found that long-term pulmonary
function was impaired but not below normal limits, and that exercise tolerance was unchanged
in adults following inhalation injury. Conversely, Willis et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that adults with burn injuries, with and
without inhalation injury, had a signi&#x0fb01;cantly lower aerobic capacity and greater oxygen
desaturation during a maximal oxygen exercise test compared with healthy controls. This
de&#x0fb01;cit in burn injury patients persisted for up to &#x0fb01;ve years following injury, although it
was not correlated with PF. The decreased aerobic capacity demonstrated in the burn injury
population may be due to periods of prolonged bed rest, as well as to the associated
hypermetabolic state that occurs as a result of major burns. The hypermetabolism that
follows burn, impacts the cardiovascular system, is characterized by increased oxygen
consumption, cardiac output, minute ventilation, and core temperature<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The resultant increased energy expenditure can lead to
exhaustion, which can have deleterious consequences for aerobic capacity<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Periods of prolonged bed rest and
inactivity experienced during recovery from major burns may further decrease aerobic
capacity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is impaired in burn survivors. Balance is a function of multiple factors, including
tactile sensation, muscle strength, proprioception, joint mobility, and cognition. All of
these factors are potentially affected in severe burn injuries. The Berg Balance Scale
measures balance by assessing performance of functional tasks. The scale is used in a wide
range of populations, including the elderly, stroke patients, and Parkinson&#x02019;s patients and
has excellent correlation with gait speed<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Burn rehabilitation strategies aim to achieve optimal function and independence in
individuals with a burn injury, with the ultimate goal being community reintegration<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups that overload the heart and
lungs and causes them to work harder than at rest for a period of 15 to 20 minutes or
longer<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maximum aerobic capacity is
the gold standard measurement of cardiovascular fitness. It provides an objective and
reproducible assessment of a patient&#x02019;s functional capacity or exercise capacity<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aerobic exercises are considered an important component of rehabilitation programs, as they
improve the patient&#x02019;s functional status, and if the intensity of training is adequate, they
result in a physiological training effect<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the current study aimed to assess whether a 12-week exercise program consisting
of a traditional rehabilitation program and/or aerobic exercise would improve aerobic
capacity and balance in adults after a burn injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty adult burn injury patients (both sexes) participated in this trial. They were
recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University,
which is where the study was conducted. The inclusion criteria included age 20&#x02013;40 years,
thermal burns covering 20&#x02013;40% of the total body surface area (TBSA) as assessed by the rule
of nines method<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, second degree burns,
and at least 3 months after burn injury. The exclusion criteria included the presence of
diabetes, neuropathy, psychiatric disorders, cardiopulmonary diseases, quadriplegia, certain
behavior or cognitive disorders (e.g., aggressive behavior, impulsivity, and dementia), leg
amputation, any limitation in the ROM of joints of the lower limbs, and participation in any
rehabilitation program prior to the study that may prevent adequate participation in
exercise activities or affecting the results. Patients were randomized into two groups: a
study group (group A), which included 15 patients who participated in an aerobic exercise
program in addition to a traditional rehabilitation program, and control group (group B),
which included 15 patients who participated in a traditional rehabilitation program.</p><p>All variables were collected for all participants at baseline and after 3 months, which was
the length of the intervention period.</p><p>Aerobic capacity assessment was used to determine maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), and
participants underwent a Graded Exercise Test (GXT) performed on treadmill using the
modified Bruce protocol. This test has been well validated with respect to evaluation and
assessment of cardiovascular fitness and for testing maximal aerobic endurance on a
treadmill<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The protocol required
participants to walk at increasingly higher workloads, with the speed and the inclination of
the treadmill increased incrementally every three minutes until the participant could no
longer continue because of volitional exhaustion, despite strong verbal encouragement of the
investigators. During GXT, subjects breathed through a face mask (Hans Rudolph Inc, Kansas
City, MO, USA) connected to a calibrated expired gas analysis system (Zan-680 Ergospiro
Ergospirometry System), which is manufactured by ZAN Me Bgerate GmbH, Germany. Expired gas
passed through a flowmeter, an oxygen analyzer, and a carbon dioxide analyzer. The flow
meter and gas analyzers were connected to a computer, which calculated breath-by-breath
minute ventilation, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, and the respiratory exchange
ratio (RER) from conventional equations. Heart rate (HR) was monitored continuously during
the graded exercise test. Absolute maximum aerobic capacity (VO2max) was taken as the
average value over the last 30 seconds during the exercise test<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treadmill time measurement was done by calculating the maximum time that a patient could
walk on the treadmill.</p><p>Balance assessment was done by using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which is a valid and
reliable clinical tool for assessing balance in individuals. It is a 14-item battery of
tasks related to activities of daily living (ADLs). The tasks address the subject&#x02019;s ability
to maintain positions of increasing difficulty by progressively diminishing the base of
support. There are three dimensions to the test: maintenance of a position, postural
adjustment to voluntary movements, and reaction to external perturbations. Each task is
scored from zero to four, with zero the lowest and four the highest functional level. A
composite score of 0&#x02013;20 is categorized as a high fall risk, 21&#x02013;40 is categorized as as a
medium fall risk, and 41&#x02013;56 is categorized as a low fall risk<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects with missing or
incomplete Berg Balance Scale assessments were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>The treatment procedures were started three months after the patients were discharged from
the hospital and lasted for 12 weeks in both groups. Patients in both groups had received
standard rehabilitation therapy. Burn patients in group A had also participated in an
aerobic exercise program at a rate of 3 sessions/week, with each session lasting from 20&#x02013;40
minutes. A RAM model 770 CF electronic treadmill was used for aerobic exercise. Each
participant exercised at 70&#x02013;85% of his previously determined individual VO2max<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill running exercises began and
ended with warming-up and cooling down periods in the form of walking on the treadmill for
about 5&#x02013;10 minutes at a speed of 1&#x02013;1.5 kilometers/hour with zero inclination. In the cooling
down period, the speed was gradually decreased until reaching zero<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants
were regularly monitored throughout the exercise program, and their heart rates were
recorded during the exercise sessions.</p><p>The traditional physical therapy program for both groups was in the form of stretching and
strengthening exercises for all areas involved, in addition to diaphragmatic breathing
exercises, 3 days/week, while activities of daily living were performed daily.</p><p>Ethical considerations were taken into account by explaining the study protocol in detail
to each patient before the initial assessment, and signed informed consent was obtained from
each patient (or his family) before enrollment in the study. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University.</p><p>Data analysis were performed with SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data
were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The quantitative variables were
expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Comparison of variables before and after
the intervention was done using the paired t-test. Comparison between 2 different groups was
done using the unpaired t-test. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used for the Berg
Balance Scale including the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for variable comparison within groups
and the Mann-Whitney U test for comparison between groups. All p-values in the analysis were
considered statistically significant when p &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical analysis of demographic characteristics of patients in both

physical activity, rest, and fatigue. Several studies have reported that exercise can
prevent the manifestation of fatigue and reduce its intensity in burn patients during and
after treatment. This approach may appear counterintuitive; however, physical activity
produces adaptive changes such as gains in muscle mass and plasma volume, improved lung
ventilation and perfusion, increased cardiac reserve, and a higher concentration of
oxidative muscle enzymes. Furthermore, resistance exercises have been shown to reduce the
loss of muscle mass related to corticoid treatment<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of addition of aerobic exercise to a
traditional rehabilitation program for burn patients on their aerobic capacity and
balance.</p><p>The results of the current study pointed out that there was a reduction in the exercise
capacity of burn patients represented by a reduction in the VO2max compared with the normal
values before application of the treatment procedure. This finding is supported by the
results achieved by Suman and his colleagues<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported abnormal cardiopulmonary functions in a patient who
survived a thermal injury. In addition, our results showed that there was improvement in the
exercise capacity, treadmill time, and balance of the burn patients after 12 weeks of
exercise training. The study group, which performed training using aerobic exercise in
addition to the traditional program, showed more significant improvement in both VO2 max and
BBS compared with the control group. Improvement in the aerobic capacity variables may be
due to an increase in the blood flow to the active muscle mass because of an increase in
maximal cardiac output, and the changes within the muscle also contribute to this increase,
primarily the increases in capillarization, myoglobin, and oxidative enzyme activity<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, it was suggested that the significant increase in aerobic capacity might be
related to the effect of aerobic exercise in improving respiratory function and to an
increase in the stroke volume of the heart by the effect of regular exercise. These
respiratory adaptations facilitate oxygen supply to tissues and add further evidence to the
improvement of respiratory fitness<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Similarly, a study was previously done to compare the efficacy and effects of an exercise
program versus traditional outpatient therapy in children with burn injuries, and it
concluded that an exercise program may be safely included in rehabilitation programs for
children with severe burns and that it can be effective in increasing muscular strength and
functional outcome<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Suman et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a 12-week
exercise program, when implemented six months post injury, improved both aerobic exercise
capacity and PF in children with severe burns, which supports the current study results.</p><p>De-Lateur et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> have also been
established that a 12-week aerobic treadmill exercise program improved aerobic capacity in
adult burn survivors, when implemented between 9 and 122 days post injury, which is
consistent with our results.</p><p>Grisbrook et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> evaluated the effects
of exercise training on aerobic capacity and PF in adults with long-term burns (at least two
years post burn). The exercise training consisted of interval training (combination of high-
and low/moderate-intensity exercise) and resistance exercises for 12 weeks. Exercise
training did not result in PF improvements, but there were improvements in aerobic capacity
and clinically relevant achievement towards occupational performance goals, which is in
agreement with the results of the current study.</p><p>The effect of aerobic exercise on balance in burn patients and on the BBS have not been
widely studied in burn patients. In this study, patients demonstrated increases in both the
raw BBS Score (mean: 17 points) and fall risk categories. Studies have found that a change
of eight points in the BBS Score correlates with a meaningful clinical change<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, evaluation of balance with more
objective tools is recommended. The results of a study by Schneider et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, which suggested an overall functional
improvement in balance with inpatient rehabilitation therapy for burn injury, are similar to
ours.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study like the small sample size and lack of follow-up
over the following months after the intervention period, which reflect the need for future
research with a larger sample of patients and follow-up measurements. In spite of that,
statistically signi&#x0fb01;cant improvements were observed across all outcome measures in both
groups, suggesting that these outcomes would be re&#x0fb02;ected in a larger sample. Also, this
study lacked a standardized therapy. Standardization of rehabilitation program is difficult,
as no two burn injuries are identical and physical therapy programs are tailored to each
patient&#x02019;s individualized lesions. However, this study underscores the importance of addition
of aerobic exercises to burn rehabilitation programs as an approach to improve aerobic
capacity and balance in the burn population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express their appreciation to all patients who participated in
