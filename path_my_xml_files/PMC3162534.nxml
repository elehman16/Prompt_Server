quarter of the world's neonatal and maternal deaths occur in India. Morbidity and mortality are highest in rural areas and among the poorest wealth quintiles. Few interventions to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes with government-mandated community health workers have been rigorously evaluated at scale in this setting.</p><p>The study aims to assess the impact of a community mobilisation intervention with women's groups facilitated by ASHAs to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes among rural tribal communities of Jharkhand and Orissa.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial and will be implemented in five districts, three in Jharkhand and two in Orissa. The unit of randomisation is a rural cluster of approximately 5000 population. We identified villages within rural, tribal areas of five districts, approached them for participation in the study and enrolled them into 30 clusters, with approximately 10 ASHAs per cluster. Within each district, 6 clusters were randomly allocated to receive the community intervention or to the control group, resulting in 15 intervention and 15 control clusters. Randomisation was carried out in the presence of local stakeholders who selected the cluster numbers and allocated them to intervention or control using a pre-generated random number sequence. The intervention is a participatory learning and action cycle where ASHAs support community women's groups through a four-phase process in which they identify and prioritise local maternal and newborn health problems, implement strategies to address these and evaluate the result. The cycle is designed to fit with the ASHAs' mandate to mobilise communities for health and to complement their other tasks, including increasing institutional delivery rates and providing home visits to mothers and newborns. The trial's primary endpoint is neonatal mortality during 24 months of intervention. Additional endpoints include home care practices and health care-seeking in the antenatal, delivery and postnatal period. The impact of the intervention will be measured through a prospective surveillance system implemented by the project team, through which mothers will be interviewed around six weeks after delivery. Cost data and qualitative data are collected for cost-effectiveness and process evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Study registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN31567106">ISRCTN31567106</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background and rationale</title><sec><title>Millennium development goals 4 and 5</title><p>Little time is left to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 for maternal and child survival. Only 19 of 68 priority countries are on track to achieve MDG4, which calls for a two-thirds reduction in under-five mortality rates from 1990 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because neonatal deaths account for 41% of under-5 deaths, achieving MDG 4 requires scaling up strategies to reduce neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Effective interventions have long been identified, and key questions now concern the best ways to increase their coverage in an equitable manner, particularly in countries and communities with high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Maternal and child survival in India</title><p>Around a quarter of the world's neonatal and maternal deaths occur in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The current neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is estimated at 34.3 per 1000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the maternal mortality ratio at 254 per 100 000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The child mortality rate declined from 33.5 (24.1-45.4) deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 13.6 (9.0-19.7) in 2010, and the maternal mortality ratio from 523 (310-835) to 254 (154-395) between 1990 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To meet MDG4 however, an accelerated reduction in neonatal mortality is required as neonatal deaths account for 55% of under-five deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Neonatal mortality rates vary widely between states, ranging from 11 in Kerala to 48 in Uttar Pradesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. They also vary within states and between social groups: the NMR in rural areas is about one and a half times that of urban areas, and rates among the poorest wealth quintile are more than double those among the richest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Socio-economically disadvantaged communities such as indigenous or <italic>adivasi </italic>groups (defined in India's demographic surveys as Scheduled Tribes) have particularly high mortality rates: <italic>adivasi </italic>children have a 25% increased risk of dying before the age of five compared to non-adivasi children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Current maternal and child health government programmes in India</title><p>The Government of India implements three large intersecting programmes to improve women and children's health. The first is the Reproductive and Child Health II (2005-10) programme, which includes the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) at community and facility-levels, promotion of skilled care at birth, Essential Newborn Care training for professionals, and health service strengthening. The second is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, which provides a range of nutrition interventions for women and children. The third is India's flagship National Rural Health Mission programme (2005-2012), including the <italic>Janani Suraksha Yojana </italic>(JSY) maternity incentive scheme under which all pregnant women living below the poverty line receive money to deliver in a health facility and receive postnatal check-ups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The NRHM also finances an estimated 820,000 community health volunteers called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in priority states. ASHAs are mandated to disseminate health information, counsel women on issues of reproductive and child health and provide essential supplies and drugs (e.g Oral Rehydration Salts and antimalarials). The ASHA programme provides an important platform for scaling up effective community-based interventions for maternal and newborn survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Community-based interventions to improve newborn survival</title><p>Several community-based interventions have demonstrated substantial effects on neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the home-based newborn care model developed by SEARCH Gadchiroli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] a trained community health worker identified pregnant women, conducted group health education, carried out two antenatal and 8-12 postnatal home visits, attended deliveries, gave infants a vitamin K injection, identified and managed high risk infants who had signs of sepsis by providing injectable antibiotics in the home and encouraged appropriate referral. This intervention led to a 70% reduction in neonatal mortality over 10 years of incremental implementation, was replicated with seven NGOs (Ankur study) covering around 80 000 population. Elements from home-based newborn care and home visits have been incorporated into ASHAs' training. Following this and other studies, WHO and UNICEF endorsed home visits with components of home-based newborn care as a strategy to improve newborn survival in low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There is now a need for operational research to examine the feasibility of scaling up this strategy, with equity as a prime concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Other models emphasise the importance of community mobilisation and participation to improve maternal and newborn health, either with or without a concurrent programme of home-based newborn care. These interventions are premised on the notion that many maternal and newborn deaths can be avoided through better understanding of health problems, changes in antenatal and newborn care practices, and improvements in community perceptions of, and demand for, health services. Several community mobilisation interventions have used a participatory approach, building on the idea that if mothers and other community members take part in decision-making and bring local knowledge, experiences and problems to the fore, they are more likely to own and sustain solutions to improve their communities' health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The Shivgarh trial in Uttar Pradesh successfully tested a combined approach of home visits with social mobilisation through community change agents, leading to a 54% (RR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.35-0.60) reduction in neonatal mortality over 15 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The Makwanpur and Ekjut trials showed reductions of 30% (OR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.94) and 45% (OR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.46-0.66) in neonatal mortality through community mobilisation with women's groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but it remains unclear whether this impact could be maintained if implemented at scale using existing community health workers or volunteers as women's group facilitators.</p><p>In India, the NRHM has called for both an expansion of ASHAs' training in home-based newborn care and for "constituting community-based women empowerment groups [...] with the aim to ensure that the female functionaries - ASHAs, Anganwadi workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives--become accountable to and work with these groups to help them realise their well-being and rights." [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] Community mobilisation for health is part of the mandate of ASHAs, but specific strategies for community mobilisation led by these workers have yet to be tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Justification for this study</title><p>Although several intervention models have shown impacts on neonatal survival in India, we do not know whether any of these can bring improvements when delivered through government-linked community health workers such as ASHAs, nor what the barriers and facilitators to scale up might be. This trial aims to test whether a proven participatory community intervention with women's groups can improve maternal and newborn health when implemented with ASHAs, examine its interaction with home visits for maternal and newborn care, and identify the processes through which the intervention can be successfully delivered and scaled-up.</p><p>Although the women's group intervention has already been tested in three trials, we decided to adopt a cluster-randomised controlled design to evaluate its impact with ASHAs for two reasons. First, the community mobilisation intervention has not been tested when delivered by community health workers (CHWs); other programmes combining community mobilisation with essential newborn care and delivered by CHWs were not evaluated with baseline data or a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Second, several NRHM interventions (including home visits and JSY) are being implemented in the study areas and only an RCT would allow us to robustly quantify the contribution of community mobilisation to any mortality reduction in this context.</p><p>In addition, the study is needed to address key implementation research questions and identify strategies for scaling up. Taking community health worker programmes to scale raises questions about adequate levels of remuneration, training, supervision and motivation. Providing recommendations to address these is critical: in a 2007 study, only 3-12% of children born at home in 5 south Asian and sub-Saharan African countries received a visit from a trained health worker within 3 days of birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Implementation research is necessary in order to understand how best to implement the intervention with ASHAs and whether community mobilisation will supplement or impede their existing activities.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Cluster randomisation was preferred over individual randomization as the intervention is a community mobilisation programme delivered at a village-level and with the potential to influence health outcomes both within and between households. An implementation research component is carried out through the trial's process evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To assess the impact and scalability of a community mobilisation intervention with women's groups facilitated by ASHAs to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes among rural tribal communities of Jharkhand and Orissa</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>1.

Because we expect a short lag period for this intervention to take effect as groups take some time to discuss the causes of maternal and newborn health problems before implementing strategies, we will include data for the last 24 months of the study (1<sup>st </sup>January 2011 - 31<sup>st </sup>December 2012) in the final analysis for the primary endpoint, thereby allowing for a four month lag-period. Additional endpoints for the trial include home care practices and health-care seeking behaviour for mothers and newborns and ASHAs' activities related to home visits.

The main tribal groups in the trial area are the Ho, Munda, Oraon, Santhal, Binjhiya, Paharia, Bhumij, Bhatudi, Bhuyian, Gond, Mankidia and Kondh. In previously published research carried out in other rural tribal areas of these states, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] we found a neonatal mortality rate of 58 per 1000 livebirths and a maternal mortality ratio of 510 per 100 000 livebirths. Around 35% of mothers had three or more antenatal check-ups and only 17% delivered in a health facility. In December 2010, the recruitment of ASHAs had been completed in Jharkhand and Orissa but their training in home-based newborn care had not begun. JSY was operating in both states but had higher coverage in Orissa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The trial is being implemented by Ekjut, an NGO that has been working in Jharkhand and Orissa since 2003, in collaboration with the Centre for International Health and Development at University College London (UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Target group and eligibility criteria</title><p>The target population will be rural, mainly tribal communities with poor access to health services. The target group for the women's group intervention is women of childbearing age between the ages of 15 and 49 years, and particularly pregnant mothers. However the groups are open to all community members, including adolescent girls, older women and men. Community health workers may also participate in group discussions. Participants in the trial will be all women who have given birth in the study area between 1<sup>st </sup>September 2009 and 31<sup>st </sup>of August 2010 for the baseline period, and between 01<sup>st </sup>of September 2010 and 31<sup>st </sup>December 2012 for the trial period, and who have agreed to take part in the study when approached by an interviewer around six weeks after delivery. Excluded are women who decline to be interviewed or have migrated out of the study clusters, and, for secondary outcomes (care-seeking and home care practices), women who gave birth in the study area but who cannot be traced after 9 months. During an earlier trial, 1.3% of births detected by a similar surveillance system to the one used in this study (255 out of 19068) were to mothers who migrated in or out of the study clusters, and we were not able to obtain background socio-economic data on these migrants. The intention to treat population (for the primary outcome) will therefore be all mothers who reside in the study clusters and have given birth in the study area in the last 24 months of the intervention and did not migrate out of the study clusters. Participation in intervention activities will be voluntary and women are free to join or leave a group at any time.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>The randomisation was carried out as follows: in each district, we invited stakeholders from each cluster, including Village Health Committee members and staff from other NGOs to a meeting. We allocated a number to each cluster, wrote these numbers on small plastic balls and placed the balls within a dark bag. The intervention team reminded stakeholders about the aim and length of the intervention and about the purpose of the randomization process. We asked each of the participants to draw one ball from the bag and read the cluster number out until all balls had been picked. The numbers were then written on a sheet of paper in the order of selection. Finally we placed twenty pieces of paper numbered 1 to 20 - each corresponding to a unique allocation sequence generated by CP in Excel - in the dark bag and asked a participant to select a paper and read out the number. The corresponding sequence was then used to publicly allocate each cluster to one of two groups to ensure transparency among the stakeholders and also to avoid conflict as only intervention area ASHAs would be entitled to incentives.</p><sec><title>The interventions</title><sec><title>Women's groups</title><p>The intervention is a participatory learning and action cycle of 20 meetings, during which women's groups open to other community members identify and prioritise maternal and newborn health problems in their area, identify strategies to address these, implement these strategies and evaluate the entire process. This cycle was adapted from an earlier intervention tested during the Ekjut trial and in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Specific adaptations based on lessons from the Ekjut trial included a minimum recruitment of pregnant women into groups and an emphasis on care for newborns during winter, as a strong increase in neonatal deaths was observed in the study areas during this season. The team also prioritized materials to be used (e.g. picture cards) by selecting the most important maternal and newborn problems with ASHAs. The cycle consisted of fortnightly meetings for the first four months (Phase 1 and Phase 2), following by monthly meetings after this, as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. In the first phase, consisting of three meetings, the ASHA will introduce the project, then help the group identify and prioritise local maternal and newborn health problems. In the second phase, consisting of four meetings, groups discuss causes and solutions to prioritized problems through participatory games and using picture cards, then identify and prioritise strategies for addressing the problems. At the end of this phase the groups prepare to hold a community meeting in which they share their thoughts, problems and strategies with other community members, including men, traditional birth attendants, mothers-in-law and Community Health Workers. In phase three, the groups implement their strategies and carry out practical role-plays focusing on care-seeking and emergencies. Finally, in phase four the groups evaluate each of the phases and progress on their prioritized strategies. The intervention is expected to run for 24 months (20 meetings, two community meetings and two additional months to make up for any cancellations of meetings).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Intervention meeting plan</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="3">ASHA TRAINING 1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>Phase I: </bold>Problems</td><td align="center">Meeting 1</td><td align="center">Introduction to the project</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 2</td><td align="center">Identifying &#x00026; prioritizing maternal problems in the community</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 3</td><td align="center">Identifying &#x00026; prioritizing neonatal problems in the community</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>ASHA TRAINING 2</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Phase II:</bold><break/>Strategies</td><td align="center">Meeting 4</td><td align="center">Thermal care for newborns (story on preventing winter deaths)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 5</td><td align="center">Understanding causes and solutions for prioritized problems (story focusing on causes, effects and management)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 6</td><td align="center">Identifying and prioritising strategies for implementation</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 7</td><td align="center">Choosing a method &#x00026; preparing for sharing at the community meeting</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 8</td><td align="center">Preparing for a community meeting</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>COMMUNITY MEETING 1 AND ASHA TRAINING 3</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Phase III:</bold><break/>Implementation</td><td align="center">Meeting 9</td><td align="center">Assigning responsibilities for the implementation of strategies</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 10</td><td align="center">Birth preparedness - Hygienic practices - Essential Newborn Care - Management of twins and low birth weight babies (demonstration)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 11</td><td align="center">Understanding &#x00026; implementing home care strategies using picture cards</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 12</td><td align="center">Understanding &#x00026; implementing preventive strategies using picture cards</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 13</td><td align="center">Understanding &#x00026; implementing strategies for newborn emergency problems using picture cards</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>ASHA TRAINING 4</bold></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 14</td><td align="center">Accessing appropriate care (game)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 15</td><td align="center">Emergency preparedness for maternal and neonatal problems (role-play)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 16</td><td align="center">Preventing maternal deaths through campaigning against the first delay</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 17</td><td align="center">Learning about strategies implemented by other groups</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">Meeting 18</td><td align="center">Preparation for community meeting</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td align="center"><bold>COMMUNITY MEETING 2</bold></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>ASHA TRAINING 5</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Phase IV:</bold></td><td align="center">Meeting 19</td><td align="center">Phase-wise evaluation</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Evaluation</td><td align="center">Meeting 20</td><td align="center">Evaluation of women's group activities</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>ASHA selection, training and incentivisation</title><p>In each district we approached district-level ASHA coordinators and Village Health Committees (VHCs), explained the women's group intervention and asked VHCs to identify suitable ASHAs to facilitate the groups. These ASHAs had to be functional according to government criteria: they needed to have undergone at least three training sessions and be village-based. We identified problems that could arise whilst working with ASHAs during the course of the intervention and agreed on strategies to address these. In order to assist the ASHAs, we appointed a co-facilitator who was given an incentive of Rs 50 per meeting to help with record keeping. This co-facilitator was not given training to conduct meetings, and ASHAs were left in charge of facilitation. Should an ASHA not be accepted by her village, we agreed that the district-based intervention team would seek to help her, and, if unsuccessful, ask the co-facilitator to conduct meetings after training. In the event that an ASHA should drop out of the intervention permanently the VHC and women's group would decide whether a new ASHA should be trained, or whether a co-facilitator should take over and be paid the full incentive. The intervention team designed four training sessions for selected ASHAs, one for each phase of the intervention. One cluster coordinator employed by Ekjut is posted in each district. ASHAs are given an incentive of Rs100 per day as in government trainings (US$2) and Rs200 per meeting. A total of 149 ASHAs were selected to implement the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional interventions</title><p>Community involvement in monitoring health services is an essential component of the NRHM programme. Village health and sanitation committees (VHSCs or VHCs) are mandated to monitor local services as well as disseminate information about rights and entitlements to healthcare. We will undertake three main activities related to strengthening health services in <italic>both </italic>intervention and control areas. First, we will carry out at least one village health committee meeting about rights and entitlements in each village during the study period. Second, we will organise meetings with government officials and hospital management committees to inform the provision of appropriate care for mothers and newborns in facilities in the study districts. Finally, we will carry out at least one meeting with ASHAs using the appreciative inquiry method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] to strengthen their job motivation and help them further enhance their work performance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Impact evaluation</title><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size calculation was carried out in June 2010 using 11 months of available data on birth outcomes from the study areas prior to the creation of clusters. Baseline mortality data collected from the study areas between 1<sup>st </sup>February 2009 and 31<sup>st </sup>December 2009 indicated an NMR of 66 per 1000. We estimated <italic>k </italic>(the between cluster correlation coefficient) at 0.1 on the basis of data from the Ekjut trial as well as baseline data from the JOHAR trial areas. On the basis of surveillance from existing clusters, for an average cluster population of 5000, we expect an estimated 100 livebirths per cluster per year. We aim to assess the impact of the intervention using a total of 2 years of birth outcomes. We used formulae from Hayes and Bennett to estimate the power of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Assuming a more conservative baseline mortality rate estimate of 55 per 1000, with 100 livebirths per cluster per year in 30 clusters, the study will have between 76.6% and 79.6% power to detect a 30% reduction in the NMR (from 55 per 1000 to 38.5 per 1000) over 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Surveillance</title><p>A monitoring team independent from the intervention team was established to collect information on births and deaths to women of reproductive age and on events during the antenatal, delivery and postnatal periods through a surveillance system adapted from a previous study, covering a total population of around 158,053 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. One key informant (a community member) reports all births and deaths to women of reproductive age to an interviewer. The informant is visited on a monthly basis by an interviewer from the surveillance team. The interviewer checks the report, pays the informant an incentive of Rs30 for an identification and another Rs 50 for conducting an interview with the identified mother around six weeks after the delivery. The collected questionnaires are examined by District Monitoring Coordinators with guidance from District Managers. Completed questionnaires are then entered into a database designed in Microsoft Access. Baseline data on birth outcomes were collected for a full year from 1<sup>st </sup>September 2009 to 31<sup>st </sup>August 2010.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Trial vital events surveillance system</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-182-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Data monitoring, masking and analysis plan</title><p>Due to the nature of the intervention, the intervention team or participants cannot be blinded to the allocation however the analysts will be blinded to the allocation for the data safety and monitoring board and until the definitive analysis is performed.

This may happen if ASHAs travel from one cluster to another (for example for training or to meet relatives), or if participants migrate permanently or temporarily to a neighbouring cluster. This may result in information or strategies being shared, the effect of the intervention spreading to control clusters and dilution of differences between treatment arms. In order to reduce the risk of contamination, intervention and control clusters are separated either by natural boundaries (e.g. hills or rivers) or by 'buffer villages'. In the five rural districts where the study will take place, villages are quite distant from each other. We will also ask about exposure to women's groups in control areas so will be able to quantify any contamination.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>All intervention related costs, including start-up and running costs will be audited through the project accounting system.
