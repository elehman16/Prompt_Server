Developing weight management programmes which are appealing and acceptable to men is a public health priority. Football Fans in Training (FFIT), a men-only weight management programme delivered to groups of men at top professional football clubs, encourages men to lose weight by working with, not against, cultural ideals of masculinity. To inform further development of interventions in football club settings, the current study explored <italic>who</italic> is attracted to FFIT and <italic>why</italic> overweight/obese men choose to take part.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed-methods study analysing baseline data on 747 men aged 35&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years with BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> who were participants in a randomised controlled trial of FFIT, and data from 13 focus group discussions with 63 men who had attended the programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Objectively-measured mean body mass index was 35.3&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (sd 4.9). Overall over 90% of participants were at very high or extremely high risk of future ill-health. Around three-quarters of participants in all age groups were at &#x02018;very high&#x02019; risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (72%, 73% and 80% of men aged 35&#x02013;44, 45&#x02013;54 and 55&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years respectively). A further 21%, 16% and 13% were at &#x02018;extremely high&#x02019; risk. Qualitative data revealed that the powerful &#x02018;draw&#x02019; of the football club attracted men otherwise reluctant to attend existing weight management programmes. The location and style of delivery of early FFIT sessions fostered team spirit; men appreciated being with others &#x02018;like them&#x02019; and the opportunity to undertake weight management in circumstances that enhanced physical and symbolic proximity to something they valued highly, the football club.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The delivery of a weight management intervention via professional football clubs attracted men at high risk of ill-health. The setting enabled men to join a weight management programme in circumstances that felt &#x02018;right&#x02019; rather than threatening to themselves as men. FFIT is an example of how to facilitate health promotion activities in a way that is consistent with, rather than challenging to, common ideals of masculinity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Weight management</kwd><kwd>Gender</kwd><kwd>Men</kwd><kwd>Masculinity</kwd><kwd>Evaluation</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Obesity has &#x02018;escalated&#x02019; in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the prevalence in UK men is amongst the highest in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More men are overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 67%) than women (57%). In mid to late working life (35&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years), more than three quarters of men are overweight or obese, and a third are obese, with the prevalence of obesity increasing with age (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at: 35&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years&#x02009;=&#x02009;29%; 45&#x02013;54&#x000a0;years =32%; 55&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years&#x02009;=&#x02009;35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On current trends, nearly 50% of UK men will be obese by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; these trends pose a threat to individual health (through increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer), a burden on health services and a challenge to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A 5-10% weight loss can produce health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but there are real challenges in encouraging weight loss in men. Not only is obesity rising faster in men than women, but men seldom use existing commercial and National Health Service (NHS) weight loss programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, many men seek a body weight that is not consistent with biomedical definitions of &#x02018;normal weight&#x02019;, &#x02018;overweight&#x02019; and &#x02018;obesity&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and are more willing to challenge these definitions than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Men often view dieting as &#x02018;feminine&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], are more likely to use exercise to control their weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], are more resistant to healthy-eating campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and are less aware of links between diet and ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, as argued elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], prevailing cultural constructions of masculinities are closely related to men&#x02019;s decisions about health-related behaviours, including help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], as well as eating, physical activity (PA) and weight loss. These constructions are often said to be inherently health-damaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], mitigating against men taking care of their health, or putting them in an ambiguous position between wanting to care for their health as responsible citizens, without appearing to care &#x02018;too much&#x02019; as men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, with the increasingly male hue of the obesity epidemic, developing weight management strategies which are appealing and acceptable to men is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and most likely to be successful when working with, not against, cultural ideals of masculinity. In other words, health-promoting interventions need to engage men without being an anathema to valued aspects of their identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Other weight management programmes for men take a similar view and have shown promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], although evidence on what works in weight loss for men is relatively sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] given their underrepresentation in weight loss trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>In order to inform further development of weight management and other public health interventions in football club settings this paper reports firstly, on the characteristics of 747 men participating in a randomised controlled trial (RCT, ISRCTN32677491) of a weight management programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] designed specifically to attract men at high risk of ill-health due to obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and, secondly, their accounts (as expressed in 13 focus groups with 63 men) of why they decided to participate in the programme. Football Fans in Training (FFIT) is a men-only, evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], 12-session, weight management and physical activity group programme with subsequent minimal-contact weight loss maintenance support delivered free of charge at Scotland&#x02019;s top professional football clubs by community coaches trained in diet, nutrition, physical activity and behaviour change techniques to a standard programme delivery protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This training included discussion of SMART goal setting and implementing the pedometer-based walking programme. Training was interactive and designed to promote the principles of adult learning and the use of banter in the group sessions to make men feel more comfortable about raising sensitive issues. Coaches shared ideas about suitable in-stadia physical activities which could be adapted to different levels of fitness.</p><p>FFIT exploits the traditionally male environment of football clubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], existing loyalty to football teams and the opportunity to participate in men-only groups to maximise men&#x02019;s engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; its development is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In brief, FFIT is gender-sensitised in context, content and style through its delivery at professional football stadia by club community coaches who encourage participative learning, a practical focus through shared experiences of progression towards behaviour change and a light-hearted atmosphere (&#x02018;banter&#x02019;) which supports men in discussing potentially difficult issues. In addition to advice on diet, alcohol and sustainable behaviour change strategies, FFIT focuses on physical activity through an incremental pedometer-based walking programme to encourage greater activity in daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and pitch-side sessions led by club coaches. FFIT&#x02019;s location within professional football clubs reflects growing recognition of the potential of sporting organisations to deliver health initiatives to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Club community coaches receive two days training to ensure that key elements of FFIT are delivered. The mapping of these key elements onto behaviour change techniques which are effective in weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] (e.g. self-monitoring of weight and physical activity, intention formation, goal setting and review) is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The results of a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and semi-structured telephone interviews with participants in the pilot deliveries of FFIT in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggested that the programme had potential to help men to lose weight and is popular with participants. The results of a full-scale RCT, the first such study to be conducted in a professional sports setting, powered to assess whether participation in FFIT helps overweight/obese men to lose at least 5% of their body weight 12 months after baseline (pre-programme) measurement provides evidence of the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of FFIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The data were gathered as part of the FFIT RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Within a 3.5&#x000a0;month period<sup>a</sup> prior to start of the first delivery (August/September 2011) of the optimised FFIT programme in 13 clubs (12 in the Scottish Premier League and one recently relegated to a lower division), sufficient men were recruited to fill all available places (at that time funding from the Football Pools and Scottish Government was available for deliveries at the 13 clubs in August-December 2011, February-April 2012 and August-December 2012). Following measurement at baseline in August-September 2011 and assessment of eligibility (age 35&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years, BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 374 men were randomly allocated to undertake FFIT immediately (intervention group) and 374 to undertake FFIT 12&#x000a0;months later (waitlist comparison group). Men who were unable to attend baseline measures were placed on a waiting list and offered a place on the February 2012 delivery of FFIT (&#x02018;non-trial&#x02019; group) if any places remained after prior allocation to men who had attended the measurement sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We report the characteristics of the 747 men who took part in the RCT, excluding one man randomised to the comparison group who subsequently withdrew.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the University of Glasgow College of Social Sciences Ethics Committee (CSS/2011/029), which complies with the UK Economic and Social Research Council&#x02019;s Framework for Research Ethics. Participants gave separate written informed consent for participation in the RCT and the focus group discussions. Men were offered travel expenses and a &#x000a3;20 football club shop voucher as a gesture of thanks for their contribution to the focus group discussions.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>All objective baseline physical measures were taken in the clubs by fieldworkers trained to standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Weight (kg) was recorded using an electronic scale (Tanita HD 352), with participants wearing light clothing, no shoes and having emptied their pockets. Height (m) was measured (without shoes) using a portable stadiometer (Seca Leicester). Waist circumference (cm) was obtained using a 200&#x000a0;cm tape measure. At least two measurements were taken, followed by a third if these differed by &#x02265;5&#x000a0;mm; the mean of all measures was calculated. Resting blood pressure (BP) was measured using a digital BP monitor (Omron HEM-705CP). Equipment was calibrated prior to fieldwork.</p><p>Descriptive statistics for weight, BMI, blood pressure and waist were calculated.

Of 295 men contacted, 133 (45%) indicated willingness to take part. At each club, up to 6 of these men, chosen randomly, were invited to a 60-minute discussion at the club stadium; 63 men participated in 13 focus groups. These were audio- and video-recorded with consent, transcribed verbatim, and transcripts checked for accuracy against recordings. To thank them for their time, men were offered a &#x000a3;20 club shop voucher and travel expenses. During the discussions men were asked about several aspects of FFIT, including why they signed up in the first place and early experiences of attending FFIT, as reported here.</p><p>The focus group data were analysed using a structured, thematic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Transcripts were read by several authors to identify broad themes, guided in part by our research questions in the process evaluation. Transcripts were then coded to broad themes including the &#x02018;draw&#x02019; of the football club/club setting, reasons for participating, and satisfaction with and acceptability of FFIT; coding was quality-checked by another researcher.</p><p>Secondly, the content of the themes relevant to this paper was examined in detail by a third researcher. Each coded extract was read line by line to identify all sub-themes. These sub-themes were summarised schematically and each occurrence of every sub-theme was noted and compared with data from subsequent groups, using the OSOP method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], which allows systematic comparison of data from different participants/groups, noting anticipated and unanticipated themes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Attention was paid to &#x02018;deviant cases&#x02019; to ensure all perspectives were captured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We paid particular attention to a code entitled &#x02018;negatives of club setting&#x02019;; this contained relatively little material (from just 2/13 clubs) and can be summarised as disappointment that the more &#x02018;professional&#x02019; side of the club did not show the same interest in FFIT participants that the community coaches had done.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first describe the characteristics of men who enrolled for FFIT and their risk of future disease (on the basis of their weight and body compositional measures) in comparison with Scottish men of the same age.

Professional sports clubs, and specifically professional football clubs in the UK, are increasingly seen as settings that can attract men to health promoting activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; Pringle and colleagues suggest that &#x0201c;the product (i.e. football/EPL [English Premier League])&#x02026; the place (club stadia and facilities), people (players and management) and processes (including communication, marketing and the product delivery infrastructure)&#x0201d; all contribute to their appeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. If this &#x02018;draw&#x02019; is to be used to maximum public health benefit, it is important that programmes delivered in these popular locations are based on best-evidence about what works, <italic>and</italic> reach those men most likely to benefit. Behavioural &#x02018;choices&#x02019; are embedded in socio-cultural contexts, including those relating to gender, yet gender is often ignored in intervention development, perhaps explaining underuse by men (only 10-30% of participants in weight loss programmes are men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). This paper shows that FFIT, a gender sensitised, weight management programme delivered to standardised protocols across all participating clubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], has succeeded in attracting men whose weight and body composition puts them at very high risk of ill-health, and thus adds further evidence of the potential of the professional football club setting for attracting men to health-related initiatives, including weight management.</p><p>In explaining why FFIT succeeded in attracting them, men provided multiple and overlapping explanations for enrolling. These included &#x02018;push&#x02019; factors in their personal and family lives and experiences, such as growing health concerns, wanting to lose weight to &#x02018;be there&#x02019; for family, or to regain sufficient fitness to restart valued activities; and &#x02018;pull&#x02019; factors, in this case specifically the &#x02018;draw&#x02019; of the delivery of FFIT at football stadia. The COM-B framework for understanding behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] suggests that people require <italic>capability</italic> (physical and psychological capacity to engage in behaviour, including skills), <italic>opportunity</italic> (external factors, including the physical environment and &#x02018;social opportunity afforded by the cultural milieu&#x02019;), and <italic>motivation</italic> (habitual processes, emotional responses, goals and conscious decision-making) to undertake behavioural change. We would argue that the professional football club setting appears to have provided these men with a physical and social opportunity which matches well with their own identities and values as men. The fact that FFIT attracted like-minded men with similar physiques and levels of fitness (&#x02018;people like them&#x02019;) contributed to the appeal of the group format. In relation to the COM-B model, men&#x02019;s accounts suggested they <italic>wanted</italic> to, and were <italic>motivated</italic> to, lose weight for whatever reason and that the FFIT programme was an ideal <italic>opportunity</italic>. Our attempts to &#x02018;gender sensitise&#x02019; FFIT in context (professional football stadia), content (e.g. specific sessions on alcohol and weight, &#x02018;branding&#x02019; with club insignia on programmes and club-based t-shirts) and style of delivery (participative, peer-supported, learning which encouraged male &#x02018;banter&#x02019;) appears to have worked in terms of engagement; the results of the RCT demonstrate the effectiveness of FFIT in achieving clinically significant weight loss at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Assertions that men undertake &#x02018;risky&#x02019; behaviours (such as smoking and drinking excessively) and avoid health-protective behaviours (such as help-seeking) to be &#x02018;real&#x02019; men are commonplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and constantly reinforced in popular media and day-to-day interactions. Vandello and Bosson argue that &#x0201c;people view the very state of manhood as a precarious social status that is hard won and easily lost, [requiring] continual public demonstrations of proof&#x0201d; (p101) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This resonates with other conceptualisations about how people demonstrate in their day-to-day social interactions that they are behaving in ways that are appropriate for their gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. De Visser and colleagues, for example, argue that taking part in activities which are deemed to be &#x02018;feminine&#x02019; is one way in which men can &#x02018;lose&#x02019; man points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] or &#x02018;masculine capital&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] (in which &#x02018;masculinity&#x02019; is seen as a resource accumulated through social interaction that can be enhanced, undermined or destroyed by certain actions and behaviours). Because dieting and taking part in commercial weight loss programmes are so often constructed as &#x02018;feminine&#x02019; activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], it is perhaps no surprise that men are more willing to engage in programmes that give them the easy opportunities to revalidate their credentials as men. This paper reinforces earlier evidence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] that FFIT is valued by men who want to lose weight, not just because it is enjoyable and engaging, but because it enables men to &#x02018;bolster&#x02019; their masculine capital through their association with football clubs, symbolically and physically, and their participation and association with other men like them.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study has a number of strengths. Weight, height, blood pressure and waist circumference were objectively measured by fieldstaff trained to standard protocols who were independent of the clubs delivering FFIT, as were the researchers who facilitated the focus groups. This illustrates that whilst others have acknowledged the challenges of evaluative research in these contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], it is possible to obtain objective measures and use evaluative designs (the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; RCT) that normally reside more comfortably in clinical settings. The study also has limitations. Focus group participants were men who had completed the majority of FFIT sessions, and were willing to volunteer to make an additional trip to the club. It is thus possible their views are more positive than other participants. On the other hand, the location of the discussions may have been seen as a positive opportunity to meet fellow participants in a venue they enjoyed coming to. Certainly, the views expressed are consistent with those gathered via shorter telephone interviews with men who undertook the pilot deliveries of FFIT in August-September 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], with comments reported back by fieldworkers at the follow-up measurement sessions, and with feedback from the coaches.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This mixed-methods study has shown that the delivery of a weight management intervention via professional football clubs attracted men who were at very high risk of ill-health, the majority of whom did not attend other weight management programmes. The familiar and valued football club setting, the opportunity to interact with others &#x02018;like them&#x02019;, and the gender-sensitised content combined to reassure men they were in the right place and to support their engagement with the programme. Football Fans in Training provides an excellent example of how to facilitate weight management in a way that is consistent with, rather than challenging to, common ideals of masculinity.</p></sec><sec><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>Formal recruitment began on 2 June 2011 when funding for the RCT was confirmed.
