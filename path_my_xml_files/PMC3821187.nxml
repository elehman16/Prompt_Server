Inadequate exposure to basic clinical skills, poorly structured curriculum, mushroom growth of sub-standard colleges, lack of innovation in the faculty development programs, and, ambiguities in the policies on integration - are a few points among others- that have been raised from time to time to suggest that the quality of Ayurveda training is poor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In 2008, a nationwide survey that included interns, postgraduate students and teachers from more than 30 Ayurveda institutions spread across 18 states of India, showed that the &#x02018;teaching methodology&#x02019; was one of the crucial areas that needed instant attention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The study also observed that teaching and learning in Ayurveda education institutions was more &#x02018;memory-oriented&#x02019; than &#x02018;understanding- and application-oriented&#x02019; in general, along with being teacher-centric. The study also recommended that newer methods of active learning such as &#x02018;problem-based learning&#x02019; be incorporated in Ayurveda education.</p><p>Though, at present, several topics from contemporary medical science (&#x02018;modern medicine&#x02019;) are included in the syllabi of graduate program of Ayurveda, no specific thrust has been placed on &#x02018;integrating&#x02019; the two sciences. The curriculum prescribed by Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) lists out the topics from the two different streams of science under different papers and sections discretely. As Wujastyk puts it, &#x0201c;the two sciences have different epistemological basis and the curriculum continues to inculcate this epistemological split.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] This split is especially obvious with the subjects such as anatomy and physiology. This in fact, poses a threat: Students go for &#x02018;rote learning&#x02019;, and thus miss the links between the two sciences and the links between &#x02018;theory&#x02019; and &#x02018;application&#x02019; leading to a state of cognitive dissonance. In 1958, Udupa committee on &#x0201c;Ayurveda Research Evaluation&#x0201d; strongly recommended that &#x02018;the delivery of relevant contents from contemporary medical physiology and anatomy to explain away the gaps left in Ayurveda&#x02019; was necessary.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] After this, several committees and individual educationists have been arguing in favor of developing an integrative curriculum for Ayurveda education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Considering these facts, we planned the present study, where, we developed a few integrative teaching methods and evaluated their efficiency in graduate level of Ayurveda education. We restricted our inquiry to the field of <italic>Kriya Sharira</italic> (Ayurveda physiology) as this is a vital subject that introduces the recent understandings in human physiology along with the classical Ayurveda descriptions. It is also a subject that forms the foundation of clinical pathology, highlighting the applicability of various theories and principles in clinical setup.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To develop a few integrative methods of teaching with a view of enhancing the quality of learning experience in <italic>Kriya Sharira</italic> at graduate level of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> education</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the learning outcomes of these integrative methods with the conventional teaching method that lays almost no emphasis on integration.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Definition of the phrase &#x02018;integrative methods of instruction&#x02019;</title><p>The meaning of &#x02018;integrative approaches&#x02019; in the context of Ayurveda education is considerably different from the generally understood &#x02018;integration&#x02019; in other fields of education. This is primarily because the so called &#x02018;epistemological split&#x02019; does not come into picture in other fields, whereas, it is the most important factor that makes many scholars believe that a true &#x02018;integration&#x02019; is not possible between Ayurveda and contemporary biomedicine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we had to define the phrase &#x02018;integrative methods of instruction&#x02019; and we defined it as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The instructional methods that help in bridging the gaps between the two streams of sciences, that is, &#x02018;Ayurveda physiology&#x02019; and &#x02018;contemporary biomedical physiology&#x02019;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The instructional methods that help in integrating the theoretical knowledge with the clinically relevant application</p></list-item><list-item><p>The instructional methods that help in understanding the links between different organ systems and <italic>Dosha-Dhatu-Mala</italic> highlighting their role in maintaining the homeostasis.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In this study, we report the results of three experiments, where, we employed different instructional methods to emphasize the integrative way of understanding the subject. In the first experiment [integrative module on cardiovascular physiology (IMCP)], the experimental group of students was subjected to a well-planned teaching module that incorporated the descriptions from Ayurveda texts along with the relevant information from the field of contemporary medical physiology in an integrative fashion. Development of such &#x02018;integrative modules&#x02019; or &#x02018;cross-curricular units&#x02019; is a known way of achieving integration, which eventually paves way to the development of a full-fledged integrated curriculum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In the second experiment [case-stimulated learning (CSL)], the experimental group of students was exposed to CSL, which is a derivative form of the classical problem-based learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In the third experiment, we incorporated &#x02018;classroom small group discussion&#x02019; (CSGD), in which, the students were split into small groups and instructions were carried out in the form of guided group discussions where the process of active learning was emphasized.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Integrative explanation was the key feature in all the three experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The approval from the institutional ethics committee was obtained before starting with the experiments. Later, the relevant Ayurveda, <italic>Vedic</italic>, and contemporary literature related to the topic of present study was scanned thoroughly. Authentic portions from Ayurveda compendia along with the views of various commentators were screened. For the purpose of collecting the contemporary literature, the relevant textbooks, journal articles, and various authentic websites were consulted.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In continuum, an effort was also made to interpret the classical explanation in terms of contemporary medical physiology. The material was then rearranged so as to plan the experiments meticulously.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Population</title><p>Population for the present study was defined in terms of the students who were registered in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) program conducted in our institution for the academic years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sampling and randomization</title><p>Students of both the academic years were randomized and grouped separately into two equal groups: &#x02018;Experimental&#x02019; and &#x02018;control&#x02019;. We used the = RAND() function available with Microsoft Excel 2007 workbook for this purpose. During the session 2011-2012, two students were dropped out of the first experiment because they opted out of the BAMS program. In second and third experiments, two more students were dropped out because of the same reason.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Experiments</title><p>The first author of this report was the instructor for all the three experiments.

In this method, the experiment was done to compare the effectiveness of &#x02018;discrete&#x02019; and &#x02018;integrative&#x02019; teaching methods. We borrowed the term &#x02018;discrete&#x02019; from the phrase &#x02018;discrete subject teaching&#x02019;, a well-known method used in the context of primary education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] We decided to use this term to highlight the position of &#x02018;detachment&#x02019; while viewing the two streams of science. In this method, Ayurveda and contemporary biomedicine portion of the topic was delivered without discussing any correlation or integration. This is how usually teaching takes place in most of the Ayurveda education institutions. The control group received instructions in this conventional way, but the experimental group was introduced to a new way of instruction, that is, integrative method. In this method, the concepts of Ayurveda and contemporary medical science were correlated using the ideas derived from different sources of scholarly literature authored by various contemporary scholars.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Box-1</xref> shows the summary of the content that was covered in two different methods of teaching.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Box-1</label><caption><p>Summary of the method in which the subject content was arranged and delivered under &#x02018;Integrative Module&#x02019;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-4-138-g001"/></fig><p>Two sets of power-point presentations were prepared for the control group and the experimental group separately.

This was done by incorporating CSL sessions into the conventional lecture. &#x0201c;Physiology of coronary circulation&#x0201d; was selected as the topic for the experiment. The students were first introduced to an imaginary clinical case scenario. A brief history of the patient, symptoms, and investigation reports were provided, and thereafter, the physiology was described in a conventional manner. At the end of the lecture, the case was taken up once again and the students were asked to solve the mystery of the case. Based on the student responses, the explanations on physiological aspects were provided. Thus, the students went through the normal physiology, also being simultaneously exposed to the application aspect. Two power point presentations were prepared: One for the control group and the other for the experimental group. The control group of students received the information in a conventional way in which the &#x02018;clinical problem&#x02019; was not discussed, though the integrative explanations were offered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Box-3</xref> shows the subject content that was covered for two groups of the students.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Box-3</label><caption><p>Summary of the method in which the content under &#x02018;Case-Stimulated Learning&#x02019; was delivered</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-4-138-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Assessment of the learning outcome</title><p>The learning outcome was assessed in the form of a short written test of 30 min duration conducted after the completion of the first stage of the experiment.

Students were asked to study, understand and discuss the topic for 1 hour within the group. The instructor acted as a facilitator and helped students in studying and understanding the physiological principles regulating the microcirculation, while also introducing them to the integrative way of understanding the concepts of &#x02018;Edema&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>shotha</italic>&#x02019;.</p><p>As we had multiple groups that were exposed to &#x02018;small group discussion&#x02019; type of study, we could not have a control group in this experiment. Further, we did not go for a written test because there was no group to compare the learning outcome with.

This feedback was in the form of questionnaires consisting of eight to ten statements. All the statements demanded students&#x02018; level of agreement on a five-point Likert scale. Half of the statements in each questionnaire were just the reverse of the rest. This was to make sure that the students expressed their opinions only after giving their thoughts carefully to the items. The five levels of agreement were: &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019;, agree&#x02019;, &#x02018;undecided&#x02019;, &#x02018;disagree&#x02019;, and &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019;. The five-point scale was so adjusted that a score of 1 would mean a strong agreement in <italic>favor</italic> of the integrative method and a score of 5 would mean a strong agreement <italic>against</italic> the integrative method of teaching.

This is especially true with the subjects such as <italic>Rachana Sharira</italic> (Anatomy) and <italic>Kriya Sharira</italic> (Physiology). The major reason for this is, unfortunately, the syllabus prescribed by the CCIM which lists out the topics belonging to &#x02018;biomedical sciences&#x02019; and &#x02018;Ayurveda&#x02019; discretely under different papers and sections, thus attempting at no integration. This has prompted many authors to write textbooks that are &#x02018;in accordance with the syllabus prescribed by CCIM&#x02019;. Students generally prefer consulting the textbooks that are &#x02018;in accordance with the syllabus&#x02019; and this trend has posed a threat of students learning Ayurveda only for the namesake. This obviously leads to a state where two mutually unrelated explanations are held simultaneously in an unacknowledged cognitive dissonance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In fact Ayurveda, in its original form has always been open to other streams of sciences. For instance, Sushruta has endorsed this openness as follows: &#x0201c;One cannot become a good physician by studying only one stream of science; rather, one should study various streams of sciences to be a successful physician&#x0201d;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p><p>In spite of the availability of such descriptions in classical textbooks, &#x02018;Educational research&#x02019; is still in its infantile state as far as Ayurveda education is concerned. There are no methodically conducted studies to suggest how Ayurveda should be taught in colleges, especially in the context of the recent advances in biomedical sciences. &#x02018;Are the epistemological bases of the two streams complementary to each other?&#x02019;, &#x02018;should they be allowed to merge?&#x02019;, and &#x02018;If such a merger is needed, what are the means to achieve this?&#x02019; &#x02013; are a few vital questions that have remained unanswered. Many scholars and sociologists believe that there cannot be an entity like &#x02018;integrative medicine&#x02019;. They argue that the core features of the two knowledge systems are mutually incompatible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, this view does not merit much attention as it lacks an in-depth understanding of both the sciences. Further, the recent advances in certain areas of biomedical sciences, such as systems biology, pharmacogenomics, chronobiology, stem cell biology, tissue engineering, neuroimmunoendocrinology, and biology of gut microbiota have strengthened the worldview that Ayurveda puts forth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]</p><p>With this background, the present study was planned to incorporate &#x02018;Ayurveda-biomedicine integration&#x02019; in the subject <italic>Kriya Sharira</italic>. &#x02018;Integration&#x02019; in fact is being seen as a strategy for making educational experiences coherent, relevant, and engaging; connecting diverse disciplines; and facilitating higher-order learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] In this context, the results of our study assume importance as there is a paucity of systematically conducted studies that evaluate the effectiveness of integrative approaches in Ayurveda education. The Integrative module (IMCP) that we designed and evaluated seems to have served the purpose of showing pointers to the possible ways of teaching the two sciences in an integrative manner. Similar modules have been prepared and evaluated in the context of medical education, the results of which are comparable with those of our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] CSL is intended at providing various degrees of early clinical exposure to the students in their preclinical years of study and therefore, aims at vertical integration. This also involves active learning. The results of our study are consistent with other similar studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] CSGD basically encourages interaction within the members of the group along with promoting communication skills. This is especially suitable for difficult subject matter involving complex facts. Because group sessions increase active participation, the members also learn from each other.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] There have been several studies that examine the potential of small group learning in other fields of education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Though we could not assess the results of this intervention objectively in our study, the student feedback suggests that this method is effective.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Implications of the study</title><p>The current study may be taken as a lead in planning the future course of Ayurveda education. As the next step, similar studies could be planned in other subjects and the merits of integrative approaches may be examined. These approaches may be incorporated into various faculty development programs so as to train the teachers in these methods. As the final outcome, an integrative curriculum may be envisioned once sufficient numbers of such studies are available.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>During the first and second experiment, both the experimental group and the control group of students were receiving the instructions simultaneously, though in separate teaching sessions.
