However, it is unclear which specific processes underlying motivation are altered. We tested whether bacterial endotoxin <italic>E. coli</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affected two dissociable constructs of motivational behavior, ie, effort and reward sensitivity. After familiarization with 5 effort levels, participants made a series of accept/reject decisions on whether the stake offered (1, 4, 8, 12, or 15 apples) was &#x02018;worth the effort&#x02019; (10%, 27.5%, 45%, 62.5%, and 80% of maximal voluntary contraction in a hand-held dynamometer). Effort and reward levels were parametrically modulated to dissociate their influence on choice. Overall, 29 healthy young males were administered LPS (2&#x02009;ng/kg; <italic>n</italic>=14) or placebo (0.9% saline; <italic>n</italic>=15). The effort-stake task, and self-reported depression and fatigue were assessed prior to LPS/placebo injection, 2 and 5&#x02009;h post injection. Cytokines and sickness symptoms were assessed hourly till 8&#x02009;h after LPS injection. LPS transiently increased interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, sickness symptoms, body temperature and self-reported fatigue, and depression post injection relative to baseline and placebo. These changes were accompanied by LPS-induced decreases in acceptance rates of high-effort options, without significantly affecting reward sensitivity 2&#x02009;h post injection, which were partially recovered 5&#x02009;h post injection. We suggest that LPS-induced changes in motivation may be due to alterations to mesolimbic dopamine. Our behavioral paradigm could be used to further investigate effects of inflammation on motivational behavior in psychiatric and chronic illnesses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Motivational symptoms such as apathy and fatigue are common in patients with psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toomey <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). A growing field of research suggests that inflammation may contribute to these motivational symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felger and Treadway, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R&#x000e9;us <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenblat <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). This is supported by observations of elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) in people who suffer from chronic major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowlati <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">M&#x000fc;ller and Schwarz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and observations of neuroinflammation in patients with bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stertz <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Y&#x000fc;ksel and &#x000d6;ng&#x000fc;r, 2010</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garver <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenblat <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Systemic inflammation in humans typically induces a cluster of non-specific symptoms (ie, sickness behavior) including fatigue, depression, and apathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dantzer, 2001</xref>). Studies of sickness behavior in animals suggest that these behavioral changes might be mediated by cytokine effects on the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dantzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felger and Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swardfager <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Following pathogen exposure, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released by activated immune cells to orchestrate the physiological immunologic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dembic, 2015</xref>). These pro-inflammatory cytokines also have a critical role in the regulation of immune influences on brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kronfol and Remick, 2000</xref>) and have shown to affect dopamine function in mesolimbic brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neurauter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capuron <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Dopamine has repeatedly been associated with both reward and effort-based decision making, but it remains to be determined how inflammation affects effort and reward influences on behavior.</p><p>Several human studies have investigated reward learning and mesolimbic functioning after treatment with the inflammatory cytokine interferon alpha (INF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) or acute inflammation challenges. These studies demonstrated altered reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and reductions in reward-related ventral striatal activity, that was associated with inflammation-induced increases in depression, fatigue, and anhedonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capuron <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dowell <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, research with animals suggest that inflammation affects effort expenditure, rather than reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larson <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunes <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In a two-choice (high-effort/high-reward <italic>vs</italic> low-effort/low-reward) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), administration of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> shifted rodent&#x02019;s choice towards the low-effort/low-reward option. Importantly, reward sensitivity remained intact as high-reward preferences were unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunes <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Another study demonstrated that inflammation reduced the overall effort investment (ie, number of responses), whereas the better high-effort/high-reward option was still favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vichaya <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). A version of this latter paradigm was recently assessed in humans where participants chose between high-effort/high-reward and low-effort/low-reward options. Reward magnitude and probability was modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lasselin <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Although participants selected the high-effort/high-reward options at the same rate during inflammation compared to placebo, they selected a greater proportion of the high-effort options when the probability to win the reward was high. Thus, participants still performed the high-effort options during inflammation to gain a higher reward, suggesting that they are still reward sensitive.</p><p>Paradigms used to date have been limited in the dissociation of reward and effort influences as they typically compare high-reward/high-effort options with low-reward/low-effort options. Accordingly, in the current investigation, we aimed to test whether systemic inflammation differentially affects reward or effort processing in healthy human volunteers using a recently developed effort-stake choice paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnelle <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2016</xref>). In this paradigm, we parametrically modulate effort and reward choices by providing options with combinations of different levels of reward and effort, allowing us to dissociate effort and reward influences on choice.</p><p>Our second aim was to explore the relationship between changes in motivational behavior and changes in fatigue and depression or pro-inflammatory cytokine response.

The human endotoxemia sessions took place 1&#x02009;week before the administration of Fluenz and were therefore not confounded by this second part of the clinical trial. Participants received either <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 2&#x02009;ng/kg or saline (0.9% NaCl) intravenously. They were randomly assigned to the LPS or placebo condition on the morning of testing by an unaffiliated research nurse and deblinding of conditions took place after all data had been collected. To control for individual differences in baseline performance, behavioral testing took place at three time points: session 1: 45&#x02009;min before injection; session 2: 2&#x02009;h post injection and; session 3: 5&#x02009;h post injection. &#x02018;Timing was based on previous experiences from our group showing that sickness symptoms are limited 2&#x02009;h after LPS administration, whereas cytokine levels are still high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kox <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leentjens <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).&#x02019; All study procedures were in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, including the latest revisions and approved by the local medical ethics committee (CMO: 2015/2058).</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty healthy, non-smoking Caucasian males aged 18&#x02013;35 years old (median age 21; IQR: 20&#x02013;23) without any medical/psychiatric history or current use of (prescription) drugs were recruited by the Radboud University Medical Centre Intensive Care Research Unit (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for inclusion and exclusion criteria). All subjects were bachelor or master students from the local universities. To reduce potential variation related to gender or hormonal fluctuations in female menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angele <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engler <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karshikoff <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moieni <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), only male subjects were used. Participants were asked to refrain from food (12&#x02009;h) as well as caffeine and alcohol (24&#x02009;h) before the LPS/placebo challenge. One volunteer was excluded due to vomiting that interfered with task performance during session 2 (LPS group: <italic>N</italic>=14, placebo group: <italic>N</italic>=15).</p></sec><sec><title>Force-Level Familiarization</title><p>After estimation of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for details on apparatus and MVC estimation), the five effort levels were set as 10%, 27.5%, 45%, 62.5%, and 80% of each individual&#x02019;s MVC, and represented as sections on the trunk of an apple tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Beginning at effort level 1, participants practiced squeezing to the required force and holding their grip at that force for 2&#x02009;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The trunk of the tree filled up with red as the dynamometer was squeezed, and turned yellow as soon as the required force was reached. Each effort level was performed twice sequentially from level 1 to level 5 using the dominant hand. Force-level familiarizations were repeated at the start of each session to remind participants of the effort required for each level.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Task</title><p>Participants were presented with a series of offers, in the form of the apple trees, and they had to select YES or NO, by lightly squeezing the right or left dynamometer, depending on if they evaluated the stake offered to be &#x02018;worth the effort&#x02019;. Twenty-five possible offers (all combinations of the 5 effort levels and 5 stake levels (1, 4, 8, 12, or 15 apples)) were each sampled four times in a pseudo-random order, totaling 100 trials in each session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To make each judgment behaviorally relevant, participants were told that 26 decisions would be randomly selected for them to perform immediately following the decision phase. These 26 trials were then presented during an execution phase. If the offer was accepted, participants had 5&#x02009;s to reach the required effort level and hold it for 2&#x02009;s. If they were successful, they received feedback stating how many apples they had won. If the offer was rejected, the tree appeared on screen with the message &#x02018;offer rejected&#x02019;, meaning they were not able to attempt to win the apples offered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Participants were told at the start of the day they would be rewarded based on the number of apples (worth 3 cents each) they gathered during this execution phase. Ten trials were practiced before session 1 to familiarize them with the stake/effort relationships. To control for changes in perceived task demand, participants performed a NASA task-load index questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hart and Staveland, 1988</xref>) after each familiarization session. Participants rated temporal, physical, and mental demand; frustration, effort required and their performance for each effort level.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Sickness Behavior and Mood</title><p>Physical sickness symptoms were measured before LPS administration (T=0) and at 30-min intervals until 8&#x02009;h after LPS administration (17 measures). Participants were asked to rate from 0 (absent) to 5 (very severe) the severity of six common symptoms: nausea, headache, muscle aches, back pain, shivers, and vomiting. Self-reported mood was assessed using the depression and fatigue subscales of the profile of moods state questionnaire (POMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNair <italic>et al</italic>, 1971</xref>)) at the start of each session (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for details on the subscale items).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Cytokines in Plasma</title><p>EDTA-anticoagulated blood was collected at: 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8&#x02009;h after LPS administration, centrifuged (2000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>, 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 10&#x02009;min), and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until analysis. Plasma concentrations of cytokines of interest (TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6) were measured using a simultaneous (entered together in one batch) Luminex assay (R&#x00026;D systems; Abingdon Science Park, UK, Human high sensitivity cytokine kit, catalog numbers LHSCM000, LHSCM210, LHSCM206, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rndsystems.com">www.rndsystems.com</ext-link>). Statistical analyses to calculate plasma concentrations were performed using Graphpad Prism version 5.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Lower detection limits in plasma and intra-assay coefficients of variation (C.V.) were; 0.22&#x02009;pg/ml (C.V. 1.54%) for TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and &#x0003c;0.86&#x02009;pg/ml (C.V. 0.92%) for IL-6. We initially also aimed at assessing IL1-Ra and IL1-b because of the suggested association between IL1 and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roerink <italic>et al</italic>, 2017a</xref>). Unfortunately, luminex assays of IL1-Ra failed and measures were considered unreliable as concentrations of IL1-Ra exceeded the upper detection limit (&#x0003e;15&#x02009;296&#x02009;pg/ml, C.V.=0.046%). IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> was excluded from analyses because plasma concentrations did not exceed lower detection limits at 2&#x02009;h post injection (0.79&#x02009;pg/ml, C.V.=0.30%).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Behavioral Task</title><p>The percentage of accepted offers for each of the 25 conditions (5 effort and 5 stake levels) was the key variable for each participant.

Here, we found that LPS increased cytokines and concomitantly altered motivational behavior and mood supporting the concept that inflammation could have a role in development of symptoms such as depression and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dowell <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engler <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; Felger and Treadway, 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karshikoff <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller and Raison, 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, we could not demonstrate direct relationships between LPS-induced behavioral changes and cytokine concentrations or mood. This could be due to our small sample size, lacking the power to detect such associations. In addition, the immune manipulation we used (LPS) induced robust increases with little variation in multiple cytokines that strongly interact with one another, making it difficult to disentangle which cytokine is responsible for the observed change in behavior. Future studies that induce more variation, eg, by using different dosages or selectively stimulate or inhibit cytokines could provide more insight on the role of specific cytokines on change in behavior. Although many studies have suggested relationships between motivational behavior and mood, actual reports of these relationships have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lasselin <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). One reason for this could be that the POMS was not sensitive enough to detect subtle alterations in depressive mood and fatigue. Alternatively, because our task dissociated between the sub-constructs of motivation (effort and reward) (Berridge <italic>et al</italic>, 2009), it may have captured behavior that is not necessarily reflected by the subjective reports of fatigue and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karshikoff <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has only been one previous human study that investigated effort and reward processing during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lasselin <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). That pioneering investigation used two-option choices (high-reward/high-effort <italic>vs</italic> low-reward/low-effort) and showed that after LPS the high-effort option was still favored, more so when the probability of gaining the reward was also high. There was no difference between LPS and placebo conditions in the number of high-effort choices. Although our results may at first appear to contradict these findings, both studies demonstrated that reward sensitivity was not affected by LPS. In addition, the two studies differed in important ways.</p><p>First, in Lasselin <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s forced-choice design, participants had to perform an action on each trial (meaning they updated their experience of the effort options), and they chose to perform the high-effort actions to gain a higher reward at the same rate as after placebo. In our design, participants only had the option to perform actions they considered &#x02018;worth the effort&#x02019; for the reward offered, ie, they could choose to do nothing, which led to a reduction in choice of high-effort options during inflammation. Furthermore, our paradigm parametrically modulated effort and reward, rather than offering two-option choices. In this way, our task allowed participants to gain the high rewards at a lower effort level, meaning gaining the largest reward was not contingent on putting in the highest effort. Second, the previous human study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lasselin <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) had a probability dimension, the likelihood of gaining the reward on high-effort trial was variable, an aspect which we did not test. Our task was simpler: reward was always given if the participant reached the effort level required. Finally, the previous investigation tested their participants 4&#x02009;h post LPS, while we tested participants 2&#x02009;h post LPS, which might be why our subjects were more effort sensitive. Indeed, the alterations in effort sensitivity were partly recovered 5&#x02009;h after LPS.</p><p>One potential mechanisms through which cytokines can affect motivational behavior is through interference with brain dopamine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felger and Treadway, 2017</xref>). Indeed, effort- and reward-related components of motivated behavior have consistently been linked to dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skvortsova <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wardle <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). For example, using a variation of the task reported here, Chong <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2015</xref> observed that patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, who often experience motivational symptoms, were willing to put in more effort to gain rewards when they were ON dopaminergic drugs compared to when they were OFF them. Animal work has also shown that dopamine depletion in the nucleus accumbens causes similar changes in effort-based choice behavior as observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randall <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, previous neuroimaging work has mainly focused on LPS effects on reward-related processes, showing reduced reward-related signals in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capuron <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Given the partial dissociable brain networks of effort and reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein-Fl&#x000fc;gge <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skvortsova <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), the neural alterations related to LPS effects on effort-based choice remained to be determined. We unfortunately do not have brain imaging data to compare to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capuron <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Future studies are needed to better dissociate the neural mechanisms of inflammation effects on effort- and reward-related processes.</p><p>Insights into immune-to-brain pathways gained from acute immune manipulation studies are important for better mechanistic understanding of motivational deficits in psychiatric conditions, and could lead to new pharmaceutical targets. Indeed, dopamine enhancing drugs like methylphenidate or levodopa can reverse inflammation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yohn, 2016</xref>; Bonsall, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felger <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and has some effects on reducing fatigue in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blockmans <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerr <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendon&#x000e7;a <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Minton <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether other dopamine manipulations would also reverse inflammation effects on motivational symptoms. Here we show that our task is sensitive to immune manipulation on dissociable sub-constructs of motivational behavior (reward and effort) in humans. This paradigm is therefore promising for further human research on immune-mediated changes in motivational behavior, and for testing of pharmacological targets to treat motivational symptoms. These could include targets at the immunological level by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines; a method that has reduced fatigue symptoms in some medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Omdal and Gunnarsson, 2005</xref>; Roerink <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b), but also targets at the central level, affecting dopamine function, for patients groups in which immune-alterations are less prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roerink <italic>et al</italic>, 2017a</xref>).</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, lacking power to detect relevant associations between individual immune responses, motivated behavior, and mood. Second, we used a relatively high dose of LPS (2&#x02009;ng/kg). This inherently also induce sickness symptoms that could affect the blindness of the conditions and potentially confound task performance. Although we show that our effects are specific to effort and not reward-based decisions, and that sickness symptoms were not directly correlated with effort-based choice within the LPS group, it is unfortunately statistically impossible to dissociate sickness symptoms from behavioral alterations, as these factors are not independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Chapman, 2001</xref>). Simply lowing the dose might not help as this inherently also reduces the behavioral effects, while still inducing significant increases in sickness symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benson <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Instead, future studies might potentially be able to dissociate these factors, eg, by assessing effects of co-administration with centrally acting drugs that do not affect sickness symptoms. Finally, we tested only men, whereas clinical work indicates that motivational symptoms such as depression are more prone in woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altemus <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In addition, several studies highlight the importance of sex differences in immune&#x02013;brain interactions that likely mediate the LPS effects on mood and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engler <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karshikoff <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moieni <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). This, therefore, limits generalizability of our results.</p><p>In summary, experimental endotoxemia reduced, otherwise, healthy participant&#x02019;s willingness to engage in high-effort options, while reward sensitivity was not significantly altered. This change in motivation was not due to the task being perceived as more effortful. Endotoxemia concomitantly induced an increase in subjective reports of depression and fatigue. The behavioral paradigm used in this study provides a human model to further investigate brain mechanisms underlying inflammation effects on motivational behavior. A better understanding of these mechanisms in humans will be important for further development and testing of pharmaceutical targets to treat motivational deficits in psychiatric disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding and disclosure</title><p>This research was funded by a Wellcome Trust Principal Fellowship awarded to Prof Masud Husain and supported by the Oxford NIHR BRC and CRF.

In the example pictured effort is set at level 3 corresponding to 45% MVC. Stake level is indicated by the number of apples on the tree, which ranged from 2 to 16 apples. In the example pictured stake is set at stake level 3 corresponding to 8 apples. (c) All the stages of the task that were repeated during each session. In force-level familiarization stage, participants had to reach each effort level twice, starting at effort level one (pictured) and moving up to effort level 5. They then completed the NASA task-load index questionnaire. During the decision phase, each of the 25 conditions were presented four times each in a pseudo-random order. Participants just had to select YES or NO to each offer. For the execution phase, 26 trials from the decision phase were randomly selected for the participant to perform. If an offer they had accepted (YES) was selected, they saw the command &#x02018;start squeezing!&#x02019; and were able to attempt to reach the force level required to win the apples. If an offer they had rejected (NO) was selected the message &#x02018;offer rejected&#x02019; appeared on the screen and they waited for the next trial to begin.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="npp2017231f1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) The mean percentage of accepted offers during the decision phase for each of the 25 conditions (5 effort &#x000d7; 5 stake).
