An estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, with 250,000 annual deaths attributed to the disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The prevalence of asthma in different countries varies widely, but the disparity is narrowing due to rising prevalence in low- and middle-income countries and plateauing in high-income countries.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Increased rate of its prevalence may be because of changes in life-style, rapid industrialization, increase in air pollution etc. Common risk factors of asthma include exposure to allergens (such as those for work place, house dust, mites, animal fur, cockroaches, pollens, and mold), occupational irritants,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] tobacco smoke,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] respiratory infections, food allergies (such as milk, peanuts, and eggs), and psychological stress.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] During asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes swell, causing the airways to narrow and reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs causing sleeplessness, daytime fatigue, reduced activity levels and school and work absenteeism.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This miserable condition is comparable to <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> in Ayurveda.</p><p>Detailed description of <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> including pathogenesis, signs and symptoms, and treatment is available in Ayurveda classics.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The symptoms of <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> are <italic>Asinolabhate Soukhyam</italic> (comfortable in sitting posture), <italic>Pratamyati Vegataha</italic> (tachypnea), <italic>Kasa</italic> (cough), <italic>Kanthodhwansa</italic> (hoarseness of voice), <italic>Parshwa Graham</italic> (stiffness in flanks), etc., and are similar to the symptoms of bronchial asthma.
