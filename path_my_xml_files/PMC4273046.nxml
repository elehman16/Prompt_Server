open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects comprised 11 female and 47 male patients who are randomly divided
into two groups: which performed a CKC exercise program Group I and Group II which
performed an OKC exercise program. Pain intensity was evaluated using visual analogue
scale (VAS). Knee flexion was evaluated using a universal goniometer, and thigh
circumference measurements were taken with a tape measure at baseline and at 3 months and
6 months after the treatment. Lysholm scores were used to assess knee function. [Results]
There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline. Within each
group, VAS values and knee flexion were improved after the surgery. These improvements
were significantly higher in the CKC group than in the OKC group. There were increases in
thigh circumference difference at the 3 and 6 month assessments post-surgery. A greater
improvement in the Lysholm score was observed in the CKC group at 6 months. [Conclusion]
The CKC exercise program was more effective than OKC in improving the knee functions of
patients with ACL reconstruction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</kwd><kwd>Closed kinetic chain exercises</kwd><kwd>Open kinetic chain exercises</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are prevalent musculoskeletal injuries among
physically active individuals and are most frequently seen in the population aged 15&#x02013;25
years<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. ACL reconstruction is the standard operative method used to prevent
the progress of unwanted musculoskeletal complications. There are many graft options,
fixation techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation programs for the treatment of ACL
tears. Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction with the use of autograft or allograft
tissue is generally preferred in surgery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Rehabilitation methods constitute an important part of the treatment aiming to reduce pain
and joint effusion, improve the range of motion (ROM) of the knee, and increase quadriceps
strength following ACL reconstruction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, there is no consensus on the ideal timeframe and the type of exercises that should
be prescribed<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data in the literature suggests both open and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise treatment
after ACL reconstructive surgery. Closed kinetic chain exercises have gained popularity over
open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises because many clinicians believe that CKC exercises are
more reliable and functional<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Supporters
of CKC exercise also note that it is more effective than OKC exercise at restoring
quadriceps femoris muscle strength after ACL reconstruction surgery. CKC exercises have also
been reported to exert more strain on the reconstructed ACL and are less harmful to the
patellofemoral joint<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate OKC and CKC exercises, and to report the early and
mid-term results of patients performing CKC and OKC exercise programs after ACL
reconstructive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 58 patients with unilateral ACL tears who underwent arthroscopically
assisted ACL reconstruction with an autograft of hamstring tendons.</p><p>Approval for the study was granted by the Local Ethics Committee of Bozok universty and
informed consent was received from all the study participants. From the initial 66
consecutive patients admitted to the outpatient clinic, 58 were randomly allocated into 2
groups by the sealed envelope method. Following a detailed physical examination, a standard
evaluation form was completed for each patient. Demographic information including sex, age,
weight, height, body mass index, occupation, education level, pain intensity and affected
side were recorded. Preoperative and post-treatment tests were applied for 4 variables of
pain intensity, thigh circumference difference, knee flexion, and Lysholm score. The
presence of ACL tear was confirmed by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging at
the initial visit. All subjects were required to be older than 17&#x02005;years of age and underwent
arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction surgery.</p><p>Subjects with a history of other lower extremity pathology and trauma, previous surgery of
the lower extremity, and inflammatory disorders or other rheumatic diseases, neurological or
psychiatric disorders, other problems related to either knee, or with a history of drug
therapy other than analgesics or physiotherapy treatment within the last 3 months were
excluded. Patients were randomly allocated to Group I (CKC) or Group II (OKC).</p><p>Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction was performed with a double bundle autologous
hamstring graft using the rigidfix system (The DePuy Mitek RIGIDFIX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Cross Pin
System) for all the patients with ACL tear by the same surgeons (ME, HOA). In Group I, 19
patients had also meniscus degeneration &#x02212; tear (16 medial, 3 lateral). In Group II, 17
patients also had meniscus degeneration &#x02212; tear (15 medial and 2 lateral). All meniscial
lesions were partially removed.</p><p>A Jones bandage, elevation and cold pack were applied immediately after the operation. The
following rehabilitation programme was followed by both groups. The patients were encouraged
to stand and bear weight using crutches 24 hours postoperatively. The knee was fully
extended by over press. Between Days 3&#x02013;7, ankle pump exercises were conducted (4 sets of 20
repetitions), knee isometric quadriceps flexion exercises (3 sets of 50 repetitions) and
straight leg elevation of 0&#x02013;50&#x000b0; (3 sets of 20 repetitions). Passive knee flexion-extension
between 0&#x02013;90&#x000b0; with a continuous passive movement device and walking with crutches with full
weight-bearing on the operated side was started between days 7&#x02013;15. The CKC and OKC exercises

(VAS) (0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm), active knee flexion was evaluated with a universal goniometer, and thigh
circumference difference was calculated from measurements made with a tape measure. The
thigh circumference difference was measured 15&#x02005;cm above the upper rim of the patella<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and represents the circumference measurement
difference between the operated and normal thighs. Lysholm scores were used to assess the

decrease of pain and inflammation, for regaining functional range of motion for undertaking
daily living and sporting activities, and for regaining previous quality of life. However,
there is no consensus on the post-surgery rehabilitation regimen In rehabilitation following
ACL reconstruction, it has been proposed that the graft and knee should be protected via
longer immobilization, and that weight-bearing should be avoided to prevent instability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Shelbourne et al., reported that
weight-bearing and accelerated rehabilitation programmes including full extension of the
knee on the first day had favorable effects on knee stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, full extension and weight-bearing were achieved on the first
postoperative day. In the early postoperative assessments at both 3 and 6 months, no
instabilities were seen. We consider this is one of the positive effects of early
rehabilitation and is consistent with the results of some previous studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Yack et al. compared OKC and CKC exercises in ACL rehabilitation and reported that there
was more laxity in the OKC group<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, Perry et al. found no knee laxity differences between OKC and CKC groups<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, no laxity was
determined in either group.</p><p>Postoperative knee edema and swelling develop immediately, and in the following days,
muscle weakness and atrophy begin in the quadriceps muscle, indicating the need for exercise
therapy to maintain the muscle mass. The most significant thigh circumference difference was
seen at 3 months in the present study. This difference was lower in the CKC group, which can
be considered to be the result of OKC exercises increasing the hamstring and quadriceps
muscle forces simultaneously and earlier than CKC exercises. The thigh circumference
differences were equal in the OKC and CKC groups at the end of the 6th month.</p><p>The essential reasons for performing OKC and CKC exercises are to avoid loss of muscle
strength, preserve knee ROM, and to maintain knee functionality and proprioception. In the
present study, although both CKC and OKC had positive effects on knee flexion, the CKC
exercises were more effective at inhibiting muscle atrophy of the knee flexors and extensors
at 3 and 6 months.</p><p>These results are similar to those of Barrett<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and show that CKC exercises performed while weight-bearing are more
effective at muscle strengthening and increasing joint range of motion. CKC exercises are
considered to be better for restoring normal knee function and weight-bearing<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bynum et al. compared ROM and Lysholm scores between an OKC group and a CKC group and found
significantly higher values in the CKC group<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, there were statistically significant
differences between the groups in the Lysholm and ROM scores of the patients, and the values
of the CKC group were higher at the end of the 6th month. This was contrary to the findings
of a study by Hooper et al., who reported that there were no differences between OKC and CKC
groups at the 4th week<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the
postoperative measurements were taken at later times in the present study, it is possible
that performing the exercises for longer periods may have a more positive effect on the
results.</p><p>In a study by Morrissey et al., VAS pain scores of OKC and CKC groups were compared and no
differences were found between the groups<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. That finding was in contrast to the results of the present study,
which show VAS scores were lower in the CKC group at both 3 and 6 months post-surgery. This
can be explained by CKC exercises being conducted with weight-bearing, which improves the
early mobilization and functionality of the patients. In addition, Hooper et al., reported
4-week values, a shorter observation period than that of the present study; thus, CKC
