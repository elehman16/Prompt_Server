In all studies, ED has a rather high rate from 20% to 40% for the ages 60-69 years old, some increasing after the age of 65 years.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>This requires two kind of therapeutic approaches: one, by administering the aphrodisiac drugs with supplementation of a nutritious diet to regain vigor and virility; second, by offering counselling to dispel mis-conceptions and wrong beliefs about sexual performance.</p><p>Here in this clinical study, an attempt has been made to see the efficacy and safety of the orally administered <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> preparation with that of a placebo in the treatment of patients with <italic>Klaibya</italic> (impotency).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study objective</title><p>

A total of 43 patients completed the 45 day study period and 8 patients dropped out prior to completion of the study, 27 patients were registered in Group A, among them 24 patients continued till end of the study and 3 patients discontinued. In group B, a total of 24 patients registered, among them, 19 patients continued till the end of the study and 5 patients discontinued [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The following was the demographic distribution of the patients: 27 patients (52.9%) were between 31 years and 40 years, 15 patients (29.4%) belonged to the age group of 2l-30 years. 9 patients (18%) were belonging to age group of 41-50 year. 25 patients (49%) of patients belonged to Hindu religion, 19 patients (37.2%) belonged to Muslim and 7 patients (14%) were Christians. 25 patients (49%) were labourers. 15 patients (29.5%) had <italic>Va&#x00101;ta Pitta Prak&#x01e5b;ti</italic>, 23 patients (45%) were addicted to smoking, followed by 18 patients (35%) to alcohol, 13 patients (25%) to pan-masala and 8 patients (15.6%) to tobacco. Sexual life was found unsatisfactory in 65% and satisfactory in 18 patients (35%), while 48 patients (94%) patients had normal scrotal findings and 3 patients (6%) of them had abnormal findings. 44 patients (86%) patients showed normal epididymal findings. 38 patients (74.5%) had the history of masturbation and 41 patients (80%) of reported nocturnal emissions before marriage. Nearly 18 patients (35%) indulged in <italic>Ativyavaya</italic> while 15 patients (30%) had <italic>&#x0012a;r&#x01e63;&#x00101;</italic>, <italic>Chinta&#x00101;</italic>, <italic>Shoka</italic>, <italic>Bhaya</italic> etc., and 13 patients (25.5%) had the history of taking <italic>Asa&#x00101;tmya</italic>, <italic>ViruddhaA&#x00101;hara</italic>. 20 patients (39%) reported lack of erection while 15 patients (30%) patients reported primary infertility and inability to maintain erection.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile of 51 patients of <italic>Klaibya</italic> (impotency)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ASL-32-134-g002"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study was aimed to design an effective, safe and affordable alternative treatment of <italic>Klaibya</italic>. The herbal combination <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> used in this study showed better improvement in sexual desire, penile erection and penile rigidity in the treated group. Such positive results were not observed in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Majority of patients in the study, i.e., 49% were Hindus, which only reflects the higher population of this religion in the specific geographic area. Majority of patients, i.e., 53% were of an age group between 31 years and 40 years. Excessive sex indulgence and stress may be the reasons for this population to seek the help of the physician. About half of the patients were of labour class. More than their physical work, stressful life, life-style changes, lack of education may be the key factors here. Majority of patients were poor, lacked nutrition and led unhygienic life-style, which might have impacted their condition. About 70% of patients had one or the other addiction. Tobacco and alcohol both have adverse effects on the libido of the individual. It could be seen that the majority of patients visited were naturally having an unsatisfactory sexual life and had led &#x0003c; 10 years of married life. Majority of patients were engaged in masturbation and also had nocturnal emissions. Even though these are natural and normal, mis-conceptions related with it might have had adverse effects. Majority of patients had the complaint of lack of erection. In general, this is the reason for which the patient seeks the help of a physician. Effect of therapy of the prepared sample <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> was assessed by analysing the effect on sexual parameters and seminal parameters. To confirm the effect to be due to the drug, but not by chance or placebo effect, a control group with placebo administration was also selected. Considering the effect on sexual parameters, we observe statistically significant improvement on sexual desire, penile erection and orgasm in the treated group, where as placebo group did not show such positive results [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of therapy on sexual parameters</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ASL-32-134-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Effect of therapy on seminal parameters</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ASL-32-134-g004"/></table-wrap><p>A significant improvement <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 was seen in duration of coitus in the group treated by <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic>. This again confirms the positive effect of study drug in comparison with placebo. A significant improvement in the duration of sexual act and frequency of sexual act were other desired positive effects of <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>When we consider the effect on seminal parameters, the data clearly shows the therapeutic efficacy of <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic>. Significant improvement in seminal volume, total sperm count, rapid linear progressive motility and slow linear progressive motility were observed in the treated group. Mild reductions in the number of immotile sperms were seen in the group of <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic>. A marginal increase in seminal volume was observed in the treated group and an adverse effect was seen in the placebo group. Another interesting observation is that the viscosity of semen also shows an increase. When the total effect of therapy was analysed all the patients under the treated group had shown at least some amount of improvement. In about 58% of patients, moderate to marked improvement was observed. In the placebo group, no improvement was seen. All these observations confirm that <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> has certain efficacy on both the sexual and seminal parameters [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. It also improved psychological and physical health. These effects could be due to the various ingredients present in the formulation.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Over-all effect of therapy</title><p>In Group A (<italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic> treated group), majority of the patients, i.e., 41.66% had shown mild to moderate improvement and the remaining 16.66% patients showed marked improvement. In Group B (placebo treated group), no improvement could be seen in the selected parameters, some of the patients have even shown deterioration in their condition.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Probable mode of action of <italic>P&#x0016b;ga Kha&#x01e47;&#x01e0d;a</italic></title><p>Many researchers have concluded that <italic>Areca catechu</italic> as having aphrodisiac property,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] anti-aging property,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] anti-oxidant property,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] anti-inflammatory, analgesic action.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] <italic>P&#x0016b;ga</italic> has an alkaloid, arecoline, which has some stimulating action on the central nervous system. <italic>P&#x0016b;ga</italic> has <italic>Kash&#x00101;ya</italic>, <italic>Madhura Rasa</italic>, <italic>Guru gu&#x01e47;a</italic>, <italic>&#x0015a;&#x0012b;ta v&#x0012b;rya</italic>, <italic>Ka&#x01e6d;u Vip&#x00101;ka</italic> and is <italic>Trido&#x0015b;a &#x0015a;&#x00101;maka</italic>.
