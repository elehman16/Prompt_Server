To demonstrate the package and compare results from forced choice pairwise comparisons to those from more standard single stimulus rating tasks using Likert (or Likert-type) items, we investigated perceptions of physical strength from images of male bodies. The stimulus set comprised images of 82 men standing on a raised platform with minimal clothing. Strength-related anthropometrics and grip strength measurements were available for each man in the set. UK laboratory participants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Study 1</xref>) and US online participants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec021">Study 2</xref>) viewed all images in both a Likert rating task, to collect mean Likert scores, and a pairwise comparison task, to calculate Elo, mean Elo (mElo), and Bradley-Terry scores. Within both studies, Likert, Elo and Bradley-Terry scores were closely correlated to mElo scores (all <italic>r</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.95), and all measures were correlated with stimulus grip strength (all <italic>r</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.38) and body size (all <italic>r</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.59). However, mElo scores were less variable than Elo scores and were hundreds of times quicker to compute than Bradley-Terry scores. Responses in pairwise comparison trials were 2/3 quicker than in Likert tasks, indicating that participants found pairwise comparisons to be easier. In addition, mElo scores generated from a data set with half the participants randomly excluded produced very comparable results to those produced with Likert scores from the full participant set, indicating that researchers require fewer participants when using pairwise comparisons.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Leverhulme Trust (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>F/00 182/CJ (2011-2013)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penton-Voak</surname><given-names>Ian S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Leverhulme Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leverhulme.ac.uk">www.leverhulme.ac.uk</ext-link>) provided a Research Grant [F/00 182/CJ (2011-2013)] to ISP-V and APC.

For example, a rater could be asked to evaluate the attractiveness (&#x0201c;characteristic&#x0201d;) of an image depicting a face (i.e. &#x0201c;stimulus&#x0201d;) along a gradient between not attractive at all and highly attractive that could be scored along integers between 1 and 7. This is often referred to as a Likert scale [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] but this is technically inaccurate as Likert himself used &#x0201c;scale&#x0201d; to refer to a group of multiple such items [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Discrete Visual Analogue Scale is suggested as a general alternative [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but we will simply refer to the practice as &#x0201c;Likert rating&#x0201d;. When inter-rater agreement is high, and average responses are calculated from a reasonable sample of raters, Likert rating tends to produce repeatable results that convey useful information about the stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This represents a mathematically straight-forward process that is easy for researchers with even minimal technical ability to complete using very basic and readily available hardware and software tools.</p><p>From an individual participants&#x02019; perspective, however, the rating experience could be better. The scale itself can be a challenging concept for users with a weak grasp of number lines; for instance, small children [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], or members of some traditional, pre-literate cultures [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More generally, using a rating scale can increase cognitive demand as it requires conscientious raters to monitor their responses to each stimuli and retrospectively compare them to responses from previous perceptive states, whereas paired comparisons imposes no such constraint [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>One alternative to Likert rating is to show stimuli in pairs and ask participants to choose which one better expresses some characteristic, for example, which of two faces is more attractive. The results of these pairwise comparisons can be used to quantify perceptions of a stimulus according to a mathematical model that calculates its probability of being judged to be more or less expressive than a given set of alternatives. This method was first developed in the context of psychological research by Thurstone [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but developed further by Bradley &#x00026; Terry [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A class of mathematically-related models are now often known as Bradley-Terry models [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and include a variety of sophisticated extensions and approaches to model-fitting [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190393.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Also related are models that were independently derived to rank chess players&#x02014;the earliest by Zermelo [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the most famous by Elo [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which in turn has led to more complex derivatives such as Glicko [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and TrueSkill<sup>&#x02122;</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of advantages associated with pairwise comparisons. They are less complicated for participants: there are only two choices for each decision, the choices do not require an understanding of number lines, and there is no need to track responses from previous decisions. Besides this, each decision made provides information about two stimuli, therefore representing a more efficient use of participant time. In previous contrasts, results from Likert ratings correlate strongly with pairwise comparison methods [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, pairwise comparisons are much less used, perhaps because many Bradley-Terry models, although simple by the standards of mathematicians, are comparatively complex and computationally intensive. However, this is no longer a serious constraint as the hardware and software capabilities to overcome it are readily available. Elo rating, in particular, is a relatively simple approach that offers conceptual accessibility, widespread familiarity and use [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and recent programming implementations [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of Elo rating to pairwise comparisons of stimuli, and introduce &#x0201c;EloChoice&#x0201d;, an R package optimized for this use and designed to be accessible even to those with limited experience of the free, and increasingly popular, R programming environment [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Each pairwise comparison can be seen as a contest between two stimuli, with the one chosen as a better exemplar of some attribute being the winner. All stimuli begin with the same starting score, but diverge as successive comparisons take place. Because the number of points exchanged in any comparison is symmetrical (the winner&#x02019;s gains equal the loser&#x02019;s losses), the mean score will always equal the starting score, so long as the number of stimuli in the set remains stable. When stimuli are paired randomly, the scores should quickly converge to a stable ranking, assuming sufficient variation among stimuli and a reasonable degree of shared perceptions among rating participants. As with chess players, there is no requirement that all combinations of stimuli are observed, and, indeed, this is one of the system&#x02019;s chief advantages [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>There are at least two problems associated with the Elo rating system in the context of this application, but both are readily surmountable. The first problem arises from the fact that final scores can be influenced by the sequence order of contests, because the same contest outcomes will produce different results depending on the order in which they are observed. This is appropriate when the targets being scored are entities that may become weaker or stronger with time (such as players gaining or losing skill), but psychological stimuli are typically static in this regard and hence the order of events is not capturing any useful information. As there is nothing special about the sequence of contests presented to participants, any variation in final scores introduced by sequence variation is undesirable noise. To counter this problem, we propose a simple fix; randomly shuffle the original sequence presented to participants multiple times to create multiple virtual sequences, and average Elo scores for each stimuli from the different sequences to generate mean Elo scores that are free from sequence noise.</p><p>A second problem is that there is currently no commonly accepted way to measure consistency across paired comparison trials. It is often desirable to measure the consistency of ratings for stimuli across multiple raters (to gauge the extent to which raters share perceptions about targets), and in the case of Likert rating this is most appropriately achieved by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To provide a conceptually (but not directly) comparable value, our solution is to propose a novel measure, the Elo consistency index, which tracks how often outcomes deviate from predictions based on previous judgments (that is, those trials in which the stimulus with the lower Elo score was chosen&#x02013;in other words, an upset or reversal). Because the preceding Elo score is generated by the judgements made in previous comparisons, violations of expected outcomes can be seen as inconsistency between judgements. This inconsistency can occur both between and within raters. The index will be biased towards tracking one form of inconsistency or the other depending on the ratio of raters to the times each rater makes a judgement on each stimulus. In the case that each rater makes only one judgement on each stimulus, the index will be entirely tracking between-rater consistency (because each preceding Elo score was generated by judgements made by previous raters only). The index can be calculated for any sequence of trials (across any number of raters) and is defined by the following formula:

where <italic>u</italic> is a vector of 1&#x02019;s and 0&#x02019;s, in which a 1 indicates that the expected outcome was violated and a 0 indicates that it was not, and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of trials for which an expectation existed (that is, for all trials in which the preceding Elo score difference was not 0). The resulting index value will vary between 0 and 1. Index values approach 1 as fewer expectation violations (or upsets/reversals) are observed, and approach 0 as more are observed. An index value of 0.5 indicates random choice, but values of less than 0.5 are technically possible. Index values for each sequence generated can be averaged to produce a mean consistency index score to correspond with mean Elo scores.</p><p>A weighted version of the Elo consistency index can be calculated by taking into account the score disparity observed in expectation violations, according to the following formula:
<disp-formula id="pone.0190393.e006"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0190393.e006.jpg" id="pone.0190393.e006g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>&#x02032;</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>
where <italic>u</italic> is the same vector described above and <italic>w</italic> is the absolute difference in preceding Elo scores between members of a trial. This can be understood as the proportion of all points exchanged in a sequence that were correctly predicted by preceding Elo scores. The weighted consistency index will again vary between 0 and 1, and larger expectation violations (that is, where the difference in preceding Elo scores is greater) will negatively impact values of <italic>R</italic> more. Generally the weighted consistency index value is expected to be greater than the unweighted value, as the magnitude of difference between Elo scores should negatively predict probability of an expectation violation.</p><p>To demonstrate Elo rating in action and to compare it both to Likert rating and to a basic Bradley-Terry model, we use the example of perceived physical strength from stimuli composed of images of human male bodies.

On the basis of these facts alone, there is little to separate one measure from another, and little reason to favour one above the other options. However, we argue that mElo scores represent a good alternative option to Elo scores, Bradley-Terry scores and Likert ratings, for distinct reasons.</p><p>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190393.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190393.g004">4</xref> demonstrates the range of Elo scores that can result from different sequences of the same trial comparisons with the same outcomes, and the range of correlations with grip strength and PC1 of body size (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Study 1</xref>) demonstrates why this is problematic. As argued earlier, this variation in final scores represents an undesirable feature in the context of our rating temporally stable features, and we proposed mElo scores to address this issue. When multiple mElo scores are generated, each using the same trial data but using different randomly shuffled sequence orders, the results are far less variable. Each mElo score was almost perfectly correlated with all others, and there was no detectable variation between them when predicting actual strength and strength-related measurements. This was even the case for the one mElo score that was generated using 1000 different sequence orders, which indicates that, in this case at least, using 100 sequence orders is sufficient and saves computing time without cost.</p><p>We argue that the mElo approach is conceptually simpler than standard Bradley-Terry models, and thus more likely to appeal to researchers who are new to pairwise comparison. Our results suggest that mElo is computationally simpler as well, calculating score in 5 seconds or less, whereas Bradley-Terry models took over 15 minutes. This could be related to the number of stimuli used in our example, so studies using an even greater number of stimuli may suffer even greater time disparities.</p><p>Although results from Likert ratings and mElo scores were largely similar for this task, the procedure for obtaining them was quite different, leading to a very divergent participant experience. Participants completed pairwise comparison trials significantly quicker than rating trials, and the effect size for this difference was large (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190393.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Taking response time as a proxy of cognitive load [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the speed difference between the trial types indicates that participants found the pairwise comparisons to be easier. This is likely to be a particularly important consideration for more difficult tasks (e.g. rating characteristics which are not readily apparent, such as personality traits from faces [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], or kinship in monkeys [<xref rid="pone.0190393.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]), or for participant groups that have either compromised capacity or limited experience with stimulus tasks, particularly those involving novel concepts.</p><p>In addition, because participants complete pairwise comparison tasks more quickly, they might be willing to be paid less to provide similarly useful information. This is not the only way in which pairwise comparisons may prove to be more efficient. Note that correlations with actual strength and strength-related measures deteriorated as more raters were excluded for both Likert ratings and mElo scores, despite strong correlations with ratings and scores from the full participant set. This indicates that collecting data from more participants is likely to beneficial for both methods. However, also note that the mElo scores obtained from the halved set had strikingly similar associations with stimulus variables as Likert ratings from the full set did, and similarly mElo scores from the quartered set produced similar associations as Likert ratings from the halved set (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190393.t002">Table 2</xref>). If this pattern is typical of other data sets, this suggests that only half as many pairwise comparison participants are required to produce results equivalent to those from ratings tasks. This could represent a considerable savings for researchers both in time and participant payments.</p><p>In conclusion, using pairwise comparisons in conjunction with the &#x0201c;EloChoice&#x0201d; package represents a simple alternative option for researchers interested in quantifying perceived characteristics of stimuli, offering participants a less demanding experience while requiring fewer of them, and representing a minimal learning cost even for researchers inexperienced with R.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a research project grant awarded to A.P.C. and I.S.P-V from the Leverhulme Trust.
