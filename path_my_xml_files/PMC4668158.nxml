hamstring flexibility. [Subjects] Fifty-four healthy young subjects were randomly assigned
to one of three groups (2 treatment groups and 1 control group). [Methods] Subjects in the
passive stretching group had their knees extended by an examiner while lying supine 90&#x000b0; of
hip flexion. In the same position, subjects in the active stretching group extended their
knees. The groups performed 3 sets of the assigned stretch, with each stretch held for 10
seconds at the point where tightness in the hamstring muscles was felt. Subjects in the
control group did not perform stretching. Before and immediately after stretching,
hamstring flexibility was assessed by a blinded assessor, using the active knee-extension
test. [Results] After stretching, there was a significant improvement in the hamstring
flexibilities of the active and passive stretching groups compared with the control group.
Furthermore, the passive stretching group showed significantly greater improvement in
hamstring flexibility than the active stretching group. [Conclusion] Improvement in
hamstring flexibility measured by the active knee-extension test was achieved by both
stretching techniques; however, passive stretching was more effective than active
stretching at achieving an immediate increase in hamstring flexibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hamstring flexibility</kwd><kwd>Active stretching</kwd><kwd>Passive stretching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The tightness of hamstring muscles is one of the main factors hindering performance in
daily and sporting activities. Reduction in the flexibility of the hamstrings has been
reported to be associated with the occurrence of back pain in adolescents and adults in
cross-sectional studies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, reduction in the flexibility of the hamstrings
has been reported to increase the risk of damage to the musculoskeletal system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, flexibility of the hamstrings is important for general health and physical
fitness<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have indicated that flexibility of the hamstrings is improved by
stretching<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Indeed, many stretching
techniques are used in clinical practice, including ballistic stretching, static stretching,
and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques. Among the stretching methods,
passive and active stretching techniques are easy to implement and are useful as home
exercises. Active stretching increases the flexibility of tight muscles while concomitantly
improving the function of antagonistic muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, passive stretching is characterized by the addition
of stretch stimulation on muscle contraction independent of the subject<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Murphy detailed a new active stretching technique called
the dynamic range of motion (DROM)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This method is as an alternative to static stretching. During DROM, a contraction by the
antagonist muscle causes the joint crossed by the agonist muscle to move through the full
ROM at a controlled, slow tempo<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. DROM
is a technique that takes advantage of reciprocal innervation. However, Bandy et al.
reported that passive stretching is more effective than DROM<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, but their study had different stretching conditions, such as
different stretch elongation times, and was not an accurate comparison of the stretching
techniques. To our knowledge, no studies have compared active and passive stretching
techniques using the same method for the hamstring muscles. Thus, the purpose of this study
was to compare the effect of passive and active stretching techniques using the same method
on the flexibility of the hamstring muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 54 healthy young subjects were randomly allocated among three groups: an
active stretching group, a passive stretching group, and the control group. The subjects
were paired according to gender (9 males and 9 females for each group). The inclusion
criteria were as follows: limited hamstring flexibility, operationally defined as 70&#x000b0; by
the active knee-extension test (AKET) conducted at 90&#x000b0; of hip flexion in the supine
position<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; no participation in
strengthening or stretching programs for at least 1&#x02005;year; and the absence of injury to the
lower extremities. Institutional review board approval was obtained before recruitment of
subjects. All subjects signed an informed consent form agreeing to participate in the
study. This research was approved by Saitama Prefectural University&#x02019;s Committee of Ethics
in Research (No 22705).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Hamstring flexibility was measured before the intervention. Hamstring flexibility was
measured using the AKET, which has high reliability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were positioned supine with their right hip and knee
flexed at 90&#x000b0;, and their lumbar lordosis was supported with a lumbar roll. From that
position, extension of the knee was performed. The knee was extended to the point of mild
resistance or just below the threshold of myoclonus, as described by Gajdosik<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The same-blinded assessor measured the
knee angle (degrees from full extension) in all three sessions using an inclinometer.
Subjects in the passive stretching group had their knee extended by one examiner while
lying supine with 90&#x000b0; of hip flexion. In the same position, subjects in the active
stretching group extended their own knee. Stretches were performed times in 3 sets of the
assigned stretch. Each stretch was held for 10 seconds at the point where tightness in the
hamstring muscles was felt, and then the leg was slowly lowered (over 10 seconds).
Stretches at maximum knee extension elicited a &#x0201c;strong but tolerable feeling of muscular
tightness&#x0201d; in the back of subjects&#x02019; legs<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects in the control group did not perform stretching.</p><p>Means and standard deviations (SD) of the pre-intervention and post-intervention AKET
measurements were calculated for each group. In addition, the mean difference between
pre-intervention and post-intervention AKET measurements was also calculated.</p><p>The pre-intervention and post-intervention AKET angles of the control group were used to
assess the reliability of the measurement using the intraclass correlation coefficient,
ICC (1,1). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for significant
differences between groups in the dependent variables: characteristics of each group
(differences in age, height, and weight), pre-intervention AKET angle, and flexibility
change (difference between post- and pre-interventions). The data were analyzed using
one-way ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. The level of
significance was chosen as p=0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
15.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of each group were not significantly different (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects in each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active stretching group (n=18)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Passive stretching group (n=18)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=18)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.3 &#x000b1; 1.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.5 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.5 &#x000b1; 8.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.9 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.4 &#x000b1; 6.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.1 &#x000b1; 8.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.6 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.8 &#x000b1; 6.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).

flexibility. The results of this study demonstrate that both active and passive stretching
were effective at improving hamstring flexibility compared with the control group. In
addition, the passive stretching group showed a significant improvement in flexibility
compared with the active stretching group.</p><p>Winter et al. reported that passive stretching is characterized by the external addition of
stretch stimulation on muscle contraction, while active stretching is characterized by a
reciprocal innervation mechanism used to relax antagonist muscle contraction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reciprocal inhibition adjusts the
contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles to facilitate various movements. In this
study, the subjects in the active stretching group performed stretches using this mechanism.
However, the improvement in hamstring flexibility in the active stretching group was less
than that of the passive stretching group. The reason for this difference may be the posture
of the active stretching group during the stretch. When holding the stretch position the
excitatory spinal motor neurons overcome &#x003b3; inhibitory neuron impulses<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the final knee extension position was held
for 10 seconds by subjects in the active stretching group. Consequently, there was a
simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles without antagonist suppression of
the &#x003b3; impulses. Therefore, the active stretching group did not experience antagonist muscle
relaxation, suggesting that there is a difference in the degree of stretch stimulation
between the active and passive stretching groups.</p><p>A recent study reported that passive stretching is harmful for movement performance<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Simic et al. reported that the results of
a meta-analysis of 104 studies showed passive stretching before exercise results in a
reduction of maximum muscle strength<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In contrast, active stretching has been reported to improve movement performance. Yamaguchi
et al. reported that muscle strength was improved by an average of 13.3% after
stretching<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Faigenbaum
et al. compared motor function after different stretching techniques, and showed that active
stretching improves motor function<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, the effect of passive stretching and active stretching should be considered together
with when the stretching occurs, e.g. before and after exercise, as this could influence the
effect. The results of the current study show that passive stretching was useful for
increasing the flexibility of the hamstring muscles. Previous studies reported improvements
in flexibility were elicited by passive stretching conducted for patients with contracture
and limited flexibility<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, passive stretching before exercise is not
recommended according to another study<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, passive stretching should be recommended for use when improvement in flexibility is
required, for example, when there are post-exercise and range of motion restrictions, and
particularly for bedridden patients, passive stretching may become one of the choices of the
therapy.</p><p>The subjects of this study were young people. This study did not investigate the effects of
stretching on elderly people, and only focused on immediate effects. Further studies are
required. Specifically, studies using long-term interventions with greater numbers of
subjects including the elderly, and comparison of time and frequency of active and passive
stretching are required. In addition, it is possible to evaluate the effect of stretching on
exercise performance, not only flexibility.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the effect of passive and active stretching techniques on
hamstring flexibility. The results of this study suggest that improvement in hamstring
flexibility can be obtained by both stretching techniques. However, passive stretching may
elicit greater improvements in hamstring flexibility than active stretching.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Pentti</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Terho</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Low back pain and disability in 14-year-old
