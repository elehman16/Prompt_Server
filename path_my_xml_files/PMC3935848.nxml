Furthermore, the times until loss of consciousness (LOC) and to the first occurrence of epileptiform patterns were to be evaluated. A detailed knowledge of the development of epileptiform activity under different sevoflurane concentrations could help to avoid these potentials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Approval from the ethics committee of Hannover Medical School was obtained for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p>Data of 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I - III children undergoing elective surgery in the paediatric theatre were studied with written parental consent.

Julliac et al. <xref rid="pone.0089191-Julliac1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> gave 8% sevoflurane for induction of anaesthesia in 40 adult patients. The endtidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 4% or 2%, and in the patients with 4% endtidal sevoflurane different ventilation modes were used. In each of the three groups with a maintenance concentration of 4% endtidal sevoflurane, 3 to 5 of 10 patients had epileptiform potentials, whereas in the group with 2% only 1 of 10 patients had such EEG activity.

J&#x000e4;&#x000e4;skel&#x000e4;inen et al. <xref rid="pone.0089191-Jskelinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> demonstrated in non-epileptic adult volunteers who received the three endtidal concentrations 2%, 3% and 4% sevoflurane for 30 min each that sevoflurane produced epileptiform discharges in a dose-dependent manner. At 2% endtidal sevoflurane, epileptiform discharges occurred in 7 of 8 persons. At 3%, they occurred in all persons, additionally, 1 person had repetitive epileptiform discharges. At 4% endtidal sevoflurane, all persons had epileptiform discharges and repetitive epileptiform discharges, 3 had electrographic seizures, in 1 case accompanied with clinical motor seizures.

Two patients had such episodes after the termination of EEG suppression at the beginning of section C. Both had DSP and the endtidal sevoflurane concentration was near 3.0% in one child and 3.5 to 3.6% in the other child. During the course of section C, DSP and few PSR occurred in a 5-year-old child with 3.4&#x02013;3.3% sevoflurane, a 1-year-old child had DSP and SSP after the endtidal sevoflurane had been 4.4% and decreased from about 4.2 to 3.5%. In a 6-year-old patient DSP and PSR occurred when the endtidal sevoflurane concentration was increased from 4.3 to 4.6%. DSP, PSR, and some PED, occurred in a 4-year-old child under increasing endtidal sevoflurane concentrations between 3.8 and 4.3%.</p><p>Hyperventilation is discussed in the literature as one factor that may activate electroencephalogram abnormalities during sevoflurane administration <xref rid="pone.0089191-Vakkuri2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The authors assumed that this resulted from a higher minute ventilation in uncooperative relative to cooperative patients. In the own data set, the time from start of induction to the occurrence of slow EEG waves, which characterize a deep EEG stage of anaesthesia, was shortest in the most agitated children (0.7&#x000b1;0.3 min), was longer in only moderately crying children (1.1&#x000b1;0.3 min), and was longest in children who were calm (1.3&#x000b1;0.4 min), but the portion of children with epileptiform EEG activity was not significantly different in the three groups (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8775).</p><p>Julliac et al. <xref rid="pone.0089191-Julliac1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> reported that women had a higher risk to develop epileptiform activity than men, but in the own data set no gender effect was found.

Up to a concentration of 6%, the cumulative percentages of children with 6% and 8% sevoflurane who had epileptiform potentials were similar (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3708). In total, in our analysis, more children with 8% sevoflurane compared to 6% had epileptiform potentials in their EEGs, because higher endtidal sevoflurane concentrations were reached with 8% sevoflurane.</p><p>With 6% sevoflurane, the longest time from start of sevoflurane until an EEG pattern of deep anaesthesia, which was characterized by delta waves &#x0003c;2 Hz, appeared was 126 s, and the longest time from start of sevoflurane to LOC was 79 s. Accordingly, reducing the administration time of 6% sevoflurane e. g. to 3 min, as with 8% sevoflurane, would have been safe with regard to depth of hypnosis. Shortening the administration time of 6% sevoflurane could probably have reduced the number of children with epileptiform potentials at least to some extent. In 14 of the 26 children of the 6% sevoflurane group with epileptiform potentials the first second with epileptiform potentials occurred later than 3 min after the start of the sevoflurane administration.</p><p>Schultz et al. <xref rid="pone.0089191-Schultz2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> reported on the incidence of epileptiform EEG activity related to brief administration of 8% sevoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub> in children. Immediately after the LOC the inhaled concentration was reduced to 4%. Epileptiform EEG patterns were detected in 20% of the patients.

The authors argue that it is reasonable to avoid circumstances favouring the emergence of these signs, particularly, because there are concerns about the safety of anaesthetic agents in the brain of young children.</p><p>The MAC value of sevoflurane given without N<sub>2</sub>O is reported to be 2.8% in children from 6 months to below 3 years, 2.5% between 3 and 12 years and 2.6% at an age of 25 years <xref rid="pone.0089191-Fachinformation1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The corresponding 1.5 MAC values are 4.2%, 3.75%, and 3.9%.</p><p>In patients with a history of epilepsy, epileptiform EEG activity may be observed even with lower sevoflurane concentrations. Iijima et al. <xref rid="pone.0089191-Iijima1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> showed that during administration of sevoflurane from 1 to 2 MAC, adult patients with a history of epileptic disorders had an increasing amount of epileptiform activity in their EEGs.

There was no significant difference in the time to the clinically observable loss of consciousness, between 8% and 6% sevoflurane, the mean time to an EEG stage of deep anaesthesia was about 14 s longer with 6% compared to 8% sevoflurane (77.9&#x000b1;20.0 s vs. 64.0&#x000b1;22.2 s).</p><p>The own analysis and data from the literature imply that avoiding higher endtidal sevoflurane concentrations can reduce the risk for the occurrence of epileptiform activity during induction of anaesthesia in children. This may be achieved by using inhaled sevoflurane concentrations below 8 Vol.-% and limiting administration times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0089191-Dubois1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
