The qualitative and quantitative contributions of the various component causes to disease initiation and/or progression varies from patient to patient, resulting in a widely heterogenic clinical phenotype. Disease severity and extent also appear to be influenced by the same exposures, in conjunction with local anatomical features. Tissue destruction arises largely from a dysregulation of chronic inflammatory processes that the body's homoeostatic maintenance systems fail to resolve, resulting in a failure to eliminate pathogenic components of the subgingival biofilm and a persistence of chronic non-resolving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Van Dyke 2008</xref>).</p><p>Exposure categories believed to contribute component causes to periodontal inflammation include: genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Michalowicz et al. 1991</xref>); environmental (e.g. biofilm, stress); lifestyle/behavioural (e.g. smoking, diet) and pharmacological (e.g. corticosteroids); and &#x0201c;nutrition&#x0201d;, which is influenced by lifestyle, environmental and genetic exposure categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chapple 2009</xref>). Evidence is emerging for associations between such lifestyle factors and periodontal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bawadi et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Epidemiological studies demonstrate that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables (FV) is associated with a lowered risk of atherogenic cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Joshipura et al. 1999</xref>), ischaemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Joshipura et al. 2001</xref>) and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Knekt et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Sauvaget et al. 2003</xref>). Diets rich in vegetables and Vitamin C also appear to associate positively with better periodontal health and negatively with periodontal disease progressing more rapidly in undernourished populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Enwonwu et al. 2002</xref>). Given the high prevalence of periodontitis in the population (moderate disease prevalence 20&#x02013;50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">K&#x000f6;nig et al. 2010</xref>) and its impact upon elevating plasma biomarkers of systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">D'Aiuto et al. 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">b</xref>), it appears that periodontal inflammation makes a significant contribution to the systemic inflammatory burden.</p><p>In recent years, strong evidence has emerged that diets rich in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats are pro-inflammatory, whereas those rich in polyunsaturated fats (fish oils), antioxidant micronutrients (fruits, berries and vegetables) and certain nuts (cashews) are anti-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">O'Keefe et al. 2008</xref>). Pro-inflammatory diets drive oxidative stress within cells and tissues through metabolic (mitochondrial) and receptor-mediated pathways (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chapple 2009</xref>) and such post-prandial oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Sies et al. 2005</xref>), termed &#x0201c;meal induced inflammation&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">O'Keefe &#x00026; Bell 2007</xref>) positively correlates with the magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Esposito et al. 2008</xref>) and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Ceriello et al. 2008</xref>) of post-meal surges in glucose and triglycerides. The latter, a consequence of the rapid absorption of glucose and lipids into the blood stream following intake of dietary refined carbohydrate and saturated fats, gives rise to elevations in plasma levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Monnier et al. 2006</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chapple 2009</xref>). Indeed, recent evidence has demonstrated a significant role for oxidative stress in promoting bone resorption via activation of certain transcription factors (FoxOs, which decreases wnt signalling), modulated by insulin resistance and increasing age (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Galli et al. 2011</xref>). Antioxidant micronutrients combat such pro-inflammatory cascades through modulation of oxidative stress by directly scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also by down-regulation of some redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory gene transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 while up regulating anti-inflammatory gene transcription factors such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2: reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chapple &#x00026; Matthews 2007</xref>). Indeed, adjunctive phytonutrient supplementation using juice powder concentrates of fruit, vegetables and berries (FVB) has been shown to reduce the immediate impact of a high fat test meal upon inflammatory biomarkers and to improve flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Plotnick et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress, defined as <italic>an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favour of the oxidants, leading to a disruption of redox signalling and control and/or molecular damage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Sies &#x00026; Jones 2007</xref>) is a key pathological event underpinning periodontal tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chapple &#x00026; Matthews 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bullon et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Galli et al. 2011</xref>). Since the first indirect demonstration of oxidative stress within the periodontal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Chapple et al. 1997</xref>), a body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Sugano et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Takane et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Wei et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Panjamurthy et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">D'Aiuto et al. 2010</xref>) and antioxidant compromise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Chapple et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brock et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Panjamurthy et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">D'Aiuto et al. 2010</xref>) in periodontitis patients. Recent data from our own laboratory demonstrated that the antioxidant depletion manifest locally within the periodontal tissues appears to be an effect rather than a cause of the oxidative stress, which develops during periodontal inflammation (Chapple et al. 2007, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Grant et al. 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, it is biologically plausible that boosting the antioxidant micronutritional status of patients may have preventive and/or adjunctive therapeutic benefit, in particular in those patients who show micronutrient deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Tonetti &#x00026; Chapple 2011</xref>).</p><p>The potential impact of diet upon periodontal inflammatory status was recently illustrated in a Swiss study, which found that when 10 adults were placed in a &#x0201c;stone-age&#x0201d; environment for 4 weeks, with negligible oral hygiene and diets were &#x0201c;stone-age&#x0201d; in nature (id est. low in simple sugars and high in antioxidant micronutrients, fish oils and fibre), they remarkably demonstrated significant decreases in gingival bleeding and probing depths, despite significant increases in plaque accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baumgartner et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recent case&#x02013;control studies have demonstrated that periodontitis patients have significantly lower serum antioxidant micronutrient levels than unaffected controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brock et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Panjamurthy et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Konopka et al. 2007</xref>), and also compromised gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) antioxidant status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chapple et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brock et al. 2004</xref>). Non-surgical periodontal therapy has been shown to restore certain antioxidant components in a process attributed to reducing levels of oxidative stress secondary to the resolution of periodontal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chapple et al. 2007</xref>). However, non-surgical therapy did not restore levels of the important small molecule antioxidant species, glutathione (GSH), although the ratio of GSH to its oxidized counterpart was restored, implying at least a restoration of the redox balance within periodontal cells and tissues following successful periodontal therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Grant et al. 2010</xref>). Large scale epidemiological studies also consistently support a strong inverse association between serum antioxidant micronutrient concentrations and periodontitis prevalence and severity, in several different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Nishada et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Amarasena et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Amaliya et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chapple et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Linden et al. 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jenzsch et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that diets rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and dairy products, when employed as the only intervention, significantly improved pocket depth and gingival inflammation in periodontitis patients with metabolic syndrome. The reported data point towards the biological plausibility of beneficial periodontal outcomes being derived from phytonutritional interventions of antioxidant micronutrients, acting by direct scavenging of ROS, and also by modulation of redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory gene transcription factors.</p><p>There remains a paucity of data from prospective intervention studies on the role of nutrition in the pathogenesis of periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">van der Velden et al. 2011</xref>). Specifically, there are no reports from placebo-controlled randomized trials on the efficacy of nutritional supplements upon periodontal outcomes.

The study was conducted in accordance with international Good Clinical Practice standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and volunteers</title><p>Volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 61) were recruited from new patient consultation clinics by one study team member (P. W.), and were both non-smokers and medically healthy by medical history questionnaire. A rolling recruitment protocol was adopted and non-smokers selected, as smoking impacts upon oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chapple &#x00026; Matthews 2007</xref>) and was deemed to be a likely confounder of study outcomes. Volunteers were aged between 30 and 60 years, either men or women, and had chronic periodontitis as defined by a minimum of two sites per quadrant with pocketing or interproximal attachment loss of &#x0003e;6 mm and one-third radiographic bone loss. The following exclusion criteria were applied: patients with aggressive disease, patients with physical or mental disability, pregnant women, patients whose medical history may place them at risk of complications from periodontal therapy (e.g. need for antibiotic prophylaxis, Warfarinised patients), patients taking long-term antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory drugs, patients unable to swallow capsules, patients unable to provide informed consent, current smokers (or within 5 years), patients taking regular vitamin supplementation. The study was designed to exit 60 volunteers at 9 months following recruitment (8 months following completion of non-surgical treatment) and was conducted over a 4.5-year period (2005&#x02013;2010).</p><p>Volunteers were provided with a detailed information sheet and allowed 2 weeks to consider their participation, prior to obtaining their informed consent and enrolment. As volunteers were enrolled (by M. M.) they were allocated sequential study numbers (by K. A.) and provided with their capsules, sufficient for 3 months.</p><p>Randomization was performed by the study statistician (G. D.), who was independent of the clinical study team and site, using a computer-generated program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link> (volunteer numbers generated from 001 to 070 to allow for loss of up to 10 participants). The capsules were supplied in pre-labelled containers.</p><p>Baseline measures were also collected at the enrolment visit, prior to which volunteers were asked to fast overnight, not to brush and not to chew gum or drink within 2 h of their appointment. Protocol adherence was checked prior to sample collection, and patients were re-appointed if necessary. Biological samples were sequentially collected. The GCF from three deep sites (&#x02265;6 mm) and three shallow sites (&#x02264;3 mm) was collected as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chapple et al. 2007</xref>) and deep sites were pooled, on a volunteer and visit basis, as were samples from the three shallow sites. The GCF sampling was followed by a venous blood sample, probing pocket depth (PPD) and recession measures, bleeding scores, gingival colour index [Modified Gingival Index (MGI) &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lobene et al. 1986</xref>] and plaque indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Patients then had scaling and root surface debridement performed on a quadrant by quadrant basis within 1 month and over four visits. At each visit, adherence was re-checked and recorded. Capsule re-supply occurred at recall visits and patients were recalled at 2, 5 and 8 months following completion of the last session of instrumentation. At each recall visit, clinical samples and measurements were repeated and volunteers exited the study at the 8-month recall appointment, when capsule containers were returned and counted. Volunteers were also asked to maintain a supplement diary recording of how many capsules had been missed. If further therapy was required at this stage, as judged by clinical examination, it was performed by the same therapist (N. L.-M.), but outside of the study.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpe0039-0062-f1"/></fig><p>All volunteers completed standard non-surgical periodontal therapy, which was performed by a single operator (N. L.-M.; 15 years experience and MPhil degree in clinical periodontal trials) within 4 weeks of commencing treatment and all indices were recorded by a single GCP-trained examiner (M. M.). Scaling and debridement was performed using a traditional quadrant by quadrant protocol, using a single ultrasonic (Densply CavitronPlus SPS; Densply UK) device and FSI-100 inserts, and Gracey curettes (LM-Dental UK).

Secondary outcome measures were reductions in GCF volume from both deep and shallow sites, gingival redness (MGI &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lobene et al. 1986</xref>), cumulative plaque index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lobene et al. 1982</xref>) and recession.

The mean of the two closest measures was used. Mean probing attachment (derived from pocket depth + recession), and PPD measures per subject were calculated at each examination point (baseline, 2, 5 and 8 months post-therapy). Marginal bleeding was recorded dichotomously (four sites per tooth, mesial, distal, mid-facial, mid-lingual) and expressed as mean percentage sites bleeding on probing (% BOP) per subject at each examination point. Plaque levels were quantified using a modification of the Quigley-Hein index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lobene et al. 1982</xref>) and expressed as a whole mouth total (cumulative) score per volunteer at each examination point.

One patient was withdrawn (placebo group) as they telephoned to inform that they were experiencing difficulty swallowing, and although this could not be attributed to the supplements as opposed to a respiratory tract infection, the principal investigator (I.

We hypothesized that additional clinical benefit would result from supplementation with a juice powder concentrate (FV) and that the triple therapy (FVB) would provide enhanced outcomes over the dual supplement (FV) due to additional polyphenolic antioxidants. The rationale for such hypotheses was based upon the substantial literature base concerning the efficacy of antioxidant micronutrients in reducing extracellular oxidative stress, and their intracellular role in the down-regulation of redox-regulated pro-inflammatory gene transcription factors (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chapple &#x00026; Matthews 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chapple 2009</xref>). Statistically significant additional reductions in PPD were seen at the 2-month post-therapy recall visit for FV verses placebo, providing partial fulfilment of the first hypothesis. Therapy employing the FVB supplement did not, however, provide significantly improved primary outcomes relative to the placebo group, despite the presence of additional polyphenolic micronutrients within. Hypothesis two was therefore not fulfilled and nor was hypothesis three, as the initially greater pocket depth reduction in the FV group was not sustained at 8 months post-therapy.</p><p>It was surprising not to see similar additional improvements for the FVB as the FV group, but this may be explained by the reduced bioavailability of micronutrients in this group as demonstrated by the serum &#x003b2;-carotene levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). It may also be explained by nutrigenetic differences between groups, as polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene (&#x003b2;-carotene 15,15&#x02032;-monoxygenase) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Leung et al. 2009</xref>) which appear to explain, at least in part, the low conversion rates of &#x003b2;-carotene to its bioactive form in many individuals. The attenuation in serum &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations at 5 and 8 months could also have arisen due to reduced adherence to supplementation in the FVB group; however, this thesis was not supported by the supplement diary and capsule count analysis. An alternative explanation is that micronutrient absorption across the gastrointestinal tract wall may have been lower in the FVB than the FV group, or that the additional polyphenolic compounds within the FVB supplement antagonized beneficial activities of other components. Whatever the explanation, the plasma &#x003b2;-carotene data demonstrate reduced bioavailability of some micronutrients in the FVB group relative to FV.</p><p>Significant additional reductions in percentage sites bleeding on probing arose for the FV group at 5 months (following the increased 2-month pocket depth reductions). The cumulative plaque index data recorded in the supplementation group are also interesting, as significant additional decreases were observed at the 8-month follow-up visit for FV verses placebo, 3 months after the additional improvements in percentage sites bleeding recorded in the same group (FV). Although it could be argued that the improved plaque index in the supplement group arose due to better home care/compliance, this seems unlikely, as there were no differences between groups in plaque indices at 2- and 5-month recalls, where the most substantial reductions in plaque took place. An alternative and intriguing explanation is that additional reductions in inflammation evident at 5 months were reflected in the composition of the GCF, which in turn led to a reduced biofilm accumulation. Although this is consistent with current evidence that the inflammatory status of the gingival tissues influences plaque biofilm accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hillam &#x00026; Hull 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baumgartner et al. 2009</xref>) and with current consensus views on host response/biofilm inter-relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Tonetti &#x00026; Chapple 2011</xref>), plaque re-growth studies and those analysing GCF composition would be necessary to substantiate such a thesis. A prebiotic effect upon biofilm accumulation is unlikely as capsules were swallowed and nutrients not applied locally. Any effect therefore would appear likely to be due to the influence of an altered systemic (and downstream local) host response upon the periodontal biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Marsh &#x00026; Devine 2011</xref>).</p><p>The healing and resolution of inflammation arising from the non-surgical mechanical therapy alone (placebo group) was substantial and consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">van der Weijden &#x00026; Timmermann 2002</xref>), with clinically significant increases in the number of closed pockets apparent at 2 months and at subsequent recalls. Moreover, there were no baseline differences between groups in circulating concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin C or &#x003b2;-carotene, all of which were within or close to the low end of published SI reference ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Young 1987</xref>). Taken together, it is perhaps surprising that any additional clinical benefit was achieved in patients who were effectively nutritionally replete and in whom non-surgical management alone was highly successful. Some of those benefits were not retained after 8 months, a finding that does not fulfil our third hypothesis and which may be explained by a number of factors, including a tendency for recalcitrant disease to develop at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Quirynen et al. 2005</xref>). However, given that there is a more limited rationale to the expectation of improved therapeutic outcomes in nutritionally replete verses deplete patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Schifferle 2009</xref>) and that non-surgical therapy was successful without adjunctive nutritional support, it is possible that more substantial clinical benefits may be realized from such dietary augmentation in nutritionally depleted periodontitis patients or in those who do not have access to dental services for periodontal therapy. The public health benefits of such an approach, in a society where obesity trends are increasing and diets are decreasing in quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jenzsch et al. 2009</xref>) may be substantial if proven. Indeed, there is evidence from one intervention study in patients with metabolic syndrome that inflammatory periodontal outcome measures improved following a nutritional intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jenzsch et al. 2009</xref>). Such findings when allied to the impact of periodontal inflammation upon systemic inflammatory status may further impact upon chronic inflammation in the body in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kawashima et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jin et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>There are limitations to the current study. Firstly, the study may have lacked the power to detect the beneficial effects of FV and FVB because we had no prior data upon which to base sample size estimates. Secondly, assessing protocol adherence was difficult, preventing a &#x0201c;per protocol&#x0201d; analysis. The analysis presented is an &#x0201c;ITT&#x0201d; analysis, which assumes that non-adherence will be random and thus equitable across the three groups. We did not attempt to ascertain nutrigenetic parameters which are likely to dictate &#x0201c;high responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low responders&#x0201d;, largely because this science is in its infancy and the most appropriate outcome measures are unknown, with the exception of recent discoveries in relation to &#x003b2;-carotene converter status and polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Leung et al. 2009</xref>). Thirdly, the high improvements recorded in the placebo group from mechanical debridement alone are likely to have created a ceiling effect, whereby further improvement from adjunctive therapy is less likely.</p><p>We conclude that adjunctive daily supplementation with an encapsulated FV juice powder concentrate, during non-surgical periodontal therapy, appears to offer additional initial pocket depth reductions, and subsequent additional improvements in bleeding on probing and plaque scores even in high responders to conventional therapy and in those who are not nutritionally compromised. However, outcomes seem to depend upon the serum/plasma micronutrient concentrations achieved, and this requires patient adherence and likely favourable absorption across the gastrointestinal tract wall. Further studies are necessary to assess such approaches in larger and more diverse populations, employing different supplement and therapeutic regimes. In particular, monotherapy studies (phytonutrient supplementation alone) and studies in nutritionally compromised patients are necessary to help build a clearer picture of the clinical impact of antioxidant phytonutrient supplementation upon periodontal and systemic inflammatory status.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation
