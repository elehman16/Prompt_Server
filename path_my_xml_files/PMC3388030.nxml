Two phase 3 randomized, double-blind trials were conducted at 154 sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe to compare fidaxomicin vs vancomycin in treating CDI. Patients with CDI received fidaxomicin 200&#x000a0;mg twice daily or vancomycin 125&#x000a0;mg 4 times daily for 10 days. The primary end point was clinical cure of CDI at end of treatment, and a secondary end point was recurrence during the 28 days following clinical cure. In all, 1164 subjects were enrolled, of which a subgroup of 128 in the per-protocol population had another recent episode of CDI prior to the CDI diagnosis at study enrollment. In the analysis of this subgroup, initial response to therapy was similar for both drugs (&#x0003e;90% cure). However, recurrence within 28 days occurred in 35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin (&#x02212;15.8% difference; 95% confidence interval, &#x02212;30.4% to &#x02212;0.3%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.045). Early recurrence (within 14 days) was reported in 27% of patients treated with vancomycin and 8% of patients treated with fidaxomicin (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.003). In patients with a first recurrence of CDI, fidaxomicin was similar to vancomycin in achieving a clinical response at end of therapy but superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days.</p><p><italic><bold>Clinical Trials Registration</bold></italic>.

Recurrence of disease is frustrating because there is no approved treatment alternative that provides a lower probability of yet another recurrence. Following a second recurrence, subsequent episodes occur in as many as 40%&#x02013;60% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C1">1</xref>]. Recurrent CDI may be a consequence of resident spores or infection from local environmental contamination. Relapse and reinfection are therefore difficult to distinguish. Both metronidazole and vancomycin suppress the growth of the normal microflora and thereby defeat natural colonization resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C5">5</xref>]. The purported success of fecal transplantation in the treatment of relapsing CDI supports the importance of preservation of the normal flora in preventing reinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C8">8</xref>].</p><p>Current guidelines are to treat a first episode of nonsevere uncomplicated CDI with oral metronidazole 500&#x000a0;mg 3 times daily for 10&#x02013;14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C10">10</xref>]. Oral vancomycin 125&#x000a0;mg 4 times daily for 10&#x02013;14 days has become the standard for treating severe CDI. Treatment of the first recurrence of CDI is usually conducted with the same regimen used to treat the initial episode, whereas tapered and/or pulsed doses of vancomycin are recommended for second and subsequent recurrences. Long-term treatment with metronidazole has been associated with cumulative neurotoxicity and is not recommended beyond the first recurrence.</p><p>Fidaxomicin is highly active against Gram-positive anaerobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C13">13</xref>] and spares <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species that normally comprise a major constituent of fecal flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C8">8</xref>]. In contrast, vancomycin and metronidazole have broader antimicrobial activity; vancomycin has been shown to reduce fecal <italic>Bacteroides</italic> counts by 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;logs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C4">4</xref>].</p><p>Fidaxomicin has been compared with vancomycin for the treatment of CDI in 2 phase 3 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C15">15</xref>]. This report presents a subset analysis comparing the efficacy of fidaxomicin with the efficacy of vancomycin in preventing a second recurrence in patients who were enrolled in the trials after a recent single episode of CDI.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Patients with toxin-positive CDI were recruited to 2 phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (NCT00314951 and NCT00468728). A separate stratum was constructed of patients who had experienced a single prior CDI episode within 3 months of the current CDI episode. Patients were recruited in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged &#x0003e;15 years, had a diagnosis of CDI, and had received no more than 24 hours of pretreatment with vancomycin or metronidazole. Concomitant treatment with other potentially effective treatments for CDI was not allowed. Of 1164 patients enrolled in both trials, 178 (15%) were enrolled for treatment of a first recurrence. <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection was defined as a change in bowel habits, with &#x0003e;3 unformed bowel movements (or &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL of unformed stool for patients with rectal collection devices) in the 24 hours before randomization and the presence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin A or B in the stool within 48 hours of randomization. All patients gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design and Conduct</title><p>Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral fidaxomicin (200&#x000a0;mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125&#x000a0;mg 4 times daily) for 10 days. The main outcome of this analysis was recurrence (diarrhea and positive stool toxin test) within 28 days after completing treatment. Patients were evaluable for recurrence if they were followed up for 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2 days from the end of treatment and did not receive additional CDI therapy. Results are given for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol groups.</p><p>Fecal samples collected before the first dose of study drug, at the end of treatment, and at recurrence of symptoms were assayed for toxins A and B, which were assessed by the standard tests used at the local site laboratory. Patients were asked to record self-administration of study drugs and CDI symptoms, including number and consistency of bowel movements.</p><p>Safety was assessed by interview, recording of adverse events, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and other evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Drugs, Randomization, and Blinding</title><p>Study drugs were overencapsulated using microcrystalline cellulose as filler so that all capsules were identical in appearance and taste. Capsules were supplied to patients in blister packs with instructions on how to take the study medication during the 10-day treatment period. Patients randomized to receive fidaxomicin took 2 capsules containing 200&#x000a0;mg of fidaxomicin and 2 placebo capsules, alternating. Patients in the vancomycin treatment group took 4 capsules containing 125&#x000a0;mg of vancomycin. An interactive voice response system or an interactive web response system was used to assign a computer-generated randomization number and medication kit number to each patient. The investigator, sponsor and site personnel, and patients were blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Patients with either a first episode of CDI or a single prior episode of CDI were enrolled, and this is a subset analysis of the latter, with no predetermined sample size.</p><p>To compare the efficacy of fidaxomicin vs vancomycin in preventing a second recurrence within 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2 days of completion of treatment for the first recurrent episode, a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test of difference in proportions was performed and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived. Recurrence was compared across subgroups according to age, sex, and inpatient status.</p><p>A Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis using the Gehan&#x02013;Wilcoxon and log rank tests was used to determine equality across treatment and age strata. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine if treatment (fidaxomicin or vancomycin), receipt of concomitant antibiotics, and age were predictors of recurrence, and corresponding adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated. The treatment-by-age interaction term was included in the full model. If the interaction term was not statistically significant at &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, a reduced model without the interaction term was used in the final model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>The mITT study population consisted of 178 enrolled patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of fidaxomicin (88 patients) or vancomycin (90 patients) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CIS462F1">1</xref>). There were 79 and 83 patients, respectively, in the per-protocol analysis of cure. Patients who were cured (74 fidaxomicin-treated and 76 vancomycin-treated patients) were monitored for recurrence. Eight patients in the fidaxomicin treatment arm and 14 patients in the vancomycin treatment arm were excluded from the per-protocol analysis of recurrence owing to insufficient follow-up, receipt of other therapy for CDI, or other protocol violations. There were 128 patients in the per-protocol analysis of recurrence, 66 treated with fidaxomicin and 62 treated with vancomycin. Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="CIS462TB1">1</xref> summarizes baseline characteristics of the per-protocol population.

Plasma levels of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite ranged from 20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;ng/mL, and there was no accumulation at day 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Treatment of acute CDI with metronidazole or vancomycin is effective in many patients, but recurrent CDI in a subset of patients continues to present a significant clinical challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C14">14</xref>]. The major contributing processes in recurrent CDI are postulated to be persistence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores that can germinate following completion of therapy, suppression or eradication of protective microflora that would normally inhibit germination and vegetative growth of resident spores or establishment of newly acquired environmental spores, and failure of the host to establish an adequate immune response to <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxins A and B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C18">18</xref>]. Germination of persistent spores and relapse generally occur within 7&#x02013;10 days of completion of antibiotic therapy for CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C6">6</xref>], whereas mean time to reinfection from environmental sources has been estimated at 42.5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C19">19</xref>]. Patients with chronic relapsing CDI typically have 7&#x02013;15 days between cycles of antibiotics to treat reemergent symptoms, suggesting that these episodes represent regrowth from persistent spores rather than new infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C20">20</xref>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis of 463 patients in Quebec, Canada, presenting with a first recurrence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> between 1991 and mid-2005 found that the risk for a second recurrence within 60 days of diagnosis was similar whether patients were treated with metronidazole, vancomycin, or both for either the initial or first recurrent episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C21">21</xref>]. One-third of patients treated with either antibiotic had a second recurrence, and risk increased with age and duration of hospitalization. The risk of recurrence was similar to that in the present study, although duration of follow-up varied. In the Canadian study, 33% of patients had recurrence of CDI within 60 days of beginning vancomycin treatment, with the majority of those recurrences occurring within 30 days. In our study, recurrence after vancomycin was 35.5% within 28 days of completing therapy; this corresponds to 36&#x02013;40 days from the first dose of vancomycin, depending on duration of follow-up (26&#x02013;30 days). In contrast, patients treated with fidaxomicin in this study had a 19.7% risk of a second recurrence.</p><p>A vexing issue is whether recurrence of CDI is caused by relapse with the original strain or reinfection with a new strain from the environment. In this randomized, blinded trial, we found that treatment of an initial recurrence with fidaxomicin was associated with fewer second recurrences than treatment with vancomycin. In addition, mean time to second recurrence was significantly longer in the fidaxomicin treatment group. Only 38% (5 of 13) of recurrences occurred within 14 days of completing fidaxomicin therapy, whereas 77% (17 of 22) of recurrences in the vancomycin group occurred by day 14. Because both drugs may remain in the large bowel for several days, it is postulated that the early reduction in recurrence represents prevention of relapse from germination of the resident <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores, and within this time frame, fidaxomicin was clearly more effective than vancomycin. However, CDI recurrence after 14 days, when both antibiotics have been cleared from the gut, more likely represents new infection from environmental sources, and the rates of recurrence after 14 days were similar for both drugs (13% of fidaxomicin-treated patients and 11% of vancomycin-treated patients without recurrence by day 14 of follow-up).</p><p>Advanced age was also associated with a second recurrence; patients aged &#x02265;65 years were more than twice as likely to have a relapse in 28 days than patients aged &#x0003c;65 years. Other studies have observed an increased risk of recurrence within 2 months for patients aged &#x02265;65 years following treatment with metronidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C22">22</xref>]. The relapse rate was as high as 58% in this age group during the Canadian outbreak in 2003&#x02013;2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C22">22</xref>]. These studies did not stratify patients according to whether this was a first or subsequent episode of CDI. In the Canadian study, most recurrences in patients who remained hospitalized during the entire 60 days following initial diagnosis occurred within the first 30 days. Comparisons between studies and meta-analyses of recurrence are complicated by differences in methodology and duration of follow-up.</p><p>Oral administration of vancomycin or fidaxomicin results in high fecal concentrations of either drug, well above minimum inhibitory concentrations for all clinical isolates of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. In a study by Louie et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C4">4</xref>], mean <italic>Bacteroides</italic> counts in feces were similar at the beginning and end of fidaxomicin treatment (day 10), but use of vancomycin resulted in counts that were 3.8&#x000a0;logs lower following 10 days of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C4">4</xref>]. In specimens collected 21&#x02013;28 days after the end of treatment, mean fecal spore counts were &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;logs lower in fidaxomicin-treated patients than in vancomycin-treated patients. Fidaxomicin spares most of the major phylogenetic clusters, including clostridial clusters XIVa and IV and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, in contrast to vancomycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C23">23</xref>].</p><p>Several therapeutic approaches have been tried in recurrent CDI, but published outcomes have been restricted by limited numbers of patients treated or retrospective analysis, often without adequate comparators. Standard vancomycin treatment followed by tapered and/or pulsed doses is recommended for second or subsequent recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C24">24</xref>], but these regimens are not based on evidence from controlled studies. Another consideration is that a pulsed regimen could potentiate acquisition and overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C26">26</xref>]. Concomitant probiotic therapy has been proposed to improve the efficacy of antibiotics, but the evidence is scant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C27">27</xref>].</p><p>Rifaximin treatment following a full course of vancomycin was effective in preventing recurrence in 7 of 8 patients with multiple recurrences of CDI, but 1 strain isolated from a patient posttherapy was resistant to rifaximin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C28">28</xref>]. Several clinical isolates of <italic>C. difficile</italic> have been found to be resistant to rifaximin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C31">31</xref>]. The incidence of rifampin resistance during a CDI epidemic at 1 US teaching hospital was 37% for all clinical isolates and 82% for NAP1/BI/027 isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C29">29</xref>]. Eight patients in that study had been exposed to rifamycins before developing a first episode of CDI, and 7 of those harbored rifampin-resistant <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Mutations in 1 region of the RNA polymerase &#x003b2; subunit (rpoB) gene of <italic>C. difficile</italic> confer resistance to both rifampin and rifaximin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C31">31</xref>].</p><p>Fecal transplantation is reported to be effective in treating recurrent CDI, but the number of patients treated in published studies is small and no comparative trial has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C8">8</xref>]. Passive and active immunization approaches to treatment are also under investigation. In short, empirical approaches to treating recurrent CDI have been reported in a number of small case series and have been compared in retrospective analyses, but it is clear that prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed to establish guidelines for the treatment of recurrent CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS462C10">10</xref>].</p><p>Our results suggest that fidaxomicin or vancomycin treatment of a first recurrence of CDI produces similar initial relief of symptoms (&#x0003e;90% response), but fidaxomicin is superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days of completion of therapy. Preservation of the normal intestinal flora during fidaxomicin treatment is presumed to be a major factor in the difference in risk of recurrence. In trials to date, fidaxomicin has been safe and well tolerated, is minimally absorbed, is not associated with selection of antibiotic-resistant strains in vivo or in vitro, and is superior in reducing recurrences following vancomycin therapy. This subset analysis has shown that this relative superiority for preventing recurrences is also seen in patients with a recent single prior episode of CDI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Acknowledgments.</italic></bold>&#x02003;The initial draft was written by S.
