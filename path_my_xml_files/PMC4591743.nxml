The work depends on the type of business, but it will usually include using computers, communicating with others by e-mail, telephone or fax, keeping records and files etc., in hard and soft format. Features of an office such as people, building space, equipment, furniture and the environment, must fit together well for workers to feel healthy and comfortable and to be able to work efficiently<bold>.</bold> More than 50% of the world&#x02019;s population currently works in some form of office. Mostly the developing countries likes India and China are having more population. They are working with machines and majority of them are from computer related sector. In the Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enable Services (ITES), workers are dependent on the computers. More IT and ITES sectors are increasing in India. The study on performance, health and well-being of office workers productivity is an essential to improve it. Indoor environmental quality has an important role to play in office workers&#x02019; performance, health and well-being. The effect of environmental factors brings down the health and efficiency of office workers. The primary objectives of this study are to improve human health, safety, and improve performance. Any study on these environmental factors can potentially benefit millions of people around the world. Hence an attempt has been made to carry out a study on the performance of office workers by considering the indoor office environment.</p><p>An essential requirement of office workers&#x02019; performance and productivity improvement is indoor environmental quality. The indoor room temperature and illumination are the most important vital factors that affect the performance of office workers. The thermal discomfort caused by elevated air temperature had affected the performance of office workers. Indoor environmental quality has influence on the office workers Performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The office workers spend 90% of the time in indoor environment. Indoor room environment has direct relation with the office worker&#x02019;s health and well-being. 10% of office worker&#x02019;s Performance may be increased by achieving the best indoor environmental quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The office workers had more negative emotions and had to use more effort to maintain performance under slightly warm or slightly cool environment conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Environmental factors have imperative role to play in the effectiveness of office workers. A neurobehavioral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] had been proposed to evaluate the effect of office indoor room temperature and illumination on the office worker&#x02019;s Performance. The NBT involves all the neurobehavioral functions such as emotion, perception, learning and memory, thinking and execution function. The performance of NBT decreased when the thermal condition in the indoor room was deviated from the neutral conditions. While comparing with neutral condition, the performance decreased at the slightly cool or slightly warm environment condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The productivity is one of the most important factor which can affect overall performance of any organization either small or entire nation. The Performance of call center workers has less Performance, when the temperature was above 25&#x000b0;C. Performance has been reduced to 2.4% per degree temperature increase between 21.9&#x000b0;C to 28.5&#x000b0;C. Similarly call center worker&#x02019;s Performance was reduced 5 &#x02013; 7% while the indoor room temperature exceeds 25&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Federspiel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] has measured the Performance of call center workers in the US. Within the comfort zone, varying the room temperature had no significant effect on Performance of the workers. Indoor room temperature at more than 25.4&#x000b0;C was affected the performance of office worker. During the high indoor room temperature, the lower work performance was shown by the office worker.</p><p>Charles et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] has stated that indoor air quality and thermal comfort are most important factors for the worker&#x02019;s performance, satisfaction and well-being. Poor office environmental conditions can affect the worker&#x02019;s visual discomfort and thermal discomfort. This may affect the health and well-being of workers. Very low and very high indoor room temperature and humidity can dissatisfy the workers and also create health problems. Air conditioned office aim to provide a thermally accepted environment for office worker&#x02019;s comfort and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Henri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] clearly explain that proper lighting was an important factor that influence on the Performance. The effect of increased or decreased illumination affects the performance, psychological and biological effect of workers. The employees preferred high illumination rather than low. Pilcher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] has reported that very hot and cold temperature conditions had effect on the performance of workers. These room temperatures have negative impact on a wide range of cognitive related task. In cold condition [10&#x000b0;C] the workers performance had decreased at an average of 13.91%. Similarly in hot condition [32.22&#x000b0;C], the performance had reduced at an average of 14.88%.</p><p>Hiroshi et.al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] has reported that the higher illumination has significant effect on the task performance of office workers Performance. More than 9% performance improvement was achieved in higher illumination. Parsons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] has stated that the study of workers response on environmental factors has an important role to play in office Performance. The thermal response of the body has consequences for the workers health, comfort and efficiency. As heat stress increases there would be an effect on mental performance. Similarly the effect of cold on human performance also have significant effect. Young S. Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] has explained that the indoor air quality enhance worker&#x02019;s job performance in enclosed private offices. Good indoor air quality and light have more significance on the performance of office workers.</p><p>Environmental factors have more related influence on performance of office workers. Good working environment is an essential requirement for the office workers. Indoor temperature, illumination are the factors which is affecting the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of an office. If IEQ affected in the office, the response of office workers will also be affected. This leads to the negative performance of office worker. So the Performance of office workers also decreased. The relation between indoor environmental factors on Performance of office worker is shown in the Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The study on indoor room temperature on the performance of workers has been studied by researchers. Similarly the effect of illumination also studied already. The combined effect of environmental factors such as temperature and illumination on the performance of office workers has to be studied. Hence indoor room temperature, illumination have been investigated in this paper.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><p>A field lab to emulate an office has been created. The experiment was carried out in the field lab (L &#x000d7; W &#x000d7; H&#x02009;=&#x02009;13 &#x000d7; 9 &#x000d7; 5&#x000a0;m) which has a controlled condition of indoor office environment. Ten voluntary participants (10 men) sat in the ergonomically designed VDT workstations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Each work station had a table, a chair, and a personal computer of equal configuration (Intel Pentium(R) dual CPU, E2200 @ 2.20&#x000a0;GHz processor 1&#x000a0;GB RAM). USB optical mouse and multimedia keyboard was connected with USB2.0 of the personal computer.

The field lab room temperature has been controlled by air conditioner. Temperature may be adjusted from 17&#x000b0;C to 28&#x000b0;C using the controls available in the air conditioner. Illumination has been controlled by regulator for focus mercury lamps and adjusting number of fluorescent lamp using on/off switch. By this way illumination may be adjusted from 500 lux to 1000 lux. The illumination level was tested at the work station&#x02019;s keyboard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten undergraduate engineering students were trained in the field lab and used as office workers. Participants are all of same age group (18&#x000a0;years old). Wages have been given to all participants at a fixed rate per hour. To increase the performance of the participants a financial appreciation was given depends on their performance. Among the participants, whoever completed the task in minimum duration with minimum error was given an incentive at the rate of double the wages. All the participants were advised to take rest during previous night. Before the commencement of the experiments the participants have given their consent for their participation. All procedures were approved by the institutional ethics committee of Sri Balaji Chockalingam Engineering College, Arni, Tiruvannamalai District, Tamilnadu, India.</p><p>All participants in the field lab sat as per the schedule shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

It may further be noted that the indoor room temperature has more significant effect than either independent or combined effect of illumination. From this, it may be concluded that the impact of indoor room temperature is more on the office worker&#x02019;s performance than the effect of illumination. Block effect of the error response was more contribution on office worker&#x02019;s performance. While considering the reaction time response, the block effect has very low contribution. But the block effects of both the responses Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> have significant effect.</p><p>From this, we can understand that the volunteers are more concentrate to do the NBT in short duration. So that reaction time response has less contribution of block effect obtained from this experiment. They were not cared about the errors. So the block effect was more in error response analysis. More over some of the volunteers were not wasting for thinking answer for unknown question in their test duration. They responded immediately to answer any one from the given choice. All the volunteers were completed the task before the time limit. But some of the volunteers had done more error in NBT. For this reason the block effect was more in error output response. The optimum level of this two factors (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub> ie., 21&#x000b0;C, 1000lux ) may improve the health and performance of office workers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>KV carried out the experimental study in Neurobehavioral Test.
