Health conditions that could be ameliorated with physical activity are particularly common in older people. One in three people aged 65&#x000a0;years and over fall at least once annually, often resulting in significant injuries and ongoing disability. These problems need to be urgently addressed as the population proportion of older people is rapidly rising.

Physical inactivity is particularly common in older age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Experiencing a fall in older age is also a significant and common public health issue that can result in substantial injury and ongoing disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At least one third of people aged 65&#x000a0;years and over fall once or more annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews show that well-designed, structured exercise programs are effective in preventing falls in community-dwelling older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exercise is most effective if it challenges balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, exercise interventions found to be effective for falls prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have not generally been of a high enough dose to ensure participants also meet physical activity recommendations and obtain broader health benefits. Furthermore, several intervention programs aimed at increasing physical activity levels among older people have actually increased falls. A trial by Ebrahim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] involving 165 women with a history of recent upper limb fracture found that a brisk outdoor walking program significantly increased fall rates. Similarly in a large-scale trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1089) conducted by Lawton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] among women aged 40&#x02013;75 years, physical activity prescription with telephone support successfully increased physical activity levels but also increased falls (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and injuries (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). These results suggest that physical activity programs for older adults should include fall prevention components.</p><p>This trial aims to establish the impact of a physical activity and fall prevention intervention compared to an advice brochure on older people&#x02019;s physical activity levels, mobility-related goal attainment, fall rates, quality of life, fear of falling, mood and mobility limitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>We will conduct a randomised controlled trial.

Participants will be instructed to wear the accelerometer on the right hip, attached via an adjustable elastic belt, for 7 consecutive days during waking hours (except during water-based activities or bathing). Activity counts per second will be collected at a sampling frequency of 30Hz and reintegrated to 60-second epochs for data analysis. The mean counts/minute/day <italic>ActiGraph</italic> measure will be computed as the total counts accumulated in a valid day divided by the wear time of that day. To be considered as a valid day for analysis, <italic>ActiGraph</italic> wear time must include 10&#x000a0;hours or more. Periods of 90-minutes or more of consecutive zeros (indicating non-use) will be considered as non-wear time. Accelerometer data will be manually checked against participant diaries/calendars to verify wear time and erroneous data will be excluded prior to analysis. Physical activity participation will be assessed at both six and 12&#x000a0;months after participant randomisation, and <italic>ActiGraph</italic> data will be extracted by a research assistant who is unaware of group assignment (i.e. blinded outcome assessment).</p><p>Two mobility-related goals will be established at baseline by all participants using the GAS with assistance from a research assistant or health coach. Once the goals are agreed upon the research assistant or health coach and participant will then predict the GAS outcomes on a five-point scale ranging from &#x02212;2 to +2, where a score of 0 indicates achievement of the set goal, a score of &#x02212;1 indicates no change from the baseline level of ability for that goal type, &#x02212;2 indicates worse performance than at baseline and +1 and +2 indicate &#x02018;somewhat better&#x02019; and &#x02018;much better&#x02019; performance than the set goal, respectively.</p><p>Attainment of the agreed mobility-related goals will be assessed at both six and 12&#x000a0;months after participant randomisation by a research assistant who is unaware of group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcomes will be: falls, recorded with monthly postal calendars over a period of 12&#x000a0;months; the proportion of people meeting the physical activity guidelines of 150&#x000a0;minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (intensity defined using the Freedson equation of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1952 counts/minute from the <italic>Actigraph</italic> to permit comparisons with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and we will also examine this outcome using a cut point of 1040 counts/minute which is calibrated to detect MVPA (i.e., &#x02265; 3.7 METs) in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]); quality of life, assessed with the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; fear of falling, assessed using the short-form Falls Efficacy Scale International [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; mood, assessed with the positive subscale of the Positive Affect Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; mobility limitation, assessed using the Late Life Function and Disability Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All secondary outcomes will be measured at both 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after randomisation with the exception of falls, which will only be measured at 12&#x000a0;months after randomisation. The intervention group will also complete a brief survey of barriers and enablers to ongoing physical activity participation at the 6&#x000a0;month time point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Analysis of outcomes</title><p>Accelerometer data will be analysed using <italic>ActiLife 6</italic> software. Acceptable wear time will be set a priori and defined as 4&#x000a0;days or more of 10&#x000a0;hours or more per day. General linear models will be used to assess the effect of group allocation on the continuously-scored primary (average physical activity counts per minute) and secondary outcome measures (quality of life, fear of falling, mood, mobility limitation), at both six and 12&#x000a0;months after randomisation, after adjusting for baseline scores.</p><p>Between-group differences in mobility-related goal attainment, at both six and 12&#x000a0;months after randomisation, will be analysed with ordinal regression. To aid interpretation of the GAS, the scores will also be dichotomised (goal met versus goal not met), and odds ratios calculated.</p><p>The number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression models to estimate the between-group difference in fall rates after one year (secondary outcome). Modified Poisson regression models will be used to compare groups on dichotomous outcome measures (proportion of fallers, proportion meeting physical activity guidelines). All analyses will be pre-planned, conducted while masked to group allocation and will use an intention-to-treat approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size justification</title><p>A total of 130 participants (65 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a 15% between-group difference in the primary physical activity outcome (i.e., a between-group difference of 35 mean counts per minute during wear time, standard deviation of 91), a dropout rate of 15% and alpha of 5%. The estimates of mean accelerometer counts per minute for this calculation were taken from the 263 community dwelling USA-based women aged 65 and older in a large sample of accelerometer data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We took a conservative approach and estimated the proportion of dropouts at 15% although our previous trials have had lower dropout rates. These calculations were undertaken in Stata 12 using the sampsi command, assuming a 0.7 correlation between measures and assuming a post-test between-group comparison that adjusted for baseline scores.</p><p>A sample size of 130 will also provide 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful 20% between-group difference in goal attainment scores. The sample size will also be sufficient to detect between-group differences in the order of 10-15% for the secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial protocol has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia (approval number 2013/789). The results of this trial will be disseminated via peer reviewed journal articles, presentations at international conferences and participants newsletters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is highly significant given the dual importance of falls and inactivity for individuals and health care systems. Public health recommendations for older adults highlight the need to engage in a combination of aerobic, muscle strength, flexibility and balance activities. This trial is the first to offer an integrated strategy that can fulfil this goal. Population surveys of older adults indicate very low participation in fall prevention balance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] with the vast majority engaged in aerobic physical activity, such as walking, but this has not been demonstrated to prevent falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Hence, this trial will address a key gap in the current evidence regarding physical activity and fall prevention for older people. It will provide a model for an integrated falls and physical activity assessment and intervention program that could be directly implemented within Australian health services. The trial findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and through scientific and professional conferences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>
