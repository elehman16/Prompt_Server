However, when a single dose of plerixafor is administered at a conventional 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, approximately one-third of donors will fail to mobilize the minimally acceptable dose of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells needed for allogeneic transplantation. We conducted an open-label, randomized trial to assess the safety and activity of high-dose (480 &#x003bc;g/kg) plerixafor in CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization in healthy donors. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a high dose or a conventional dose (240 &#x003bc;g/kg) of plerixafor, given as a single subcutaneous injection, in a two-sequence, two-period, crossover design. Each treatment period was separated by a 2-week minimum washout period. The primary endpoint was the peak CD34<sup>+</sup> count in the blood, with secondary endpoints of CD34<sup>+</sup> cell area under the curve (AUC), CD34<sup>+</sup> count at 24 hours, and time to peak CD34<sup>+</sup> following the administration of plerixafor. We randomized 23 subjects to the two treatment sequences and 20 subjects received both doses of plerixafor. Peak CD34<sup>+</sup> count in the blood was significantly increased (mean 32.2 <italic>versus</italic> 27.8 cells/&#x003bc;L, <italic>P</italic>=0.0009) and CD34<sup>+</sup> cell AUC over 24 hours was significantly increased (mean 553 <italic>versus</italic> 446 h cells/&#x003bc;L, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) following the administration of the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor compared with the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose. Remarkably, of seven subjects who mobilized poorly (peak CD34<sup>+</sup> &#x02264;20 cells/&#x003bc;L) after the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor, six achieved higher peak CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers and all achieved higher CD34<sup>+</sup> AUC over 24 hours after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose. No grade 3 or worse drug-related adverse events were observed. This study establishes that high-dose plerixafor can be safely administered in healthy donors and mobilizes greater numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells than conventional-dose plerixafor, which may improve CD34<sup>+</sup> graft yields and reduce the number of apheresis procedures needed to collect sufficient stem cells for allogeneic transplantation.

These donors, conventionally classified as poor mobilizers, are less likely to have a single apheresis that yields at least 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg<sup><xref rid="b14-1020600" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b22-1020600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and would require one or more additional injections of plerixafor or additional apheresis procedures to collect an adequate number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Determining the most efficacious dose of plerixafor in healthy donors would improve allograft CD34<sup>+</sup> cell yields and reduce the number of apheresis procedures. Initial phase I studies suggested that peak CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization occurred at the highest administered dose of 240 &#x003bc;g/kg plerixafor.<sup><xref rid="b10-1020600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In a recent dose escalation study, we reported that a single 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor is safe and effective in mobilizing CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.<sup><xref rid="b16-1020600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, that study enrolled only a limited number of subjects and did not randomize the order of dosing, thus its design was inadequate to determine whether the efficacy of CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization was improved with high-dose plerixafor.</p><p>Therefore, to evaluate whether high-dose plerixafor is more efficient in mobilizing CD34<sup>+</sup> stem cells compared to conventional-dose plerixafor, we conducted the current study that utilized a randomized crossover trial design with over 95% power to compare CD34<sup>+</sup> mobilization in subjects mobilized with a single dose of plerixafor of either 480 &#x003bc;g/kg or 240 &#x003bc;g/kg. We observed that peak circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers, circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers at 24 h, and the CD34<sup>+</sup> cell AUC over 24 h were, on average, all significantly higher following the administration of 480 &#x003bc;g/kg compared to 240 &#x003bc;g/kg of plerixafor. Remarkably, the peak circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> counts were higher in 16 of 20 of subjects following the administration of plerixafor 480 &#x003bc;g/kg compared to plerixafor 240 &#x003bc;g/kg. Perhaps most importantly, improvements in CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization with high-dose plerixafor were most pronounced in those who were poor mobilizers with conventional-dose plerixafor. In this context, all seven subjects who mobilized poorly with plerixafor 240 &#x003bc;g/kg achieved a significantly higher CD34<sup>+</sup> AUC after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose (relative increase 36%) and six of seven (86%) had higher peak CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers (relative increase 28%) following high-dose plerixafor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1020600">Figure 4</xref> and <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>). These increases represented relative improvements of 27% and 30% in AUC over an optimal 4-h and 6-h collection time, respectively, after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose. This difference would be expected to make a significant clinical impact as those who would mobilize poorly and subsequently fail to yield enough CD34<sup>+</sup> cells at the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose would be more likely to mobilize an adequate number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells at the higher 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor. We noted high-dose plerixafor was well-tolerated in the 22 subjects who received this agent, and was not associated with treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events of grade 3 or higher. Although the absolute number of grade 2 adverse events was slightly higher in subjects who received the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose than in those who received the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, there was no significant difference in the severity and overall incidence of adverse events between subjects receiving high-dose and conventional-dose plerixafor. Most adverse events were mild, transient, and resolved without treatment.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we compared CD34<sup>+</sup> mobilization in the peripheral blood without performing an apheresis procedure. However, numerous reports have shown that the number of circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in peripheral blood correlates strongly with CD34<sup>+</sup> graft yield and predicts the number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that will be collected during apheresis.<sup><xref rid="b21-1020600" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1020600" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-1020600" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Achieving higher peak circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers and a higher circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> AUC are clinically important outcomes that would be expected to improve the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells collected during apheresis procedures. The target for collection for unmanipulated allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cells is frequently 5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg recipient body weight with a minimally acceptable number of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg.<sup><xref rid="b23-1020600" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25-1020600" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Most collection centers do not have real-time information on the number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells mobilized in individual subjects at the time the apheresis collection is initiated. In this context, apheresis volumes are fixed, and in subjects who mobilize poorly, often fail to collect an adequate number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells needed for transplantation. Utilization of higher-dose plerixafor would likely increase the probability that the target dose of CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells can be successfully collected following a single apheresis procedure. It is important to consider that the efficiency with which CD34<sup>+</sup> cells are collected directly affects the yield of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in apheresis collections. At our center, CD34<sup>+</sup> cell efficiencies typically average between 30&#x02013;40%, which is consistent with reports from other apheresis centers.<sup><xref rid="b24-1020600" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Based on a validated formula<sup><xref rid="b24-1020600" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the within-subject comparison data in this study (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3A</italic>), for a 24 liter apheresis processing volume, a recipient with a 70 kg body weight, and a 30% collection efficiency, 7/20 (35%) poor mobilizers would be predicted to fail to yield the minimally acceptable 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg after a 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor while only 3/20 (15%) of those donors would fail to mobilize adequately after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg of plerixafor. With a higher collection efficiency of 35&#x02013;40%, 2/20 (10%) donors would still fail to yield a minimally acceptable CD34<sup>+</sup> number following the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, while all of the 20 donors would be expected to have an adequate CD34<sup>+</sup> cell collection after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose. Importantly, regardless of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cell collection efficiency, the proportion of donors achieving a minimally acceptable apheresis collection would predictably be higher across the spectrum of apheresis volumes typically processed following stem cell mobilization (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3B</italic>). Furthermore, the total number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells collected following apheresis would be expected to be 20% greater after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose than after the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, with higher percentages of donors yielding grafts containing both &#x0003e;2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> and &#x0003e;5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg across typical collection efficiencies and volumes. These differences are clinically meaningful and could be the determining factor obviating the need to proceed with a second apheresis collection. For cost, donor safety and improved collection efficiency, a single collection is preferable to multiple collections, even if the duration of the procedure needs to be extended.<sup><xref rid="b26-1020600" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1020600" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Interestingly, in our study we observed that the time to achieve a higher peak peripheral CD34<sup>+</sup> count was, on average, 2 h longer after high-dose plerixafor. Compared to the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, the mean CD34<sup>+</sup> counts in the circulation remained significantly higher between 8 and 24 h after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1020600">Figure 3</xref>). These differences may be the consequence of altered pharmacokinetics that are observed with high-dose plerixafor, as we previously showed the plerixafor C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were higher after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose than after the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose.<sup><xref rid="b16-1020600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Therefore, should a decision be made to utilize a higher dose of plerixafor to mobilize an allograft, this delay in peak circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells would need to be factored into decisions related to the timing of apheresis procedures to optimize progenitor cell yield. Assuming cell harvesting is scheduled for 08:00, a 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor would optimally be administered 8 h (24:00) the night before the apheresis procedure to allow for a collection that spans the time when CD34<sup>+</sup> cells are peaking in the circulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1020600">Figure 3B</xref>, the sustained increase in circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells during the 8 to 24 h after high-dose plerixafor is administered would also provide advantages should circumstances lead to an unforeseen delay in initiating the apheresis collection. In this context, given these altered mobilization kinetics, an adequate CD34<sup>+</sup> cell yield could still be collected even if the procedure was delayed 10 to 14 h after the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor had been administered.</p><p>Despite a significant increase in all measures of peripherally circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell counts following the administration of the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor, we found no difference between conventional-dose or high-dose plerixafor with respect to mobilized CFU-E or CFU-GM measured from peripheral blood samples. This lack of observed difference was likely due to the fact that blood samples for this analysis were collected 6 h after plerixafor administration, which was found, retrospectively from this study, to be a time-point when circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers were similar between both dose cohorts, as opposed to later time-points when the number of circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells was significantly higher in the blood following high-dose plerixafor administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1020600">Figure 3B</xref>). In our study, the enhanced efficacy of high-dose plerixafor on CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization was not affected by the donor&#x02019;s age. The median age of the study subjects was 31 years (range, 19&#x02013;48) and age, when analyzed in a multivariate analysis, did not correlate significantly with CD34<sup>+</sup> cell mobilization. Besides CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, we and others have reported that neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, and T cells are also mobilized with plerixafor.<sup><xref rid="b22-1020600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In this study, we also noted that total white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were significantly higher in the circulation over time following administration of the 480 &#x003bc;g/kg dose of plerixafor compared with the 240 &#x003bc;g/kg dose.</p><p>Recent data from our group have shown that alterations in T-cell phenotype and cytokine gene expression profiles characteristic of G-CSF mobilization do not occur after mobilization with plerixafor.<sup><xref rid="b22-1020600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> G-CSF mobilization has been shown to skew T cells toward a Th-2 type phenotype, which may increase the incidence of chronic graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease when G-CSF-mobilized allografts are used compared with bone marrow transplants.<sup><xref rid="b28-1020600" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-1020600" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In contrast, T cells mobilized with plerixafor do not display any changes in Th-1, Th-2, or Th-3 type cytokines compared to non-mobilized T cells. Recent studies of murine allogeneic transplantation models have also shown that the incidence of graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease may differ in recipients of allo-grafts mobilized with plerixafor alone or plerixafor plus G-CSF compared to G-CSF alone.<sup><xref rid="b22-1020600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b31-1020600" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> These data suggest that T-cell-mediated events which occur after allogeneic transplantation may differ depending on whether donor allografts are mobilized with plerixafor or G-CSF. Given that high-dose plerixafor mobilized even greater numbers of lymphocytes than did conventional-dose plerixafor, it is possible that graft-<italic>versus</italic>-tumor effects, immune reconstitution, graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease, and other variables affected by engrafting donor lymphoid cells could also differ in recipients of allogeneic transplants mobilized with high-dose <italic>versus</italic> conventional-dose plerixafor.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that high-dose plerixafor can be administered safely and is superior to conventional-dose plerixafor in mobilizing CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in healthy donors. The enhanced mobilizing effect of high-dose plerixafor was most evident in subjects who had the greatest need for this effect, namely those who mobilized poorly with conventional-dose plerixafor. Our data suggest that mobilization of allogeneic stem cell donors with high-dose plerixafor would improve the chances of using a single apheresis procedure to collect a sufficient number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells for allo-grafting and would likely result in graft collections containing higher CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers compared to those of donors mobilized with conventional-dose plerixafor. Our findings warrant further studies to explore the clinical impact of high-dose plerixafor use for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health.
