The use of multiple lines of therapy is limited by emergence of resistance and development of cumulative toxicities. As recognized by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, tolerability is a critical determinant of the clinical value of new cancer drugs (Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). For this reason, there is a growing need to more closely scrutinize the safety profiles of drugs in late stage clinical development, particularly when improvements in efficacy are relatively modest.</p><p>Etirinotecan pegol (EP) is a novel, long-acting topoisomerase-1 inhibitor designed to improve the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the prodrug irinotecan. Etirinotecan pegol contains a large-chain polyethylene glycol (PEG) core and four irinotecan molecules that are attached via a cleavable ester-based linker (Hoch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). Pegylation facilitates accumulation of the molecule in tumor tissue through the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, demonstrated in an animal model by high and sustained tumor exposure to SN38 after EP administration (Hoch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). Slow hydrolysis of the linker also alters the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, resulting in prolonged exposure to its active metabolite, SN38. The mean half-life of SN38 was extended from 2&#x000a0;days with conventional irinotecan to 50&#x000a0;days with EP in a phase 1 trial (Von Hoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Jameson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Early clinical studies showed EP to be active and generally well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors, including MBC (Von Hoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Jameson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Awada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). A randomized phase 2 study that assessed two schedules of EP (145&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 14 or 21&#x000a0;days) in patients with previously treated MBC demonstrated considerable antitumor activity (objective response rate, 29&#x000a0;%, including two complete responses) (Awada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). The every 3-week schedule was selected for further clinical development based on the clinical data, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability demonstrated in this trial.</p><p>The randomized phase 3 BEACON (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102; registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01492101) study was designed to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with heavily pretreated, locally recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer treated with EP given every 3&#x000a0;weeks or a single-agent treatment of physician&#x02019;s choice (TPC), a control arm that allowed investigators to choose one of seven commonly used cytotoxic drugs (Perez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). Median OS was numerically longer in the EP arm (12.4 vs. 10.3&#x000a0;months), but this difference was not statistically significant [hazard ratio (HR), 0.87; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) 0.75&#x02013;1.02; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.084]. EP was associated with survival improvements (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) relative to TPC in important, pre-defined subgroups with poor prognoses such as patients with liver metastases at baseline (median OS 10.9 vs. 8.3&#x000a0;months, respectively; HR 0.73) and those with stable, pre-treated brain metastasis at study entry (median OS 10.0 vs. 4.8&#x000a0;months, respectively; HR 0.51). Adverse event profiles differed between treatment arms, with a higher incidence of diarrhea reported among EP-treated patients and higher rates of neutropenia and neuropathy reported for TPC. We now report a more detailed analysis of the safety and tolerability of EP relative to TPC from the BEACON study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>BEACON was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial conducted in 11 countries (Perez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). Briefly, eligible patients were adults with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 for whom single-agent chemotherapy for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer was indicated. Eligible patients had received a minimum of two prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced disease and no more than five for breast cancer in any setting. Prior treatment with an anthracycline (unless contraindicated or not medically appropriate), a taxane and capecitabine was required. Patients with stable brain metastases were eligible, provided that local therapy was complete without ongoing need for corticosteroids.</p><p>Patients were randomized (1:1) to EP or a control arm (TPC) comprising one of seven commercially available chemotherapy drugs: eribulin, ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel or <italic>nab</italic>-paclitaxel. Etirinotecan pegol was administered at a dose of 145&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 21&#x000a0;days as a 90-min infusion. TPC was administered according to local practice, with the exceptions of eribulin and ixabepilone, which were administered in accordance with local product labeling.</p><p>All adverse events (AEs) were assessed with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. For TPC, dose delays, reductions, and discontinuations for AEs were made according to the prescribing information or local practice guidelines, and supportive care was administered at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion. Dose modifications and specific supportive care regimens were defined in the protocol for EP. Prior to subsequent cycles, patients had to have adequate hematopoietic function; full resolution of diarrhea to grade 0 for at least 7&#x000a0;days without supportive antidiarrheal measures; and resolution of grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities to grade &#x02264;1. Required dose reductions for specific toxicities are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; dose re-escalation was not allowed. Treatment could be delayed for up to 28&#x000a0;days to allow for recovery from toxicity. Patients who required treatment delays of &#x0003e;28&#x000a0;days were withdrawn from treatment, unless, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion and approved by the medical monitor, study continuation was deemed of benefit for the patient. Loperamide was dispensed to all patients randomized to EP at treatment start, with instruction to initiate therapy at first onset of diarrhea or loose stool and continue until resolution. Prophylactic anti-diarrheal medications were prohibited. Other supportive care measures were administered at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Protocol-defined dose modifications for etirinotecan pegol in subsequent cycles based on worst toxicity in prior cycle</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Adverse event by NCI CTCAE grade</th><th align="left">Dose modification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Hematologic (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Grade 1&#x02013;2 (except ANC)</td><td align="left">Maintain dose level</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Grade 2 (ANC &#x0003c;1500/mm<sup>3</sup>)</td><td align="left">First occurrence</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">&#x02022; Hold until ANC &#x0003e;1500/mm<sup>3</sup>

Summary statistics were prepared for the safety population, which comprises all patients who received at least one full or partial dose of assigned treatment. The treatment-emergent period was defined as the time between the first dose of study drug through 30&#x000a0;days after the last dose of study drug or the day prior to initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurred first. A TEAE was defined as an AE that was not present prior to treatment, but appeared following treatment or was present at treatment initiation and worsened during treatment. An AE that was present at treatment initiation, but resolved and then reappeared while the patient was on treatment, was also considered a TEAE, regardless of baseline intensity. A TESAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolonged a hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; was a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or was an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, jeopardized the patient and required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes that comprises an SAE. Odds ratio (OR) and exact confidence limits were calculated for AEs that occurred in at least 10&#x000a0;% of patients in the safety population. The time to onset of events was calculated from the first dose of the study treatment. Time to resolution was calculated from the onset date to the resolution date, death date, or date of start of new anti-cancer therapy. Because incidence rates are low in AEs of Special Interest, descriptive statistics were summarized based on patients who had the event or who had a resolution date when calculating time to onset and time to resolution of AEs of Special Interest.</p><p>The study was conducted according to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice standards, US Food and Drug Administration regulations, as well as any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws and regulations.

More patients in the TPC arm experienced at least one grade &#x02265;3 TEAE (70.4 vs. 50&#x000a0;% in the EP arm; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Grade &#x02265;3 diarrhea occurred in 5.9 and 3.7&#x000a0;% of patients in the EP and TPC arms, respectively, and rates of grade &#x02265;3 neutropenia were 14.7 and 33.3&#x000a0;%, respectively. Diarrhea was more common in the EP arm (55.9 vs. 18.5&#x000a0;% for TPC). Neuropathy-related events were more common in the TPC arm (25.6 vs. 7.8&#x000a0;% for EP).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This detailed comparison of the safety and tolerability of EP relative to TPC in the randomized phase 3 BEACON study demonstrates that EP is generally well tolerated, produces significantly fewer grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and does not share overlapping toxicities with commonly used MBC single-agent therapies, including eribulin. Fewer patients in the EP arm experienced a dose delay or dose reduction due to AEs, and median relative dose intensity was higher than in the TPC arm. The development of AEs can limit treatment exposure, jeopardize a patient&#x02019;s likelihood of achieving maximal therapeutic benefit, and adversely affect QOL. The relatively favorable tolerability profile of EP in BEACON, coupled with statistically superior global health status and physical functioning in corresponding QOL analyses, is likely to translate into a clinically meaningful benefit for heavily pretreated patients with MBC (Cortes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). In the context of the efficacy seen in the BEACON study, especially in certain patient subgroups, these data re-inforce the potential utility of EP in the treatment of women with MBC.</p><p>The safety profile of EP is consistent with expectations for a pegylated version of irinotecan. The clinical utility of conventional irinotecan is limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetics. When given intravenously at conventional doses, irinotecan produces relatively high peak plasma concentrations that are believed to be responsible for the cholinergic reactions, significant myelosuppression, and early-onset diarrhea seen in clinical practice (Kehrer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>; Masi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Takimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>; Herben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>). Additionally, the short terminal half-lives of the parent compound (9&#x02013;14&#x000a0;h) and active metabolite (24&#x02013;47&#x000a0;h) result in undetectable plasma levels of these cell-cycle specific agents within 1&#x000a0;week of administration (Kehrer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>; Chabot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>; Pitot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>). A 21-day dosing interval therefore results in relatively short, intermittent tumor exposure to SN38 and peak plasma levels associated with toxicity. EP was specifically engineered to produce continuous exposure to SN38 without the high peak plasma levels (Hoch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Jameson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). As expected, the incidence of neutropenia in BEACON was numerically lower in the EP arm than in the TPC arm, and neutropenic events appeared to be less severe. Approximately one-quarter of EP-treated patients developed neutropenia, and more than half of the cases were grade 1&#x02013;2 in severity. The rates of grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia were relatively low in the EP arm (9.6&#x000a0;%) compared to the TPC arm (30.6&#x000a0;%), and fewer patients in the EP arm required growth factor support. A greater proportion of EP-treated patients discontinued treatment due to neutropenia; there were, however, specific, protocol-mandated guidelines for managing neutropenia in the EP arm that likely contributed to differential discontinuation rates. Notably, the median time to onset of grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia was substantially delayed with EP (120 vs. 16&#x000a0;days for TPC), demonstrating that patients were able to receive more courses of EP prior to the development of severe neutropenia relative to their counterparts in the TPC arm.</p><p>Diarrhea is a well-known side effect of irinotecan and, as expected, was relatively common among EP-treated patients in the BEACON trial. As with neutropenia, the time to onset of grade 3&#x02013;4 diarrhea was longer with EP than with TPC. Indeed, this protracted time to diarrhea onset is consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of EP, which eliminates the high peak plasma irinotecan concentrations associated with early-onset, cholinergic diarrhea. Strict protocol-mandated diarrhea management guidelines used in BEACON minimized the risk for grade &#x02265;3 diarrhea. These guidelines were developed based on safety data from phase 2 trials. In a phase 2 trial initiated without guidelines, the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 23&#x000a0;% in patients with MBC who received EP 145&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> given every 3&#x000a0;weeks (Awada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). In contrast, fewer than 10&#x000a0;% of EP-treated patients in BEACON experienced grade 3 diarrhea, and none experienced a grade 4 or grade 5 event.</p><p>Six of the seven agents comprising the TPC treatment options were microtubule inhibitors, including eribulin, for which neuropathy is the primary toxicity concern. As expected, the incidence of neuropathy, a cumbersome side effect that interferes significantly with QOL, was higher in the TPC arm, and neuropathy was the most common cause for TPC drug discontinuation. The lack of clinically significant neuropathy with EP therefore provides an attractive alternative for patients with MBC who have experienced or are at increased risk for neuropathy in view of prior therapies.</p><p>In summary, the BEACON study demonstrated that EP produces clinically meaningful outcomes (Perez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>) with a manageable toxicity profile, resulting in an overall favorable risk/benefit ratio for patients with heavily pretreated MBC. The lack of substantial overlapping toxicities with other agents used in this setting suggests that EP could be used sequentially with or in lieu of agents with different safety profiles. Importantly, the favorable safety profile was maintained among patients with a history of brain metastases who appeared to gain particular benefit from EP, providing further support for on-going clinical development in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Study concepts: EAP; Study design: EAP, AA, JO&#x02019;S, HSR, CT, S-AI, LSS, UH, ALH, JC; Data acquisition: EAP, AA, JO&#x02019;S, HSR, CT, S-AI, JC; Quality control of data and algorithms: ALH, CT; Statistical analysis: CZ; Data analysis and interpretation, Manuscript preparation, Manuscript editing and Manuscript review: All authors.
