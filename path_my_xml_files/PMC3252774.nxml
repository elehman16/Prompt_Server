The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical care on quality of life (QOL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>A prospective study on impact of pharmaceutical care on QOL in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was conducted in a private tertiary care teaching hospital in South India for a period of 8 months. Study was done on 120 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled randomly in the intervention group (with pharmaceutical care teachings) or the control (without drug related educations). The intervention group patients received pharmaceutical care through diabetes education, medication counseling, instructions on lifestyle that needed modifications (necessary for better drug function) and dietary regulations regarding their prescribed drugs, whereas the control group patients were deprived of any pharmaceutical care till the end of the study. The &#x0201c;Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life&#x0201d; standard questionnaire was used to assess the relevant parameters (including: Fasting Blood Glucose, HbA1c, Body Mass Index) and to evaluate the impact of the pharmaceutical care on the subjects.

In 2007, diabetes caused 3.5 million deaths globally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 246 million adults worldwide have Diabetes mellitus. The incidence of diabetes is escalating to epidemic proportions and by 2025, the figure is expected to reach 380 million. Diabetes accounts for around 6% of total global mortality, with 50% of diabetes- associated deaths being attributed to cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>The diabetes pandemic is rapidly spreading and mostly affects developing countries like India. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas (2006) which was released at 19<sup>th</sup> World Diabetes Congress, there were an estimated 40.9 million people with diabetes in India and this number is predicted to rise to almost 70 million by 2025.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The countries with the largest number of diabetic people will be India, China and USA by 2030.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>Diabetes mellitus has become an international healthcare crisis that requires new approaches to prevent and treat it. In many parts of the developing world, low birth weight and maternal malnutrition during pregnancy may be a major factor underlying the insulin resistance syndrome and thus in an increased risk of diabetes in the later life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Diabetes is a disease that desperately needs more pharmacist involvement. Pharmacists who are specialized in this growing chronic condition can make a significant, positive impact on the patient, the health care system and themselves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Pharmaceutical care and the expanded role of pharmacist are associated with many positive diabetes-related outcomes, including improved clinical measures, improved patient and provider satisfaction, and improved cost management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>Health-care professionals are becoming increasingly aware of the need to assess and monitor the quality of life (QOL) as an important outcome of diabetes care. The QOL is an important outcome on its own right and, because it may influence in the patient's self-care activities, may consequently impact their diabetes control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Pharmaceutical care is the direct, responsible provision of medication-related care with the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient's quality of life. It is also the determination of the drug needs for a given individual and the provision of not only the required drug, also the necessary services (before, during or after treatment) to ensure the optimally safe and effective drug therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Many pharmaceutical care programs have been established in various countries to enhance clinical outcomes and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL). These programs were implemented by pharmacists, with the cooperation of the physicians and other health care professionals. However, such programs are not very common in the Indian scenario. The community pharmacist is a professional with knowledge of medicines and health care and is easily accessible to patients throughout the day. The pharmacist can, therefore, in collaboration with physicians and other health care professionals, contribute to the improvement of diabetic patients&#x02019; quality of life by informing and educating patients, answering their questions and, at the same time, monitoring the treatment they receive and carrying out their own assessments of the patients&#x02019; health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the role of pharmaceutical care on the quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in our medical setting (a Private Tertiary Care Hospital) in South India.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective, control versus intervention group clinical trial was conducted in the general medicine department of a 550 bedded multi specialty tertiary care teaching hospital, located at Coimbatore, in the south of India from May 2009 through December 2009 (8 months). The main endpoint outcome of this study was improvement in the Quality of Life in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus and in their clinical parameters such as Fasting Blood Sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, and BMI. The target population for this study were Indian diabetic (Type 2) patients in Tamil Nadu province and all adult (Age&#x0003e;18 years) men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the main reason for the hospital visit, with or without other diseases, who gave informed consent and had sufficient English literacy (at least high school educated) to answer the questionnaire. Pregnant women, mentally incompetent patients and critically ill patients were excluded from the study. Eligible patients were included in the study using the convenient sampling method and on the basis of their medical visits.</p><p>Permission to carry out the study was obtained from the hospital authorities and concerned Physicians after submitting the study protocol. Patients were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Patients were briefed on the study through the Patient Information Form and there after the written informed consent were obtained.</p><p>A total of 165 patients were interviewed during the study period. Out of which 120 participants met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. At their first visit, the patients were randomly allocated to the intervention group or to the control group using random number table. Randomization was stratified by age, sex and duration of diabetes (60 patients in each group). All data concerning general medical history and specific diabetes history were collected by using customized Data entry forms for I.P and O.P separately which were specially developed for the study.</p><p>Bradley's questionnaire was used, the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQOL),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> which is designed to measure an individual's perception of the impact of diabetes on their quality of life, was called. The questionnaire was content and cultural validated and tested for reliability for the new language (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79) by using standard methods which will be described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Prior written permission was obtained from the developer of the questionnaire (Dr. Claire Bradley). All patients were asked to answer the prevalidated QOL questionnaire and the treatment satisfaction questionnaire.</p><p>The design of the questionnaire included 18 life domain specific items and 2 overview items to be scored between -9 to +9 which diabetes are affected by. The questionnaire took approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p><p>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> was used, to measure the patients&#x02019; satisfaction with diabetes treatment. It is consisted of six item scales assessing treatment satisfaction and two items assessing perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The DTSQ items are scored on a scale from 6 to 0. Individual satisfaction with the treatment items (items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) were considered separately. The higher the score, the greater the satisfaction gained with each aspect of the treatment. Item 2 and item 3 were, perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively. Here the lower score indicated the blood glucose level closer to the ideal. The higher score indicated a problem. The questionnaire took approximately 10 minutes to complete and the whole process of validation and testing the reliability of the questionnaire were completed for its usage in a new language as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></p><p>Controlling the blood glucose was assessed using fasting blood glucose measurements recorded during the baseline, second and the final interview with the patients. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a measure of the average control of blood glucose, over the three previous months was also assessed. Both parameters were analyzed using an ordinary calibrated biochemical auto analyzer located in the hospital laboratory of. With regards to HbA<sub>1c</sub>, individuals were categorized according to the targets from the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management in Canada.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Similarly, the patients&#x02019;blood pressure and weight were recorded in every visit which had an interval of 3 months. The weight was monitored to determine the body mass index(BMI).An ideal body mass index of 18.5-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a systolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 130 mmHg was recommended.</p><p>Patients in the intervention group received the pharmaceutical care which included medication counseling, instructions on dietary regulation, exercise and other lifestyle modifications, while the control group patients did not receive any pharmaceutical care till the end of the study.</p><p>The pharmaceutical care provided by the pharmacist was documented in the forms designed for the purpose. The patient information leaflet, diabetic diet chart (prepared in English and Tamil in discussion with the chief dietician of the study hospital) and Diabetic Diary were also provided to the intervention group in order to provide better counseling.</p><p>Pharmacist followed the patient's progress with follow up visits and phone calls and the patient's progress was recorded. Attempts were also made to have all the participants repeat the completion of the ADDQOL questionnaire during the final interview. The interventions made in this study are described in detail in the result section in order to enable utilization of the experience by others.</p><p>The paired t-student test was used for intra-group analysis (baseline and final scores) and the t-student test was also used for inter-group analysis using the SPSS 14.0 for Windows software. P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as the statistically significant level.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The age range of the participants in both groups was between 32 to 85 years old.

The results of the study demonstrated that the intervention group which was provided with the pharmaceutical care reported overall excellent diabetes related quality of life. Patients were satisfied with their treatment, felt little affected due to their disease, and rarely worried about the negative consequences their diabetes. Furthermore, several clinical parameters correlated well with the quality of life. Patients who were more satisfied with their current treatment tend to have better glycemic and blood pressure control. Most studies addressed humanistic outcomes in the form of HRQOL. These patients have consistently reported lower scores when assessed compared to both healthy patients and those with other chronic diseases. Several studies have acknowledged the importance of pharmacist providing counseling for diabetes patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>The present study showed an improvement in diabetes- specific health related quality of life using ADDQOL and the DTSQ's questionnaire which was contented and culturally validated for use in Indian population. In this study, the patients with diabetes mellitus who were managed by a clinical pharmacist had significantly lower blood glucose and HbA1c levels compared to the baseline. Significant changes in the quality of life and diabetes treatment satisfaction score of the diabetes patients can be obtained by providing long term pharmacists managed diabetic care services. Improvement in the intervention group was especially noted with decrease in concern of future, worries, and living condition domain of the patients.
