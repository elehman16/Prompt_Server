However, whether LA or OA is the best procedure for patients suffering from acute appendicitis still remains unclear.</p><p id="p0015">In this retrospective study, we compared the treatment outcomes and perioperative clinical factors of LA and OA performed in our department to determine the best procedure for appendectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Patient population and selection</title><p id="p0020">We retrospectively analyzed 185 Japanese patients who were diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent LA or OA, and their operational outcomes, from January 2010 to January 2016. In total 185 patients with appendicitis defined as a phlegmonous, gangrenous transformation of the appendix, or perforation of the appendiceal wall (macroscopic or microscopically proven by histological report), were included in this retrospective study.</p><p id="p0025">Prior to surgery all patients were subjected to clinical examination and blood and urine screening. In all of patients, plain computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted to ensure correct diagnosis. Same patients received non-surgical treatment before surgery because most of the patients did not have remarkable abdominal pain at the time of outpatient clinic. After the onset of acute appendicitis, a case requiring more than 7 days until surgery was defined as interval appendectomy.</p><p id="p0030">Prior to surgery each patient was given intravenous single shot antibiotic treatment consisting of a first-generation cephalosporin, and in cases of perforation, gangrene, and/or abscess formation, second-generation cephalosporin was added.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>LA and OA procedure</title><p id="p0035">All operations were performed by a team of two surgeons who were experienced in the open as well as the laparoscopic approach. Three ports were inserted in LA G, one 10-mm port (camera port) in umbilicus at first and two 5-mm ports in right lower quadrant and suprapubic portion, respectively. The mesoappendix was cut with SonoSurg (Olympus Corporation, Japan) and the appendiceal stump was closed with endoloop (Ethicon, USA). If patients need to convert from LA to OA, we prepared a laparotomy at right paratectal incision. In OA, all approaches were performed at the right paratectal incision. In the case of perforation or ascites, we inserted a drain at the stump of appendectomy or utilized a Douglas pouch.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0040">We evaluated clinicopathologic and operative factors in all of the 185 patients. We divided into two groups LA group (LAG) and OA group (OAG), and clinicopathologic factors were selected and compared between two groups. These included age, gender, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), white cell counts (WBC), operative factors (time and amount of blood loss), length of hospital stay (LHS), day from diagnosis to operation (DDO) and 30-day morbidity focusing on occurrence of surgical site infections (SSI). The NLR was defined as the value calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">The patients were then compared regarding the surgery duration, postsurgical symptoms such as pain, wound infection, DDO, LHS and SOI.

Since 2000, laparoscopic appendectomies have become popular worldwide because they were demonstrated in comparative cases to be well tolerated [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Laparoscopic surgical procedure has advantages in several surgical areas of daily practice as a minimally invasive technique, and several reports published in the last decade described the superiority of LA against conventional open approach cosmetic outcomes and low cost also is another factor where LA supersedes open approach, and are an important issues in OA [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, less postoperative pain, early recovery, and improved cosmetic appearance are accepted as the main advantages of LA <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcome, such as preoperative characteristics, surgical factors, and postoperative hospital stay, of LA in the treatment of acute appendicitis in comparison with the open approach. At our medical center LA was started in 2010, and now a days, the vast majority of appendicitis cases, are operated laparoscopically.</p><p id="p0080">Longer operative time and massive blood loss during LA are another issue in the comparison of LA and OA. Generally, those two factors are dependent on surgeon's experience. Though most surgical staffs in general has performed basic and advanced laparoscopic procedures, operating time is long when performed by inexperienced surgeons, and is shortened by accumulating experience [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also blood loss is dependent on surgeon's skill and on the situation of appendicitis. In our study, amount of blood loss was significantly lower in LA procedure.</p><p id="p0085">Currently in Japan, shorting postoperative hospital stay is one of the most important factors for economic management of a medical institution, and in order to shorten postoperative hospital stay, surgeons are required to reduce the risk of postoperative complications as much as to their ability. Among the postoperative complications, SSI is the most problematic in terms of extending hospitalization for patients with appendectomy. Consistent with other studies, SSI occurred more often in the OA group [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the previous reports that featured LA as a treatment for acute appendicitis, SSI was not as prominent, and the hospital stay has been clearly shortened [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The main reasons for the major number of SSI in the OA group might be due to the direct physical touch to the wound, and the fact that in all of the cases that underwent LA the specimen were removed using a plastic bag. Similar to our results, SSI ratio was zero percent in LA group, and there were no cases of re-admission due to postoperative ileus and/or abscess formation. Furthermore, SOI tended to be short in LA group, and it was suggested that early improvement of postoperative nutritional status would be affecting positively to the decrease of SSI incidence rate. Finally, the low SSI incidence rate was thought to have influenced shortening of post operative hospital stay.</p><p id="p0090">Focusing at the result of univariate analysis, it should be noted that the OA group had higher preoperative CRP level and pathological gangrenous cases than in the LA group. This result suggested selection bias by the surgeons. Before 2014, we did not have enough experience of LA; therefore we avoided LA procedure in patients with those types of complicated acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, those two factors were not evident on multivariate analysis. We recommend that if the patients have those two factors before operation, surgeons should be careful in considering LA or OA as the treatment of choice.</p><p id="p0095">Recent year, several medical centers selected nonsurgical treatment of appendiceal phlegmonous or abscess, using antibiotics treatment, or interval appendectomy. Darwazeh G et&#x000a0;al revealed in their systemic review report that interval appendectomy and repeated nonsurgical management in case of recurrence are associated with similar morbidity in emergency appendectomy, but interval appendectomy tended to be high in cost and tend to prolong hospital stay [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. From our results, 7 cases had interval operation in LA group, and two cases in OA group, but there were no significant differences between the both groups. On the other hand, interval appendectomy cases were slightly high in numbers in the LA group. We suggested and suspected that interval LA cases will be increasing in the next decade with improving laparoscopic technique. Even so, there will be possibility that cost can be reduced and hospital stay can be shortened. For complicated appendicitis (perforation, localized pus or four quadrant pus) it may also be necessary to choose interval surgery. Based on our result, we will prepare diagnostic criteria for complicated appendicitis, and make protocol of interval surgery to prove the effectiveness of interval LA. In conclusion, LA constitutes a safe and feasible procedure for the treatment of acute appendicitis. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that LA is associated with significantly lower risk compared to OA.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0100">Mitsugi Shimoda: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0105">Tsunehiko Maruyama: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p id="p0110">Kiyotaka Nishida, Kazuomi Suzuki, Tomoya Tago, Jiro Shimazaki: Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p><p id="p0115">Shuji Suzuki: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0120">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0125">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0130">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Semm</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Endoscopic appendectomy</article-title><source>Endoscopy</source><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><year>1983 Mar</year><fpage>59</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><comment>PubMed PMID: 6221925</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6221925</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Katkhouda</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Towfigh</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laparoscopic versus open appendectomy: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study</article-title><source>Adv.
