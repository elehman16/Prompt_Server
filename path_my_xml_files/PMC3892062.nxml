Aspirin and heparin have been shown to have potentially beneficial effects on trophoblast implantation. However, few published data on this issue are available from developing countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An open clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Misurata Teaching Hospital in Libya from January 2009 to December 2010 to investigate the effects of treatment with low dose aspirin (LDA) versus treatment with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) in combination with LDA on patients with a history of recurrent miscarriages. A total of 150 women were enrolled in the study. Women were eligible for the study if they had a history of three or more consecutive miscarriages. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either LDA (75&#x000a0;mg daily) alone or a combination of LDA and LMWH (75 women per treatment group). The primary outcomes were the rate of miscarriages and live births for each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with the group who received LDA alone, the combination group had a significantly lower number of miscarriages (22/75 [29%] vs. 43/75 [47%], P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and had a significantly higher number of live births (53/75 [71%] vs. 32/75 [42%], P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Two preterm infants in the LDA group and three in the combination group were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. There were no significant differences in the mean (SD) birth weights of neonates born in either group (2955.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;560 vs. 3050&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;540&#x000a0;g for the LDA and combination groups, respectively, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.444).

A small proportion of these losses are associated with identifiable causes in the mother or fetus, but the underlying cause in most cases of recurrent pregnancy loss remains unknown. There is evidence to suggest that successful pregnancy outcome depends on the development and maintenance of adequate utero-placental circulation, and that the hypercoagulability associated with thrombophilia might result in recurrent miscarriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, there is no clear consensus on what constitutes appropriate thrombophilia testing or, indeed, a standardized laboratory method for thrombophilia assessment.</p><p>Because of the potential involvement of thrombophilia in recurrent miscarriage, the use of antithrombotic agents has been suggested as a potential means of increasing the live birth rates in subsequent pregnancies in women with either inherited thrombophilia or unexplained recurrent miscarriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Preliminary data examining pregnancy success with the use of antithrombotic therapy in women with heritable thrombophilia are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, because two successive pregnancy losses are relatively common and distressing, and there are no other effective treatments, antithrombotic therapy is often prescribed for these women. Although low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and low dose aspirin (LDA) are generally considered safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], there is no direct evidence of their efficacy for miscarriage prevention. As a result, there have been repeated calls for randomized trials in this area, particularly a comparison of anticoagulant treatment with no pharmacological intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Heparin has been shown to have potentially beneficial effects on trophoblast implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and influence trophoblast apoptosis. To be beneficial, heparin may need to be given at the time of implantation. LMWHs are administered subcutaneously once a day. They have considerable theoretical benefit over unfractionated heparin (UFH) including better bioavailability, a longer plasma half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and less potential to cause osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. LMWH is also less likely to induce thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. LMWH inhibits factor Xa more effectively than factor IIa to produce its antithrombotic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. LMWH does not cross the placenta and is safe for the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Aspirin is increasingly used to reduce the risk of miscarriage and improve pregnancy outcome in women who have suffered recurrent miscarriage. An important factor controlling tissue perfusion is the equilibrium between thromboxane A2 (in addition to its platelet aggregating properties, it also has a vasoconstrictor effect) and prostacyclin (has vasodilatory properties) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The daily administration of LDA induces a shift in the balance away from thromboxane A2 and towards prostacyclin, leading to vasodilatation and enhanced blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of LDA alone with the combination of LMWH and LDA in women with recurrent miscarriage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Women were eligible for this study if they had a history of three or more consecutive miscarriages. Women with a history of thromboembolism, systemic lupus erythematosis, uterine abnormalities, and multiple successful pregnancies were excluded. After obtaining informed consent, socio-demographic, obstetric, and medical data were gathered from the study participants using pre-tested questionnaires. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either LDA alone (LDA group) or a combination of LDA and LMWH (combination group) using computer generated numbers drawn from an envelope. Participants started taking 75&#x000a0;mg of LDA once daily as soon as their pregnancy was confirmed and fetal heart activity was detected by ultrasound. Women in the combination group also self-administered 0.4&#x000a0;mL/day of the LMWH Enoxaparin. Follow-up examinations were conducted in the antenatal care clinic and all participants received routine iron and folic acid supplements. Participants were closely monitored until delivery, which was planned at 37 weeks of gestational age, unless otherwise indicated. Treatment was stopped at the time of miscarriage or when the pregnancy reached 34 weeks gestation. The outcome of all pregnancies was analyzed and all neonates were examined by a pediatrician shortly after delivery.</p><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows.

These findings are comparable with those of previous studies, which also concluded that the combination of heparin and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in achieving higher rates of live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Another recent study also concluded that the use of LMWH is a safe and reliable treatment resulting in a high live birth rate and no maternal or fetal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, other measures that these women received, such as strict follow-up of all women, might have also affected the results because close follow-up has been reported to have a significant beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome in women with a history of recurrent miscarriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>LDA may improve pregnancy outcome by irreversibly blocking the action of cyclo-oxygenase in platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet thromboxane synthesis and preventing thrombosis of the placental vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition to its anticoagulant action, heparin may act to reduce fetal loss by binding to phospholipids, thereby protecting trophoblast phospholipids from attack and promoting successful implantation in early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our study, there was no difference in pregnancy outcome between the two treatment groups in the pregnancies that survived beyond 13 weeks gestation. By this time, the first wave of trophoblast invasion is complete and placentation is established. Therefore, our result suggests that heparin may indeed act to protect the developing trophoblast. However, a previous study showed that combination therapy with LMWH and aspirin failed to prevent late-pregnancy losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Despite the treatment, one quarter of the fetuses from the successful pregnancies were delivered prematurely. This confirms previous reports of a high incidence of pregnancy complications in patients with recurrent miscarriages, especially if phospholipid antibodies are detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and emphasizes the need for close antenatal surveillance. Of the total deliveries, 24% were preterm. Most of these occurred spontaneously, but in some cases, labor was induced prematurely because of intrauterine growth retardation and preeclampsia. Five of these premature infants were admitted to the neonatal unit, but all of them were later discharged in good condition. The finding that most miscarriages occurred before 14 weeks of gestation confirms previous prospective observations in women with phospholipid antibodies who received no pharmacological treatment during pregnancy, and who were followed up from the time that they had a positive pregnancy test. Interestingly, Kaandorp <italic>et al.</italic> concluded in their recent review that there was no benefit of LDA over heparin treatment on the live-birth rate in women with a history of at least two miscarriages without apparent causes other than inherited thrombophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, two women in the LDA group had pre-eclampsia. A link (perhaps through endothelial dysfunction and heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been postulated between pre-eclampsia and increased cardiovascular disease later in life and women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages who might be at increased cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) in blood pressure regulation (through the control of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity), increased levels of G protein coupled receptor kinase and action of heparin by acting as a GRK inhibitor was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Regarding maternal outcomes, LDA and LMWH are safe drugs, and were well tolerated in this study. Of those taking heparin, none developed thrombocytopenia or had symptomatic complications, apart from mild localized bruising at the injection site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of LDA and LMWH is better than LDA alone for the maintenance of pregnancy in patients with recurrent first trimester miscarriages.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MOE and IA designed the study.
