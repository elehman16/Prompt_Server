There are at present two widely used and Food and Drug Administration-approved devices: the AutoPulse (Zoll Medical Corporation, Chelmsford, MA, USA), a load-distributed band device that rhythmically compresses and restricts the chest wall and the LUCAS (Physio-Control/Jolife AB, Lund, Sweden), a piston device with a cup that is placed in the centre of the chest and pushes the sternum down over a distance of 5.2&#x02009;cm and pulls back to the neutral position.

The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of our hospital with deferred consent because of the emergency situation, including the use of data from patients who did not survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Survivors of the arrest were approached for written consent, and patients refusing consent were withdrawn from the analysis. Clinical trial registration: ISRCTN14647429 (LUCAS) and ISRCTN75393297 (AutoPulse).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were included between 3 November 2008 and 26 May 2014. Included were patients either with an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or with an OHCA after arrival at the emergency department with ongoing CPR. All patients had a shorter (IHCA) or longer (OHCA) period of manual CPR before inclusion in the study. Excluded were patients with a traumatic cause of the arrest, patients with known or estimated age &#x0003c;18&#x02009;years, patients who arrived at the emergency room with a mechanical chest compression device already applied by the ambulance crew, patients who had return of spontaneous circulation before application of the study device, and patients who had no cardiac arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Randomization was done by computer-generated random numbers. Initially, we randomized patients to be treated either by a LUCAS chest compression device or control (LUCAS study) or by an AutoPulse chest compression device or control (AutoPulse study). Per-patient randomization with 1:1 allocation to either LUCAS study or AutoPulse study study was followed by per-patient randomization with 1:1 allocation to the study device or to manual control CPR, and the resulting treatment allocation concealed in opaque envelopes that were placed at the coronary care unit (CCU). Patients randomized to control treatment received manual chest compressions with corrective feedback of compression depth and rate from the sternal displacement transducer of a Philips Heartstart MRx defibrillator (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). After randomization of 69 patients and observing a lower-than-expected inclusion rate, we decided to merge the patients allocated to the two control groups up to that moment into one control group for use in both comparisons and changed the allocation to 1:1:1 for AutoPulse:LUCAS:control for the remainder of the study (<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ehx318-F1">1</xref></italic>). The control patients in both comparisons therefore included the same patients. This change in randomized treatment allocation was made before any blinded outcome assessment had been done. The data and safety monitoring committee approved this change in the protocol.

The devices were operated by the CCU nurses who participated in the regular hospital resuscitation team. All CCU nurses received training courses from the manufacturers of the compression devices in their correct and rapid application and handling and received refresher courses every 6&#x02009;months. When an alert for a possible cardiac arrest was received at the CCU, one sealed randomization envelope was opened. The hospital resuscitation team then took the corresponding device to the site of the arrest, being the location of the in-hospital arrest or the emergency department where the patient arrived after OHCA with ongoing CPR. After arrival on-site, the resuscitation team confirmed that CPR was still ongoing, then evaluated the patients for possible exclusion criteria. If none of the exclusion criteria applied, the patients were treated with the designated device. Final inclusion and exclusion decisions therefore were done after randomization had taken place and was not blinded to the allocated treatment. If the mechanical chest compression device did not operate as intended because of battery failure or other malfuction, the device was removed from the patient, manual chest compression administered, and the patient was excluded from analysis.</p><p>Chest compression data from all patients were obtained from a LifePak 12 defibrillator (Physio-Control, Redmond, WA, USA) and analysed with specific software (CodeStat Suite V9, Physio-Control, Redmond, WA, USA) with automated time synchronization. The moment of initiation and termination of AutoPulse or LUCAS compressions was identified by the characteristic pattern of the impedance signal. From patients randomized to manual chest compressions, compression duration, rate, and depth were analysed with Q-CPR review software V 2.1 (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). For patients with an OHCA, the duration of chest compressions before connection of the study device was estimated from the time interval between the moment of call to the ambulance dispatch centre for an OHCA and the initiation of study compressions in the emergency department. For patients with an IHCA, this interval was the time interval between the call for cardiac arrest to the hospital switchboard and the first study compression.</p><p>For patients not surviving resuscitation, autopsy was requested to the family. In addition, we requested permission to perform a post-mortem high-resolution multislice computed tomography (CT) scan to be performed within 1-2&#x02009;h after death.<xref rid="ehx318-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> For patients initially surviving resuscitation, all data from the subsequent clinical course in the intensive care unit (ICU) were obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was serious or life-threatening resuscitation-related damage to visceral organs, including large vessels and vertebrae as determined by post-mortem CT scan and/or autopsy or by clinical course (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S1</italic></xref>). The secondary outcome was damage to bony structures of the chest wall (sternum and ribs). The study was analysed according to the actual treatment received, as acceptable for a safety study. The study was not intended nor powered to study survival for either of the two devices against manual controls, nor was the study intended to compare damage or survival between the two compression devices.</p><p>The post-mortem CT scans were evaluated by a panel of two experienced radiologists; autopsy was performed with a specific protocol. For patients surviving resuscitation, the subsequent clinical course until death or hospital discharge was evaluated for signs of visceral or chest cage damage by a panel of two radiologists, an intensivist and a cardiologist, using all available information. All assessors were blinded to the allocated treatment. During an autopsy, however, a characteristic round mark from the cup of the LUCAS or skin abrasions from the AutoPulse band could be visible and therefore the pathologist cannot be considered fully blinded.</p><p>The seriousness of the observed damage was distinguished in three levels of severity according to standard grading for patients in cardiac arrest<xref rid="ehx318-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>: </p><p>(i) life-threatening&#x02014;reasonably expected to interfere with cardiovascular or respiratory function, exsanguination in excess of 800&#x02009;mL; (ii) serious&#x02014;demands therapy for repair or for alleviation of pain, expected to prolong hospitalization; and (iii) insignificant&#x02014;requires no therapy (expected to heal spontaneously without complication) or may require limited one-time only therapy. This definition of the primary endpoint was clinically oriented and could not be assessed in full if the patient did not survive the resuscitation attempt. In these cases, the panel classified the damage with the anticipation of a clinical course as if the patient had initially survived.</p><p>The secondary endpoint damage to the ribcage was defined as serious if it included sternal fractures and/or involved fractures to &#x0003e;6 ribs if unilateral or &#x0003e;4 ribs if at least one rib fracture was bilateral. Otherwise rib fractures were classified as insignificant. Damage to the ribcage and sternum was never considered life-threatening by itself.</p><p>For those patients who had a post-mortem CT scan as well as an autopsy, the most severe reported damage was used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study was designed as a non-inferiority study. The primary analysis tested whether mechanical chest compressions by either AutoPulse or LUCAS devices would not result in more life-threatening or serious visceral damage when compared with manual chest compressions.

<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ehx318-F1">1</xref></italic> shows the randomization, exclusion and inclusion of the patients, and number of patients available for outcome assessment. The hospital resuscitation team was alerted for 1697 patients for whom a randomization envelope was opened. An AutoPulse was brought on scene for 574 patients, a LUCAS for 559 patients, and a Philips MRx for manual chest compressions for 564 patients. After exclusion criteria were assessed, an AutoPulse was used in 115 patients, a LUCAS device was used in 122 patients, while 137 patients received manual chest compressions. For details of the reasons for exclusion, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S2</italic></xref>. Location of the arrest for IHCA patients is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S3</italic></xref>. Permission for autopsy and post-mortem CT scanning was denied by the family for 12 AutoPulse patients, for 14 LUCAS-treated patients, and for 11 control patients, who did not survive resuscitation. Possible damage could therefore be assessed by autopsy and/or post-mortem CT scan or by clinical follow-up in 103 AutoPulse patients, in 108 LUCAS-treated patients, and in 126 controls (for details of clinical diagnostic information, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S1</italic></xref>). One surviving control patient refused consent, and her data were removed from analysis.</p><p>Baseline data are presented in <italic>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="ehx318-T1">1</xref></italic>. Age and gender were not significantly different between patients allocated to either mechanical chest compression devices or to manual control. For patients with OHCA, the interval between estimated initiation of manual chest compressions and connection of the study device was approximately 60&#x02009;min, not significantly different between the experimental and control groups. For patients with IHCA, this interval was much shorter and significantly shorter for control patients. In the control group, the mean compression depth was slightly below the recommended 50&#x02009;mm. The compression rate in the control group was within the recommended range.<xref rid="ehx318-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx318-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> For details of initial recorded rhythm and possible cause of arrest, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Tables S4</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"><italic>S5</italic></xref>.

Studies of potential damage from mechanical chest compression devices have been published and a variety of damage is reported, mostly from autopsy reports.<xref rid="ehx318-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20&#x02013;22</sup></xref> The absolute difference in observed visceral damage between these studies is striking: in the study of Smekal <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ehx318-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> visceral damage was observed in 28% and 19% in LUCAS-treated and manual-treated patients, respectively, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 0.84&#x02013;3.2). In the study of Lardi <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ehx318-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> visceral damage in LUCAS-treated and manual-treated patients was 19% and 25%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 0.76 (95% CI 0.22&#x02013;2.6), but in Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s<xref rid="ehx318-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> study, this was only 3% and 1%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 3 (95% CI 0.3&#x02013;30). A recent large retrospective cohort study using post-mortem CT scans compared AutoPulse treatment with controls.<xref rid="ehx318-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The odds ratio of abdominal injury in AutoPulse treated patients was 4.9 (95% CI 1.88&#x02013;12.9). In all patients, both mechanical and manual chest compressions were given. Being a non-randomized study, the contribution of mechanical chest compression to damage cannot be clearly established. Our randomized study with damage assessment in &#x0003e;90% of all included patients allows a better assessment of the possible contribution of mechanical devices to damage from chest compressions, as the duration of initial manual CPR prior to device application was similar in all groups.</p><p>The numbers of various kinds of damage are too small to draw conclusions on their cause. The LUCAS concentrates its force on the sternum, and this may explain why more sternum fractures were observed in patients treated with LUCAS. The AutoPulse may generate high intra-thoracic pressure because of the force on the circumference of the chest. Severe rib and sternum damage did not occur significantly more in both mechanical chest compression devices. Rib and sternum damage was not considered life-threatening in itself, but it may have caused severe or life-threatening visceral pulmonary or mediastinal damage such as tension pneumothorax, mediastinal bleeding, or mediastinal emphysema.</p><p>Damage classified as life-threatening does not imply that it actually had caused death. In the setting of a cardiac arrest, the cause of the arrest, its consequences (e.g. aspiration or cerebral ischaemia), and the complications of chest compressions (e.g. pleural bleeding or pneumothorax) are a mix of conditions that each could contribute to death after resuscitation. In only three patients, the visceral damage could be classified as lethal in itself: liver rupture with massive bleeding and tension pneumothorax with cerebral air embolism.</p><p>Autopsy is not routinely performed after failed resuscitation, and most studies that report resuscitation-related damage only rely on autopsy performed in a minority of non-survivors. In a study specifically aimed to investigate damage from mechanical chest compressions, 222 of 691 non-surviving patients (32%) of a subset of the LINC study had an autopsy and patients with mechanical chest compressions were over-represented in the sample.<xref rid="ehx318-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In the study of Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ehx318-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> it was unclear from what population of cardiac arrest the autopsy patients were originating. In our study, autopsy was permitted in only 70 of the 221 patients (32%) who did not survive the resuscitation. Because we added post-mortem CT scanning to our protocol, we could assess damage outcome in 90% of all patients in the study. Post-mortem CT scanning has initially been used in forensic medicine but also has been investigated for assessment after resuscitation. In general, there is a reasonable agreement between postmortem CT and autopsy. In some studies, rib and sternum damage was found more frequent in CT scans, but some visceral damage identified more often in autopsy.<xref rid="ehx318-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx318-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx318-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> More control patients survived resuscitation (50%) than AutoPulse (37%) or LUCAS patients (34%) and therefore more often clinical diagnostic information was available (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S1</italic></xref>). Many patients in the ICU had CT scans driven by suspicion of damage from chest compressions. We believe therefore that diagnostic bias was not relevant for this reason.</p><p>In our study, randomization took place before inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria could be assessed. This may raise concern of bias in treatment allocation. There was no significant difference in allocation to treatment groups, except for the exclusion criterium ROSC on arrival of the resuscitation team (<italic>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="ehx318-T1">1</xref></italic>). This can be explained by the fact that preparing and applying a mechanical chest compression device took on average 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;min longer than applying a sternal displacement transducer in the control group, a significant difference. Therefore, there was 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;min more time for ROSC to occur before the mechanical compression device was in place, while for those patients allocated to manual control, chest compressions had started earlier, before ROSC may have occurred. There was a notably higher number of device failures of the Autopulse caused by battery failure, resulting in some inbalance in active treatment. This did not affect the interpretation of the outcome of interest (damage) in patients who received active treatment.</p><p>There is an association between longer duration of CPR and more bone and visceral damage.<xref rid="ehx318-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Approximately half of the patients had the onset of cardiac arrest outside the hospital and had manual chest compressions during transport for refractory cardiac arrest before the study device was applied after hospital arrival. The duration of chest compressions before inclusion in the study was evenly distributed between mechanical and manual chest compression in the OHCA patients, the rate of severe damage even tended to be higher in the IHCA patients. Therefore, it is unlikely that the prolonged period of chest compressions in the OHCA patients confounded the comparison of damage rates in patients receiving mechanical or manual control chest compressions, but a specific contribution to possible severe or life-threatening damage during transportation was not assessed in this study. In the Resuscitation Guidelines of 2015 ambulance transport to the hospital with mechanical chest compression is reasonable for emergency coronary angiography of patients who failed to have return of organized rhythm before transport.<xref rid="ehx318-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx318-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In that context, longer duration of mechanical chest compression can be expected than studied in our patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of mechanical chest compressions with the LUCAS device does not cause more severe or life-threatening visceral damage than good quality manual chest compressions. For mechanical chest compressions with the AutoPulse, it cannot be excluded that more severe or life-threatening damage is caused, compared with good quality manual chest compressions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
