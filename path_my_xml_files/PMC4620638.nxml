However the immunization coverage varies globally. It has been reported as low as 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% in some countries. This study explored the acceptance of and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination, comparing acceptance and willingness to pay before and after health education.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted with 2693 older people in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants were divided into an education group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1402) and a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1291). A validated questionnaire measuring acceptance of and willingness to pay for vaccination was administered during semi-structured interviews before and after education. Data on factors influencing acceptance were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants&#x02019; mean age was 69.5&#x000a0;years, 80&#x000a0;% were women and 82.1&#x000a0;% had at least one co-morbidity. Of the participants, 43.5&#x000a0;% had previously received vaccination more than once, although 92.8&#x000a0;% expressed acceptance of vaccination. Acceptance was associated with a positive attitude toward vaccination (OR 2.1, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.5&#x02013;2.9) and a history of receiving vaccination (OR 4.1, 95&#x000a0;% CI 2.8&#x02013;6.1). At baseline, there were no differences between the education and control groups in terms of work status (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.457), co-morbidities (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07), medical status (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.243), and previous vaccination (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62), except for educational background (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). Acceptance of vaccination increased to 95.8&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) after education and willingness to pay increased to 82.1&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Education significantly affected those with primary school-level education and no previous vaccination history, with acceptance increasing from 83.3 to 92.6&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001); more than twice as high as the control group (OR 2.4, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.2&#x02013;4.7). Viewing an educational video increased the proportion of participants with a high level of knowledge from 29.2 to 49.2&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and increased the proportion of participants with a positive attitude from 52.4 to 70.7&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). No significant difference was found in any parameter between the first and second assessment in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The strategies to increase positive attitudes may enhance the acceptance of vaccination. Health education using an educational video demonstrated a significant impact on acceptance, willingness to pay, knowledge and attitude in older people. This may lead to increased sustainability of the immunization program in older people.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acceptance</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Health education</kwd><kwd>Influenza vaccination</kwd><kwd>Willingness to pay</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Influenza remains one of the more serious diseases affecting public health, and leads to increasing rates of morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Older people, especially those with chronic diseases, are the most high-risk population for severe illness and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that during a regular flu season, 90&#x000a0;% of seasonal flu-related deaths in the US occurred in those aged 65&#x000a0;years and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Influenza infection also reduces functional independence, health and quality of life in older people, particularly those who suffer chronic diseases, and results in general economic loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC have recommended target groups for annual influenza vaccination including older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In older adults, the vaccination reduces illness severity and complications by up to 60&#x000a0;% and deaths by 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A number of studies have confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccination has reportedly prevented morbidity, hospitalization and mortality in older people with various conditions such as diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], chronic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Influenza vaccination is cost effective and safe for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In addition, around the world, populations are aging. A number of countries are experiencing challenges in dealing with an aging population. Thailand&#x02019;s population is also aging, with 11&#x000a0;% of the 64.5 million Thai citizens expected to be part of an aged society in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Older people, particularly those with chronic diseases, benefit from protection against diseases through vaccination. Influenza and herpes zoster are the most common communicable diseases in older adults. If a large number of older adults are not vaccinated against influenza, the disease is likely to be more severe and result in death in more cases. If a large proportion of the older adult population receives influenza vaccination, dissemination of the disease within the community will be reduced and individuals will be protected against influenza infection.</p><p>In Thailand, influenza vaccination is provided free of charge to people aged 65&#x000a0;years or older and those with chronic diseases including diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and those with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The EU Council of Ministers declared in 2009 to increase coverage of older age groups to a 75&#x000a0;% vaccination coverage by the 2014&#x02013;2015 season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Thailand influenza vaccination coverage among those aged 65&#x000a0;years and older (both general population and high-risk population) increased gradually from 11.5&#x000a0;% in 2010, 14.3&#x000a0;% in 2011, to 19.6&#x000a0;% in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], this vaccination coverage is relatively low in Thailand. Although some studies reported the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], many of these studies did not investigate knowledge about vaccination and attitude towards vaccination, and did not study the factors associated with acceptance of and willingness to pay for vaccination among older Thai people (target vaccination recipients).</p><p>International studies have shown that acceptance of influenza vaccination is influenced to different degrees by factors such as age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], marital status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and education level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], with factors varying in different regions and different racial/ethnic populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>A study conducted with high-risk patients in the US comparing education and lottery incentives as ways to increase vaccination coverage found that an educational brochure encouraged people to get vaccinated against influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Other studies have shown that health education using a mailed letter or a personal phone call successfully improved vaccination acceptance among various population groups, including older people, pregnant women and other high risk populations. However, most available studies were conducted in developed countries such as the USA, UK and Spain, where the health care systems, lifestyles and levels of knowledge in older people about vaccination differ from Thailand. Moreover, a survey of older Thai people conducted by the Thai National Statistical Office (NSO) reported that older Thais preferred receiving information by watching or listening rather than reading or via the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As a result, education tools such as leaflets, surface mail, and text messages may not be suitable for older Thai people, particularly those who have impaired eyesight or who are less interested in reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The present study was conducted to explore acceptance of and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination among older adults, and to compare acceptance of and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination before and after receiving health education.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Ethics Committee for Human Research (BMAEC). Participant was informed and consented before included in the study. The study was conducted with ambulatory older people who attended one of the 68 Health Centers administered by the Department of Health, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). Based on demographic profile, the population selected in this study represents the general older population in Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Each center runs regular activities and meetings as part of their care system for the ambulatory older population.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study population comprised people aged 60&#x000a0;years or older who lived in Bangkok. Participants were recruited from all of the 68 Health Centers in Bangkok. Those willing to participate in the study, who were self-assisted and able to read and sign the consent form were included in the study. Those who were not able to complete the questionnaires or could not watch the educational video were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected between 5 June and 5 July 2013. Around 40&#x02013;50 participants from each of the 68 health centers were sampled using a purposive sampling technique. Participants&#x02019; acceptance of vaccination and willingness to pay for vaccination were assessed using validated questionnaires administered as semi-structured interviews at two points (before and after presentation of the educational video). Data from participants were kept confidential by the use of a participant code, meaning the participant&#x02019;s name was not included on the questionnaires. Questionnaire content validity was verified by experts in the field of clinical science and social science (MD,PhD). Pre-testing was performed with a group of 30 elderly people, after which the questionnaire was modified and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Ethics Committee for Human Research (BMAEC). The questionnaire consisted of: 1) basic sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, educational background, work status, monthly income, co-morbidities, medical status and history of previous flu vaccination; 2) knowledge assessment; 3) attitude assessment; and, 4) acceptance of and willingness to pay for vaccination.</p><p>Knowledge was assessed with 12 true or false questions as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> concerning the cause of influenza, high-risk groups and possible complications. To determine vaccination-related knowledge, the questions included the types of vaccine used in Thailand and the reasons for vaccination. Each item was given a score of 0 or 1. Knowledge scores were classified into three groups using Bloom&#x02019;s Theory, which categorizes by percentage after the score is summed: &#x02264;60&#x000a0;% represented low knowledge, &#x0003e;60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% moderate knowledge, and &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;% a high level of knowledge.</p><p>Attitude was assessed on a five-point Likert scale comprising 15 issues which were listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Questions about influenza infection included the importance and severity of the disease as well as medication. Vaccination-related items included the population groups that should be vaccinated, vaccine safety, vaccine effectiveness and optimal vaccination schedule. Scores of attitude were interpreted as follows. For the positive answers, Strongly agree, Agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Disagree, and Strongly disagree would receive scores of 5,4,3,2,and 1, respectively. For the negative answers, Strongly agree, Agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Disagree, and Strongly disagree would receive scores of 1,2,3,4, and 5, respectively. Mean attitude scores were classified into three groups by Best&#x02019;s Theory: 1.00&#x02013;2.33&#x02009;=&#x02009;negative, 2.34&#x02013;3.67&#x02009;=&#x02009;neutral and 3.68&#x02013;5.00&#x02009;=&#x02009;positive.</p><p>Participants were divided into two groups: an education group and a control group. Participants enrolled at Health centers with an even number were assigned to the education group, while those enrolled at Health centers with an odd number were put in the control group. Participants in the education group were given a 1-h break after watching an educational video, after which the second assessment was performed. Participants in the control group did not watch the educational video, but were given a 1-h break after which the second assessment was performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>The present study used a video developed by researchers as the educational tool. The video was based on health belief models describing people as taking action to prevent disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The content included influenza topics (i.e., influenza infection, seriousness, complications, transmission, influenza prevention and practice after contracting influenza) and influenza vaccination (i.e., effectiveness, safety, possible side effects, influenza vaccination program in Thailand and practices after receiving vaccination). To ensure participants could clearly understand the message, each frame of the educational video contained images as well as written information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The video lasted for 10&#x000a0;min. The same group of experts in the field of clinical science and social science (MD, PhD) verified the accuracy of the video content. Pre-testing was performed with a group of elderly people, after which the video was modified and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University and the BMAEC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS Version 20 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used to describe basic sociodemographic characteristics. Knowledge and attitude were represented by the percentage of participants at each level and overall mean and median. Acceptance of and willingness to pay were represented by percentages. Chi-square analysis and then logistic regression were used to determine the associations between potential factors and acceptance or willingness to pay. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare mean attitude scores between those who accepted and did not accept vaccination due to non-normal distribution. The McNemar test was used to compare proportion data before and after video education. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used to compare knowledge and attitude scores before and after according to non-normal distribution. All significance levels were set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 3026 older adults were interested in the study, and 2693 (89&#x000a0;%) were included in the analysis.

Although the most common source for information on influenza infection was TV programs, older people reported that the most common source for information on influenza vaccination was medical personnel. This suggests that influenza vaccination information disseminated through health centers may be limited and in general, may not be sufficient.

Moreover, some studies have found that elderly people who were vaccinated against seasonal influenza were more likely to receive pandemic influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Other sociodemographic characteristics found to be significantly related to influenza vaccination included age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], marital status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], education level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], having co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and influence of healthcare personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. These characteristics varied in different countries, races, ethnicities and cultures. Improvements in technology and global travel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] mean that areas tend to have mixed cultures; for example, by 2030 in the US, Blacks Hispanic and Asian older adults will comprise a significantly larger proportion than they did in the past. The US census also estimates that by 2050, the older population in the US will look different. It has been predicted that within 10 to 20&#x000a0;years, ethnic minorities will be the new majorities, and in essence, Asians will have the highest rates of growth numerically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The United States encounter the continuous influx of refugees from Southeast Asia since 1975. They reported that Asian Pacific Americans remain one of the most poorly understood minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and there are smaller studies indicating these Asian population groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thus, understanding of this population is needed for health policy maker and service providers in order to provide facilities against health problems and reduce health care costs of the developed nation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Moreover, in an effort to control contagious and highly infectious disease like influenza, global cooperation is needed. Each area should investigate and report population characteristics, knowledge, attitude, vaccination acceptance and influential factors to focus vaccination and improve immunization coverage throughout the world, meaning global prevention may be within the realm of possibility.</p><p>This study evaluated the impact of health education on acceptance and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination by assessing key factors before receiving education (baseline) and after receiving education according to principles of health education assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The education tool used correlated with the principles of health education for the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We were able to examine the direct impact of the success of education (intervention), and our results showed that education using a video had a significant impact. Our study also assessed acceptance of and willingness to pay in the control group at two time points and the results showed no difference, indicating that the effect of education was true effect and there was less intervening effect that could distort our conclusions.</p><p>Our study represents older people in a developing country and has shown that vaccination acceptance in older people increased from 91.4 to 95.8&#x000a0;% after watching the educational video. Similar studies in developed countries have been conducted with varying results. A study in Spain showed that the use of a printed letter on led to a 3.6&#x000a0;% increase in the immunization rate from 38.1 to 41.7&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A UK study found an increase in vaccination uptake in older people from 46.7 to 67.9&#x000a0;% after they received a personal letter of invitation to attend an influenza vaccination clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The impact of the educational video was significant in older people who had primary school-level education or less and who had no previous history of influenza vaccination. It is noteworthy that this subset initially had lower vaccination acceptance than the overall study population. After video education, overall vaccination acceptance increased from 83.3 to 92.6&#x000a0;%. Moreover, logistic regression showed the video education increased acceptance by more than two times. Our results highlighted that video education also had benefit for the group of older Thai people who were less likely to accept influenza vaccination. A US study (1996) found that an educational brochure had a striking effect on influenza immunization among high-risk patients who did not accept immunization the prior year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Health education may be important among a number of countries where its population education is relatively low or similar to Thailand data (less than 50&#x000a0;% of population attain secondary education) such as Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed the importance of using a different form of health education (educational video). Other studies in developed countries have used other education forms such as a letter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or brochure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which might not have been suitable for older people due to eyesight impairment or less interest in reading long or complex statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The UK study also showed that health checks by a practice nurse who offered influenza vaccination resulted in an immunization rate increase from 48.7 to 74.3&#x000a0;%. However, this intervention was costly and its effect on influenza vaccination rates was modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Another study focused on hard-to-reach populations such as drug abusers, sex workers, immigrants, homeless people and older people, using a multilevel community-based method that included cooperation among neighbors, local community staff, nurses and physicians. After intervention, interest in receiving vaccination increased from 80 to 94&#x000a0;%. Although the multilevel community-based method had an effective outcome, the intervention required collaboration from many institutes, meaning a larger budget and a longer time were required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Our study also measured willingness to pay for vaccination, a factor that has not been considered in previous studies. Our results showed the educational video had a high impact on willingness to pay (a 13.7&#x000a0;% increase overall, and an 18.8&#x000a0;% increase in older people with primary school-level education). This increase may result from increased recognition of the benefit of influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and implies that vaccination recipients may be willing to pay when more expensive new generation vaccines become available, although these are relatively more expensive for the government. Although the chi-square test showed no difference in willingness to pay between the education and control groups at the second assessment, other economic factors may be related to willingness to pay such as income level; if the vaccination is more expensive, fewer older people would be willing to pay. Less than a half of older adults in our study could afford vaccination if the price was less than 100 baht (&#x0003c;3.08 USD), but the market price has been much higher. However, the percentage of older people in the education group who were willing to pay for vaccination after the education video increased from 56.2 to 69.6&#x000a0;%.</p><p>The present study included participants aged &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years. Retirement is an option for Thai people at the age of 60&#x000a0;years. While vaccination acceptance increased after education, our results showed that affordability is a barrier to vaccination. This indicates that it is important for the Thai government to reconsider the influenza vaccination program criteria to cover older people aged &#x02265; 60&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Aside from acceptance of and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination, the educational video improved the knowledge and attitudes of older people. This is important as Thailand is a developing country with limited knowledge, negative attitude and low influenza vaccination coverage, and differs from developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our finding that education had an effect on knowledge and attitudes about influenza vaccination was similar to a study with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Our study found that those who accepted vaccination felt that becoming sick from influenza infection would have an impact on health, and that people should be vaccinated against influenza every year. After video education, there was an increase in positive attitudes toward these two issues. Other attitude issues related to vaccination acceptance also showed an increase in mean scores after education, including perception of vaccination preventing influenza and the effectiveness/benefit of vaccination. Improvement in knowledge and attitude resulted in increased awareness of influenza prevention, which in turn may lead to increased immunization coverage and sustainability of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p>Our quasi-experimental study suggested that education is a successful method of improving vaccination acceptance and willingness to pay for vaccination among elderly people in an aging society. Education intervention is necessary for implementation of vaccination programs, particularly in a developing country such as Thailand due to poor knowledge about vaccination, negative attitudes and low influenza vaccination coverage. An educational video is a helpful tool for health education for older people. It is simple and has both pictures and sound, which may help older people to pay attention, particularly if they have impaired eyesight and less concentration when reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This indicates that an educational video is an alternative educational tool for older adults that may lead to the sustainability of immunization programs.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Study limitations</title><p>A limitation of our study is that the potential factors that showed correlation with acceptance of or willingness to pay in the cross-sectional part of the study do not allow causality to be identified due to the lack of temporal sequence between factors and outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Influenza vaccination acceptance is associated with having a positive attitude. Therefore, strategies to improve attitudes toward vaccination should be implemented to improve immunization coverage. Furthermore, TV programs are the most common media for conveying information on influenza infection to older adults. However, access to information on influenza vaccination is currently restricted to health care centers. Consequently, sources of vaccination information should be expanded to include TV, radio, newspapers, and leaflets promoting the influenza vaccination program. Health education using an educational video demonstrated a significant impact on acceptance of and willingness to pay for influenza vaccination as well as improving knowledge and attitude in elderly Thais. Health education is particularly important if the vaccination is not available for free. In addition, educational videos provided by the government through tele-media/TV program during influenza vaccination campaigns may improve immunization coverage, particularly in older adults who have low vaccination acceptance. Increasing knowledge and positive attitudes about vaccination will lead to sustainability of the influenza immunization program in low to mid income older populations worldwide.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>The World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSO</term><def><p>Thai National Statistical Office</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMAEC</term><def><p>The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Ethics Committee for Human Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMA</term><def><p>Bangkok Metropolitan Administration</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no conflicts of interest, financial or other, exist.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RW assisted in the design of the study, developed materials, and collected and analyzed the data.
