In 2003, 12% of teen 13-15-years-old were smokers, that figure has reached 27% in 2007.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Meanwhile, about 70% of smokers want to quit smoking, and few of them are about 5% who receive no help to be succeeded in quitting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Results of a survey conducted in our country showed that only 2.4% have managed to quit smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Transtheorethical Model (TTM) is one of the models in the early 1980s, which was introduced by Prochaska and decremented for smoking quit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] TTM is one of the stage-based theories and proposes that behavior change is not a continuous process but can occur through a series of qualitatively different stages. These models, consequently, suggest that interventions will be most effective when they are tailored to individual's current stage of change. According to these models, three broad categories of individuals distinguished:[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] People who have not yet decided to change their behavior,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] people who have decided to change, and (three people who are already engaged in overt change.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The TTM proposes that &#x0201c;tailored&#x0201d; interventions, which are taken in to account of current stage and the individual has reached in the change process, will be more effective than &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; interventions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Results of several studies have shown the stage-based interventions by using different strategies to increase the smoking cessation rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>On the basis of TTM, five different stages of smoking behaviors are: (a) Precontemplation (individuals who are smokers and not intending to quit smoking in the next 6 months), (b) Contemplation (individuals who are smokers but they try to quitin the next 6 months), (c) Preparation (individuals who are smokers but they have plan to quit smoking in the next 30 days), (d) Action (individuals who actually quit smoking and been abstinent for less than 6 months), and (e) Maintenance (individuals have quit smoking and they get abstinent for more than 6 months after initial quitting).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The first three stages are motivational, whilst the latter two stages are actionable in nature. Progression through the stages is seen as sequential, though relapse to an earlier stage can occur.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The time of occurrence changes depends on decisional balance and self-efficacy, which are considered as two intermediate indicators.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] They also explain behavior change strategies through 10 processes of change that are divided into two categories: Experiential process (consciousness raising, dramatic relief, environmental re-evaluation, social liberation, and self-re-evaluation) and behavioral (Self-liberation, stimulus control, helping relation, counter conditioning, and reinforcement management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Decisional balance is defined as the potential benefits (Pros) and costs (Cons) of behavior change.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In moving toward any decision, individuals weigh the costs and benefits of the action being contemplated. In change of behavior, these considerations are known as decisional balance, a process of cognitively appraising or evaluating the &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; aspects or pros, the &#x0201c;less good&#x0201d; aspects or cons of a behavior, the reasons to change and not to change that behavior. Lasting behavior change is associated with the pros for the behavior change increasing and the cons for change decreasing until the point of crossing over is reached.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The concept of self-efficacy is a component of Bandura's social learning theory defined as one's perceived confidence in the ability to perform a specific behavior.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In smoking behavior; self-efficacy represents the subjects&#x02019; level of confidence that they can resist smoking across a number of tempting situations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Self-confidence to resist against smoking temptations has tended to decrease among precontemplators and get much higher as the smoker acts and maintain abstinence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>The first step in quitting is having preparation and motivation for quitting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Besides motivation and readiness, successful smoking cessation is impressed by nicotine dependence. Avoiding the withdrawal symptoms to nicotine abstinence is a strong stimulator to continue smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In one hand, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is an effective way to overcome the physiological withdrawal symptoms because it ameliorates affects and can double smoking cessation rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] On the other hand, studies have shown that telephone follow-up in both reactive and proactive forms are effective in stopping smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>There is no functional comprehensive policy to control smoking in Iran and in this area only one research center in Tehran is active. Because the smokers who are in the preparation stage committing to and planning for imminent change, we focused our interventions in this group. Hence, the aim of the current study was to examination of individualized counseling, line follow-up, and nicotine replacement on smoking cessation based on TTM constructs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>Participants were people in preparation stage of smoking behavior.

The result indicated that the continuous abstinence rate based on the maintenance stage was 46% in the treatment group. This finding emphasis on the role of tailored intervention, individual counseling, and NRT as well as. According to TTM, stage matched intervention increase the abstinence rate in smokers, especially who were in preparation stage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Because the individual in preparation stage motivated to quitting, their success in quitting could be enhanced by NRT, line follow-up, and in person counseling. Nicotine is addictive material that could be influenced any successful quitting by its withdrawal symptoms. Hence, including NRT for overcoming on psychological and physiological symptoms is very important issue. Several studies have shown that nicotine dependency role in the success or failure of smoking cessation and that using NRT, especially in people with high nicotine dependence in the first few weeks of smoking cessation has a great impact.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] In the meantime, the offering of free NRT should be considered because the economic barrier to NRT is one of the barrier that can alter the quit attempts and decrease the motivation for cessation. Alberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] reported that free transdermal nicotine patches provision increased quit rate from 38% to 56%. Meanwhile, referred to smoking cessation in a period of 18-month increased by 37%.</p><p>The study conducted by Nohlert and colleagues showed that the success rate of continues abstinence rate in the group that had received high-intensity counseling twice the depth of a group that had received only short-term counseling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] Besides, phone calls follow-ups and in-person counseling provide the social support for smoking abstinence. Some studies have shown that providing telephone counseling can cause to help quit smoking. McAlister <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] study's estimated that telephone counseling services had about 8% more quit rate than self-help group and was 1 year cost-effective in smoking cessation. Another study results showed the effectiveness of quit lines as auxiliary method, if it is to be used along with health care system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Heydari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] study on efficacy of telephone quit-line for smokers in Iran showed the sustained abstinence rate after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months was 59%, 41%, 31% and 18%; respectively. However, our proactive calling provided access to counseling and was helpful in quit processing.</p><p>We did found a considerable effect size related to TTM variables in treatment group at two follow-up measurements. These results confirmed the role of behavioral counseling, social support and NRT to succeed quitting rate.</p><p>The current study showed that non-smokers use more behavioral process and some cognitive process like consciousness raising, social liberation, and environmental re-evaluation in their quitting process. Smokers reported more relapse and greater temptation and little self-efficacy to smoke, especially in negative/affective situations. Furthermore, the pros of quitting were lower in quitted person but cons of smoking were not different between smokers and non-smokers. This could be explained by high perceived costs of smoking in two groups. The smokers perceived more benefits and costs from smoking simultaneously but, non-smokers perceive low benefit and higher costs of smoking. Furthermore, the temptation rate decreased and self-efficacy increased over the time. In consistent with our findings Fang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] reported that their intervention resulted in greater self-efficacy, and greater pros of quitting over time but, in contrast to our study their participants reported fewer cons of quitting at 3-month follow-up. In this area, it should be noted that the cons and barriers of smoking in both control and treatment groups were high in baseline and not changed in post baselines. In the study, the minimal intervention strategy was influenced only the intention to quit and self-efficacy only for high educated patients but, did not increased pros of quitting and pros of smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>]</p><p>The results showed that people who quit are more likely to use behavioral process than smokers. According to TTM, smokers who are in the early stages apply more cognitive and experiential processes but when they started to quit and moving to later stages, they use behavioral processes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>]</p><p>In contrast to TTM, quit participants reported more consciousness raisings and social liberation than smokers. In this area, Glanz <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] reported that social liberation has unclear relationship to the stages. In line with consciousness raising, it could be explained that people who quit may increase their awareness about smoking and its complications. However, others reported that there was not consistent relationship between the stages of change and processes that used and suggested that more basic research, especially longitudinal studies are need.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>]</p><p>Our research encountered with some limitations to its generalizing. First, quit rate was based on participants self-report, and not verified biochemically. Second, its inclusion criteria was only smokers who were in preparation stage. Third, it's small sample size and follow-up until 6-month. Further researches should be useful that included smokers in earlier stage like precontemplation and contemplation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our findings revealed that uses of individual counseling, telephone follow-ups, and free NRT in motivated and prepared people to quit, increased the continuous abstinence rate. Hence, it is recommended that to establish counseling centers in primary care systems, along with free provision of NRT, and access to quit line. Definitely, it could be possible to change the current tobacco control policy by policymakers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>WHO.
