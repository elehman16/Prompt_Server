We propose that adopting open/hidden designs from placebo research would offer a possible way to establish specificity in psychotherapy. Therefore, we tested the effects of providing opposing treatment rationales in an online expressive writing intervention on affect in healthy subjects. Results indicate that it was possible to conduct the expressive writing intervention both covertly and openly, but that participants in the hidden administration condition did not fully benefit from the otherwise effective expressive writing intervention in the long-run. Effect sizes between open and hidden administration groups were comparable to pre-post effect sizes of the intervention. While this finding is important for the understanding of psychotherapy's effects per se, it also proves that alternative research approaches to establish specificity are feasible and informative in psychotherapy research.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> German Clinical Trials Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009428">DRKS00009428</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is consensus that psychotherapy is effective, yet identification of accountable factors or processes is subject to controversy [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Whereas in biomedical research the position that "preservation of sound judgment both in the laboratory and in the clinic requires the use of the double blind technique [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is considered gold standard, this approach is not fully applicable in psychotherapy research. Although it needs to be noted that even in biomedical research not everything that glitters is gold [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the principle of indistinguishability between comparators is fundamentally hampered in psychotherapy trials both practically and conceptually [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. So far, two main approaches have been employed to handle this problem and to establish specificity in psychotherapy research, both with problematic consequences in their own right ([<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], p. 213ff).</p><p>First, since it is old lore that "to show that a specific form of psychotherapy (&#x02026;) produces results not attributable to the non-specific placebo effect it is not sufficient to compare its results with (&#x02026;) no treatment" (cited from [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], p. 300) psychotherapy is to be compared to psychological placebo to establish specificity of the treatment [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Placebo conditions often run under various denominators, such as supportive therapy, nondirective therapy, common factor control, credible attention placebo, and modest contact, but should be and are considered as placebo as they are lacking treatment constituents deemed specific. This seemingly adopts the gold standard of biomedical research and thus is considered good enough to be gentled as "Research-supported psychological treatment" by the American Psychological Association [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there is evidence that differences between psychotherapies and psychological placebo conditions are a function of the credibility of the placebo control [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as well as the extent of structural equivalence between comparators [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and that controlling for researchers' allegiance towards a particular intervention abolishes observed differences (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Second, specificity has been sought through direct comparisons of psychotherapies, which usually differ in their characteristic, but not in their incidental treatment constituents [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and through dismantling or additive component studies, in which presumable characteristic treatment constituents are either omitted or added. However, meta-analyses on respective trials do not substantiate the existence of statistically and/or clinically significant differential effects per se [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], besides those are related to researchers' allegiance [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the utility of randomized placebo-controlled trials in clinical research "to sort therapeutic wheat from chaff" (cited from [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], p. 1502) is not unequivocally warranted in psychotherapy. Given that placebo conditions in psychotherapy cannot be blinded, the main principle of randomized placebo-controlled trials, i.e. to employ different interventions with the same rationale&#x02013;or put otherwise: to control the incidental, while manipulating the characteristic treatment constituents&#x02013;is not applicable. However, the strive for specificity&#x02013;understood here as the identification of characteristic treatment constituents outperforming incidental ones&#x02013;is important regardless of both the understanding of psychotherapy or of the respective characteristic treatment constituent under investigation.</p><p>Here, placebo research designs could come to aid. Using a topsy-turvy approach with regard to randomized placebo-controlled trials, the aim is to control for characteristic, while manipulating incidental treatment constituents. A stringent implementation of this approach is the open versus hidden design, where an otherwise identical intervention is given to subjects either knowing or not knowing when or if the drug will be administered or withdrawn. Differences between conditions are then understood as placebo-like effects, since the intervention itself is not a placebo (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). This trial design has the merits of being able to specify effects of assumingly incidental treatment constituents, e.g. therapeutic meaning [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], from those of characteristic treatment constituents without the use of a placebo condition and thus has successfully been used in non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). However, it has not been tested in the realm of psychotherapy interventions. Employing an online expressive writing intervention, we tested the feasibility of an open/hidden paradigm in psychotherapy and whether the effects of the assumingly characteristic treatment constituent of expressing emotions about a traumatic experience are influenced by the assumingly incidental treatment constituent of providing a therapeutic rationale, i.e. a meaning [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial with three experimental conditions in healthy subjects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s001">S1 File</xref> for trial and manuscript details). Two groups underwent a standardized online intervention, whereas the control group did not receive an intervention. While both intervention groups received the same online intervention, they were given different treatment rationales for the intervention: Participants in the causality group were told that the intervention will have beneficial effects on mood in the long-run, participants in the reversed causality group were instructed that mood will influence how they will perform in the intervention (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s002">S2 File</xref> for details).</p><p>The intervention consisted of an online version of the expressive writing paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], due to its feasibility and proven efficacy to reduce distress in healthy student and clinical populations (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It needs to be noted that expressive writing leads to short-term deterioration of affect, followed by long-term increase in well-being [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Subjects in both intervention groups wrote about their most traumatic experience on three consecutive days for 20 minutes on each day.</p></sec><sec id="sec004" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>In total, participants were imbedded in the study for 46 days. The study encompassed three intervention days (days 1 to 3) and four assessments (days 1, 4, 10 and 46 or baseline, post intervention, mid-term and long-term follow-up, respectively). On intervention and assessment days participants received an email with an individual access code for a webpage differing in content according to group assignment and study day. For all groups, the website contained the outcome (PANAS, see below). On the intervention days, the website also contained an embedded video for the two intervention groups, showing a professional speaker explaining the rationale of the intervention. While the instruction was equal for both intervention groups in terms of structure and format, the treatment rationale, i.e. proposed meaning, differed in content between these groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s002">S2 File</xref>). For the control group, this website contained the outcome only. On intervention days, participants of the intervention groups completed the outcome before and after the expressive writing intervention, while the control group completed the outcome only once on each of the intervention days. The intervention, the different instructions as well as the assessments were conducted online in order to control for patient-therapist interaction. Participants were not informed about the existence of and the difference between the three groups. Subjects were debriefed after study participation. Participants were provided with written information about the study and written informed consent to participate in this study was obtained online and stored digitally. The protocol and consent procedure was approved by the institutional review board of the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Basel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s003">S3 File</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s004">S4 File</xref>). The trial was not registered in a WHO approved registry before enrolment, because the trial initially was not considered to qualify as a clinical trial and comparable trials have not been registered as clinical trials (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). However, the study was retrospectively registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187400.s005">S5 File</xref>). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. There were no changes to methods after trial commencement.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Measures</title><p>Possible effects of the experimental conditions were repeatedly assessed for up to 46 days after baseline with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS, [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), which was <italic>a priori</italic> defined as the primary outcome. The PANAS contains two scales with overall 10 five-point items assessing positive (e.g. "interested", "proud") and negative affect (e.g. "upset", "ashamed"). The internal consistency estimate of reliability for the PANAS scales in the total sample was good (positive affect: Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.87, negative affect: Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.79). In the intervention groups, linguistic content of written text, subjective rating of the severity of the reported traumatic experiences and the plausibility of their respective treatment rationale were employed to assess the validity of the intervention and experimental manipulation of treatment rationale. The linguistic content of the written text was analyzed with <italic>Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count</italic>, which quantifies words in a given text according to preset categories with a 70&#x02013;80% hit rate [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For the purposes of this study, we used the word count of first person singular personal pronouns (e.g. <italic>I</italic>, <italic>me</italic>, <italic>mine</italic>), of negative and positive emotions (e.g. <italic>sad</italic>, <italic>hate</italic>, <italic>worthless</italic> and <italic>happy</italic>, <italic>pretty</italic>, <italic>good</italic>), of cognitive processes (e.g. <italic>distinguish</italic>, <italic>because</italic>, <italic>know</italic>), of causality (e.g. <italic>argument</italic>, <italic>influence</italic>, <italic>effect)</italic> and of insight (e.g. <italic>recognize</italic>, <italic>conscious</italic>, <italic>decision</italic>). Subjective rating of the severity of the traumatic experiences was assessed with a single sentence 5-point item (i.e. <italic>In general</italic>, <italic>how distressing is the experience you have just written about for you</italic>?) and plausibility of the treatment rationale was operationalized with a 5-point item for each group (causality group: <italic>Writing about a traumatic experience influences my well-being</italic>, reversed causality group: <italic>My well-being influences how I write about a traumatic experience)</italic>. All described measures were assessed online and stored in internal and secured data carriers.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited amongst psychology students at two Swiss Universities (University of Zurich and University of Basel) through mailing lists and web postings at both universities. Inclusion criteria were (1) ages of 18 years and older, (2) absence of any mental disorder by self-report, (3) not receiving psychological or psychiatric or medical treatment in the last six month by self-report and (4) a Toronto Alexithymia Scale score below 54 [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], since alexithymia has been shown to influence effects of expressive writing [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Of 183 enrolled subjects, 19 did not fulfill inclusion criteria and were therefore excluded. A total of 164 subjects were randomly assigned to the three experimental groups and 112 participants completed the intervention and all assessments. Random allocation sequences were achieved with individual assignment codes in separate envelopes, opened by study personnel after confirmation of eligibility and informed consent. Eight subjects dropped out after randomization and before post-intervention assessment and 30 subjects were excluded due to low commitment in the expressive writing task, defined as writing for less than 15 minutes on intervention days by self-report, so that overall 126 subjects were considered per protocol (control group N = 55, causality group N = 36, reversed causality group N = 35). Furthermore, 14 subjects did not complete all assessments after post-assessment, so that two samples were analyzed (completers N = 112 and ITT N = 126, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187400.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Subjects not meeting inclusion criteria as well as those excluded due to low commitment, i.e. not being considered as per protocol, did not differ significantly in any baseline demographic or baseline parameters (all p&#x0003e;0.40). Mean age of participants was 23 years and 8 months (control group 22 years and 9 months; causality group 24 years and 11 months; reversed causality group 23 years and 11 months) and the gender ratio was 86 women and 26 men (control group 37/11; causality group 25/7; reversed causality group 24/8). Overall, only 2 participants (1.8%) kept a regular diary. Participants received study credits for their participation. The flow of participants through the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187400.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0187400.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187400.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow of participants through the study (ITT: Intention to treat, TAS: Toronto Alexithymia Scale).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0187400.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Based on assumed small to medium effects of our experimental manipulation of treatment rationale on intervention effects, a priori sample size calculation with the statistical software G*Power 3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] led to an optimal sample size of N = 120 (f = 0.2, 80% power, 5% alpha error, 3 groups, 4 assessments and correlation among repeated measures = 0.3). We assumed that our restrictive exclusion criteria, the population under investigation and the emotionally demanding task would lead to a substantial dropout of at least 30%. We therefore set out to recruit N = 180. SPSS 21 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for Apple OS X was used for all statistical analyses. Based on previous recommendations, we did not run statistical tests comparing the participants on baseline demographic characteristics and outcome measures (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]).</p><p>A time by group by scale multivariate analysis of variance with subsequent time by group univariate analysis of variance for single PANAS scales was used to investigate differences between groups regarding treatment effects over time. For significant results between groups, Cohens f (calculated from SPSS partial eta-squared with the program G*Power 3.1: 0.1 = small, 0.25 = medium and 0.45 = large) was used for time by group interaction effects. Within- and between-group effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d (0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large). All results are displayed as mean values and standard deviation unless otherwise indicated. All analyses were performed on per protocol subjects, i.e. with sufficient commitment in the writing task, as we were interested in the effects of different rationales for a given treatment. For this, it is of importance to ensure treatment fidelity in the first place. Otherwise, there would not be any &#x0201c;administration of a treatment&#x0201d; at all and in consequence, no open/hidden administration of a treatment. Clearly, the low-commitment cases were not undergoing the expressive writing intervention and thus any inclusion of them would have violated both our aim to test this as well as the validity of our data. In this regard, it is of importance to note that the number of low-committers is near similar in both intervention groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187400.g001">Fig 1</xref>), pointing towards that the open/hidden administration did not have a systemic effect on commitment. All analyses of on protocol subjects were performed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis including randomized protocol subjects with baseline and at least post-intervention values (day 4) for the variable being analyzed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187400.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Standardized mean differences for significant effects in the ITT sample were of small to medium size for positive affect (standardized between-groups differences at follow-up: causality group versus control group d = 0.41; reversed causality group versus control group d = 0.43; standardized within-group baseline to follow-up differences: causality group d = 0.46; reversed causality group d = 0.30;control group d = 0.01) and for negative affect (between groups at follow-up: causality group versus control group, d = 0.57; causality group versus reversed causality group, d = 0.64; standardized within group baseline to follow-up differences: causality group, d = 0.33; reversed causality group, d = -0.28; control group, d = -0.2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this randomized-controlled trial was to test the feasibility of an open/hidden paradigm in psychotherapy research and to assess the effect of the assumingly incidental treatment constituent of providing a treatment rationale to the assumingly characteristic psychotherapeutic intervention of expressive writing.</p><p>First, both the intervention as well as the experimental manipulation proved to be valid and feasible, as indicated by the linguistic content analysis, the expected detrimental effects of expressive writing on affect during intervention days and participants rating of plausibility of their treatment rationale. Noteworthy, intervention groups did not differ in these parameters, so that it is unlikely that observed effects of the experimental manipulation of the treatment rationale are the consequence of differences in the perception, implementation and direct effects of the intervention itself. Second, while the experimental manipulation did not influence affect in short- and mid-term, we observed significant long-term differences between groups. Both intervention groups reported higher positive affect six weeks after the intervention in comparison to the no-treatment control group. In contrast, while the causality group showed a decrease of negative affect, the reversed causality group did not seem to benefit from the intervention in the same fashion. All of these group differences were of medium effect size and the differences between the reversed causality and causality group in negative affect at follow-up exceeded the magnitude of observed within group-changes between baseline and follow-up.</p><p>In the following, the observed effects will be discussed from an expressive writing, a theoretical and a methodological perspective. With regard to the former, the results of the causality group followed the expected direction and time course, with a temporally delayed and medium-sized improvement in affect (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Also, immediate deterioration of affect with long-term improvement is proposed as the normal psychokinetic of expressive writing interventions [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and follow-up duration has been found to be a significant predictor of expressive writing effects, with longer-term follow-up studies showing better outcome than studies with shorter-term follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It needs to be noted that although the observed effects are comparable to previous publications (see above), our trial is at best considered an efficacy trial and thus our results do not shed light on the effectiveness of online expressive writing interventions.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, the observed response differences between the intervention groups are per se not unexpected. For example, a recent within-subject randomized blinded balanced placebo design observed higher analgesic effects with overt in contrast to covert lidocaine injections in healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, providing an otherwise similar aerobic exercise training or a work-related behavior with group-specific therapeutic rationales led to larger changes in self-esteem [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or physiological health parameters [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], respectively. However, it needs to be noted that the reversed causality group benefitted from the intervention with regard to positive, but not to negative affect. Here, an early study on the effects of either open or hidden administration of a pharmacological intervention is informative. Ross and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] observed discomfort in subjects receiving 10 mg of d-amphetamine covertly, while the overt administration resulted in neutral to comfortable mood, arguing that subjects who covertly received the pharmacological intervention, "had no 'therapeutic' set and presumably reported their feelings 'honestly' on the mood scales" (cited from [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], p. 391). However, the processes underlying the observed differences, such as differences in experiencing or attributing symptoms or both, need to be elucidated in further studies.</p><p>Regarding the methodological approach, the observed effects of our trial support the feasibility and utility of an open/hidden administration to disentangle effects of incidental treatment constituents from those of characteristic treatment constituents. In this regard, the beneficial effects on positive affect in both intervention groups could be seen as being caused by characteristic constituents of expressive writing, while the incidental treatment constituent of providing a treatment rationale is needed to obtain full effects, i.e. beneficial changes in both positive and negative affect. It needs to be noted that the definition of what is to be considered characteristic or incidental in psychotherapy is complicated by the fact that many treatments include the provision of a treatment rationale without defining its role in the treatment theory as characteristic. While this in general highlights the need to revise treatment theories [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the definition of what is to be considered incidental or characteristic in the case of expressive writing was considerably facilitated by the fact that the original instruction [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] did not contain the provision of a treatment rational and thus is clearly considered incidental to the treatment. According to Gr&#x000fc;nbaum's conceptualization [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a treatment qualifies as verum, which he chooses to label "non-placebo", when at least one characteristic treatment constituent is therapeutic for a given disorder. With regard to our findings, we have reason to assume that expressive writing qualifies as verum, since its effects are observable even when administered covertly. However, there is an important amendment to this conclusion. Explanatory models and theories of expressive writing currently focus on emotion-related processes, i.e. propose disinhibition, emotional catharsis, cognitive-processing, self-regulation, exposure, social integration or development of a coherent narrative as underlying principles of change [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187400.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Based on our results and given that 1) expressive writing effects are strongly associated with positive response expectancies, 2) a full confrontation with the traumatic experience is not a prerequisite for these effects [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and 3) that writing about traumatic events is as beneficial as writing about positive events [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], future research is warranted to elucidate characteristic treatment constituents in expressive writing and to revise the underlying treatment theory accordingly.</p><p>There are several aspects of our study that need to be considered critically. First, participants in the reverse causality group may have known about the beneficial effects of writing. However, controlling for this is difficult, if not impossible, as asking participants about their assumptions regarding possibly positive effects of writing might itself provoke or prime such assumptions. Therefore, we opted against a direct inquiry and instead assessed the plausibility of the respective condition rationale. Our results showed no difference between the intervention groups, which indicates that participants found both possible causal directions between affect-change and writing equally acceptable.</p><p>Second, we experimentally manipulated the treatment rationale and thus provided the causality group, i.e. the open administration of the intervention, with a description of expected positive effects of the intervention. In the original instructions (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) this clear description and direction of effects is missing. However, the therapeutic properties of expressive writing interventions are inherently tied to accounts of this intervention (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) and even with the original instructions, i.e. without providing a description of expected positive effects, high positive expectancies that the writing intervention will have beneficial effects were found in comparable populations [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Also&#x02013;at least with respect to ethical guidelines in psychotherapy&#x02013;providing a treatment rational is integral to normative guidelines (see [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). Since our aim was to test the effects of an experimental manipulation of providing a treatment rationale (and not to replicate the effects of the original expressive writing instructions), we choose to make the implicit explicit, by providing and manipulating the rationale of the two conditions. &#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;&#x0202c;However, it needs to be acknowledged that our instructions differed from those in Pennebaker [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which did not provide a description of any anticipatory effect or treatment rationale.</p><p>Third and closely related to the previous aspect, our hidden administration of the online expressive writing intervention differs from similar approaches in medical research, where the patient is unaware when a given substance is administered. Instead, we operationalized the hidden administration by providing an alternative non-therapeutic rationale to ensure that both experimental conditions do not differ in their credibility and to minimize the possibility that the expressive writing intervention would per se be perceived as therapeutic. Given that this has been observed in trials not providing a rationale (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), we addressed this problem by implementing a non-therapeutic rationale.</p><p>Fourth, it needs to be noted that we carried out a large number of analyses and thus there is a probability that our main finding is due to chance. However, it needs to be considered that 1. we carefully analyzed pre-defined hypotheses with multivariate methods, 2. our finding of a significant short-term deterioration and a long-term improvement replicates previous findings on expressive writing from independent groups and 3. our main finding of a significant group difference in the course of long-term negative affect is of medium effect size and the consequence of a well-controlled experimental design. Therefore, we consider the probability of a chance finding as minimal. Finally, several of our finding in the ITT analyses failed to meet the 5% significance level (but fell under the 10% error level). While this could be taken as non-significance, we chose to consider these findings as of borderline significance, since the results in the ITT sample mirrored those in the per protocol sample.</p><p>To conclude, we consider the manipulation of assumingly incidental treatment constituents while keeping assumingly characteristic treatment constituents constant, as a promising design for psychotherapy research. Although our study might also illustrate the difficulties of this approach, it is far from new. Faced with the problem of an effective treatment without a proven mechanism, Benjamin Franklin and colleagues employed probably the first documented open/hidden trial to test Anton Mesmer&#x02019;s animal magnetism at the end of the 18th. century. Using a specially designed blindfold, the servant of an experienced practitioner of magnetism was put to test: "Magnetized next with eyes uncovered, he feels tingling in his forehead when the metal rod is brought close to it; blindfolded again, he feels no tingling when the rod is brought close" (cited from [<xref rid="pone.0187400.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], page 347). These results, amongst others, convinced the Franklin commission that "having finally demonstrated by decisive experiments that the imagination without magnetism produces convulsions, &#x00026; that magnetism without imagination produces nothing" or state otherwise that the otherwise impressive effects of magnetism was fully driven by its incidental and not by any characteristic treatment constituents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Instructions for experimental groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>IRB trial protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>DRKS0000942.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187400.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>EW.csv.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187400.s006.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187400.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kazdin</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mediators and mechanisms of change in psychotherapy research</article-title>. <source>Annu Rev Clin Psychol</source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>3</volume>: <fpage>1</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>27</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091432">10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091432</ext-link></comment>
