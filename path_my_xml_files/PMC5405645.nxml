Metformin is the most widely used ISA to treat irregular menstruation; however, the gastrointestinal side effects are quite debilitating. The development of herbal medicines such as bioactive fraction DLBS3233 offers a possibly effective treatment with minimal side effects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>To determine the effect of metformin and DLBS3233 on serum AMH level.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted between March 2013 and June 2015 at Yasmin Clinic, RSCM Kencana, Jakarta and Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung. The patients with PCOS were diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. All participants received daily treatment consisting of 1500 mg metformin divided into two doses or 100 mg DLBS3233 for 6 months. An evaluation of serum AMH level was conducted before and after the completion of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>Twenty patients received metformin, whereas 18 patients received DLBS3233. The levels of AMH prior to the intervention were 9.30 &#x000b1; 5.06 ng/mL and 11.27 &#x000b1; 6.47 ng/mL. After 6 months of therapy, we found that the decrease in AMH level was higher in the metformin group compared to the DLBS3233 group (&#x00394;AMH = 1.83 ng/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 and &#x00394;AMH = 1.15 ng/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.077, respectively).

However, the Rotterdam criteria have simplified the diagnosis of PCOS. A patient has to fulfill two out of the following three criteria: (1) oligo- and/or anovulation (OA), (2) hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical) (HA), and (3) polycystic ovaries (PCO) on ultrasound examination, after other etiologies have been excluded.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Four different phenotypes in PCOS have been acknowledged based on the following criteria: phenotype A (OA + HA + PCO), phenotype B (HA + OA), phenotype C (HA + PCO), and phenotype D (OA + PCO).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Several factors have been found to be correlated with the development of PCOS, including insulin resistance (found in 50&#x02013;70% of the patients with PCOS).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] More recently, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, was found to be a contributing factor. Because a follicular arrest is present in the patients with PCOS, a study found that serum AMH level may increase up to threefold higher in the patients with PCOS than in controls without PCOS.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A recent Indonesian study also found that serum AMH level may increase to 2.5 times that of healthy women.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the Indonesian population, the cutoff value of AMH level in the patients with PCOS is determined as 4.45 ng/mL (sensitivity 76.1% and specificity 74.6%).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Because of the involvement of AMH in the pathogenesis and insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of PCOS, the condition can be managed by administering insulin-sensitizing agents (ISAs), with metformin being the most widely used ISA. However, to date, the effect of ISAs on AMH level remains controversial.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Studies reveal that the administration of metformin may reduce the serum level of AMH,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with several side effects including vomiting.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] New medications with insulin-sensitizing properties such as bioactive fraction DLBS3233 may become a promising and effective ISA with minimal side effects for the patients with PCOS.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>DLBS3233 is a herbal medicine produced in Indonesia containing herbal extracts combination containing <italic>Lagerstroemia spesiosa</italic> and <italic>Cinnamomum burmanii</italic>. This medicine has been known to increase glucose uptake by cells as well as adiponectin secretion. DLBS3233 can also stimulate the increase of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) translocation from the cytoplasm into the membrane and can increase the genetic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level, resulting in the synthesis of new GLUT-4. DLBS3233 has also been investigated as an antidiabetic for type 2 diabetes mellitus.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>DLBS3233 has a promising effect on insulin resistance and, therefore, PCOS; however, to our knowledge, no studies have been published on the use of DLBS3233 in the management of PCOS, especially on its effect on serum AMH.

The participants who did not come back for follow-up or did not consume the medications for two consecutive weeks were considered as dropouts. Serum AMH, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were examined at baseline and after 6 months of treatment, or immediately after a participant is confirmed pregnant. At the end of the study, the side effects, menstrual diary, lifestyle, and physical conditions of the participants were also assessed.

Serum AMH level in both metformin and DLBS3233 groups was initially very high (9.3 &#x000b1; 5.06 ng/mL and 11.27 &#x000b1; 6.47 ng/mL, respectively). This finding was consistent with that of previous studies on the patients with PCOS showing increased serum AMH level up to 2.5&#x02013;3 times than that of women without PCOS (9.5 &#x000b1; 5.11 vs. 3.53 &#x000b1; 1.95, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] AMH is known to decrease follicle sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); thus, with a high AMH level, folliculogenesis arrest may occur.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] On the contrary, with low AMH level, the inhibitory effect of AMH can be suppressed and follicle sensitivity to FSH can return to normal. Studies have shown that ISAs can reduce insulin resistance[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and can also decrease AMH level.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A study by Fleming <italic>et al</italic>. examined a patient with PCOS after treatment with 3 &#x000d7; 500 mg metformin daily. The study showed a decreasing level of AMH up to 1.5 ng/mL in the fourth month and 2.3 ng/mL in the eighth month.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In this study, both metformin and DLBS3233 decreased AMH level up to 1.83 ng/mL and 1.15 ng/mL, respectively.</p><p>To date, the exact mechanism of how ISAs can decrease AMH level remains unclear. The effect of DLBS3233 in the patients with PCOS has not been thoroughly studied, although some studies have shown that DLBS3233 may increase insulin sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It is believed that metformin is capable of improving ovarian morphology by increasing peripheral resistance to insulin and increasing sex-hormone binding globulin level in the liver. These mechanisms are believed to be capable of normalizing luteinizing hormone (LH) level, thus increasing FSH level.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Recently, the use of metformin in the management of PCOS is proven to be superior to pioglitazone. After treatment with metformin, the rate of ovulation induction is higher than placebo [odds ratio (OR) 3.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.25&#x02013;6.69; number needed to treat (NNT) 4.4].[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another study by Kandarakis[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also showed less insulin resistance and a decreasing level of androgen in the obese-type patients with PCOS who received 2 &#x000d7; 850 mg metformin daily for 6 months. In this study, as many as 13.15% of the patients conceived spontaneously after the administration of metformin.</p><p>However, a 2012 systematic review by Tang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that there were some side effects with metformin, especially nausea (OR 4.27; 95% CI 2.4&#x02013;7.59). This gives rise for the need of a new ISA with less side effects. DLBS3233 has been shown to have a positive outcome without serious side effects. Tjandrawinata <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that the administration of DLBS3233 did not cause gastrointestinal disturbances and had a lower risk of hypoglycemic episodes. In this study, no patient experienced nausea after treatment with DLBS3233 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006). Other side effects such as diarrhea and headaches were also considerably less compared to the metformin group. Overall side effects in the DLBS3233 group were significantly lower than in the metformin group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). After the administration of ISAs, seven patients (18.26%) conceived naturally, with five in the metformin group and two in the DLBS3233 group. Most patients conceived 3 months after the start of treatment. A meta-analysis by Palomba <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in 2014 demonstrated that the use of metformin would increase the pregnancy rate (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.10&#x02013;3.44; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the number of patients was relatively small. Second, there was a high level of dropout (25%) from this study because of its long duration. Third, this study did not investigate the DLBS3233 mechanism of action in reducing serum AMH level.</p><p>In conclusion, both metformin and DLBS3233 could decrease the serum level of AMH. However, DLBS3233 showed fewer side effects compared to metformin. Further studies are needed to investigate the exact mechanism of ISAs in reducing AMH level.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors take full responsibility for the content of this article and wish to thank to all the members of Indonesian Reproductive Medicine Research and Training Center (INA-REPROMED), Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo, General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia; and Yasmin, IVF Clinic.</p></ack><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sirman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pate</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology, diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome</article-title><source>J Clin Epidemiol</source><year>2014</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>13</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group.
