The most important objective of root canal therapy is to minimize the number of microorganisms in root canal systems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The scientifically documented procedure was biomechanical preparation of the root canal during the first appointment, followed by the application of a calcium hydroxide dressing for one week or more. Root filling is then performed at the second or a later appointment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, it has been shown that calcium hydroxide fails to consistently produce sterile root canals and even allows regrowth in some cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Another approach is to eliminate the remaining microorganisms or to render them harmless by entombing them by complete obturation immediately after preparing and irrigating the canal space at the same visit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Many studies reported that one-visit endodontic treatment offers some potential advantages to both clinician and patient. In addition to being faster and very well accepted by patients, it may prevent the risks of root canal system contamination or recontamination between the clinical appointments. There was widespread acceptance of single visit endodontics for vital cases. Nevertheless, treatment in one session of necrotic pulps associated with periradicular lesions remains one of the important dispute in endodontics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Due to these conflicting opinions, the number of visits necessary to treat infected root canals is debated in recent years.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to compare and evaluate the clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence of periapical healing after root canal therapy of teeth with periapical pathology completed in single-visit or with ApexCal intracanal medication in two-visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Approval for the project was obtained from institutional ethical committee for research on human subjects. All the teeth for treatment were selected based on the following criteria. The primary inclusion criteria includes patients aged between 18 and 62 years, only single rooted teeth with Vertucci's type I canal configuration, teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology (periapical index (PAI) &#x02265; 3) and pulpal necrosis.</p><p>The exclusion criteria includes patients with any systemic diseases, pregnant patients, patients who had been taking antibiotics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids prior to time of treatment, patients who needs antibiotic premedication for dental treatment, if the tooth had been previously accessed, grossly decayed teeth where rubber dam isolation is difficult, teeth with calcified canals, and weeping canals.</p><p>Oral and written informed consent was obtained from the participants to join the study and understood the need to attend follow up sessions. During the recruitment period, a total of 64 single rooted teeth from 57 patients, 30 male and 27 female, with mean age of 40 years (age range = 18-62) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Six patients contributed more than one tooth in which five patients with two teeth and one patient with three teeth. A total of 14 patients had to be excluded from the randomization procedure. Five patients were on pain or antibiotic medication, seven patients were refused to participate in the study and two patients were not to be available for recall.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Endodontic treatment</title><p>A total of 64 single rooted teeth were selected and randomly divided into two groups to perform root canal therapy. Thirty-four teeth in group I were treated in one visit and 30 teeth in group II in two visits following a standardized protocol.</p><p>The procedure for both groups was infiltration of local anesthesia, rubber dam application, caries excavation if present, and access preparation. Working length was checked with root ZX apex locator (J. Morita corporation, Japan) and confirmed by using radiographs. The instrumentation was carried out using Protaper universal files (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) in a crown down manner according to manufacturer's instructions. Copious irrigation was done with 3% sodium hypochlorite (Prime Dental Products, India) and saline by canal clean needle (Ammdent, India) during and after instrumentation. RC-help (Prime Dental Products, India) was used as a lubricant during filing.</p><p>After instrumentation, canals were dried with paper points and were obturated at the initial appointment with gutta percha cones (META Biomed Co. Ltd, Korea) and AH plus (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) as a sealer, using lateral condensation technique. Teeth were then restored with glass ionomer cement (GC Gold Label, Japan) and postobturation IOPAR was taken.</p><p>For teeth assigned to group II, a paste carrier was used to carry ApexCal (Ivoclor/vivadent, Liechtenstein) medicament into the root canal and temporarily restored with cavit (3M ESPE, USA) and were scheduled for a second visit 7 days later. At the second appointment, the ApexCal was removed and canals were obturated with similar methods and materials used for group I. A postobturation IOPAR was taken.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Radiographic technique</title><p>All patients in the study had a standardized X-ray series. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and recall radiographs were taken with individual bite blocks attached to the beam guiding device, Rinn Xcp holder (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland). All radiographic films were exposed and processed conventionally under similar conditions. During the endodontic treatment, working length or master-cone images, when appropriate, were obtained by freehand. The radiographs were then digitalized using Digital X-ray reader (Zhengzhou Smile Dental Equipment Co. Ltd., China).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Follow up</title><p>Patients were recalled at intervals of 3, 6, and 12 months to evaluate the treated teeth both clinically and radiographically.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Clinical assessment</title><p>Clinical assessment includes presence of clinical signs and symptoms at 12 months (spontaneous pain, presence of sinus tract, swelling, mobility, periodontal probing depths greater than baseline measurements, or sensitivity to percussion or palpation). The patients who had taken medication for any systemic illness during the follow-up period were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Radiographic assessment</title><p>Radiographic evaluation was done using the PAI scoring system given by Orstavik in 1986.

In order to eliminate any operator dependent variations in the results, all the teeth were treated by a single operator.</p><p>Calcium hydroxide has been widely used as inter appointment dressing because of its proven antibacterial properties, periapical tissue healing stimulation, and capacity to detoxify bacterial lipopolysaccharides.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The vehicle plays a most important role in the overall process because it determines the velocity of ionic dissociation causing the paste to be solubilized and resorbed at various rates by the periapical tissues and from within the root canal. There are various vehicles like aqueous, viscous, and oily. Aqueous vehicles have rapid ionic dissociation and consequently short-term action. Viscous vehicles permits slower liberation of hydroxyl ions, maintaining its action for a longer period, are preferable in teeth with periapical lesions. Oily vehicles may remain within the root canal for very long periods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> paste, which is commercially available as ApexCal, was taken. Polyethylene glycol present in this paste is a viscous vehicle, which maintains Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> action for a longer period. It was used as an intracanal dressing for 7 days in accordance with the study done by Sjogren <italic>et al</italic>., demonstrated that a 7 day usage of calcium hydroxide medicament was sufficient to reduce canal bacteria to a level that gave a negative culture.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In this study, culture test was not performed in both treatment groups before obturation because culturing canals after the use of an intracanal medicament (especially calcium hydroxide) may largely demonstrate the carryover effect of residual medicament rather than elimination of bacteria from the canal space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Although longer observation periods might be ideal, evidence of periapical changes in bone density associated with healing should be apparent at 12 months when using the PAI, and longer observation times might not be necessary.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] We intend to perform follow-up evaluation on patients in this study at 3, 6, and 12 months in consistent with the results of earlier studies.</p><p>Clinical symptoms were rare during the follow-up period. Thus, the outcome was classified mainly on the radiographic evaluation using PAI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>When scores obtained by radiographic evaluation were submitted to Mann &#x02014; Whitney U test, there was no statistically significant difference between teeth in groups I and II at either the baseline, 3, 6, or 12 months evaluation. This finding is in consistent with the results of majority of well controlled clinical studies done.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>These results are in contradiction with earlier studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] where they showed that calcium hydroxide treatment would be statistically superior to one-visit treatment. This could be attributed to difference in the sampling of patients, designs of the studies, and treatment procedures.</p><p>Even though Wilcoxon signed rank test showed no statistically significant difference between two groups, the decrease in mean PAI scores showed better improvement in group II than in group I. This might be due to the use of intracanal dressing ApexCal for one week in group II. These results were comparable with the findings of earlier studies done by Trope <italic>et al</italic>. and Penesis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, although the percentage of healed teeth were more in group II than in group I. Chi-square test showed no significant difference between the two groups, could be due to the small sample size.</p><p>The findings of current study clearly demonstrate that mechanical instrumentation, chemical disinfection, and obturation plays an important role in healing of periapical lesions. In the present investigation, the size of the periapical lesion was proven to be a risk factor. That means that a larger periapical lesion was associated with a lower probability to resolve within a given period of time than a smaller lesion.</p><p>The insignificant results between the two groups in this study may be due to true observed insignificant difference or because of the low sample size. Properly designed randomized clinical trials are needed to further explore the results. The basic demographic characteristics of the two study groups were similar, and neither group varied significantly from the study dropouts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, there was no statistically significant difference in radiographic evidence of periapical healing between one-visit and two-visit group at 12 months follow-up. Both groups exhibited a statistically significant decrease in PAI scores from baseline to 12 months evaluation. Both groups showed improved healing in almost similar percentage of teeth at the end of 12 months.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
