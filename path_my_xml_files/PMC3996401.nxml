martial arts training on anaerobic threshold, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood lactate
recovery. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen healthy university students were recruited and
divided into an exercise group and a control group (n = 7 in each group). The subjects who
participated in the experiment were subjected to an exercise loading test in which
anaerobic threshold, value of ventilation, oxygen uptake, maximal oxygen uptake, heart
rate, and maximal values of ventilation / heart rate were measured during the exercise,
immediately after maximum exercise loading, and at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15&#x02005;min of recovery.
[Results] At the anaerobic threshold time point, the exercise group showed a significantly
longer time to reach anaerobic threshold. The exercise group showed significantly higher
values for the time to reach VO<sub>2max</sub>, maximal values of ventilation, maximal
oxygen uptake and maximal values of ventilation / heart rate. Significant changes were
observed in the value of ventilation volumes at the 1- and 5-min recovery time points
within the exercise group; oxygen uptake and maximal oxygen uptake were significantly
different at the 5- and 10-min time points; heart rate was significantly different at the
1- and 3-min time points; and maximal values of ventilation / heart rate was significantly
different at the 5-min time point. The exercise group showed significant decreases in
blood lactate levels at the 15- and 30-min recovery time points. [Conclusion] The study
results revealed that Taekwondo as a security martial arts training increases the maximal
oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold and accelerates an individual&#x02019;s recovery to the
normal state of cardiorespiratory fitness and blood lactate level. These results are
expected to contribute to the execution of more effective security services in emergencies
in which violence can occur.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Security martial arts</kwd><kwd>Taekwondo</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic threshold</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Taekwondo has high value as a security martial arts training technique due to its
scientific basis and educational and physical training effects. Highly trained professional
security guards use their bodies as a weapon, which helps them to perform their security
services, and the combination of security techniques and martial arts maneuvers enables them
to react efficiently to given situations. Sport scientists have developed and applied
logical and effective training programs using Taekwondo as a martial arts training
technique. Further, they have identified the physiological limitations of exercise
capacities and conducted various studies to predict and assess the exercise abilities of
security personnel who know martial arts<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among these factors, the anaerobic threshold (AT) is an important indicator for objective
assessment of the functional capacity attained through Taekwondo training. Individuals with
a high AT are capable of generating energy by using organic metabolism even during
high-intensity exercises. This ability delays the onset of muscle fatigue and enables the
continuation of high-intensity exercises <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, the AT is an important criterion for judging whether
to continue or stop an exercise.</p><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is another excellent indicator for assessing
cardiorespiratory system performance by using a maximum exercise-loading test and heart rate
(HR) recovery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. One report stated that
individuals who train regularly recover their resting HR after maximum exercise loading more
rapidly than those who do not train<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
is attributable to autonomic nervous system activation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Autonomic nervous system responses to physical movements are
governed by the parasympathetic nerves in the resting state, while sympathetic nerve
activation occurs during exercise. Inversely, when the body is gradually brought back to the
resting state after exercise, the parasympathetic nerves gradually become dominant
again<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Practitioners of Taekwondo are
well aware of this nervous system mechanism, and their HR recovery capacities are known to
be superior. The HR decreases rapidly during the first 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;min after maximum exercise
loading, while the recovery speed decreases after 3&#x02005;min<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ability to remove blood lactate indicates an individual&#x02019;s ability to perform an
endurance exercise or continue exercising more intensely<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in lactate removal ability translates into decreased
lactate accumulation during exercise, not only in the blood but also in the activated
muscles; this phenomenon is conducive to recovering cell homeostasis and increasing recovery
capacity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While several studies have assessed HR within the 3- or 5-min recovery period and
investigated how it correlates with the AT, few studies have investigated respiratory, HR,
and blood lactate recovery responses in detail. Further, by investigating CRF and lactate
recovery capacity as blood fatigue markers, information can be obtained about which is
required for emergency responders to manage situations that are likely to occur during
intense and repeated Taekwondo training for security martial arts. The results of this study
are expected to provide basic physiological data to improve security services. With this
purpose in mind, this study was conducted to determine the effect of Taekwondo training on
the recovery of AT, CRF, and blood lactate to resting levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 14 healthy male university students aged 20&#x02013;23&#x02005;years with
no medical diseases and no history of drug abuse. The exercise group (n = 7) comprised
security majors who had been regularly practicing Taekwondo for &#x0003e;3&#x02005;years, while the
control group (n = 7) consisted of general university students with no martial arts
experience, including Taekwondo, during the preceding 3&#x02005;years. All subjects were educated
about the contents and purpose of the experiment prior to its beginning and were asked to
provide written informed consent prior to participating. The Kyungwoon University ethics
review board approved this study, which complies with the Declaration of Helsinki
principles.</p><p>The subjects&#x02019; body heights (cm) and weights (kg) were measured by using an automatic
measurement device (DS-102; Jenix, Seoul, Korea), and their body mass indices (BMI) were
calculated by using the equation BMI = weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>). Body fat
percentage was analyzed by using a BMI measuring device (InBody 4.0; Biospace, Seoul, Korea)
that employs the bioelectrical impedance method. The subjects&#x02019; physical characteristics are

maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>), HR, and oxygen pulse (O<sub>2</sub> pulse);
measurements were obtained during the exercise, immediately after the maximum exercise
loading, and at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15&#x02005;min of recovery. The measurements were taken by using a
treadmill and metabolic gas analyzer system (Quark b<sup>2</sup>; Cosmed, Italy). The
maximum exercise-loading test was performed by using the Bruce protocol. In compliance with
the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, the maximum capacity was considered reached when the respiratory
exchange ratio was &#x0003e;1.15 and the rate of perceived exertion was &#x0003e;17, when the
VO<sub>2</sub> value no longer increased with increasing exercise intensity, or when the
subject wished to stop.</p><p>The O<sub>2</sub> pulse was calculated by dividing the VO<sub>2</sub> by the HR
(O<sub>2</sub> pulse = VO<sub>2</sub>/HR) during the exercise testing and recovery.
Postexercise recovery was induced by having the subject walk lightly (speed, 1.3 mph;
gradient, 0%) for 30 sec immediately after the exercise period; after the treadmill halted
completely, the respiratory rate and HR were measured for 15&#x02005;min with the subject sitting on
a chair. HR was monitored with electrocardiography, and respiratory variables were measured
by using the expired gas metabolism analysis system. The ventilation threshold (VT)
necessary for the AT assessment was determined by using the modified V-slope method. The VT
was determined to be the time point at which VO<sub>2</sub> started to increase nonlinearly
in relation to the VCO<sub>2</sub>. Blood lactate concentrations were measured with a
lactate analyzer (Lactate Pro-LT1710; Arkray, Inc.) during the exercise, immediately after
maximum exercise loading, and at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15&#x02005;min of recovery.</p><p>Data analysis was performed by using independent t-tests to compare the intergroup
differences in the change in average values. To express the intergroup differences at each

group than in the control group. This finding signifies that regular exercise training
increases AT, that an exercise of higher intensity can be performed after training, and that
higher VO<sub>2</sub> occurs without full recovery of the resting-state lactate level. Even
with the increase in VO<sub>2max</sub>, the AT appears at a higher level after training.
Kinderman et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the AT is
an important factor in choosing the optimal exercise intensity. Kumagai et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that exercise performance is more
closely related to the VO<sub>2</sub> at the AT than to the VO<sub>2max</sub>. At the
maximum exercise loading time point, all variables, namely RVO<sub>2max</sub>,
VE<sub>max</sub>, VO<sub>2</sub>, VO<sub>2max</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> pulse, were higher.
The finding that Taekwondo practitioners have superior CRF-related variables at the maximum
exercise loading time point suggests that they can execute high-endurance exercises at a
higher intensity and pace.</p><p>An individual&#x02019;s CRF level is their capacity to supply sufficient amounts of oxygen to meet
increasing oxygen demands of activated muscles. An individual&#x02019;s endurance level depends on
this capacity. Muscular endurance training such as Taekwondo practiced as security martial
arts increases the efficiency of the oxygen transport system. In particular, the
O<sub>2</sub> pulse is the value obtained by dividing VO<sub>2max</sub> by HR and denotes
the amount of oxygen supplied by each heartbeat. Therefore, it is used as an indicator of
circulatory system efficacy. Because it is related to the difference between arterial and
venous blood oxygen pressure differences, which is tantamount to the arteriovenous oxygen
content difference, along with cardiac output, it can indirectly assess the amount of oxygen
extracted from the activated muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The finding of this study that O<sub>2</sub> pulse at the maximum exercise loading time
point was significantly higher in the exercise group implies that Taekwondo practitioners
demonstrate a superior capacity to supply adequate oxygen to their tissues and extract
oxygen from activated muscles during training. This may be attributable to the increase in
blood flow and density in the peripheral skeletal muscles, greater opening of the capillary
vessels, and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference in the muscles activated because of
the mutual adaptation of muscle and peripheral tissue induced by continuous training.</p><p>At the maximal exercise loading time point, the recovery CRF-related variables appeared to
be higher in the Taekwondo practitioners undergoing regular training. This result may be
explained by the increased vascular elasticity, control of the autonomic nervous system, and
functional adaptation of the cardiorespiratory system with the increase in aerobic power
because of regular training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, while most CRF-related variables showed significant differences until the 5-min
recovery time point, VO<sub>2</sub> values were significantly different up to the 10-min
recovery time point. This result signifies that Taekwondo practitioners have higher
respiratory rate recovery capacities than non-practitioners, as their respiration rate
recovery curves reached the resting state more rapidly.</p><p>Observations of the changes in blood lactate level revealed that the exercise group had a
higher lactate removal ability at 15 and 30&#x02005;min of recovery. The blood lactate concentration
increases through lactate accumulation when the anaerobic glycolysis-induced lactate
production rate exceeds the aerobic glycolysis-induced lactate removal rate during
high-intensity exercise<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The higher CRF
level and increased lactate removal rate after exercise seen in the exercise group is
assumed to be due to improved aerobic-anaerobic efficiency. Moreover, regular exercise
increases the density and exchange surface area of the capillary vessels and shortens the
diffusion distance between the place of lactate synthesis and the capillary vessel wall,
thereby improving the lactate exchange ratio<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such a capacity signifies a rapid recovery from muscle fatigue,
which is expected to improve physical motion in response to emergencies.</p><p>Taken together, the results of this study show that Taekwondo training as security martial
arts improves VO<sub>2max</sub> and the AT, increases CRF, and improves blood lactate
clearance rates. Such results are believed to contribute to the performance of more
effective security services in emergencies that may even turn violent.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Seo</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The Effect of electrical stimulation on blood lactate
