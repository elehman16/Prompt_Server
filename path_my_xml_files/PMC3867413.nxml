Today, even advanced tumours with infiltration into neighbouring organs can be resected with good long-term outcome. Increasing numbers of diagnosed cystic lesions of the pancreas are a further reason for the increased need for distal pancreatectomies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Despite low mortality rates in high-volume centres, the morbidity of this operation remains high, at up to 64% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The most common morbidity following a distal pancreatectomy is postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Insufficient healing of the resection margin causes leaking of aggressive pancreatic fluid into the abdominal cavity. Passive drainage tubes are routinely placed intra-abdominally in distal pancreatectomies. If any fluid from the abdominal cavity shows elevated levels of amylase on or after the third postoperative day, a POPF has to be assumed according to the consensus definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Most patients with a POPF are not limited by their physical condition and require no additional diagnostic or therapeutic steps; this condition is defined as a Grade A POPF. In these patients, the drainage tubes are removed slowly and in a stepwise manner during the following days or weeks, most often as an outpatient treatment. If they are not drained, these enzyme-rich intra-abdominal fluid collections often induce pain, lack of appetite, and vomiting, resulting in a prolonged hospital stay. Secondary bacterial infection of these collections can cause additional septic complications to varying degrees. Clinically impaired patients often need further therapeutic interventions such as nasogastric tubes, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and interventional drainage. Very rarely, angiography or further surgery is needed. Depending on the patient&#x02019;s condition and the therapeutic interventions needed, the patient may be diagnosed with clinically relevant Grade B or Grade C POPF (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Definition and clinical grading of</bold> POPF <bold>according to the international study group on pancreatic fistula</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Definition</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Volume of drainage fluid on or after.</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Grade A</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clinical condition is good; at most little changes in management are needed.

New techniques are needed to avoid this complication.</p><sec><title>Preliminary data</title><p>Ever since distal pancreatectomies were first performed, there has been a longstanding debate as to the most effective technique for closure of the pancreatic remnant. For a long time, several different techniques were practiced side-by-side without good evidence in favour of or against any of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In 2005, a systematic review and meta-analysis verified this lack of evidence. Due to compromised comparability because of non-standardised surgical procedures or varying definitions of a POPF, the rates ranged from 0% up to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The DISPACT trial compared the two most commonly used techniques (hand-sewn suturing vs. stapler closure) in a large randomised multicentre trial. In that trial, the detected POPF rate was 36%, demonstrating that secure primary closure of the pancreatic resection margin is far from assured with the current techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports have highlighted the potential advantage of additional coverage of the pancreatic remnant with autologous serous peritoneal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A prospective series from our institution confirmed that reduced rates of POPF were associated with shorter hospital stays and reduced treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Closure with autologous patches is not a new technique, but it has long been underused. In the 1970s, peritoneal and pleural patches were used to prevent leakages in anastomoses after oesophageal and colorectal resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The falciform patch was initially used in the closure of duodenal and gastric perforations in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In 2006, its use in the context of distal pancreatectomies was first described when skeletonised vessels were wrapped with a falciform patch to protect them from erosion bleeding due to POPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Iannitti et al. introduced the use of the falciform patch to cover pancreatic anastomoses in order to prevent POPF in pancreaticoduodenectomies and distal pancreatectomies in a retrospective series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the results of recent studies highlighting this technique in distal pancreatectomies have to be interpreted with caution due to certain methodological drawbacks including mixed populations, inadequate or missing control groups, and non-uniform definitions of POPF.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><sec><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p>DISCOVER will aim to compare the effectiveness of additional reinforcement of the pancreatic stump by means of a coverage technique for preventing a POPF compared to hand-sewn closure alone in distal pancreatectomies.</p><p>The following hypotheses will be tested:</p><p>H<sub>0</sub>: The risk of developing POPF is equal in both groups.</p><p>H<sub>1</sub>: The risk of developing POPF is different between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population and location</title><p>The study population for the DISCOVER trial will consist of patients undergoing primary elective open surgery for benign and malignant tumours, chronic pancreatitis, or pseudocysts of the pancreatic body or tail.

The expected POPF rate of 16% in the experimental group is based on the results of all available studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in which coverage of the remnant was performed and the internationally accepted definition of POPF was used (according to ISGPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The POPF rate in the control group is expected to be 36% based on the 30-day follow-up results of the DISPACT trial in which no group received additional coverage. With alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;5% and beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;20%, a sample size of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;75 per group is necessary to detect a difference between the two groups when the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (two-sided analysis) is used. It can be expected that including covariates of prognostic importance (age, BMI, and extent of resection) in the logistic regression model that is applied in confirmatory analysis will increase the power as compared to that of the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics, study registration and consent</title><p>Before the start of recruitment, this trial was approved by the independent ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg and registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00000546). The DISCOVER trial will be conducted in the context of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All patients assigned for distal pancreatectomy at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg, will be screened for eligibility on the day before the operation. During this preoperative visit, patients will be informed about the clinical problem of POPF, the timeline of the DISCOVER trial and the possible risks and benefits of participation before they will be asked to give their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and the intention-to-treat principle</title><p>Patients will be randomised intraoperatively once the surgical decision to perform a distal pancreatectomy has been made. Block randomisation was chosen and a random list was generated using the PROC PLAN feature of SAS software&#x02122; (Cary, NC, USA). The randomisation process will be paper-based (using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes) and performed by members of the study centre at our surgical department. If a distal pancreatectomy will be performed but the randomised procedure is not fulfilled, the patient will stay in the allocated group for analysis, according to the intention-to-treat principle. If the surgical procedure of a distal pancreatectomy is not accomplished, e.g., because of inoperability or the need for total pancreatectomy, the patient will be excluded from final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatment</title><sec><title>Standardised surgical approach (control group)</title><p>The type of abdominal incision (longitudinal or transverse laparotomy) will be determined by the surgeon performing the procedure. After exploration of the abdominal cavity, the pancreas will be revealed and transsected by scalpel (fish-mouth technique) or by stapler. The pancreatic duct will be identified and closed by crossing stitches. The dorsal and ventral edges of the resection margin will be adapted using single stitches. Further manipulation of the pancreatic remnant such as use of fibrin glue or reinforcement with meshes will not be allowed.</p><p>The decision to perform an additional splenectomy or cholecystectomy is up to the surgeon&#x02019;s preference. Further abdominal organ resections (e.g., multivisceral resection), as well as resection of vessels, do not conflict with the protocol.</p><p>Photodocumentation of the pancreatic stump should be performed before closure of the abdomen to document the type of stump closure.

Following the existing literature, it is expected that the coverage procedure will not extend operation time or increase blood loss, although both of these potential outcomes will be assessed as secondary endpoints within the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events and serious adverse events: accessing and reporting</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is any sign or symptom that impairs the patient&#x02019;s well-being. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that is life-threatening, prolongs hospital stay, results in persisting disability, or leads to death during the period of observation. AEs and SAEs will be recorded by means of daily postoperative ward visits until discharge and a telephone interview on postoperative day 40, performed by members of the study team (see below). All AEs of clinical relevance and all SAEs will be documented in the case report form. The trial investigator must be informed within 24 hours about SAEs that occur during hospital stay. The presence of a causal relationship between AEs or SAEs and the trial intervention will be judged by the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative data collection</title><p>Daily visits with study patients on all wards will be performed by clinical investigators and study nurses attached to the clinical study centre in order to collect information on the primary and secondary outcome parameters and to identify any AEs or SAEs.

Randomisation will be performed by study nurses attached to the clinical study centre at the Department of Surgery at the University of Heidelberg. The decision of whether to perform a distal pancreatectomy or a pancreaticoduodenectomy cannot be made before abdominal exploration has been performed. Therefore, randomisation will be performed as soon as the decision on a resection strategy has been achieved by the surgeon. However, if patients are excluded after randomisation, e.g., because of a need for total pancreatectomy, the randomisation number will not be reused.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimizing treatment bias</title><p>Although the coverage procedure is a technically simple method and quick to perform, we predict that surgeons who are unfamiliar with it will experience a learning curve until they overcome their individual technical difficulties. At the trial institution, however, the coverage procedure has been performed since 2009, so all surgeons participating in the study are familiar with it.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimizing measurement bias</title><p>Detection and grading of primary and secondary endpoints will be based on records kept during the hospital stay. Members of the study team will not be involved in treatment decisions. Blinding is not needed since occurrence of POPF is an objective endpoint that cannot be influenced by the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

We will distinguish between the following subpopulations: all patients who were randomly assigned to one of the groups will be analysed in the full analysis set according to the intention-to-treat principle. The per protocol analysis set will include patients without major protocol deviations, while in the safety analysis set patients will be analysed according to treatment rather than randomly. During data review, deviations from the protocol will be assessed as &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;major&#x0201d;. Major deviations from the protocol will lead to the exclusion of the patient from the per protocol analysis set.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmatory analysis</title><p>The null hypothesis of the proposed trial assumes that the rate of POPF type A&#x02013;C is equal in the two intervention groups. A binary logistic regression model will be applied in order to compare POPF-rates in the two groups, adjusting for age, BMI and extent of resection. Confirmatory analysis will be based primarily on the full analysis set, which is consistent with the intention-to-treat principle as it includes all patients as randomised. Missing values will be replaced by means of the ICA-r method described by Higgins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additionally, sensitivity analyses will be performed according to alternative methods for dealing with missing data, such as complete case analysis. In the final analysis, c_alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0087 (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, two-sided) will be applied.</p><p>Concerning the secondary endpoints, exploratory data analysis will be performed calculating appropriate summary measures for the empirical distribution (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) as well as descriptive two-sided <italic>P</italic> values. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the perprotocol population as well as for the appropriate subgroup (e.g., covering methods). The safety analysis will include calculation and comparison of frequencies and rates of complications and SAEs. Furthermore, statistical methods will be used to assess the quality of the data and the homogeneity of the intervention groups. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.1 or higher.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Distal pancreatectomies are performed for benign or malignant tumours in most cases. Despite the increasing caseload, the morbidity associated with this kind of operation remains high, mainly due to POPF, which occur in up to 60% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are needed for these patients, leading to prolongation of their hospital stay, readmission, and an increase of treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, POPF can persist for up to six months. It can be assumed that quality of life is considerably impaired in fistula patients.</p><p>The DISCOVER trial will evaluate the technique of additional coverage of the pancreatic remnant and its effectiveness at reducing the rate of POPF after distal pancreatectomies. Using the ISGPF-definition of POPF will enable us to compare our results to those of other trials. The thesis that quality of life is impaired by POPF will be tested by means of a validated questionnaire (EQ-5D questionnaire; EuroQol Group Foundation).</p><p>If the use of the coverage procedure can be shown to reduce the rate of POPF, this would help to establish the coverage procedure as a standard technique after distal pancreatectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The DISCOVER trial is currently still recruiting.
