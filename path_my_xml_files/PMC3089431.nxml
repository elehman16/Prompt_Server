While combined oral contraceptives contain both an estrogen and a progestogen component, the overall effect of combined oral contraceptives on the endometrium is considered to be attributable to the progestogen component,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijwh-3-127">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijwh-3-127">6</xref> the effects of which are mediated via the progesterone receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-3-127">7</xref></p><p>Dienogest (DNG) is one of several new progestogens that have been introduced in recent decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijwh-3-127">8</xref> It is a specific progesterone receptor agonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-3-127">7</xref> and combines the properties of both 19-nortestosterone derivatives and progesterone derivatives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijwh-3-127">9</xref> Consequently, DNG has a unique pharmacological profile and a pronounced effect on the endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-3-127">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijwh-3-127">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-3-127">10</xref></p><p>DNG 2 mg (Visanne<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Germany) is indicated for the treatment of endometriosis. At this same dose, DNG also represents the progestogen component of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 30 &#x003bc;g and of a continuous hormone replacement therapy containing estradiol valerate (E<sub>2</sub>V) 2 mg. Both preparations are highly effective in their respective indications, and are well tolerated and associated with a favorable bleeding profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijwh-3-127">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijwh-3-127">14</xref> Attempts to develop estradiol-containing combined oral contraceptives have historically been characterized by suboptimal cycle stability and bleeding irregularities, particularly when administered as monophasic or biphasic regimens,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijwh-3-127">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijwh-3-127">19</xref> although excellent contraceptive efficacy in clinical studies has been achieved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijwh-3-127">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijwh-3-127">20</xref> More recently, a novel oral contraceptive comprising DNG and E<sub>2</sub>V in a dynamic estrogen step-down and progestogen step-up dosing regimen has become available in many countries worldwide. This regimen comprises an extended hormone-containing phase (26 days), including four days of unopposed estrogen delivery, and a shortened hormone-free interval (two days). The E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG oral contraceptive has been shown in clinical trials to be an effective contraceptive that is well tolerated and associated with a good bleeding profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijwh-3-127">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijwh-3-127">22</xref></p><p>This study was designed to investigate the contraceptive efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG regimen in 1377 women of reproductive age, using the preparation as an oral contraceptive; the primary findings of this trial have previously been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijwh-3-127">22</xref> The E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG regimen was associated with an overall unadjusted Pearl Index of 0.73 and a well-controlled and regular bleeding pattern. E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG was well tolerated and mean body weight generally remained stable throughout the study visits. A large majority of the women reported unchanged or improved physical and emotional well-being, compared with their pretreatment status, as well as a high degree of overall satisfaction with the study drug.</p><p>The importance of investigating endometrial changes in women using new combined oral contraceptives as indicators for the development of endometrial cancer is reflected in the European Medicines Agency Guideline on Clinical Investigations of Steroid Contraceptives in Women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijwh-3-127">23</xref> Therefore, histological assessment of endometrial biopsy samples was undertaken in a subgroup of women aged 18&#x02013;50 years to assess the endometrial safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Design and participants</title><p>The full methodological details of this trial have previously been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijwh-3-127">22</xref> Briefly, this was a multicenter, open-label, noncomparative study of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG, administered using an estrogen step-down and progestogen step-up dosing regimen. To assess the effect of the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG regimen on the endometrium, endometrial histology was assessed in a subgroup of women from selected study centers who took part in this trial.</p><p>Healthy female volunteers (aged 18&#x02013;50 years) requesting contraception, who had a body mass index of &#x02264;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a normal cervical smear test result, were included in this trial. Participants in the study were either new users of hormonal contraception or had switched from another oral contraceptive. Exclusion criteria were generally consistent with the usual contraindications for combined oral contraceptive use. The use of long-acting hormonal contraception immediately prior to the study was not permitted. In addition, no endometrial biopsies were taken from women with an acute genital infection, as diagnosed at the discretion of the investigator. Women in the endometrial biopsy subgroup discontinued the study if the screening biopsy revealed relevant pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Women participating in this trial received treatment for a total of 20 cycles. Each 28-day cycle comprised E<sub>2</sub>V 3 mg on days 1&#x02013;2, E<sub>2</sub>V 2 mg/DNG 2 mg on days 3&#x02013;7, E<sub>2</sub>V 2 mg/DNG 3 mg on days 8&#x02013;24, E<sub>2</sub>V 1 mg on days 25&#x02013;26, and placebo on days 27&#x02013;28. One tablet was taken daily with no tablet-free interval between cycles. In the first treatment cycle, the first tablet was taken on the first day of menstrual or withdrawal bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Endometrial biopsies were taken between days 12 and 19 of the cycle, both at screening (including during active use of another oral contraceptive prior to switching to treatment with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG at visit 2) and at cycle 20 (or at a final examination if women prematurely discontinued the study between cycles 6 and 20). If insufficient tissue was obtained, the biopsy was repeated within four weeks.</p><p>Endometrial biopsies were taken with a pipelle and did not require dilation of the cervix or anesthesia. Endometrial material was obtained from the anterior or posterior wall of the fundus area. Material taken from the tubal corner or the endocervix was deemed inappropriate, and was not used. The Laboratorium f&#x000fc;r Klinische Forschung (LKF), Kiel, Germany was responsible for providing materials and organizing logistics. For the evaluation of endometrial biopsies, the specimens were sent to LKF. One pathologist (reader) assessed the samples. Thereafter, the samples were stored at LKF to enable a rereading procedure at a later time point, if necessary. To evaluate the endometrial safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG, each endometrial biopsy sample was classified according to one of three categories, ie, insufficient material, normal/nonsuspicious, or abnormal. Histological categories for the evaluation of the endometrium are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijwh-3-127">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For this prospectively defined subgroup analysis, endometrial biopsies were planned to be taken in a subgroup of 250 women at screening and at the final examination. Taking into consideration a dropout rate of 40% over 20 cycles, which is typically observed in long-term studies of oral contraceptives, approximately 150 biopsies were aimed to be available at cycle 20. No formal sample-size calculation for the number of biopsy samples was performed. Biopsy results are presented as a percentage of the total number of assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject disposition</title><p>A total of 1377 women were included in the study. Endometrial biopsies were taken in 283 of these women at screening. An endometrial biopsy was undertaken in 218 of these women at a final examination.

Abnormal biopsy findings at screening were seen in two women (both classified as &#x0201c;simple hyperplasia without atypia&#x0201d;). These women were therefore prematurely withdrawn from the study.</p><p>Of the normal endometrial biopsies observed at the screening visit, the majority were of the &#x0201c;proliferative&#x0201d; type. Just over one-third of biopsies (35.4%) were &#x0201c;atrophic&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d;. At the final examination, there were no abnormal findings of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy. Normal endometrial biopsy results were seen in 204 women (93.2%). Nonassessable results were recorded in 14 women (6.4%). Overall, 24.7% of the normal biopsies at the final examination time point were &#x0201c;atrophic&#x0201d;, 39.3% were &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d;, 11.4% were of the &#x0201c;proliferative&#x0201d; type (weakly [8.2%], disordered [1.8%], or actively [1.4%]), 16.9% were of the &#x0201c;secretory&#x0201d; type (progestational [10.5%] or cyclic [6.4%]), and 0.5% were of the &#x0201c;menstrual&#x0201d; type. In total, 80.9% of women had an atrophic, inactive or secretory endometrium.</p><p>There were five women with a diagnosis of endometrial polyps at screening. The polyps were classified as &#x0201c;atrophic&#x0201d; in three women and as &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; in two women. In all five women, a biopsy was taken at the final examination. There were no women with signs of endometrial polyps at the final examination. Signs of limited focal endometrial metaplasia on a background of inactive endometrium were observed in four women overall; two women at the time of screening and two at the final examination. In all cases, there were no abnormal findings of endometrial hyperplasia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this prospectively defined subgroup analysis demonstrate the endometrial safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG administered in an estrogen step-down and progestogen step-up regimen, including four days of unopposed estrogen. After 20 cycles of treatment, endometrial biopsies revealed an inactive or atrophic endometrium in 64% of women. Of note, no findings of hyperplasia or malignancy were observed during 20 cycles of treatment.</p><p>Estrogen exerts a stimulatory effect on the endometrium, and long-term unopposed exposure to even low doses is associated with a substantial risk of abnormal endometrial growth, as has been extensively reviewed previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-3-127">24</xref> Indeed, the administration of unopposed estrogen to postmenopausal women has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijwh-3-127">25</xref> and endometrial cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijwh-3-127">26</xref> Although the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG oral contraceptive used in the current study includes four days (days 1&#x02013;2 and days 25&#x02013;26) of unopposed E<sub>2</sub>V, there was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia. These results support data from previous studies of combined oral contraceptives, which did not observe any changes that could be described as hyperplasic or malignant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijwh-3-127">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijwh-3-127">30</xref></p><p>The stimulatory effect of estrogen on the endometrium is opposed by progestogens, which inhibit estrogen-induced endometrial proliferation. In the current subgroup analysis, good suppression of endometrial activity was observed. Furthermore, endometrial suppression was evident at a time point of the treatment cycle between day 12 and day 19, when the proliferative stimulation by the estrogenic compound is expected to approach its maximum level. DNG is a selective progesterone receptor agonist that has potent endometrial activity when administered orally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-3-127">7</xref> DNG exerts a potent progestogenic effect at the level of the endometrium, counteracting estrogenic activity. In postmenopausal women receiving estrogen, this results in protection of the endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijwh-3-127">31</xref> Furthermore, it is important to know the effect of a new contraceptive formulation on the endometrium because endometrial function also plays an important role in the uterine bleeding process.</p><p>The results of the current subgroup analysis are comparable with those of a limited number of studies that have assessed the endometrial effects of other cyclic or extended low-dose combined oral contraceptives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-3-127">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijwh-3-127">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijwh-3-127">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijwh-3-127">30</xref> In a study by Anderson et al, women received a 91-day extended regimen of ethinylestradiol 30 &#x003bc;g/levonorgestrel 150 &#x003bc;g that provided low-dose estrogen (10 &#x003bc;g) instead of placebo during the typical seven-day hormone-free interval.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijwh-3-127">27</xref> During active treatment, 70% of women had an inactive or atrophic endometrium. Similarly, after 13 cycles of treatment with ethinylestradiol 30 &#x003bc;g/drospirenone 3 mg in a 21-day regimen with a seven-day tablet-free period, 63% of women had an atrophic endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-3-127">2</xref> Also, histological and ultrasonographical evaluations confirmed that the proliferative activity of the endometrium was suppressed by this oral contraceptive treatment. Furthermore, no adverse endometrial effects were observed after 13 cycles of a continuous combined oral contraceptive regimen (ethinylestradiol 20 &#x003bc;g/levonorgestrel 90 &#x003bc;g); 52% of women receiving this regimen had endometrial histology results categorized as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;, which primarily included an inactive or benign endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijwh-3-127">29</xref> In another study, no adverse endometrial effects were observed among women who received a 21-day ethinylestradiol 20 &#x003bc;g/desogestrel 150 &#x003bc;g regimen with a reduced hormone-free interval and five days of unopposed estrogen treatment (placebo was administered on days 22&#x02013;23, followed by ethinylestradiol 10 &#x003bc;g on days 24&#x02013;28).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijwh-3-127">28</xref> In a recent study by Rabe et al, 59 women underwent endometrial biopsy to examine the effect of ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg/chlormadinone acetate 2 mg administered in a 24/4-day regimen on endometrial histology. After six treatment cycles, ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg/chlormadinone acetate 2 mg demonstrated effective and reversible endometrial effects without exerting any pathological effects. At cycle 6, 16% of subjects had a secretory and 60% an inactive endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijwh-3-127">30</xref></p><p>The use of estradiol as the only estrogen component in combined oral contraceptives has so far not been successful because it has been characterized by suboptimal cycle stability and bleeding irregularities, particularly when administered as monophasic or biphasic regimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijwh-3-127">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijwh-3-127">19</xref> This can be explained by local enzymes (eg, 17&#x000df;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) which, in the presence of a progestogen, are stimulated within the endometrial cells, causing rapid oxidation of estradiol to estrone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijwh-3-127">32</xref> Therefore, the local level of estradiol is also reduced, which may cause the incidence of intermenstrual bleeding to increase. Furthermore, sequential preparations are known to improve cycle stability in women experiencing bleeding irregularities. Early estrogenic dominance is hypothesized to ensure initial endometrial proliferation and sensitivity for mid-cyclic progestogen action and endometrial stroma stability, particularly towards the end of the cycle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijwh-3-127">21</xref> To ensure estrogen dominance in the first cycle phase, ie, the stage at which the proliferation of the endometrium is promoted under estrogen influence, E<sub>2</sub>V was administered on days 1&#x02013;26 of the cycle at doses stepped down from 3 mg to 1 mg. Essentially, the shortened hormone-free interval to only two days, the progestogen dominance in the mid-to-late part of the cycle, and the estrogen-only phase before and at the end of the progestogen phase were expected to increase the cycle stability.</p><p>It has been shown previously that E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the present formulation is associated with a bleeding pattern and cycle control profile that is comparable with that of a low-dose ethinylestradiol-containing oral contraceptive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijwh-3-127">21</xref> In the present study, the overall frequency of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was relatively stable throughout the treatment cycles, ranging between 76.8% and 81.6% during cycles 1&#x02013;19. Furthermore, only 0.1% of 1377 women discontinued the study medication prematurely due to the absence of withdrawal bleeding.</p><p>The number of women with intracyclic bleeding decreased during the course of the study from 24.0% during cycle 2 and reaching the lowest level of 10.2% during cycle 18. In general, there were fewer women with intracyclic bleeding episodes during the second half of the study compared with the first half of the treatment cycles. Only 2.5% of women prematurely discontinued study medication due to menstrual bleeding irregularities.</p><p>The results of this analysis are reassuring on several counts. Firstly, this is one of the largest and longest studies assessing endometrial histology with combined oral contraceptives in women of childbearing age, and the study was conducted over a period of up to 20 cycles. Also, this study population included women aged 18&#x02013;50 years and, therefore, included women in their late reproductive years who might be at an increased risk of endometrial pathology.</p><p>At screening, almost one-half of the normal biopsy samples were &#x0201c;proliferative&#x0201d;, while one-third of normal samples were &#x0201c;atrophic&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d;. This reflects the heterogeneous group of women that were included in the study, which consisted of new users of hormonal contraception (ie, spontaneously cycling women) and women switching from other oral contraceptive. At the final examination, only 11.4% of the normal biopsies were of the &#x0201c;proliferative&#x0201d; type.</p><p>Endometrial polyps were observed in five women at screening and in no women at the final examination. It is not possible to claim that the use of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG is associated with a decrease in endometrial polyps, but no additional cases of polyps were detected, suggesting that the preparation does not have a deleterious effect in this setting. It should be noted that it is not possible to ensure, by performing an endometrial biopsy, that each and every polyp had disappeared. However, small polyps are not a contraindication for the use of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG or low-dose oral contraceptives in general.</p><p>Consistent with results reported for other low-dose combined oral contraceptives, this prospectively defined subgroup analysis demonstrated that an oral contraceptive containing E<sub>2</sub>V and DNG is safe and effective to transform the endometrium to a secretory/inactive or atrophic status and exhibits no deleterious effects on the endometrium of women aged 18&#x02013;50 years during 20 cycles of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Lutz Riethdorf and Dr Wolfgang Krause, the study pathologists, for their help in conducting the endometrial biopsy analyses.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study, including medical writing support provided by Anna Mett of <italic>in</italic>Science Communications, a Wolters Kluwer business, was funded by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>JB has acted as a consultant to or received honoraria from Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Schering Plough, Gr&#x000fc;nenthal, Procter and Gamble, and Lilly, and has received grants from Gr&#x000fc;nenthal, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Organon, Lilly, Schering Plough, Pfizer, Solvay, and Novo Nordisk.
