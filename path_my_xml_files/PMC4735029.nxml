fermented by <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> strain Shirota containing 32.5% isoflavone aglycones (FSM)
or placebo soymilk containing no isoflavone aglycones (SM). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
single-dose, crossover trial, 7 healthy premenopausal Japanese women (mean age: 35.3 &#x000b1; 11.0) consumed FSM or
SM on day 1 and crossed over to the other soymilk after a 6-day washout period. Serum isoflavones in blood
samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hr after intake were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with
tandem mass spectrometry. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the serum concentrations of genistein and
total isoflavones were significantly higher, by about 1.4-fold, up to 5 hr after FSM intake compared with SM
intake (each p&#x0003c;0.05), and that of daidzein tended to be higher after FSM intake. In addition, AUC analysis
of total isoflavones for individual subjects revealed that 5 out of 7 subjects had higher AUC values after FSM
intake compared with SM intake and that the 2 remaining subjects had similar AUC values. These 2 subjects had
higher AUC values after SM intake (mean, 2,502 &#x000b1; 348) than those of the other subjects (mean, 1,158 &#x000b1; 269).
These results indicate that the bioavailability of isoflavones, especially genistein, is enhanced after the
intake of FSM containing 32.5% isoflavone aglycones compared with intake of SM containing no isoflavone
aglycones and that the enhancement is observed in healthy premenopausal Japanese women whose isoflavone
absorption capacity is low after SM intake.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>isoflavone aglycone</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>area under the curve</kwd><kwd>fermented soymilk</kwd><kwd>premenopausal women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In Japan, the soybean has long been consumed as a traditional foodstuff. Several epidemiological studies have
suggested that populations with the highest consumption of soybean products have the lowest risk of breast and
prostate cancer, and furthermore, women in this group experience less severe menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Isoflavones, which are contained in large quantities in
soybeans, are thought to be involved in many of these benefits, as there are similar chemical structures in
isoflavones and estrogen, the main female sex hormone, and studies have demonstrated that isoflavones not only
have estrogen-like effects but also can suppress the effects of excessive estrogen [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The glycoside form of isoflavones, which is normally present in soybeans, does not demonstrate physiological
effects; these kinds of effects are instead observed when the aglycone form is consumed [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When glycosides are ingested, they are hydrolyzed by &#x003b2;-glucosidase derived from gut
microbiota and the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the resulting aglycones are absorbed through the intestine and
circulated throughout the body, where their physiological actions take place [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there are great interindividual differences in
the absorption and metabolism of isoflavones (due to ethnicity, dietary habits, the form that the isoflavones
are consumed in, etc.), which are mainly attributed to differences in gut microbiota. It is possibly due to
these interindividual differences in isoflavone absorption and metabolism that there are inconsistencies in
studies examining their activities; in contrast to the abovementioned studies [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], several other epidemiological
studies have denied that soybean products and isoflavone consumption are correlated with lowered risk of breast
cancer [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, blood levels of isoflavone are
considered good markers of physiological effects. In fact, other epidemiological studies have demonstrated that
there is a low risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer in subjects with higher plasma isoflavone levels
compared with those with lower levels [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Soybean products fermented with microbes having &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity, such as miso and soy sauce, have a
moderate level of isoflavone aglycones (from 10 to 60%), but unfermented soybean products have almost no
isoflavone aglycones [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
Epidemiological studies among the Japanese population, whose consumption of soybean products is high, have
reported that higher miso consumption is associated with lower risk of breast cancer and coronary heart disease
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results suggest
that fermented soybean products have better isoflavone effects than unfermented soy products, presumably because
of a higher bioavailability of isoflavone aglycones. Additionally, Toi et al. reported in an epidemiological
study among Japanese women that dietary habits involving the intake of both soy foods and dairy products
containing <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> strain Shirota (LcS) may be useful for preventing breast cancer
[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our previous studies have also demonstrated that the development
and growth of mammary tumors are suppressed by soymilk and LcS, respectively, and that soymilk fermented by LcS
containing isoflavone aglycones has more potent suppression of this development compared with unfermented
soymilk in an animal carcinogenic model [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, it remains unclear how the fermentation of LcS enhances the suppressive
potential of soymilk and whether it enhances isoflavone bioavailability.</p><p>To investigate the effect of the fermentation of LcS on the pharmacokinetics of isoflavones after the intake of
soymilk fermented by LcS containing moderate levels of isoflavone aglycones (&#x0201c;fermented soymilk&#x0201d;; FSM

premenopausal Japanese women to investigate the effect of fermentation of LcS on the pharmacokinetics of
isoflavones after the intake of FSM compared with SM intake. This study demonstrated that the AUC value of total
isoflavones was significantly higher up to 5 hr after the intake of FSM compared with SM intake.</p><p>Daidzein and genistein were detected in serum after the intake of FSM and SM, but glycitein was barely
detected. This is likely because both the FSM and SM contained glycitein and the glycoside of glycitein at
levels below the detection limit. The daidzein metabolites, DHD, <italic>O</italic>-DMA, and equol, were also
barely detectable in serum. These metabolites are produced from daidzein by gut microbiota, and they have been
reported to be detectable in the serum from 5 hr to 48 hr after intake [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Due to ethical considerations, we were able to collect
blood samples only up to 5 hr after intake in the present trial, and it is possible that such metabolites had
yet to become detectable.</p><p>The concentrations of daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavones changed over the course of the trial, with
higher concentrations seen after the intake of FSM compared with SM intake. Specifically, significantly higher
concentrations were detected at 1, 2, and 5 hr after intake for daidzein, 1 and 2 hr after intake for genistein,
and 1, 2, and 5 hr after intake for total isoflavones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs. 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003"> 3</xref>, and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004"> 4</xref>). Although there were
no significant differences in C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> between FSM and SM, the AUC value of daidzein
was higher and the AUC values of genistein and total isoflavones were significantly higher after the intake of
FSM compared with SM intake (<xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These findings support the
previously reported results indicating that genistein has a higher absorption efficiency than daidzein [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated that the absorption efficiency of total isoflavones for the 24 hr after intake
is 35.8% for normal soymilk as opposed to 65.9% for soymilk fermented by <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>
Yakult and <italic>Lactobacillus mali</italic> with 90% or more isoflavone aglycones [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], indicating that fermentation enhanced bioavailability by approximately 1.8-fold. The
present study revealed absorption efficiencies of total isoflavones of 11.2% up to 5 hr after the intake of FSM
with 32.5% isoflavone aglycones and 8.0% up to 5 hr after the intake of SM, suggesting that fermentation
enhanced bioavailability by approximately 1.4-fold. Our previous study also demonstrated that 35.8% of the total
isoflavones in SM are absorbed during the 24 hr after intake and that the concentration returns to the baseline
level at 24 hr after intake. There was a similar pattern in the changes in the serum concentration of total
isoflavones up to 5 hr after intake in our previous study [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the
present study. These findings suggest that about 22% of the amount of total isoflavones absorbed over the course
of 24 hr would be absorbed in the first 5 hr, and that the bioavailability of isoflavones can be adequately
assessed from analysis of the serum isoflavone concentration up to 5 hr after intake with fewer blood
collections.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic analysis in the present study showed that there were 2 peaks in the changes in the serum
concentrations of daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavones after intake of FSM and SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs. 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003"> 3</xref>, and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004"> 4</xref>), which is consistent with other previously reported results [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
The second peak (at 2&#x02013;5 hr after intake) may be due to enterohepatic circulation, in which the absorbed daidzein
and genistein are released as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in the gut together with bile and then
subsequently reabsorbed after being deconjugated by gut microbiota. However, the concentrations of total
isoflavones were almost the same between the first peak (0&#x02013;2 hr after intake) and the second peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs. 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003"> 3</xref>, and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004"> 4</xref>). This suggests that the 2-peak phenomenon is based on not only
enterohepatic circulation but also other factors.</p><p>All subjects showed 2 peaks after the intake of FSM and SM in the pharmacokinetic analysis of total isoflavones
for individual subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, in all subjects, the
serum concentrations of total isoflavones after the intake of FSM were higher at the first peak (0&#x02013;2 hr after
intake), and the AUC value of total isoflavones up to 2 hr after intake was significantly higher after intake of
FSM compared with SM intake (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that other fermented soy products with a
moderate proportion of isoflavone aglycones may have enhanced bioavailability at least up to 2 h after intake.
However, there were two patterns regarding the second peak (2&#x02013;5 hr after intake); in 5 of the 7 subjects
(Subjects 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7), there was a higher concentration after the intake of FSM, and in the 2 remaining
subjects (Subjects 2 and 3), there was a higher concentration after the intake of SM. Isoflavone aglycones
(daidzein and genistein), but not their glucosides, have been reported to be absorbed in the stomach in animal
models [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has been also reported that isoflavone glycosides are
converted to aglycones by &#x003b2;-glucosidase located in the mucosa of the upper gastrointestinal tract and that the
aglycones are then absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract into the blood circulation in GF mice [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is well known that gut
microbiota are very diverse and show great interindividual differences, although it can be assumed that the
activity of &#x003b2;-glucosidase, located in the mucosa of the upper gastrointestinal tract, will show fewer
interindividual differences than gut microbiota. Our findings indicate that the first peak may be derived from
isoflavone aglycones ingested from FSM directly as well as those converted from the glycosides in FSM and SM by
mucosal &#x003b2;-glucosidase in the upper gastrointestinal tract; furthermore, the second peak may be derived from
isoflavone aglycones via not only enterohepatic circulation but also conversion from the glycosides contained in
FSM and SM by &#x003b2;-glucosidase in gut microbiota in the lower gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>A group of 5 subjects (Subjects 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7) had higher AUC values after the intake of FSM compared with
SM intake. However, the remaining 2 subjects (Subjects 2 and 3) had similar AUC values after the intake of FSM
and SM. These 2 subjects had higher AUC values after SM intake (mean, 2,502 &#x000b1; 348) than those of the other
subjects (mean, 1158 &#x000b1; 269) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings suggest that the
2 subjects may have had strong gut microbiota &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity that facilitated the production of
isoflavone aglycones from the glycosides, leading to high AUC values after the intake of SM. We also speculate
that bioavailability was enhanced in the 5 subjects after the intake of FSM compared with intake of SM, who had
lower AUC values after the intake of SM, due to high absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract (shown as
the first peak) as well as activation of &#x003b2;-glucosides in the gut microbiota in association with LcS and/or
fermentation, which was observed as a the second peak (2&#x02013;5 hr after intake).</p><p>In conclusion, our placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in premenopausal healthy Japanese women
revealed that the bioavailability of isoflavones, especially genistein, is enhanced after the intake of FSM
containing 32.5% isoflavone aglycones compared with intake of SM containing no isoflavone aglycones and that the
enhancement is observed in healthy premenopausal Japanese women whose isoflavone absorption capacity is low
after intake of SM. Furthermore, the results of pharmacokinetic analysis of serum isoflavones for each subject
suggest that the enhancement is associated with beneficial effects of LcS and/or soy fermentation on gut
microbiota having &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity as well as the increase of isoflavone aglycones due to fermentation by
LcS. Further studies are necessary to clarify these points in greater detail.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all subjects who were enrolled in the clinical trial. We also thank Mr. Tatsuo Uetake of CX
