Bacterial cultures were obtained from the conjunctiva and eyelid. Treatment was instilled in both eyes twice daily at 12-hour intervals for 14 days. The primary endpoint was complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms at Day 15. The secondary endpoint was complete bacterial eradication at Day 15 among subjects with positive bacterial cultures at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significantly more Group 1 subjects met the primary endpoint (27.1%) than those in Group 2 (15.6%; <italic>P</italic>=0.028), but not compared to Group 3 (23.5%; <italic>P</italic>=0.581). Significantly more Group 1 patients (60%) had complete bacterial eradication at Day 15 compared with Group 3 (40.2%; <italic>P</italic>=0.007), but there was no difference compared with Group 2 (66.3%; <italic>P</italic>=0.306). Adverse events were reported in about 25% of the subjects, with an equal distribution among treatment arms; the most common adverse event was irritation at the instillation site. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure differences were not statistically significant, but did show age and sex differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ISV-502 is effective in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis as evaluated by clinical cure and bacterial eradication scores. ISV-502 was superior to 1.0% azithromycin in clinical cure and superior to 0.1% dexamethasone in bacterial eradication.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>blepharitis</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>eye</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Blepharoconjunctivitis is characterized by inflammation of the outer eyelids and the conjunctiva that results in redness and swelling. It is associated with increased bacterial colonization, especially with <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species. It is diagnosed when there is simultaneous occurrence of blepharitis and conjunctivitis, and there are both inflammatory and bacterial components to the disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-2225">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-2225">3</xref> If left untreated, blepharoconjunctivitis may lead to scarring of the eyelid and loss of proper eyelid function over time with secondary damage to the ocular surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-2225">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-2225">2</xref> Several subtypes of blepharoconjunctivitis have been identified, including anterior disease, posterior disease (similar to blepharitis), angular blepharoconjunctivitis, seborrheic blepharoconjunctivitis, and atopic blepharoconjunctivitis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-2225">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-2225">2</xref> and different subtypes may require different treatment strategies. In atopic blepharoconjunctivitis, for example, an allergic component may be treated successfully with steroids, while a bacterial load would necessitate both antibiotics and steroids for an optimal and quick resolution.</p><p>Blepharoconjunctivitis commonly presents as diffuse inflammation of both the anterior and posterior lid margins as well as the conjunctiva and is usually associated with an increase in the local bacterial load.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-7-2225">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-2225">5</xref> Discharge secondary to blepharoconjunctivitis is not uncommon, and may result in patients reporting eye dryness with eyelids stuck shut in the morning and the presence of greasy and/or crusty eyelashes. Although blepharoconjunctivitis is more common among individuals of middle age or older, it also has been reported in childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-2225">6</xref></p><p>In its chronic form, acute onset blepharoconjunctivitis can lead to lid ulceration that results in malposition of tear duct and/or corneal sequelae. Although viral or bacterial microorganisms may cause blepharoconjunctivitis, toxins produced by the <italic>Staphylococcal</italic> spp. (in particular <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and <italic>aureus</italic>) have been implicated as a major cause of blepharoconjunctivitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-2225">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-2225">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-7-2225">7</xref> In general, <italic>S. epidermis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> are found in both the staphylococcal and mixed seborrheic-staphylococcal manifestations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-2225">3</xref> Other organisms found when culturing the lids and conjunctiva in patients with blepharitis include <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> and <italic>Corynebacteria</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-7-2225">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-2225">9</xref></p><p>A combination agent that addresses both the microbiological and inflammatory components of blepharoconjunctivitis may be highly effective in clearing signs and symptoms while eradicating the inciting organism or group of organisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-2225">8</xref> Currently, there is limited efficacy data regarding the available treatments for blepharoconjunctivitis, and there are no approved treatments in the United States. We evaluated the combination of 0.1% dexamethasone and 1.0% azithromycin compared to each component alone for the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis to determine if the combination would provide a greater therapeutic effect (that is, quicker resolution of the disorder) than the individual components used alone.

The study was conducted in compliance with all applicable governmental rules, ethical principles, Good Clinical Practice regulations, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Consultants Review Committee Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Austin, TX, USA) and Coast IRB (Colorado Springs, CO, USA). It was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the registry number NCT01408082.</p><p>All enrolled subjects were informed that the study drugs were being used for investigational purposes only. Written informed consent was obtained from all trial participants. Subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 years were required to provide written assent, and a parent or legal guardian was required to provide informed consent for all enrollees younger than 18 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 417 subjects were assigned to one of three groups: combination 1.0% azithromycin and 0.1% dexamethasone (ISV-502; InSite Vision Incorporated, Alameda, CA, USA; Group 1), 1.0% azithromycin alone (Group 2); or 0.1% dexamethasone alone (Group 3) in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a randomization schedule generated by the trial&#x02019;s sponsor. At each study site, subjects were randomized sequentially by assigning the number corresponding to the lowest numbered drug kit available at the site. All investigators were masked to the randomization code. All study medications were administered from identical multidose containers so that neither the participant nor the investigator knew which medication the subject was receiving.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included a positive diagnosis of blepharoconjunctivitis, defined as a presence of one of the eyelid signs (eg, lid margin redness or swelling), and one of the conjunctival signs (eg, bulbar conjunctival redness, palpebral conjunctival redness, or ocular discharge). In addition, the presence of an ocular symptom was required (eg, lid irritation, itchy eyelids, gritty eyes, or painful/sore eyes). Enrollees had to have a minimum total score of 5 in at least one eye to be eligible for study entry. For subjects who had both eyes qualify for the study, the eye with the highest combined clinical signs and symptoms score on Day 1 of the study was analyzed. If the total score was the same in both eyes, the right eye was designated as the study eye.</p><p>Other inclusion criteria were best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) &#x02265;20/100 in both eyes and an intraocular pressure (IOP) &#x02264;25 mmHg in either eye. To participate in the study, subjects had to agree to discontinue systemic antibiotic medication use at least 7 days prior to enrollment through to the end of the study, and subjects also could not have used any corticosteroid medication within 14 days prior to study enrollment. Exceptions were made to allow use of topical antibiotics on the face (except around the eyes) for dermatological conditions; also, the use of inhaled and nasal corticosteroids and topical dermal steroids (except on the eyelids) were permitted. Per study protocol, patients had to discontinue contact lens wear at least 72 hours prior to the first visit and throughout the duration of the study. Patients had to agree to not use eye makeup during the study. Patients had to discontinue use of any nondiagnostic topical ophthalmic solutions, including tear substitutes, and any medication that the investigator deemed may interfere with the study parameters (eg, likely to cause ocular drying).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included known sensitivity or poor tolerance to any component of the study medications, history of eyelid and/or ocular surgery in the previous 6 months, or an acute ocular and/or lash or lid infection or active ocular inflammation other than blepharoconjunctivitis. Patients with a history of glaucoma were also excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included any uncontrolled systemic disease or debilitating disease (eg, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or cystic fibrosis), any clinically significant cardiovascular disorders (eg, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months, Class III or IV congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias), any history of liver or kidney disease resulting in persisting dysfunction, or any active upper respiratory tract infection. Women of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to their entry into the study. Female subjects who had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or who were postmenopausal by at least 12 months or premenarchal were considered as not of childbearing potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><sec><title>Planned treatment protocol</title><p>Treatment in the study included combination 1.0% azithromycin and 0.1% dexamethasone (ISV-502; Group 1), 1.0% azithromycin alone (Group 2), or 0.1% dexamethasone alone (Group 3) instilled in both eyes twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals for 14 days. Subjects were instructed to place 1 drop of the study medication on his or her eyelid and one drop in the eye at each instillation. The first dose of medication was administered under an investigator&#x02019;s supervision, as was the morning dose during subject visits to the investigator&#x02019;s site. Study participants were responsible for the remaining instillations.</p><p>Instructions for administering all other doses at home were provided, and patients were asked to complete a dosing diary. Subjects were instructed to bring the bottles of study medication and subject diary at each planned study visit and return for all subsequent visits between 8 am and 11 am.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Identification of study medications</title><p>ISV-502 is a dual-agent investigational study drug comprised of the antibacterial agent 1.0% azithromycin and the corticosteroid 0.1% dexamethasone. The antibacterial agent 1.0% azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Azithromycin is classified as an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics, a class of drugs that arrest bacterial cell growth by inhibiting protein synthesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-7-2225">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-2225">13</xref></p><p>The anti-inflammatory component of ISV-502, 0.1% dexamethasone, is a potent corticosteroid commonly prescribed as an ocular anti-inflammatory agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-7-2225">10</xref> It is approved for ocular administration (both topical and periocular), as well as systemically.</p><p>A component of ISV-502, AzaSite&#x000ae; (1.0% azithromycin ophthalmic solution; InSite Vision), was approved for marketing in the US in April 2007 (NDA 50-810).

It also maintains the dexamethasone suspension and increases viscosity upon instillation, allowing for use as both an eye drop and an ointment.</p><p>ISV-502 is intended as a long-acting topical eye drop for twice-daily dosing over a 14-day treatment course.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Per protocol clinical visits</title><p>The per protocol (PP) clinical visits were planned as follows.</p><sec><title>Visit 1 (Day 1)</title><p>The investigator performed an initial eye examination, including assessment of BCVA, signs and symptoms of blepharoconjunctivitis in both eyes, biomicroscopy, and undilated ophthalmoscopy in both eyes. A culture of the eyelid and conjunctiva was taken from the study eye. After the culture was obtained, IOP was measured using applanation tonometry. Subjects not meeting the appropriate inclusion criteria were disqualified.</p><p>Following the eye examination, ocular culture, and instillation of the first dose of study medication, subjects were instructed to administer the second dose in both eyes at bedtime, and then twice daily (in the morning and evening) for the next 13 days.

A culture of the eyelid and conjunctiva was taken from the study eye; to ensure the dose was taken &#x02265;12 hours prior to culture, subjects were instructed to dose promptly the night before the visit. Following this, IOP was measured in both eyes using applanation tonometry. Subjects were asked to grade the frequency of the signs and symptoms of blepharoconjunctivitis since the previous visit.</p><p>When the study visit procedures were completed, the subject had to instill a drop of the study medication in both eyes and one drop on both eyelids at the study site under the guidance of a study staff member.

AEs were reported in about 25% of participants; most were mild to moderate in severity, and there was an equal distribution among treatment groups. The most frequently reported AE was instillation site irritation, which was more common in Group 1 and Group 2. Ocular disorders were more common in Group 3. Nasopharyngitis was reported in three subjects in Group 3.</p><p>One serious adverse event (SAE) was noted (coronary artery disease) that was not related to the study medication. A total of 13 subjects discontinued for AEs, including the patient with the SAE. Three subjects in Group 1 and two in Group 3 may have withdrawn for reasons likely attributable to study medications, including allergic reaction, burning upon instillation, increased IOP, and irritation.</p><p>Visual acuity was unchanged or improved at Visit 5 compared with Visit 1 in 91.4%, 87.9%, and 89.0% in Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-opth-7-2225">Table 5</xref>). Only one participant each in Group 1 and Group 3 had worsening of three lines or more at Visit 5. The majority of patients had no change on ophthalmoscopy or on slit lamp biomicroscopy examination.</p><p>At all follow-up visits, the mean change in IOP was higher in Group 1 and Group 3 than in Group 2. Median IOP change was zero in Group 2 and 1.0 mmHg in the other two groups. Among Group 1 patients, the change in mean IOP compared with baseline was 0.89&#x000b1;2.11 mmHg at Visit 2 and 1.25&#x000b1;2.78 mmHg at Visit 5. In Group 3, the mean IOP change increased 1.18&#x000b1;2.34 mmHg at Visit 2 and 1.04&#x000b1;2.66 mmHg at Visit 5. Only one patient experienced an IOP spike of more than 10 mmHg, but the patient was discontinued after an unrelated incident of herpes zoster ophthalmia.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment compliance</title><p>Treatment compliance was assessed by the subject&#x02019;s recording the date and time of each drug instillation; this data was reviewed by study staff at all follow-up visits. The subject was also questioned at each visit to determine if the subject had followed the dosing schedule. The first instillation of medication and the morning instillation of the medication at Visits 2&#x02013;4 were administered under supervision in the clinic and recorded. Noncompliance with study protocol based on diary data was a reason for study discontinuation.</p><p>The subjects were instructed to bring all study medications (used and unused) and subject diaries to each visit and to return medication at Visit 5 (Day 15&#x02013;16). On Visit 5 (Day 15&#x02013;16), all subject medication and the subject diaries were returned when the subjects exited the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized, double-masked comparative study found ISV-502 (combination arm) to be effective in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis and to be superior to each of its individual active ingredients in the ability to achieve both clinical resolution of the signs and symptoms (compared to azithromycin 1%), and bacterial eradication (compared to dexamethasone 0.1%) at Visit 5. Although there were differences among the treatment groups in the incidence of positive bacterial cultures, this was likely due to a small number of subjects with pathogens isolated, as the highest incidence was 17.3% for MSSE in Group 2 compared with 11.0% in Group 1 and 13.4% in Group 3. These same organisms and resistant types were also predominant in the eyelid only, but the incidences were greater; the highest incidence was for MSSE in Group 3 (43.3%) compared with 42.0% in Group 1 and 35.6% in Group 2.</p><p>Of note, bacterial eradication was sufficiently achieved at Day 8 (Visit 3) within the arms containing an antibiotic (combination arm, and azithromycin arm), and the eradication results did not significantly improve by Day 15, which was the end of the dosing period. It would be interesting to gauge the clinical improvement at the same visit and examine whether there is any correlation between bacterial eradication and clinical improvement. However, this study was designed only to evaluate the complete resolution of signs and symptoms (total score of 0) at each visit. As an example, those patients that had achieved 90% clinical resolution were not counted as a &#x0201c;success.&#x0201d;</p><p>While visual acuity was evaluated primarily for safety in the worse eye only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-opth-7-2225">Table 5</xref>), there was an improvement of one to three lines of visual acuity in approximately 15% of subjects across all groups, regardless of the administered investigational drug. One could speculate that if this analysis had been done in the better eye, that a larger percentage per group would demonstrate improved visual acuity from baseline to Visit 5.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests a hard course of combination therapy for 7 days followed by a long-term maintenance therapy, may be efficacious in treating blepharoconjunctivitis. Our study analyzed only full remission data, and we therefore cannot compare our outcomes to those with a shorter course of therapy. Generally speaking, eye care professionals aim to reduce both the bacterial and inflammatory aspects of the disorder, which limits the efficacy of either an antibiotic or a corticosteroid if used alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-7-2225">15</xref> Other studies have evaluated azithromycin 1% in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis, and outcomes have been mixed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-2225">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-7-2225">19</xref> The published literature also includes studies with higher dosing frequency than has been suggested here.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-7-2225">11</xref></p><p>As noted, the combination arm in this study proved superior to the other two arms in both bacterial eradication and clinical resolution of signs and symptoms of blepharoconjunctivitis. From a clinical perspective, this study can be considered a success; from a regulatory perspective, that is not the case. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advocates the combination of improved clinical signs and symptoms as its primary endpoint for the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis. Bacterial eradication is considered a secondary endpoint only. As our study results found the primary endpoint met in both the investigational product but also in the corticosteroid arm, this limits the regulatory definition of &#x0201c;trial success.&#x0201d; There is some weight to the US FDA&#x02019;s perspective, as a small number of patients presenting with blepharoconjunctivitis diagnosis proved to be culture negative. In real-world practice, however, the majority of clinicians prefer to address both bacterial load and clinical signs and symptoms to provide patients the broadest and most efficacious treatment.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Bacterial load was variable at baseline, potentially impacting interpretation of treatment effect on bacterial colonization. Because blepharoconjunctivitis can recur with some frequency, we recommend a longer-term study that would evaluate the recurrence rates to determine if ISV-502 is an effective prophylactic treatment as well.</p><p>In conclusion, ISV-502 was effective in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis as evaluated by clinical cure, with reduction in associated signs and symptoms and significant bacterial eradication at Visit 5 compared with baseline. This study supports twice-daily dosing with a combination of 1% azithromycin and 0.1% dexamethasone for 8&#x02013;15 days in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was presented in part at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology annual conference, 2011.
