The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence of oxymorphone extended-release (Oxy-ER) and a crush-resistant formulation of oxymorphone extended-release (Oxy-CRF).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In three open-label, randomized studies, healthy adults at a clinical research center received two single oral doses of Oxy-ER and two single doses of Oxy-CRF, each separated by a &#x02265;7-day washout. Doses were administered under fasted conditions (study 1, 5 mg doses; study 2, 40 mg doses) or after a high-fat breakfast (study 3, 40 mg doses). Subjects administered 40 mg doses also received naltrexone. The primary endpoint was systemic oxymorphone exposure; the bioequivalence criterion was met if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio (Oxy-CRF/Oxy-ER) for oxymorphone area under the curve from time 0 to the last measured concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>), AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>), and maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) were within 0.8&#x02013;1.25. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In studies 1, 2, and 3, the safety population comprised 30, 37, and 36 subjects and the pharmacokinetics population comprised 27, 30, and 29 subjects, respectively.

The 90% confidence intervals for plasma oxymorphone AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> fulfilled the bioequivalence criterion. Adverse event rates were similar with Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF (study 1, 25% versus 23%; study 2, 9% versus 16%; study 3, 20% each group).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oxy-CRF and Oxy-ER (5 mg and 40 mg) are bioequivalent under fasted and fed conditions, suggesting that Oxy-CRF will have clinical efficacy and safety equivalent to Oxy-ER.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abuse deterrent</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>oxymorphone</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>substance abuse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Between 1997 and 2006, the use of therapeutic opioids (mg/person) in the United States increased by 347%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-5-455">1</xref> Illicit opioid use, as with therapeutic use, has increased rapidly in the last decade.

A survey of prescription drug abusers entering drug rehabilitation found that 80% of abusers crush or chew extended-release opioids in order to abuse them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-5-455">2</xref> Chewing or crushing can also occur without intention of abuse in patients who have difficulty swallowing intact tablets and do not understand the consequences of misusing their medication in this way. Formulation of extended-release tablets that are resistant to crushing and accidental chewing may deter abuse and prevent adverse events from misuse.

In each study, healthy adults received two single doses of Oxy-ER and two single doses of Oxy-CRF during four alternating treatment periods according to one of two randomly assigned sequences. In study 1, subjects were administered 5 mg doses under fasted conditions; in study 2, subjects were administered 40 mg doses under fasted conditions; in study 3, subjects were administered 40 mg doses after a high-fat meal.</p><p>The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice, and US Food and Drug Administration regulations. The protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (Independent Investigational Review Board Inc, Plantation, FL), and all subjects provided written informed consent before participating.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy men and women aged 18&#x02013;45 years with a body mass index of 18.5&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and no history of disease or clinically significant findings on physical or laboratory examination were eligible to participate. Women of childbearing potential were required to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth control. Exclusion criteria were smoking, pregnancy, breast-feeding, allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids or naltrexone; a disease or condition that might interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, or otherwise put a subject at risk; positive screen for substances of abuse, recent history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or significant mental illness, human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis; recent (&#x02264;14 days) use of other medication, except hormonal contraception, and use of medication known to affect hepatic drug metabolism in the past 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Subjects received two single oral doses of 5 mg or 40 mg Oxy-ER and two single oral doses of Oxy-CRF, each dose separated by a &#x02265;7-day washout. Doses were administered with 240 mL of room temperature water that subjects were instructed to drink in its entirety. Medication was administered according to one of two treatment sequences with alternating treatment periods (ABAB or BABA) based on a computer-generated randomization schedule. During each treatment period, subjects were confined to the study unit from one day before dosing through 48 hours postdose. All medication was administered under supervision by study personnel, and treatment compliance was verified by a mouth and hand check.</p><p>Subjects treated under fasted conditions underwent a &#x02265;8-hour (40 mg doses) or &#x02265;10-hour (5 mg doses) overnight fast before drug administration and continued to fast through 4 hours after drug administration. Subjects treated under fed conditions underwent a &#x02265;10-hour overnight fast followed by a high-fat meal (two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, 4 oz hash brown potatoes, and 8 oz whole milk) initiated 30 minutes before drug administration. Subjects were instructed to eat the entire meal in &#x02264;30 minutes.</p><p>To limit the potential for opioid-related adverse events, subjects who were administered 40 mg doses received three single doses of naltrexone 50 mg during each treatment period (12 doses in all). Dosing occurred 12 and 2 hours before and 12 hours after each dose of Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF. Subjects not tolerating the two initial doses during the first treatment period were not randomized to treatment. Naloxone was readily available to all subjects in the event of respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>During each treatment period, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected predose (&#x02264;1 hour before drug administration) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after drug administration. Samples were kept frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysis. Oxymorphone and 6-hydroxy-oxymorphone (6-OH-oxymorphone) concentrations were determined using a simultaneous liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method validated for the range of 0.025&#x02013;10.00 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>], AUC from time 0 to the last measured concentration [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>], maximum plasma concentration [C<sub>max</sub>], and time to C<sub>max</sub> [t<sub>max</sub>]) were derived from the plasma concentration data using noncompartmental methods and actual sample times. AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> was calculated using the linear trapezoid rule, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> was calculated as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> plus last measured plasma concentration/terminal rate constant. The terminal rate constant (&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>) was calculated by linear regression of the terminal portion of the linear concentration versus time curve, and the terminal half-life [t<sub>1/2</sub>] was calculated as ln 2/&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Subjects were monitored for adverse events from one day before treatment through 15 days after the last dose of study medication. Relationship of adverse events to study medication (not, unlikely, possibly, or probably related) and intensity (mild, moderate, or severe) were determined by the investigator. Serious adverse events were defined as an adverse event that was immediately life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in death or permanent or substantial disability, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or might have jeopardized the subject and required medical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes. Complete physical examination was performed at screening and 48 hours after the last dose of study medication. Vital signs were recorded at screening, one day before each dose of study medication, and at specified times from 2&#x02013;48 hours after each dose of study medication. Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis were performed at screening, one day before the first dose of study medication, and 48 hours after the last dose of study medication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed in all subjects who received &#x02265;1 dose of Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF and were determined by the pharmacokineticist to have sufficient plasma concentration data to calculate AUC and C<sub>max</sub>. Pharmacokinetic data from subjects who had vomited within the first 12 hours of a treatment period were not analyzed. For calculation of mean concentrations, values below the limit of quantification were set to 0 or, if occurring between two other such concentrations, were indicated as missing. For calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters, plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification were set to 0 if occurring before the first measurable concentration and otherwise were indicated as missing.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized descriptively, using the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and t<sub>1/2</sub>) or the median and range (t<sub>max</sub>). Repeated measures analysis of variance with treatment as the fixed factor and subject within-treatment sequence as a random factor was performed on the log-transformed values for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>. Geometric mean ratios (Oxy-CRF/Oxy-ER) and 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by the antilog of the least squares mean differences and their CIs. The criterion for bioequivalence was met if the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratio (Oxy-CRF/Oxy-ER) for oxymorphone AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were within 0.8&#x02013;1.25.</p><p>The safety population comprised all subjects who received &#x02265;1 dose of Oxy-ER, Oxy-CRF, or naltrexone.

A sample size of 26 subjects was planned for each study. Assuming an intrasubject coefficient of variation of 30.2% for oxymorphone, and allowing for a 5% difference between treatment groups, this sample size would provide &#x02265;90% power to demonstrate bioequivalence using this replicated dosing design.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Subject disposition and characteristics</title><p>Subject disposition is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-5-455">Figure 1</xref>.

The difference in median t<sub>max</sub> was smaller when 5 mg doses of Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF were compared (6.0 versus 5.0 hours). The t<sub>max</sub> values roughly corresponded to the time at which the two early peaks occurred in the plasma concentration versus time profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-5-455">Figure 2</xref>). The range of t<sub>max</sub> was similar for the two formulations in each of the three studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma 6-hydroxy-oxymorphone pharmacokinetics</title><p>Mean plasma 6-OH-oxymorphone concentration versus time profiles were similar for Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF, regardless of dose or administration conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-5-455">Figure 3</xref>).

The most frequent adverse events, and the only adverse events that occurred in &#x02265;1 subject treated with a particular dose of Oxy-ER or Oxy-CRF, were nausea, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. Treatment-related adverse events were infrequent with both formulations (range for treatment groups, 3%&#x02013;13% of subjects). There were no severe adverse events, no adverse events, and no deaths. There were no clinically significant changes in physical examination findings, vital signs, or laboratory findings that were deemed to be related to treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These three randomized clinical trials evaluated the bioequivalence of the lowest (5 mg) and highest (40 mg) supplied dosage strengths of Oxy-ER and the same doses of Oxy-CRF in healthy adults under fasted (5 mg, 40 mg) and fed (40 mg) conditions. Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF demonstrated overall similar oxymorphone and 6-OH-oxymorphone plasma concentrations over time. Differences in t<sub>max</sub> between Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF were not clinically relevant. The criterion for bioequivalence of plasma oxymorphone exposure was met for all parameters (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>). In these subjects, most of whom also received naltrexone, Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF were generally well tolerated, with no discernable differences between formulations.</p><p>Findings were consistent overall for oxymorphone and its active metabolite, 6-OH-oxymorphone. For 6- OH-oxymorphone, overall systemic plasma exposure, as indicated by the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, did not differ between the two formulations, and data were supportive of the finding of bioequivalence with respect to oxymorphone.</p><p>In the 40 mg dose studies, naltrexone was administered at the beginning of each treatment period to limit opioid-related adverse events. Although naltrexone is reported to increase oxymorphone peak plasma exposure (data on file, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc), naltrexone administration in the current study is not likely to have affected the evaluation of bioequivalence because dose and time of administration were standardized across subjects and treatment periods.</p><p>The presence of peaks and shoulders in the concentration versus time curves has been observed in previous studies (data on file, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc). The timing of the later peaks often corresponds with eating and may be related to the known increase in systemic exposure to oxymorphone when administered with food,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-5-455">5</xref> combined with prolonged absorption from these formulations.</p><p>The bioequivalence findings indicate a 1:1 correspondence between doses of Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF. This would facilitate conversion from Oxy-ER to Oxy-CRF. In addition, the ratios for conversion of other oral opioid doses to Oxy-ER can be considered appropriate for Oxy-CRF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-5-455">5</xref></p><p>Study subjects were selected to satisfy US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for bioequivalence studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-5-455">8</xref> and not to represent the clinical population that would be using oxymorphone. Moreover, subjects treated with 40 mg doses also received naltrexone. Thus, the safety profile was not the same as in patients or healthy subjects not receiving an opioid antagonist. However, Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF had a similar safety profile for subjects administered an opioid antagonist (ie, naltrexone) along with an opioid. There were no important differences in the type or frequency of adverse events, regardless of dose or condition of administration (fasted or fed). There was also no indication of new adverse events or an increase in the frequency of adverse events with Oxy-CRF versus Oxy-ER.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of Oxy-ER have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials of up to 12 weeks and extension trials of up to one year in opioid-naive and opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-5-455">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-5-455">10</xref> cancer pain,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-5-455">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-5-455">12</xref> and osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-5-455">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-5-455">14</xref> Other benefits are the low potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions ( oxymorphone does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-455">15</xref> and simplified interpretation of urine testing (oxymorphone does not produce any metabolites that can be mistaken for another prescribed drug).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-5-455">16</xref> The bioequivalence findings of the studies reported here indicate that Oxy-CRF is expected to have clinical efficacy and safety equivalent to Oxy-ER.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Three randomized clinical trials demonstrated bioequivalence of Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF 5 mg under fasted conditions and 40 mg under fasted and fed conditions.
