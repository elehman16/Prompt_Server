Long-term care costs are largely affected by this increase because long-term care expenses tend to increase markedly with old age <xref rid="pone.0037444-deMeijer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As the aging population intensifies its demand and uptake of healthcare services, the contextual landscape is one of a decreasing labor market, higher demands for quality of care voiced by baby boomers, and uncertainty of incomes of older people <xref rid="pone.0037444-Nies1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-JedidJahJonker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Approximately 10&#x00025; of all Dutch elderly over the age of 75 live in elderly housing <xref rid="pone.0037444-Tomassini1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-Pot1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

There are approximately 100 residents per residential home <xref rid="pone.0037444-Nies1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. When senior citizens enter into a residential home, they keep their general practitioner if possible. There is a trend to keep the elderly in their own homes for as long as possible to maximize their level of independence as well as it can be less expensive from a governmental perspective <xref rid="pone.0037444-MinistryofHousing1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-vanEgdom1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the MIC model compared to usual care (UC) in a sample of 10 residential homes in the Netherlands.

Randomization was carried out on at the level of care facilities after matching for percentage of cognitively impaired residents, based on the assumption that a high percentage of cognitive residents would affect care-related needs and services. In the matching procedure, the two facilities with the highest percentage of cognitively impaired residents were matched, and so on. Randomization was carried out using the first column from Pocock's random numbers table.

Firstly, a quarterly in-home systematic and computerized multidimensional assessment of all residents by trained nurse-assistants systematically reviewed the functional health status and care needs using the InterRAI-LTCF which is a comprehensive, standardized instrument for evaluating the needs, strengths, and preferences of those in chronic care and nursing home institutional settings <xref rid="pone.0037444-interRAI1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The InterRAI-LTCF assessment form incorporates domains such as; function, mental and physical health, social support, medication and service use <xref rid="pone.0037444-interRAI1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The problem areas identified become the foundation for the individual care plan <xref rid="pone.0037444-interRAI1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Secondly, the outcomes of the assessment were discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting in the homes with the primary care physician, nursing home physician, nurse, psychotherapist and other involved disciplines. Lastly, a multidisciplinary consultation was offered to the frailest residents with complex health care problems which were identified by the level of expected resource utilization <xref rid="pone.0037444-Boorsma1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-Fries1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Clinical outcomes measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the sum score of the 32 risk-adjusted quality-of-care indicators <xref rid="pone.0037444-Boorsma3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The quality-of care indicators were based on observations recorded in the Long-term Care Facility assessment form <xref rid="pone.0037444-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The itemized observations needed to calculate these indicators were rated by independent trained interviewers. Inter-rater reliability of the quality-of-care indicators between interviewers and nurse-assistants in the intervention facilities was satisfactory (mean intra-cluster correlation single measure 0.74). The sum score of the quality-of-care indicators was determined by the number of indicators that were present per resident divided by the number of applicable indicators per resident. An example of a quality indicator is the presence of a feeding tube. Lower sum scores indicate higher quality of care.</p><p>Functional health, an important aspect of quality of life, was measured by COOP WONCA charts <xref rid="pone.0037444-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The COOPWonca chart consists of six dimensions: physical fitness, feelings, daily activities, social activities, change in health and overall health. These dimensions combined form a total COOPWonca score. Higher scores are indicative of better functional health.</p><p>The 12- Item Short Form health survey (SF12) was used to measure general quality of life.

Costs were calculated on an annual basis and then proportioned for the six month trial. Total costs of the intervention were divided by the total number of residents living in the intervention residential homes. Multidisciplinary meetings are part of usual care by law. However, in daily practice, not all homes hold these meetings on a regular basis. We also calculated costs for the meetings held in the usual care home. In a sensitivity analysis, only the license costs of the InterRAI and the InterRAI subscription costs per patient were included.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed according to the intention to treat principle. However, patients who did not provide baseline data or died during the study were excluded from the analyses. The multiple imputation function in SPSS-18 was used to predict missing values for cost and effect data. This function created five imputed data sets that were pooled together using Rubin's rules <xref rid="pone.0037444-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Individual cost components were imputed at a patient level instead of overall total cost per patient to minimize unnecessary deletion of information.</p><p>As patient-level cost data have a highly skewed distribution, bootstrapping was performed with 5000 replications to estimate Approximate Bootstrap Confidence (ABC) intervals around cost differences <xref rid="pone.0037444-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-Efron1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated by dividing the difference in total costs between MIC and UC by the difference in clinical effects. Non-parametric bootstrapping was also used to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the ICERs (5000 replications). The bootstrapped cost-effect pairs were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane (CE plane) <xref rid="pone.0037444-Black1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and used to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEA curves). CEA curves illustrate the probability that the intervention is cost-effective in comparison with the control treatment for a range of ceiling ratios.

General scales of functional health did not significantly differ between the groups at six month although quality of care was significantly higher in the MIC group. There was a trend that total costs were higher in the MIC than UC. For functional health and QALYs we concluded that the MIC was not cost-effective compared to UC. Whether MIC is considered cost-effective in comparison with UC for quality of care depends on the amount of money decision makers are willing to additionally spend on care for this group of elderly nursing home residents. Conclusions were similar in the complete case analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Explanation of the findings</title><p>This raises the question why was quality of care higher in the intervention homes compared to the control homes? It is possible the quality indicators in the control homes did not improve to the same extent as in the intervention homes because intervention participants were receiving increased attention from the residential home staff as well as increased referrals to secondary care. The increase in secondary care may have induced the need for the informal caregiver to attend and help transport patients to the secondary care appointments which may explain the increased informal care costs. If there was unmet care, then the use of the interRAI and the multidisciplinary meetings addressed this gap in care. However, a trade-off needs to be made whether the additional effects are worth the additional costs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Existing literature comparison</title><p>Previous studies suggest interRAI has positive effects on health outcomes in nursing facilities as well as in residential homes <xref rid="pone.0037444-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037444-Mor1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, there were criticisms on the study designs and the conclusions drawn indicating a need for better designed trials <xref rid="pone.0037444-Wagner2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A four month trial from New Zealand estimated health care services utilized and the cost of implementing the minimum data set home care assessment compared with UC <xref rid="pone.0037444-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. They found that the interRAI was significantly more costly in prescribed and delivered services compared to UC but the author believed that the cost differences may be due to a genuine need of services for this population <xref rid="pone.0037444-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We think that our trial is an important addition to the knowledge base on the effect of the interRAI in clinical care.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>The six month follow-up may not have been enough to capture all potential costs and effects. The duration of the trial was relatively short because of a high risk for drop out owing to the extreme vulnerability of residents and because the umbrella care organization intended to implement the care model in the control facilities as well. Patients in a residential home have a heterogeneous mix of chronic conditions that naturally erode health over time which makes it difficult to know if an intervention of this sort would be able to override the downward trend of health states associated with chronic conditions in such a short time span. The primary outcome variables may not have been sensitive enough to pick up differences within such a limited time interval. Another limitation was the considerable amount of missing data. In this study, non-completers tended to be older and had better activities of daily living scores. As the intervention really targeted only the frailest it could be that they did not feel like they were benefitting enough from the study intervention. In situations where there are missing costs, multiple imputation is recommended which was also performed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed benefit on quality of care, against a modest cost increase. Longer term follow up of costs and effects is needed to further substantiate the findings. Future research should consider the reasons why it did not translate over to the other clinical outcome variables. Its pragmatic study design resembles clinical practice to a high degree which increases the relevance of the study results.</p><p>Future research should consider the reasons why these patients in the Multidisciplinary Integrated Care group had higher quality of care indicators and why it did not translate over to the other clinical outcome variables. Moreover, ways to decrease MIC implementation costs could be beneficial for future cost-effectiveness analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0037444.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
