Physical investigations (including vital signs and resting electrocardiogram), blood sampling for laboratory examinations, and BP recordings were performed at Visit 1 (Week &#x02212;2). At all visits, seated SBP and DBP were recorded for each patient in both arms, using an appropriately sized cuff and a well-calibrated sphygmomanometer with a maximum rate of descent of 2 mmHg.

For patients whose DBP was &#x02265;90 mmHg at Week 8, treatment intensification by randomization to either olmesartan 40 mg/day or olmesartan 20 mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day resulted in improved BP control. By Week 12, the overall proportion of patients in the two randomized groups with DBP &#x0003c; 90 mmHg was 53.1% (333/627), and the proportion who achieved the combined BP goal of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg was 34.9% (219/627). Looking at the randomized treatment groups individually, the proportion of patients who achieved the combined BP goal of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg was greater in the group that received olmesartan 20 mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day (42.5% vs 26.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-5-723">Figure 2a</xref>). Differences between these two groups in proportions who achieved the individual goal of SBP &#x0003c; 140 and DBP &#x0003c; 90 mmHg were somewhat less marked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-5-723">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>For patients who received olmesartan monotherapy only (ie, non-randomized patients who received olmesartan 20 mg/day plus the randomized patients who received olmesartan 40 mg/day), the proportion who achieved the combined BP goal of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg at Week 12 was 60.3% (1113/1848). The proportions of monotherapy recipients who achieved the individual goals of SBP &#x0003c; 140 and DBP &#x0003c; 90 mmHg were 64.5% and 83.1%, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the combined BP goal of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg, the proportion of patients who achieved a more rigorous combined BP goal of &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg was also assessed. For all patients (randomized plus non-randomized) the proportion who achieved this goal at Week 12 was 27.4% (596/2173). For the randomized groups, the overall proportion of patients who achieved the BP goal of &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg at Week 12 was 10.4% (65/627). In the individual randomized groups, the proportion of patients who achieved the combined BP goal of &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg was higher in the group that received combination therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-5-723">Figure 2a</xref>). In patients who received olmesartan monotherapy only, 29.9% (553/1848) achieved the &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg goal.</p><p>Looking at patients with diabetes among the non-randomized patients, 16.4% achieved the guideline-recommended goal of 130/80 mmHg at Week 12. For randomized patients, the proportion who achieved the 130/80 mmHg goal was 6.7% and 9.7% in the olmesartan 40 mg/day and olmesartan 20 mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>AEs reported in the OLMEBEST study have been reported previously,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-vhrm-5-723">14</xref> and are described only briefly here. Generally, similar proportions of patients experienced AEs of mild, moderate and severe intensity during open-label treatment and in the two randomized treatment groups. During randomized treatment, olmesartan 40 mg/day was associated with a somewhat lower frequency of AEs than olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day (21.5% vs 28.3% of patients, respectively). The majority (72.4%) of the AEs were classified as being of mild intensity and only 6.4% of events were considered probably or definitely related to study drug. Dizziness (1.4%) and headache (2.5%) were the most commonly reported AEs in each group during randomized treatment. AEs that led to withdrawal from the study were reported in 7 patients in the olmesartan 40 mg group and 9 in the olmesartan plus HCTZ group. No serious AEs were considered to be related to study medication.</p><p>At week 12, patients treated with olmesartan 40 mg/day and olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day showed comparable mean serum concentrations of glucose (5.55 and 5.63 mmol/L, respectively), sodium (140.9 and 140.3 mmol/L, respectively), potassium (4.40 and 4.26 mmol/L, respectively), and creatinine (82.8 and 81.6 &#x003bc;mol/L, respectively). The incidence of laboratory measurements reported as being of potential clinical relevance during randomized treatment was low. Increases in serum levels were reported for alanine aminotransferase (olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day group, n = 2), aspartate aminotransferase (olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day, n = 2), &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase (olmesartan 40 mg/day, n = 2; and olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day, n = 4), glucose (olmesartan 40 mg/day, n = 1; and olmesartan 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day, n = 3), and creatinine (olmesartan 40 mg/day, n = 1).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>OLMEBEST was a large study involving approximately 2300 patients that confirmed the efficacy of the standard maintenance dose of olmesartan 20 mg/day and suggested that for patients who did not show a sufficient response, antihypertensive efficacy could be increased by either dose-titration or the addition of a low dose of HCTZ. In each of the two randomized groups, additional reductions in SBP and DBP were seen relative to the end of the open-label monotherapy phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-vhrm-5-723">14</xref></p><p>Monotherapy dose-titration or combination therapy is recommended in patients who do not respond adequately to initial monotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-723">4</xref> The results of this analysis show that treatment of hypertensive patients with olmesartan 20 mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day or uptitration to olmesartan 40 mg/day for patients with a sub-optimal response, enabled more than half of all patients to achieve an SBP/DBP target of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg in OLMEBEST. Looking at the whole study population, the proportion of patients who achieved the 140/90 mmHg goal approached 60% at Week 12.</p><p>Approximately 70% of patients achieved DBP normalization (&#x0003c;90 mmHg) after 8 weeks of open-label treatment with olmesartan 20 mg/day. However, approximately 30% of patients did not achieve DBP normalization and went on to receive randomized treatment. By the end of the study, more than half of these randomized patients who had already shown an inadequate DBP response to olmesartan 20 mg/day had achieved DBP normalisation, and more than a third had achieved the &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg goal.</p><p>The rate of DBP normalization achieved with olmesartan 20 mg/day during the 8-week open-label phase was higher than anticipated during the design of the study. Thus, fewer patients than planned were randomized to treatment, which meant that the study did not have sufficient power to detect non-inferiority between the two treatment groups. As such, it was not possible to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the two randomized groups. Despite this limitation, the olmesartan plus HCTZ arm appeared to be associated with a higher level of goal achievement compared with uptitration to olmesartan 40 mg/day. This finding is probably explained by the complementary modes of action of ARBs and HCTS that result in increased antihypertensive efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-5-723">15</xref> Indeed, the combination of olmesartan and HCTZ has previously been associated with larger BP reductions compared with uptitration of component monotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-vhrm-5-723">16</xref></p><p>The partially-randomized design of the OLMEBEST study makes it difficult to compare the results with those of other studies. Adding HCTZ to an ARB increases antihypertensive efficacy, as outlined above, and the combination of olmesartan with HCTZ has been available for several years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-5-723">17</xref> Rump et al looked at the effects of treatment with olmesartan 20 mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/day and found that after 12 weeks the proportion of patients with BP &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg was 43%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-5-723">18</xref> which is in line with the results of the present analysis for the randomized group that received combination therapy. Combining HCTZ with other ARBs has also been shown to result in comparable levels of goal rate achievement. The combination of HCTZ 12.5 mg/day with either candesartan 8 mg/day or valsartan 80 mg/day resulted in approximately 49% of hypertensive patients achieving &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg with each combination,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-vhrm-5-723">19</xref> although a more recent analysis by Weir et al indicates a level closer to 40% for valsartan plus HCTZ.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-5-723">20</xref> For dose-titration, Neutel et al conducted a forced-titration study in which patients were treated with the aim of achieving a BP target of &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-vhrm-5-723">21</xref> During the initial monotherapy phase of the present study, patients received olmesartan 20 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by uptitration to olmesartan 40 mg/day for the next 4 weeks for patients who did not achieve target BP. At the end of the 8-week monotherapy phase, the proportion of patients who achieved the BP target of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg was 58.7%, a value similar to that observed for all patients who received olmesartan as monotherapy (either 20 mg/day or 40 mg/day) in OLMEBEST.</p><p>In many countries, overall levels of BP control in the general population are suboptimal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-723">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-vhrm-5-723">24</xref> and need to be improved in order to lower the rate of CV events such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Increasing the dose of monotherapy or using a two-drug combination is recommended in order to achieve BP control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-723">4</xref> The results of the present analysis support this approach, and suggest that each of these approaches can be used to increase the number of patients achieving the recommended &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg hypertension threshold. Moreover, this analysis also looked at the more rigorous BP goal of &#x0003c;130/85 mmHg and found that by Week 12, 27.4% of all patients had achieved this goal and had thus achieved a level of BP control below the ESH-ESC threshold for high normal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-723">4</xref> and so could be regarded as being within the normal range.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with olmesartan 20 mg/day enabled a substantial proportion of patients to achieve the guideline-recommended goal of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg, and approximately two-thirds of patients receiving olmesartan 20 mg/day at the end of the study achieved this goal. For patients who had been unable to normalize their DBP with olmesartan 20 mg/day, addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg/day to the regimen, or dose uptitration to olmesartan 40 mg/day enabled even more patients to control their BP so that overall, nearly 60% of patients had a BP &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg by study end. Such findings indicate that both uptitration and combination with HCTZ are effective options to achieve increased BP reduction and goal attainment, but clinical recommendations as to the most appropriate regimen must be decided by physicians based on individual patients&#x02019; needs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments and disclosures</title><p>This study was sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany.
