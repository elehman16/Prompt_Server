action observational training for functional electrical stimulation treatment on weight
bearing, stability and gait velocity of hemiplegic patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty
subjects were randomized into two groups. Subjects more than six months post-stroke
participated. Balance and gait velocity were measured at the baseline, and after six weeks
of treatment. Both groups received functional electrical stimulation treatment. The
experimental group additionally received action observational training. The paired t-test
was used to analyze differences in the outcome measures between before and after the
intervention. The difference between the groups was compared using the independent t-test.
[Results] The experimental group showed significant increases in weight bearing
(anterior&#x000b7;posterior, right&#x000b7;left) on the affected side, stability index and gait velocity.
The control group showed only a significant increase in anterior&#x000b7;posterior weight bearing
on the affected side. Moreover, according to the comparison of training effects between in
the two groups, the variables of anterior&#x000b7;posterior weight bearing, stability index and
gait velocity revealed a statistically significant difference. [Conclusion] Additional
action observational training for functional electrical stimulation treatment should be
considered as a therapeutic method in physical therapy for the improvement of weight
bearing, stability index and gait velocity of hemiplegic patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Action observational training</kwd><kwd>Functional electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although studies of functional electrical stimulation treatment, one of the rehabilitation
programs used to resolve problems related to the balance and gait of hemiplegic patients,
are being actively carried out, the method that is generally used in clinics is executed in
limited space or in wheelchairs. Thus, a decrease in the focus of research involving
patients is being witnessed. Therefore, it is necessary to propose additional treatment
programs or seek improvements in treatment methods in order to induce active movement.</p><p>Most training programs aim to generate adaptive reversibility in function and structures of
the undamaged brain, and training is executed with that as the focus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are limitations to the ability of hemiplegic
patients with damaged mobility to participate in such training programs, and it is not easy
to activate the brain through sensory and kinesthetic stimulation to revive the
neuroplasticity. Action observational training is based on the mirror neuron system, and can
overcome the ability limitations of hemiplegic patients. Action observational training is a
method in which an action is observed, then imitated, and executed in repetitive training.
Its theoretical base lies in the mirror neuron system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although direct stimulation to the damaged brain is executed through exercise programs for
paralyzed limbs, action observation training can also stimulate the part of the brain that
is activated during the action training. It can also assist in the reorganization of the
damaged part of the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although
studies of action observational training are currently being carried out with healthy people
and athletes as subjects, and present outstanding results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, there is lack of studies
including patients with damaged nervous systems. If action observational training for
hemiplegic patients could induce continuous activation of the brain, the maximization of
functional movement in daily life could be achieved through imitation of the observed
action. Furthermore, it could be used as a new method to treat neurologic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients diagnosed with stroke at C University Hospital,

were 2 patients aged in their 30s, 1 in the 40s, 3 in their 50s, 2 in their 60s, and 2 in
their 70s. There were 6 males and 4 females, and there were 4 and 6 patients with

the 30s, 2 in their 40s, 3 in their 50s, 2 in their 60s, and 2 in their 70s. There were 5
males and 5 females, and there were 4 and 6 patients with paralysis on the right and left

asked to watch a video on gait for 15 minutes. The video on gait showed walking on flat
ground, slopes, and stairs, and was watched 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The control group
received only functional electrical stimulation treatment.</p><p>The functional electrical stimulator used in this study was Microstim (Medel GmBH,
Berlin, Germany) which has adjustable frequency, contraction time, relaxation time, and
on-time. The electrodes used were single-use surface electrodes (0.5&#x000d7;0.5&#x02005;cm). Referring to
the studies by Lindquist et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
active electrode was attached to the head of the fibula and the reference electrode was
placed between the peroneus longus below the head of the fibula and the tibialis anterior
to selectively stimulate the deep peroneal nerve. A biphasic rectangular wave was used for
the waveform, and pulse rate, pulse width, and on-time were set as 35 pps, 250 &#x003bc;V, and 0.3
sec, respectively.</p><p>Tetrax, developed by Sunlight of Israel, was used for to evaluate subjects' weight
bearing and stability. Since the force plates of Tetrax are positioned under the front and
rear of the left foot, and the front and rear of the right foot, it is possible to carry
out weight bearing and balance test on each foot region, and to provide feedback training
with a monitor placed at the front. Measures of weight bearing on the front and rear of
the right and left feet were used in this study. The stability index measures the sway in
the posture using 4 force plates, and the overall stability is calculated from measures of
the area, length, and speed of the sway and gravity center; lower scores indicate better
subject stability.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 was used for the statistical analysis. The paired t-test was performed
to examine changes within each group after the treatment. The independent t-test was used
for inter-group comparison. The level of statistical significance was chosen as
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of the groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Variables</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Experimental group (n=10)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group (n=10)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">after</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">after</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">WD (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.15&#x000b1;6.56<sup>&#x003b9;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.35&#x000b1;4.28<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.23&#x000b1;10.37</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.16&#x000b1;6.97<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RL<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.87&#x000b1;5.48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.57&#x000b1;4.49<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.26&#x000b1;9.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.73&#x000b1;9.05</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SI<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.23&#x000b1;4.54</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.11&#x000b1;5.32<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.45&#x000b1;6.55</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.69&#x000b1;5.96</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">GV (m/s)<sup> &#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47&#x000b1;1.52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.60&#x000b1;1.36<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.39&#x000b1;2.18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42&#x000b1;2.26</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>&#x003b9;</sup> Mean&#x000b1;SD, WD: Weight Distribution, AP: Anterior&#x000b7; Posterior, RL: Right

to be an adjunctive treatment which is carried out during rest after exercise therapy. In
action observational training subjects imitate an action through continuous observation
regardless of whether the exercise had been learned or forgotten. Action imitation is a
process comprised of action observation, motor imagery, and action execution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is achieved through perception that
comprehensively reproduces the observed action and stores it in the memory. Hemiplegic
patients improve their balance and gait velocity by imitating the action in the part that is
not functional through action observation. Lee and Lee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported there was significant improvement in both static balance
capacity and dynamic balance. This result supports the results of our present study which
suggest that gait velocity increases with improvement in stability due to improvement in
weight bearing. Choi and Park<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that a group which performed actual training and motor imagery simultaneously displayed
improvement in functional activity, a result which is also in agreement with the results of
our present study. One study has suggested that action observation and exercise therapy, in
which participants repetitively practice the observed action, may elicit improvement in the
function of damaged brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also
been reported that motor imagery may assist in the recovery of motor functions after
stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it has been
reported that motor systems of stroke patients without good motor ability can be activated
through dynamic introjection of action with motor imagery regardless of the fact that actual
exercise has not been carried out<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
contrast, it has also been reported that there wasn't as much improvement in stroke patients
as healthy people in cortical activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study has suggested that damage in certain parts of the
brain not only reduces motor skill, but also the capacity for motor imagery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dijkerman et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that passive observation can be performed to
treat cognitive problems caused by a damaged brain, but it may not induce the activation of
the brain with image reproduction through observation, making difficult to accurately
evaluate whether or not the imagery training has been properly executed. However, the
experiment carried out in this study selected only subjects who displayed no abnormalities
in cognitive tests.</p><p>In conclusion, functional electrical stimulation treatment was proven to be effective when
action observational training was added to improve weight bearing, stability, and gait
velocity of stroke patients. We consider various attempts should be made to improve the gait
functions of neurologic patients by developing more diverse action observational training
methods and action observational training methods.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Howon University Research Fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nudo</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Mechanisms for recovery of motor function following
