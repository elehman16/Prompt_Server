Therefore, this study was undertaken as the first head-to-head comparison of subcutaneous (SC) abatacept and SC adalimumab, both administered along with background methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with active RA who were naive to treatment with biologic agents and had an inadequate response to MTX were randomly assigned to receive 125 mg SC abatacept weekly or 40 mg SC adalimumab biweekly, both given in combination with MTX, in a 2-year study. The primary end point was treatment noninferiority, assessed according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement response (ACR20) at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 646 patients who were randomized and treated, 86.2% receiving SC abatacept and 82% receiving SC adalimumab completed 12 months of treatment. At 1 year, 64.8% of patients in the SC abatacept group and 63.4% in the SC adalimumab group demonstrated an ACR20 response; the estimated difference between groups was 1.8% (95% confidence interval &#x02212;5.6%, 9.2%), thus demonstrating the noninferiority of abatacept compared to adalimumab. All efficacy measures showed similar results and kinetics of response between treatments. The rate of radiographic nonprogression (defined as a total modified Sharp/van der Heijde score [SHS] less than or equal to the smallest detectable change) was 84.8% for SC abatacept&#x02013;treated patients and 88.6% for SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients, while the mean change from baseline in the total SHS was 0.58 and 0.38, respectively. In the SC abatacept and SC adalimumab groups, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively, and the rate of serious infections was 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. In patients treated with SC abatacept, the frequency of discontinuations due to AEs was 3.5% and discontinuations due to SAEs was 1.3%, while in patients treated with SC adalimumab, the frequencies were 6.1% and 3%, respectively. Injection site reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients receiving SC abatacept compared to 9.1% of patients receiving SC adalimumab (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results demonstrate that SC abatacept and SC adalimumab have comparable efficacy in patients with RA, as shown by similar kinetics of response and comparable inhibition of radiographic progression over 1 year of treatment. The safety was generally similar, other than the occurrence of significantly more local injection site reactions in patients treated with SC adalimumab.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has evolved significantly over the last decade, with the early use of methotrexate (MTX) and the addition of targeted biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in patients with an incomplete response to MTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The combination of bDMARDs and MTX as the anchor drug has demonstrated the best clinical outcomes in trials and routine practice, and has emerged as the de facto standard of care for patients with moderate-to-severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) were the first approved bDMARDs for RA, followed by 4 additional bDMARD therapies with different mechanisms of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). TNFi have become the most widely used initial bDMARD. Adalimumab, a TNFi, and abatacept, a T cell costimulation modulator, have been extensively studied in RA, and treatment of RA patients with these agents, in combination with MTX, in randomized trials has produced similar clinical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11">4&#x02013;11</xref>). With multiple therapeutic options available for the treatment of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), a critical question is whether bDMARDs with different mechanisms of action have comparable clinical efficacy, comparable safety, and similar effects on inhibition of radiographic progression. To date, there has been no head-to-head comparison of bDMARDs in an RA clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). These trials are essential for evidence-based treatment decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>AMPLE (Abatacept versus Adalimumab Comparison in Biologic-Naive RA Subjects with Background Methotrexate) is a 2-year phase IIIB, multinational, prospective, randomized study. Since comparable responses to treatment have been demonstrated with both abatacept and adalimumab in separate clinical studies, a noninferiority design was utilized in this head-to-head study to determine the comparative effects of these agents on clinical responses, radiographic activity, and overall safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In this report, we present the first-year results of this study.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 classification criteria for RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), were at least 18 years of age, had a confirmed diagnosis of RA for &#x02264;5 years, had an inadequate response to MTX, and had not received previous bDMARD therapy. At randomization, patients were required to have active disease, defined as a score of &#x02265;3.2 on the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), as well as a history of one or both of the following features: 1) seropositivity for anti&#x02013;cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies or rheumatoid factor, and/or 2) an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or CRP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and treatment administration</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 125 mg abatacept (Orencia; Bristol-Myers Squibb), administered SC once per week (without an intravenous loading dose), or 40 mg adalimumab (Humira; Abbott Laboratories), administered SC every other week, both given in combination with MTX. Patients were stratified by disease activity, according to those with high disease activity (defined as a DAS28-CRP score &#x0003e;5.1) and those with moderate disease activity (defined as a DAS28-CRP score &#x02265;3.2 and &#x02264;5.1).</p><p>A total of 120 sites from North and South America participated in this study, and &#x0223c;70% of the patients were from sites in the US. The first year of this study was completed in October 2011.</p><p>Patients were concomitantly treated with a stable dosage of MTX (between &#x02265;15 mg/week and &#x02264;25 mg/week, or at least &#x02265;7.5 mg/week in patients with documented intolerance to higher doses). In addition, patients were allowed to receive either hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine; other DMARDs were not allowed during the study. Stable, low-dose oral corticosteroids (&#x02264;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) were permitted. Up to 2 courses of high-dose corticosteroids (such as a short [defined as a maximum of 2 weeks] oral course of high-dose corticosteroids, a single intramuscular dose of corticosteroid, or a single intraarticular injection of corticosteroid) were permitted, except within 42 days of day 365. Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, was permitted, provided that the dosage was stable; additional NSAIDs were not allowed within 12 hours before a clinical assessment.</p><p>Double-blinding for the study drugs was not feasible, due to logistic barriers that did not permit masking of the adalimumab syringes. Patients were not blinded with regard to their study drug. Clinical assessors were blinded with regard to each patient's treatment. These blinded assessors evaluated the patients' joints, assessed disease activity, and defined adverse event (AE) causality. In addition, different physicians reviewed and approved all of the data entry forms but did not contribute to the data collection. Radiographs were scored by independent readers who were blinded with regard to the treatment regimen.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards and independent ethics committees at the participating sites, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent before randomization. The protocol was jointly developed by the academic authors and the study sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary outcome measure for determining the noninferiority of SC abatacept compared to SC adalimumab was the proportion of patients in each group achieving a 20% response on the ACR improvement criteria (ACR20) at 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Efficacy assessments were performed on days 1, 15, and 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter. An ACR20 response indicates a decrease of at least 20% in the number of both tender and swollen joints (68 joints assessed for tenderness, and 66 joints assessed for swelling) as well as at least a 20% improvement in at least 3 of the following features: the patient's global assessment of disease activity (on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]), the patient's assessment of pain (on a 100-mm VAS), the patient's assessment of physical function on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), the physician's global assessment of disease activity (on a 100-mm VAS), and the CRP level.</p><p>Secondary end points included a 50% and 70% level of improvement according to the ACR response criteria (ACR50 and ACR70), changes in the DAS28-CRP score, and achievement of clinical remission (defined as a DAS28-CRP score of &#x0003c;2.6), low disease activity (defined as a DAS28-CRP score of &#x02264;3.2), and improvement in physical function (defined as a change from baseline in the HAQ DI of &#x02265;0.3 units) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In addition, scores on the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID-3) (on a scale of 0&#x02013;10) were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Patient's assessment of the severity of fatigue over the past week was determined using a 100-mm VAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>Plain radiographs of the hands and feet were obtained from all patients on day 1 (baseline) and day 365 (1 year), and scored for radiographic damage using the modified Sharp/ van der Heijde scoring system (SHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Radiographs were centrally evaluated by readers who were blinded with regard to the drug treatment and the sequence of films. Rates of radiographic nonprogression were determined using the smallest detectable change (SDC), an estimate of the measurement error of simultaneously read films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), in which a total SHS score less than or equal to the SDC was used as the cutoff for defining radiographic nonprogression from baseline to 1 year. Interreader and intrareader variability was also assessed by intraclass correlations. Mean changes from baseline in the total SHS score, erosion score, and joint space narrowing score were calculated at the end of year 1. In addition, cumulative probability plots were used to assess the distribution of scores from individual patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and autoantibody assessments</title><p>Safety events were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version 14.1). Both the severity of AEs and their relationship to the study treatment were noted by 2 investigators (RV and GC). Local injection site reactions and autoimmune events were prespecified based on a list of MedDRA Preferred Terms.</p><p>Blood samples for measurement of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies [ANAs] and anti&#x02013;double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA] autoantibodies) were collected at baseline and 1 year. Samples were first tested for ANAs by indirect immunofluorescence assay using a HEp-2 cell line substrate. Samples positive for ANAs were then further tested for anti-dsDNA by indirect immunofluorescence assay using a <italic>Crithidia luciliae</italic> substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All efficacy and safety analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. A per-protocol population, which included the subset of patients from the ITT population who had no relevant protocol deviations, was used to confirm the primary efficacy end point. All patients who prematurely discontinued the study after receiving the study drug, regardless of the reason, were considered nonresponders at all scheduled visits subsequent to the point of discontinuation.</p><p>Based on assumption of a 2.5% one-sided level of significance with 93% power to detect a difference between groups and a 12% noninferiority margin, a sample size of 648 patients equally randomized to the 2 treatment groups was needed to test the hypothesis of treatment noninferiority. The 12% noninferiority margin preserves at least 50% of the treatment effect, according to results from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This allows for a maximum difference of &#x02212;4.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] &#x02212;12%, 2.6%) in the ACR20 response between SC abatacept and SC adalimumab, a difference that was considered to be clinically meaningful. A 5% protocol-deviation rate would maintain at least 90% power to test the primary end point with the per-protocol population.</p><p>The proportion of patients with local injection site reactions from baseline to 1 year was a key secondary end point. Statistical testing for this secondary end point was prespecified if the primary end point (noninferiority according to the ACR20 improvement response) was met.</p><p>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed descriptively for all patients. For the response rates determined in efficacy analyses, the estimate of the proportion of responders (with 95% CIs) within each treatment group, as well as the 95% CIs for the difference in response rates between treatment groups, are presented. For assessments of change from baseline, analyses of covariance were used, with treatment assignment serving as the main factor and baseline values and disease activity group as covariates. Point estimates and 95% CIs are provided for the difference in adjusted mean change from baseline between the 2 treatment groups. For the mean change in DAS28-CRP scores, missing values were imputed using a last observation carried forward analysis (excluding patients for whom only baseline observations were available). Radiographs were obtained at baseline and at 1 year. For patients who were unwilling or unable to return after 1 year, radiographs were obtained at the time of discontinuation. In these patients, the 1-year data were imputed using linear extrapolation of the scores for radiographs obtained at the time of discontinuation. Data on safety parameters in each treatment group are expressed as frequencies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Disposition of patients</title><p>In total, 646 patients were randomized and treated (318 in the SC abatacept group and 328 in the SC adalimumab group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).

The main reasons for discontinuation were lack of efficacy (3.8% of SC abatacept&#x02013;treated patients versus 4.6% of SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients) and AEs (3.5% of SC abatacept&#x02013;treated patients versus 6.1% of SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Disposition of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the intent-to-treat population randomized to receive either subcutaneous (SC) abatacept or SC adalimumab, both given in combination with methotrexate (MTX), over 1 year.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="art0065-0028-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics</title><p>The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were balanced across the SC abatacept and SC adalimumab groups and were typical for RA studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The primary outcome measure, the ACR20 response, was achieved by 64.8% of SC abatacept&#x02013;treated patients and 63.4% of SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients. Similar benefits in terms of treatment efficacy were seen across all disease activity measures, including the ACR50 and ACR70 improvement responses and the DAS28-CRP score. Both agents showed similar kinetics of clinical response and comparable inhibition of radiographic damage progression. These results are consistent with those seen in previous studies of abatacept and adalimumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11">4&#x02013;11</xref>). Overall, the rates of safety events were balanced, other than a significantly higher rate of local injection site reactions among SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients.</p><p>Radiographic outcomes are a hallmark of any substantial RA trial. Measures of radiographic damage represent objective and quantifiable outcomes that are correlated with disease activity, long-term disability, and treatment benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). This study provides the first radiographic data set for the SC abatacept formulation. The data showed similar and robust clinical benefits, in terms of improvements in both the erosion and joint space narrowing scores, in RA patients treated with either SC abatacept or SC adalimumab in combination with background MTX, as was also seen in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The radiographic nonprogression rates and overlapping cumulative probability curves demonstrate that inhibition of radiographic progression was comparable between the treatments and included most patients.</p><p>Safety outcomes in year 1 were mostly balanced, with some important differences. The rates and types of AEs reported, including infections and SAEs, were comparable between the treatment groups and were consistent with those previously reported in clinical trials of both agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32 b33 b34 b35">32&#x02013;35</xref>), but led to higher rates of discontinuation in the adalimumab group. A greater number of SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients developed seropositivity for ANAs or anti-dsDNA autoantibodies during the course of treatment, consistent with observations in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Nonserious autoimmune AEs, however, occurred more frequently in the SC abatacept treatment group. Local injection site reactions were significantly more frequent in SC adalimumab&#x02013;treated patients, and were also qualitatively different and led to more discontinuations in the SC adalimumab group. Overall, the safety outcomes are not well suited for statistical comparison, and are more suited for descriptive metrics. The value of comparative safety increases with the period of exposure and frequency of the events. Comparative RA trials might prove more informative when the safety events observed in these trials reflect the findings of larger safety databases.</p><p>This study illustrates the advantages and limitations of performing head-to-head trials. A noninferiority design was chosen for this study because both therapies were expected to be equally efficacious in the main assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Noninferiority trials serve to establish treatment parity and allow for comparison of other relevant, secondary outcomes. The main benefit of these trials is to provide the most relevant comparative and robust data for evidence-based decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Previously, physicians relied on indirect, statistics-based strategies, with their associated limitations, e.g., disparate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38 b39 b40">38&#x02013;40</xref>). Studies that include comparator groups not powered for direct comparison afford more value, but still have limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). This head-to-head trial was designed and powered for direct comparison at 1 year. The second year of the AMPLE trial is designed to provide additional information in a controlled study. For comparative trials to be truly informative, they must enroll subjects who resemble those seen in clinical practice, and utilize therapeutic agents in a manner that reflects routine use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Adalimumab is a TNFi, the most commonly used bDMARD class in RA. Its clinical profile in the present study population is well established, and it is therefore an appropriate comparator choice.</p><p>The inability to properly mask the commercially acquired comparator agent, adalimumab, which has unique visual proprietary characteristics, is a limitation of the study. This prevented us from conducting a classic double-blind study, since patients were not blinded with regard to treatment allocation. It was neither feasible to require weekly visits for blinded injections for 2 years nor practical for a home visit nurse to administer the injections. The study did utilize an investigator-blind strategy, which mitigates this potential weakness. The consistent findings across both patient- and physician-reported outcomes and the objective radiographic outcomes support the integrity of the investigator-blind approach utilized in the AMPLE trial.</p><p>Another potential area of concern was the selection of the DAS28-CRP as a measure of disease activity. The DAS28-CRP and the DAS28 using the ESR (DAS28-ESR) do not generate identical disease activity scores, and indeed application of the DAS28-CRP leads, frequently, to higher percentages of patients being classified as in remission. However, this is less relevant in the present study, since we compared the 2 treatments and the possible difference in rates of DAS28-ESR&#x02013;defined remission, and rates of DAS28-CRP&#x02013;defined remission would apply to both drugs.</p><p>Current use of bDMARDs in the treatment of RA is not based on head-to-head comparative data. This study demonstrates that treatment of RA patients with agents that have different mechanisms of action, either T cell modulation or TNF inhibition, will lead to comparable clinical benefit, suggesting that these 2 agents should be considered equally for the treatment of RA patients who have an inadequate response to MTX. These findings from the AMPLE study demonstrate the value of comparative trials and should serve as a blueprint for future head-to-head trials in RA.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
