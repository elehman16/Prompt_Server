Telehealth may offer a cost-effective means of supporting the management of people with depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention (&#x02018;Healthlines') for patients with depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A prospective patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited through primary care, and the intervention was delivered via a telehealth service. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of depression and PHQ-9 score &#x02265;10 were recruited from 43 English general practices. A series of up to 10 scripted, theory-led, telephone encounters with health information advisers supported participants to effect a behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. The intervention was delivered alongside usual care and was designed to support rather than duplicate primary care. Cost-effectiveness from a combined health and social care perspective was measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost&#x02013;consequence analysis included cost of lost productivity, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 609 participants were randomised &#x02013; 307 to receive the Healthlines intervention plus usual care and 302 to receive usual care alone. Forty-five per cent of participants had missing quality of life data, 41% had missing cost data and 51% of participants had missing data on either cost or utility, or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base-case analysis. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service/personal social services cost of &#x000a3;168 (95% CI &#x000a3;43 to &#x000a3;294) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.001 (95% CI &#x02212;0.023 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was &#x000a3;132 630. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of &#x000a3;20 000 was &#x02212;&#x000a3;143 (95% CI &#x02212;&#x000a3;164 to &#x02212;&#x000a3;122) and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.30. Productivity costs were higher in the intervention arm, but out-of-pocket expenses were lower.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Healthlines service was acceptable to patients as a means of condition management, and response to treatment after 4 months was higher for participants randomised to the intervention. However, the positive average intervention effect size was modest, and incremental costs were high relative to a small incremental QALY gain at 12 months. The intervention is not likely to be cost-effective in its current form.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec><title>Copyright and usage</title><p>&#x000a9; The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.

Resources available included a self-directed cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) course involving the use of a book or the CBT website &#x02018;Living Life to the Full Interactive&#x02019; (LLTTFi); access to a secure web portal which included health information; access to the Big White Wall (BWW) online forum; requests for discussions with the trial's trained health information advisors (HIAs &#x02013; see below); and copies of letters sent to the participant's general practitioner (GP).</p><p>Scripted, scheduled telephone encounters took place over the 12 months of trial follow-up between trial participants and HIAs. The HIAs, non-clinical staff with experience in providing health information to members of the public by telephone, were provided with additional training in order to deliver the Healthlines service. They were employed by the NHS, and they received supervision from nursing staff and from pharmacists. Participants randomised to the intervention were eligible to receive a maximum of 10 such telephone-based encounters and also receive usual care.</p><p>Participants randomised to the control arm received usual care for depression.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Measurement of outcomes</title><p>The primary clinical outcome for the trial was the proportion of patients responding to treatment at 4 months from randomisation, measured using the PHQ-9 questionnaire. Response was defined as a reduction (from baseline) in PHQ-9 of at least 5 points and an overall score of less than 10. PHQ-9 responses were also collected at 8 and 12 months.</p><p>Information on health-related quality of life was collected at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> a standardised, generic instrument that allows for the measurement and valuation of health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L measures five dimensions of health-related quality of life (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression) with five categories of health states corresponding to no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ-5D-3L version of the questionnaire is known to discriminate between different levels of depression severity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and has &#x02018;adequate' validity and responsiveness in patients with depression.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Measurement and valuation of resource use</title><p>With participant consent, details of all primary care consultations and relevant prescriptions (antidepressants, hypnotics and anxiolytics, and drugs used in psychoses and related disorders) issued during the 12-month follow-up period were extracted from GP records.</p><p>Questionnaires administered at 4, 8 and 12 months requested information on other healthcare and social care accessed for reasons connected with the participant's depression. This questionnaire, versions of which have been used in previous within-trial primary care evaluations, is available from the &#x02018;Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement' at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dirum.org">www.dirum.org</ext-link>. The questionnaire included the use of hospital services, attendance at accident and emergency departments, ambulance use, and the use of PSS such as social worker services. The questionnaires also requested information on the use of private therapies, out-of-pocket expenditure, time-off from work, benefits received, informal care and the use of voluntary-sector services. The questionnaires could be completed online or by post, but those completing them online still had to complete the EQ-5D by post because of licencing restrictions.</p><p>All resources were valued and costs reported in pound sterling at 2012/13 prices. Curtis<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> was used to cost primary care consultations, community health and social care where possible. NHS National Reference Costs for 2012/13<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> were used to value hospital and ambulance use. All sources are described in the supplementary material (see in particular <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjpo.rcpsych.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1192/bjpo.bp.116.002907/-/DC1">Tables DS1 and DS2</ext-link>). The costs of drugs prescribed in primary care and reported in medical records were based on the Prescription Cost Analysis England database<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and cross-checked against the British National Formulary. The value of personal expenditure was obtained directly from participant responses to questionnaires.</p><p>Productivity costs were calculated from reports of working days missed by trial participants, by friends and relatives as a consequence of the participant's depression, and time from work to attend healthcare appointments.

This included the number and length of all telephone calls, the number of attempts by a HIA to contact a participant, the use of the LLTTFi website, the number of people who were sent the designated CBT book, and the use of the BWW website. Resources involved in establishing the service included training costs and the purchase of licences for LLTTFi and BWW, and these were included in the calculation of intervention cost. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjpo.rcpsych.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1192/bjpo.bp.116.002907/-/DC1">Table DS3</ext-link> in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjpo.rcpsych.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1192/bjpo.bp.116.002907/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link> summarises the unit costs of these resources.</p><p>The HIAs were remunerated at Band 4 of the NHS &#x02018;Agenda for Change' pay scale. Cost-per-hour was estimated using the framework of Curtis,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> adjusted to reflect the working pattern of the HIAs. Anonymised task-scheduling diaries kept by the HIAs were used to estimate the proportion of their time spent not in contact with intervention participants: the ratio of contact/non-contact time was estimated to be 2:1. Further adjustment was made to allow for the 40-h workweek of the HIAs. HIAs received initial and ongoing training from a nurse-grade trainer and from a consultant psychiatrist in the LLTTFi package. The costs of training were amortised over an assumed duration of 3 years. This reflects the consideration that any training received would be relevant to the service for at least 3 years, after which additional training might become necessary. We regard this as a conservative assumption.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>All analyses were conducted in Stata 13.1 (Statacorp: College Station, Texas).</p><p>The distribution of all data used in the analysis was inspected and summary measures such as means and standard deviations calculated. The data were inspected for missingness. Data relating to the use of the intervention and primary care data (including prescriptions) were generally complete. Less than 0.5% of data relating to primary care consultations were missing. These missing values were imputed with mean values at the participant level. The resulting data-set formed our &#x02018;available cases'. The predominant sources of any remaining missing data were questionnaire responses, particularly questions relating to resource use and quality of life. In spite of satisfactory data completeness on primary care and the intervention, missing questionnaire responses meant that 45% of participants had missing quality of life data, 41% had missing cost data, and 51% of participants had missing data on either cost data or utility data, or both. Complete cases had complete data on all cost items and all quality of life data items at all time points, and 49% of participants (47% in the intervention arm, 51% in the control arm) qualified as complete cases under this definition.</p><p>Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations, as implemented by the &#x02013; ice &#x02013; command<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> in Stata 13.1.

The imputation model was stratified by trial arm<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and included demographic and cost variables without missing data alongside clinical outcome variables at baseline and follow-up, cost and utility variables with missing data, depression history, baseline depression status and whether patients were being prescribed antidepressants. Predictive mean matching was used to account for non-normal distributions in some included variables.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Passive imputation was performed for categorical variables, such as binary PHQ-9 scores, that were functions of imputed variables.</p><p>Costs were imputed at the level of the major aggregate costs (e.g. primary care, medication, PSS costs and other NHS costs).

As a sensitivity check, cost-effectiveness was also estimated on complete cases only and the results were compared. For both imputed and complete case data, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was implemented by calculating cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) to quantify uncertainty around point estimates of net monetary benefit.</p><p>One-way sensitivity analysis was also performed. The sensitivity of the imputed results to self-reported use of secondary care was tested by removing these costs. Although all questionnaire responses concerning secondary care use were checked by a clinician for relevance to depression, the sensitivity analysis provides a means of assessing whether recall bias, misclassification or infrequent but expensive events differed between arms. The sensitivity of the results to the cost of an element of the intervention &#x02013; that of the BWW licence &#x02013; was also assessed in order to account for the possibility that these licence costs would be lower if the intervention were rolled out across the NHS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 307 participants were randomised to receive the intervention and 302 to the control arm.

Intervention participants reported a greater number of days affected by depression (mean per patient in available cases: 12.4 working days (s.d.=42.0) in the intervention arm compared with 5.2 working days (s.d.=15.7)) and more hours taken from work to attend healthcare appointments (mean per patient in available cases: 12.8 h (s.d.=86.8) in the intervention arm compared with 2.9 h (s.d.=12.5)).</p><p>These findings are influenced by a small number of individuals in the intervention arm who reported large amounts of lost time, and hence these results are probably owing to chance imbalance.

However, any comparison between the primary clinical outcome and the cost-effectiveness outcome must account for the differences between the outcomes (proportion of responders measured using PHQ-9 and cost-effectiveness using NHS/PSS costs and QALYs), the different time periods over which the outcome is measured (at 4 months and over 12 months) and the overall effect size.</p><p>Three considerations are important in interpreting the small between-arm QALY difference. The first is that these differences are consistent with the modest mean effect size in analysis of the intervention on the primary PHQ-9 clinical outcome and the possibility that the intervention was helpful for some but not all participants.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Analysis of secondary trial outcomes indicated greater improvements in anxiety, and greater satisfaction with support, among those randomised to the intervention.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>The second consideration is that analysis of correlation (using Spearman's rho) indicates that high PHQ-9 scores (indicating greater severity of depression) and low EQ-5D scores (indicating lower quality of life) are correlated at baseline and all follow-up time points. The null of independence was rejected in each case (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and the absolute value of the correlations were largest with the anxiety/depression domain of the EQ-5D instrument. This is tentative evidence that the two instruments indicate the same &#x02018;direction of travel' for outcomes, and that the lower sensitivity<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> of the EQ-5D instrument used in the QALY calculations is not as important to the analysis as the finding that the intervention exerted a positive but modest impact on depression and particularly on health-related quality of life.</p><p>The third consideration relates to the amount of missing data. Some 51% of participants had incomplete data on variables necessary to conduct an inferential cost-effectiveness analysis. This was in spite of near-complete data on primary care resource use, prescriptions and intervention cost. Incomplete questionnaire responses to questions on quality of life and NHS resource use account for almost all of the missing data. This was largely because of licencing restrictions imposed on the use of the EQ-5D questionnaire, which had to be sent separately from the main follow-up questionnaires, and had to be sent by post when most outcomes were collected online.</p><p>The incremental costs of the intervention arm did not change drastically between imputed cases, available cases and complete cases, largely because of near-complete data on the intervention (the major element of intervention arm costs) and on primary care data. The estimated QALYs from the imputed dataset, adjusting for baseline differences, differed by 0.001 between groups, compared with 0.037 QALYs in complete cases. Below, we explain why the complete case analysis is likely to be both biased and inefficient.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Strengths</title><p>The Healthlines RCT was designed as a pragmatic, theory-based intervention to support patients with a prevalent long-term condition. To our knowledge, it is one of the largest RCTs conducted of a complex intervention based on telehealth for patients with depression.

This analysis would be biased because missingness in quality of life data seems to be conditional on observed allocation to the intervention arm, since participants in the intervention who did not provide data at all time points had, on average, lower quality of life than those who provided complete data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t8">Table 8</xref>). In the control group, the reverse is true: non-responders to the questionnaires had, on average, a higher quality of life than the complete cases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t8">Table 8</xref> suggests a mechanism for the complete and imputed QALYs to differ.</p><p>The amount of missingness in quality of life data complicates comparisons with other trials. For example, the economic evaluation<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> of the CADET primary care trial of collaborative care,<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> involving structured and scheduled patient follow-ups and enhanced communication between medical professionals, determined that the intervention was likely to be cost-effective. An important difference between the studies is the amount of missing data in each trial, with CADET reporting missingness of up to 25% compared with 51% in Healthlines.</p><p>The level of adherence to the intervention is another potential limitation. The median number of telephone encounters known to have been initiated was 5, out of a total of 10 scheduled encounters, although a focus on the number of completed telephone encounters does not reflect all aspects of compliance with the intervention. There is a lack of methodological guidance concerning how adherence should be reflected in economic evaluation,<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> albeit the focus on actual adherence in the base-case analysis reflects the pragmatic design of the trial. A complier-average causal effect analysis, using the principal stratification method, of the main trial results<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> suggested greater effectiveness among participants who received more telephone encounters, although this did not account for baseline variables.</p><p>Other limitations include the trial follow-up period, which was limited to 12 months. Longer-term follow-up would be necessary to establish persistence of effect and whether ongoing versus time-limited telehealth support would be most appropriate for this patient group.</p><p>It is not clear how closely the operation of the Healthlines service would reflect a system-wide implementation. In practice, scale effects and alternative rostering of HIAs and scheduling of calls may secure more efficient operation, although there is no evidence from the trial itself to indicate that substantial efficiency improvements were available but left unexploited.</p><p>In order for the intervention to be cost-effective, it is likely that it would need to be more effective rather than less costly. Holding incremental costs constant, and ignoring the effects of uncertainty, the threshold incremental QALY difference necessary to result in an ICER&#x0003c;&#x000a3;20 000 is approximately 0.085 or about eight times the effect size actually observed in the trial. Improving the effectiveness of the intervention is likely to require better targeting of the intervention to those interested in using it, efforts to improve patient engagement and more effective optimisation of anti-depressant medication when patients fail to respond to treatment.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>In conclusion, the Healthlines service was found to be acceptable to patients as a means of condition management,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and response to treatment after 4 months was higher for participants randomised to the intervention.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, the intervention was associated with a small incremental QALY gain at 12 months and was not likely to be cost-effective at a threshold value of &#x000a3;20 000.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all patients, healthcare professionals, health information advisors and other NHS Direct staff who contributed time and effort to make the Healthlines trial possible.
