Recent data support the possibility that person-centred, self-management interventions can reduce dependence after stroke. However, there is limited information on the generalisability and optimum dose of these interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Taking Charge After Stroke (TaCAS) study is a multicentre, investigator-blinded, randomised controlled trial recruiting 400 participants following acute stroke from seven hospitals in New Zealand. All patients discharged to community living who have ongoing symptoms at time of discharge (modified Rankin scale&#x0003e;0) will be eligible. Participants will be randomly assigned to one Take Charge session, two Take Charge sessions 6 weeks apart or control.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome will be the Physical Component Summary score of the Short-Form 36 at 12 months post stroke. Secondary outcomes will include dependence (modified Rankin scale), performance in activities of daily living (Barthel Index) and carer strain (Caregiver Strain Index), at 6 and 12 months post stroke. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The TaCAS study is funded by a Health Research Council of New Zealand grant. It has been approved by the Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee (15/CEN/115). Results will be published and presented at relevant stroke meetings within New Zealand and internationally, informing the use of a self-management intervention after stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615001163594.

At least half of stroke survivors remain dependent on others one year after the stroke.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Currently, there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness and efficacy of community-based therapies after stroke. Family support workers and goal-setting strategies are examples of two particular interventions that have been tested in randomised controlled trials but shown no benefit.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Systematic reviews of therapy-led interventions have shown a positive effect on activities of daily living although with a small effect size.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Self-management intervention studies in stroke and other conditions suggest that there is a positive effect on patient outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Self-management programmes differ from education or skills training because they emphasise enablement of individuals to take an active role in managing their condition. This includes management of psychosocial problems and lifestyle changes needed to enhance quality of life.</p><p>A successful self-management programme is the 'Take Charge Session' (TCS) intervention, which is a low-cost, person-centred intervention undertaken after discharge from an acute or rehabilitation hospital into the community following acute stroke. This was tested against a DVD-delivered educational intervention and control in the M&#x00101;ori and Pacific Stroke study (MaPSS).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In New Zealand, 9000 people suffer stroke every year. Although a relatively small proportion (15%) of those in New&#x000a0;Zealand who have a stroke are of M&#x00101;ori or Pacific ethnicity, compared with other ethnic groups in New&#x000a0;Zealand, M&#x00101;ori and Pacific stroke patients are more likely to have stroke at a younger age and have poorer outcomes after 12 months, even when adjusted for case-mix.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In more detail MaPSS was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which participants were randomised to one of four arms: a TCS (delivered by an ethnic-appropriate, trained layperson), a professionally produced DVD of M&#x00101;ori and Pacific stroke survivor stories, both the TCS and the DVD, or a control group who received written stroke educational material. Outcomes were assessed after 12 months for 80% of the 172 participants. The TCS improved physical health-related quality of life, dependence and caregiver strain. Those who received the TCS session had a Physical Component Score of the Short-Form 36 (PCS) of 6.0 (95% CI 2.0 to 10.0, p=0.004) higher than those who did not. The TCS also reduced dependence on others (modified Rankin scale (mRS)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;2) for activities of daily living, OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.89), p=0.023. The number needed to treat to prevent one person becoming dependent was 10.</p><p>We hypothesise that the TCS could improve physical outcomes in New&#x000a0;Zealand stroke survivors of all ethnicities, and that two exposures to TCS may be more effective than one. This target population for the intervention includes all stroke survivors discharged to community living after inpatient hospital care. This represents about 60% of all patients with acute stroke&#x000a0;in New&#x000a0;Zealand, which is &#x0003e;5000 people per year. To test this hypothesis, the present study (TaCAS) will determine whether the TCS session improves outcomes in New&#x000a0;Zealand stroke survivors who are non-M&#x00101;ori and non-Pacific, and whether two TCS episodes are more effective than one.

Research clinicians are trained to encourage participants to ask and answer their own questions, and to form their own ideas. Time spent listening to participants is emphasised, in particular allowing them to consider and express their hopes, fears and priorities. By gently reflecting the participant&#x02019;s own thoughts, the TCS attempts to avoid shaping the patient&#x02019;s goals, a process that can occur in therapist-led goal-setting.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Research clinicians are discouraged from suggesting goals so that the focus remains on what the participant wants, rather than what is perceived to be doable. Using a structured workbook allows participants to write down any forthcoming goals and intermediate steps, and to see this as an ongoing process that they can review in their own time; in essence, &#x02018;Taking Charge&#x02019; of their own recovery. The intervention takes between 60 and 80&#x02009;min to complete.

Site initiation and subsequent site training visits by the Coordinating Investigator, as well as 6-monthly teleconferences between research clinicians and the study team, will allow monitoring of the fidelity of the TCS. Research clinicians are encouraged to document specific problems encountered during the TCS although the participant keeps the TCS workbook as part of the intervention. Due to the personal nature of its contents, the workbook will not be collected or analysed. A central email account is checked daily for questions from research clinicians, and the principal investigator will answer urgent questions immediately by telephone. These queries form a Frequently Asked Questions section in a monthly newsletter to all the sites.</p><p>Blinding is maintained by employing a single-blinded outcomes assessor who will visit participants at each site. The blinded outcomes assessor will have an office that is physically separate from the office of the local research clinicians, and the specific online database user profile allows access only to demographic and outcomes data. Participants are asked not to disclose details of home visits to the blinded outcomes assessor, and intervention participants are asked to hide the TCS workbook when the blinded outcomes assessor visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis</title><p>In MaPSS, the root mean square error for the PCS was 10.8. The clinically significant difference for PCS is five. A total sample size of 360, 120 in each of three arms, has 90% power to detect this difference. With provision for 10% drop out, we plan to recruit 400 participants. Experience in MaPSS has allowed prediction that TaCAS will complete recruitment in mid-2017.</p><p>All outcomes will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. Our primary analysis of the difference in mean PCS (between both Take Charge groups and control, and between high-dose Take Charge and low-dose Take charge) will be by analysis of variance. We will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to analyse the Take Charge dose response as a continuous predictor. A further analysis will adjust for baseline variables including baseline PCS, age and gender. We will use also ANCOVA for our prespecified subgroup analyses using an interaction term between randomised treatment and each of stroke severity, site, age, gender, living situation, type of stroke, thrombolysis and fluoxetine use. The mRS will be analysed as dichotomous (0&#x02013;2 compared with 3&#x02013;5) and by ordinal logistic regression.</p><p>We plan to undertake a meta-analysis of individual patient data from TaCAS and the MaPSS study to compare the TCS against control, using PCS at 12 months after stroke in a linear mixed model meta-analysis. We will also assess combined dependency based on mRS in a generalised linear mixed model.</p><p>Finally, we will undertake a cost-utility analysis of the TCS using employment and earning information, cost to the carer and health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection and study management</title><p>The baseline data will be collected on paper forms by research clinicians at the initial home visits. These forms are scanned and sent to the data management team based at MRINZ for entry into a secure, online database. This database is designed to maintain complete blinding of the outcomes assessor. The data management team at MRINZ performs double data entry of the baseline visit data. Participants undertaking the 6-month questionnaire online will enter their data directly onto this database. The blinded outcomes assessor will enter the 6-month data obtained by telephone or posted questionnaire. The blinded outcomes assessor will also enter the 12-month data onto the database by an electronic tablet at the final home visit. This web-based data management system allows allocation concealment, locking of completed entries and ad hoc consistency checks by study monitors.</p><p>The TCS has no known harms associated. We plan to report the following serious adverse events (SAEs): death, life-threatening event, permanently disabling or incapacitating event, hospitalisation and any significant medical event considered serious by the study investigator. All SAEs will be reported to the New&#x000a0;Zealand Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee of New Zealand (HDEC) in accordance with current guidelines, as well as to the MRINZ within 24&#x02009;hours of the study investigators becoming aware of the event. AE data are&#x000a0;collected at each follow-up and during the study period if the participant or their next-of-kin notify the research team. No interim analysis, for either effectiveness or harm, is planned prior to completion of the study. There are no current data available for data sharing.</p><p>There are no specific plans for independent auditing of this study; however, MRINZ research staff and online database will ensure there is a complete audit trail for external auditing, in the event this is required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>TaCAS will be conducted in compliance with relevant New&#x000a0;Zealand legislation including the Health Information Privacy Code, the Health and Disability Code and the New&#x000a0;Zealand Bill of Rights Act. Ethics approval has been provided by the HDEC, reference 15/CEN/115 and at the research office at each local site. Protocol amendments will first be approved by the HDEC and then by local ethics committees before implementation. The current approved protocol version is version 9.1, dated 20 February 2017.</p><p>Research clinicians will obtain informed consent from the participant when understanding of the study&#x02019;s undertakings has been demonstrated. The participant &#x02018;making a mark&#x02019; on the consent form will be accepted. Proxy consent by a surrogate will not be accepted.</p><p>To maintain confidentiality, participant information will be kept in the locked, central data office at MRINZ as well as at each local site in locked offices. The online database is password-protected and located on an encrypted server belonging to REDCap. Source data from TaCAS will be kept in secure premises for 15 years after completion of the study, then it will be destroyed.</p><p>The day-to-day management of the trial is undertaken by a management committee comprised of the principal investigator, Dr Harry McNaughton, the study coordinator, Dr Vivian Fu, project manager, Tanya Baker, and a team of researchers based at MRINZ. These individuals, as well as our statistician, Dr Mark Weatherall, will have access to the final trial dataset. The TaCAS Study Group meets on an &#x02018;as-required&#x02019; basis with regular updates via newsletters and email. The majority of members meet regularly for national stroke and rehabilitation working groups, study days and conferences where progress and issues with the trial are discussed. Neither the principal investigator nor site investigators have competing interests.</p><p>All members of the TaCAS Study Group will contribute to, and be acknowledged in, the primary trial manuscript. The HRC funding will be acknowledged in all publications. Results will also be presented at national and international stroke meetings, including the National Stroke Rehabilitation Working Group and National Stroke Clinical Working Group meetings. Those participants who have indicated their desire to receive results of the study will have these sent to them.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was randomised on 24 October 2015 and recruitment is expected to complete by June 2017.
