However, current guidelines are difficult to put into action in this population due to a number of barriers, especially the lack of acceptable, feasible, and validated behavioral intervention strategies. The present manuscript reports the rationale, study design and methods, and design considerations of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)-2, a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavior change strategy in increasing total daily PA and reducing sedentary time (SED-time) in patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Starting 7 January 2014, the IDES_2 began enrolling 300 patients with known T2DM of at least 1-year duration in three tertiary referral outpatient Diabetes Clinics in Rome. Additional requirements are age 40 to 80&#x000a0;years, body mass index 27 to 40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, sedentary lifestyle, and physically inactive for at least 6&#x000a0;months, ability to walk 1.6&#x000a0;km without assistance, and eligibility after cardiovascular evaluation. Patients are randomized by center and within each center, by age and type of diabetes treatment to either the intervention or the control group. Patients in the intervention (INT) group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150) receive theoretical and practical exercise counseling consisting of aggregated behavior change techniques (one individual theoretical counseling session plus eight twice-a-week individual theoretical and practical exercise counseling sessions) once a year for 3&#x000a0;years. Patients in the control (CON) group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150), receive standard care, including general physician recommendations for daily PA. The primary outcomes are total daily PA and SED-time, as measured objectively by the use of an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disturbances, well-being/depression, and health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The behavioral intervention strategy tested in the IDES_2 is based on solid theoretical grounds and uses several behavioral change techniques, two factors which were found to improve effectiveness of behavioral intervention. In addition, physicians and exercise specialists have been specifically trained for counselling/prescribing and supervising PA/exercise, respectively, in subjects suffering from metabolic disorders. Finally, the large sample size, the long study duration, and the objective measurement of PA allow statistically significant and scientifically robust conclusions to be drawn on the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention in T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01600937">NCT01600937</ext-link>; 10 October 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-1088-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Behavior change</kwd><kwd>Accelerometer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Approximately 592 million people worldwide are predicted to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by the year 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This epidemic of T2DM is causally related to the rising incidence of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with the increased calorie consumption combined with reduced energy expenditure contributing to the development of both conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) highlight that the dramatic increase of obesity levels among US adults in the general population is mainly due to physical inactivity rather than to caloric intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In fact, another report from the NHANES indicates that less than 50&#x000a0;% of US adults achieve the recommended level of physical activity (PA) and ~30&#x000a0;% of them engage in no PA at all, though projections suggest an improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The problem of sedentary behavior as well as of physical inactivity is even greater among people with T2DM or those at highest risk for developing this condition, who are well below national norms for PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, PA is now considered, together with diet and medication, as a cornerstone of T2DM management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The joint position statement of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] recommends that individuals with T2DM perform at least 150&#x000a0;minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise, plus moderate-to-vigorous resistance training at least 2&#x02013;3 days/week. In addition, the ACSM/ADA guidelines recommend that individuals train under the supervision of qualified exercise trainers, particularly when undertaking resistance exercise, to ensure optimal health benefits and to minimize injuries; individuals are also encouraged to increase total daily unstructured (commuting, occupational, home, and leisure time [LT]) PA. These recommendations are based on a large body of experimental evidence which has been accumulating during the last decade. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Diabetes Aerobic and Resistance Exercise (DARE) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the Health benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in individuals with type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], have demonstrated that combined aerobic and resistance training is more effective than either one alone in reducing hemoglobin (Hb) A<sub>1c</sub> in patients with type 2 diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis including the DARE and HART-D studies showed that structured exercise training, either aerobic, resistance, or both, is associated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially if more than 150&#x000a0;minutes/week is undertaken and when combined with dietary advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, another RCT, the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES), showed that a strategy combining a supervised mixed (aerobic and resistance) exercise training program with structured exercise counseling was more effective than counseling alone in improving physical fitness and quality of life (QoL), ameliorating HbA<sub>1c</sub> and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) 10-year risk scores, and decreasing the number and/or dosage of medications, in a large cohort of sedentary subjects with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, recent findings suggest that higher sedentary time (SED-time) in T2DM individuals is associated with higher metabolic risk, independently of measured confounders and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], thus supporting the hypothesis that the biological responses to SED-time likely influence metabolic risk through pathways distinct from those of MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>However, it is difficult for people with T2DM to put into action these exercise recommendations for a number of external and internal barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Data from trials for T2DM prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] suggest the need to identify effective strategies to promote an adequate amount of PA in sedentary subjects such as those suffering from metabolic disorders. Unfortunately, available studies have applied PA-targeted behavioral interventions that are either heterogeneous or insufficiently detailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, these studies generally involved small samples, and changes in PA were not objectively measured. In the IDES, supervised training, in addition to providing significant health benefits, was successful also in promoting PA outside the supervised sessions, likely by improving patient&#x02019;s knowledge, confidence, and sureness in his/her ability to perform PA effectively and safely on his/her own.</p><p>The IDES_2 is an open-label, parallel RCT aimed at assessing the efficacy of a behavioral intervention strategy derived from the IDES protocol in increasing total daily PA and reducing SED-time in patients with T2DM. This strategy combines the seven-step theoretical exercise counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] provided to all IDES participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] with eight bi-weekly sessions, supervised by an exercise specialist in a dedicated gym facility. These sessions, which in the IDES were administered to the intervention group for the entire 12-month study duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], serve as a theoretical and practical counseling to promote and maintain a physically active behavior. Intervention is repeated every 12&#x000a0;months for 3&#x000a0;years, and PA is objectively monitored throughout the study by the use of an accelerometer. This intervention strategy is compared with current approach, that is, standard medical care including general physician recommendations on PA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The training path dedicated to physicians (diabetologists) was aimed at increasing their awareness of the importance of PA/exercise as a preventive and therapeutic measure in T2DM and other metabolic disorders as well as at instructing them on how to administer a structured exercise counselling and prescribe PA/exercise to subjects suffering from these disease conditions. The training path dedicated to exercise specialists was aimed at instructing professionals with a Bachelor&#x02019;s degree in exercise science on how to assess physical fitness and PA volume and to supervise exercise sessions, including monitoring of clinical parameters, in individuals with metabolic disorders. At the end of the training program, exercise specialists were certified for assisting these patients in their participation to exercise training programs. All these activities were proposed and managed by the Metabolic Fitness Association and were detailed in the online supplemental material of a previous IDES publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To minimize drop-out and reduce the attrition bias due to missing data, both physicians and exercise specialists have been specifically instructed on how to promote participant retention in the trial. In particular, investigators have been asked to contact participants at regular intervals, and subjects from both groups are offered access to intervention after the trial. Moreover, investigators have been instructed to keep up-to-date contact information for participants and to collect complete data for both the primary and secondary outcomes, regardless of whether subjects continue to receive the assigned treatment.

The device is attached at the waistband in midline of the right anterior hip and detects the minutes spent at light, moderate and vigorous intensities and the total volume of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Data are collected and downloaded on a dedicated web-portal. Each participant wears the device for 4&#x000a0;months at baseline and for 7 consecutive days every 4&#x000a0;months thereafter. Upon waking, participants attach the device (immediately after bathing or showering) and wear it all day (except if swimming) up to bedtime, for at least 10&#x000a0;h/day. Patients are also asked to report on a daily diary the hours spent wearing the instrument, sleeping and napping, and performing nonaccelerometer recordable PAs such as swimming, cycling, skiing, etc.</p><p>The time the patient is awake and is not wearing the accelerometer, is assumed to be spent in sedentary activities (for example, taking a shower or getting dressed), unless spent in PAs that cannot be performed while wearing the accelerometer (for example, swimming). SED-time is then calculated by adding this time to that recorded by the accelerometer with readings &#x0003c;100 counts/min, a threshold that corresponds with sitting, reclining, or lying down, that is, to &#x0003c;1.5 METS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Matthews&#x02019; cut-points are used to identify the time spent in light intensity (100 to 1951 counts/min corresponding to 1.5 to 2.9 METs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], whereas Freedson&#x02019;s cut-points are used to determine the time spent in PA of moderate intensity (1952 to 5724 counts/min corresponding to 3 to 5.9 METs) and vigorous intensity (&#x02265;5725 counts/min corresponding to &#x02265;6 METs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The time spent in non-accelerometer-recordable PAs, as reported on the daily diary, is added to that recorded by the accelerometer, according to the intensity of each activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Moderate-intensity PA is combined with vigorous-intensity PA into the MVPAs, as participants spend little time in vigorous-intensity PA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Assessment of physical fitness</title><p>Parameters of physical fitness, that is, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and flexibility, are evaluated at baseline, 12&#x000a0;months, 24&#x000a0;months, and end-of-study. The tests are preceded by two consecutive run-in sessions to allow the patients to become familiar with the testing devices and protocols.</p><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness is assessed by a maximal treadmill exercise test using a Balke protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The treadmill speed is set at 88&#x000a0;m/min and the grade is 0&#x000a0;% during the first minute, 2&#x000a0;% during the second minute, and is then increased every minute by 1&#x000a0;%; after 25&#x000a0;minutes, the treadmill grade is kept constant, whereas the speed is increased by 5.4&#x000a0;m/min every minute. Patients are instructed not to hold the treadmill rails and are verbally encouraged to reach volitional exhaustion, as reported by the patient or by the physician for medical reasons. The time to exhaustion is used to estimate the maximal oxygen uptake, given the high correlation between these two parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>For strength assessment, isometric muscle strength is measured by means of a strain gauge tensiometer (Digimax, Mechatronic GmbH, Germany), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Isometric tests have been chosen since they are reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], do not require complex execution technique, and can therefore be easily performed by both trained and untrained subjects. Lower limb muscle strength is assessed by maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) performed at a costumed leg extension machine (Technogym). The angle at the knee and the hip is fixed at 90&#x000b0;. Upper body muscle strength is assessed by MVCs performed at a shoulder press (Technogym) along the sagittal plane, with a 90&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0; angle at the elbow and between the upper arm and the trunk, respectively. These exercise modalities have been chosen in order to test muscle chains involved in the fundamental activities of daily living. In both tests, subjects are asked to exert their maximal force with both limbs simultaneously and to maintain it for at least 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;s before relaxing. For each exercise, three MVC are performed, with a 3-min rest interval between contractions. Participants are asked to perform additional contractions if the MVC of their last attempt exceeds the previous by at least 5&#x000a0;%. During the MVCs, verbal encouragement is provided, always by the same investigator for all subjects.</p><p>For hip and trunk flexibility assessment, a standard bending test is executed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Standing on a step with legs fully extended, patients are asked to bend the torso forward to try to touch the ground with their fingertips. The test is performed three times and the distance between the finger and the ground is measured by the exercise specialist at the third attempt.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Assessment of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors</title><p>The following modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are being evaluated at baseline, end-of-study, and every 4&#x000a0;months in-between: HbA<sub>1c;</sub> fasting plasma glucose (FPG); serum insulin; C-peptide; BMI; waist circumference; body composition; BP; triglycerides; total, LDL and HDL cholesterol; high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); aspartate aminotransferase (AST); alanine aminotransferase (ALT); &#x003b3;-glutamyl-transpeptidase (&#x003b3;-GT); creatine kinase (CK); complete blood count; uric acid; blood urea nitrogen (BUN); serum creatinine; urinalysis; and albumin/creatinine ratio on first-voided urine samples.</p><p>Body weight and height are measured using a scale and stadiometer, and BMI is then calculated as weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>), whereas waist circumference is taken at the umbilicus. Body composition is evaluated by assessing the fat mass and fat-free mass by the use of a body fat monitor (Tanita BF664, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). BP is recorded with a sphygmomanometer after a 5-minute rest while the patient remains seated with the arm at the heart level.</p><p>Biochemical tests are centralized at the Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry of Sant&#x02019;Andrea Hospital, an accredited and ISO9001 certified structure, using standard analytical techniques (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

A sample size of 300 patients will allow supporting a 5&#x000a0;% dropout rate, as detected in the EXE group from the IDES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and the Student&#x02019;s t test or the corresponding nonparametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney test for continuous variables will be utilized to compare patients&#x02019; characteristics at baseline.</p><p>The intent-to-treat analysis for primary and secondary endpoints will be applied to all randomized patients with a baseline and at least one post-baseline value. The efficacy of the intervention, as compared with standard care, on the primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed by a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA - using PROC MIXED in SAS software) of change from baseline to the end-of-study. In case of differences between groups in baseline values, we will consider a baseline adjustment to improve power. The differences between end-of-study and baseline QoL scores and summary measures between the two groups will be compared using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test, while changes in QoL parameters within each group (end-of-study versus baseline) will be tested using the Wilcoxon test.</p><p>To account for change in medication throughout the study period, which might affect performance with respect to cardiovascular risk factors, we will perform both multiple regression and sensitivity analyses. In the regression models, the dependent variable will be represented by baseline to end-of-study changes. Treatment at baseline and treatment initiation during the study will be included in the model as dichotomous variables (yes versus no), whereas drug dosage will be not taken into consideration. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted by comparing study arms after exclusion of the patients who modified the treatment.</p><p>In order to treat attrition, we will assume that data are missing at random, use adjustment methods for missing data, and conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of inferences about treatment effects to various missing-data assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In particular, repeated measures models with an autoregressive correlation type matrix will be applied in order to account for both missingness at random and potential correlation within subjects.

These data suggested that additional benefits, beyond those of the PA itself, may be provided by exercise (that is, by planned or structured PA that involves repetitive bodily movements performed to improve or maintain one or more of the components of physical fitness, such as cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Based on these early studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], as well as on subsequent RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and a large meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], PA/exercise has become an integral part of T2DM management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, implementation of PA/exercise in routine clinical practice for adults with T2DM is hindered by several impediments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Compliance to PA/exercise recommendations is usually poor in sedentary and physically inactive patients such as those suffering from metabolic disorders, since sustained changes in lifestyle may require much time and effort. In fact, both RCTs and observational studies showed that health benefits from PA/exercise are volume-dependent, since they start beyond a certain threshold, increase almost linearly thereafter, and finally plateau as large volumes are achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, in the long-term, beneficial effects might be obtained also with smaller volumes of daily PA. Previous studies showed that an increase of 1 MET was associated with approximately an 18&#x000a0;% reduced risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and an increase of 1,000 steps resulted in a reduction of postprandial blood glucose by 1.6&#x000a0;mmol/L over a period of 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In addition, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study (EPIC), the greatest reductions in mortality risk were observed between the two lowest activity groups across levels of total and abdominal adiposity, suggesting that efforts to encourage even small increases in activity in sedentary/inactive individuals may be beneficial to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Finally, increasing overall PA may have beneficial effects on disease progression and cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM also by decreasing the amount of SED-time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Thus, behavioral strategies favoring of an increase of PA/exercise as well as a reduction in SED-time may be successful in these individuals, as shown in trials for T2DM prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To this end, counseling interventions focused exclusively on PA were found to be more effective in promoting PA than those targeting multiple behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and diabetes self-management education programs were shown to provide clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control when combined with &#x02265;11 contact hours with delivery personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Unfortunately, acceptable, feasible, and validated behavioral interventions are lacking. Available studies are heterogeneous in that they differ on the theory of behavior change used to underpin them (for example, the transtheoretical model, social cognitive theory, or precede/proceed model); the behavior change techniques used to promote change (for example, goal setting, use of follow-up prompts, or provision of feedback on performance); and the modalities of intervention delivery (for example, frequency and duration of contact and one-to-one versus group delivery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In other circumstances, behavioral interventions have omitted details on these items and also on how intervention was operationalized and evaluated, thus limiting its efficacy and replication outside the research setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finally, available studies generally involved small samples for short periods, and in most of them, changes in PA were not objectively measured. PA and SED-time variables in these studies have typically been derived from self-report measures, generally a 1-week recall. In addition to the imprecision associated with such measures, it is also difficult to accurately capture the total sedentary behavior or light intensity PA by questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Light-intensity PA, which includes activities such as washing dishes, ironing, and other routine domestic or occupational tasks, is the predominant determinant of variability in total daily energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>Barriers that are outside the patient&#x02019;s own control include lack of specific knowledge on the part of both physicians and exercise trainers and lack of dedicated facilities. In particular, these is a lack of evidence-based training programs to equip healthcare professionals with a range of intervention-specific competencies (knowledge and skills) and confidence to support adults with T2DM to become more physically active in the long-term. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 RCTs reported use of treatment fidelity measures in a majority of studies in terms of study design (for example, consistent duration and frequency of sessions across trial arms) and monitoring to improve receipt of intervention components and enactment of intervention&#x02013;related knowledge and skills by patients. In contrast, treatment fidelity strategies to monitor and improve provider training and delivery of treatment in practice were frequently omitted (for example, use of standardized training materials, observation of intervention implementation during training with intervention providers and recipients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Training of intervention providers and treatment fidelity assessment are important for ensuring reproducibility of intervention-related skills in clinical practice and increasing the likelihood of implementation in routine clinical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p>The IDES_2 is an RCT testing the incremental impact of a behavioral intervention strategy for the promotion and long-term maintenance of free-living PA/exercise as well as for the reduction in SED-time in subjects with T2DM. This strategy is based on solid theoretical grounds and uses several behavior change techniques, two factors which were found to improve effectiveness of behavioral intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, physicians and exercise specialists have been trained to administer a structured exercise counselling and prescribe PA/exercise to subjects suffering from metabolic disorders and to supervise exercise sessions, including monitoring of clinical parameters, for these individuals, respectively. Moreover, the large sample size, the long study duration, and the objective measurement of PA using an accelerometer which allows monitoring for long periods of time will provide statistically significant and scientifically robust data on the efficacy of this intervention. Finally, implementation of this program in routine clinical practice is certainly more feasible than that of life-long supervised training programs, the application of which is hampered by the high costs for both health services and patients.</p><p>Based on these considerations, we expect that such behavioral intervention would offer a feasible procedure for the promotion and long-term maintenance of free-living PA/exercise as well as the reduction in SED-time and thus meet the call for a change of paradigm to move beyond the limited clinical focus by including theoretically population-based and "real-life" approaches for the management of T2DM.</p><p>With regard to possible risks of bias, we anticipate that, according to the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], the risk of selection bias is low, due to the use of adequate methods for sequence generation and allocation sequence concealment, although patients who agree to participate in a lifestyle intervention program might be different from those who refuse. Moreover, though blinding of participants and investigators is impossible in exercise intervention studies, the risks of performance, detection, and attrition bias are also limited for several reasons. Regarding performance, despite the fact that independently of intervention, participants might be influenced by knowledge of group assignment in adopting and maintaining a physically active lifestyle, the possibility that unblinding to group assignment may result in an overestimation or an underestimation of intervention effects is low. On the one hand, subjects from the control group of the IDES performed a considerable amount of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and, though PA measurements are known to affect physical activity behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], this would impact on PA volume of both groups. On the other hand, investigators are asked not to provide subjects from the control group with PA advice other than general recommendations for increasing the amount of daily PA (and decreasing the SED-time), and intensification of pharmacological treatment to compensate for lower PA in these individuals will be accounted for in the statistical analysis. Regarding detection, because the primary outcome and some secondary outcomes (physical fitness and cardiovascular risk factors) are objective, the risk of bias is low on both the participant&#x02019;s and investigator&#x02019;s side, although study subjects might be influenced by knowledge of group assignment when filling in questionnaires for musculoskeletal disturbances, well-being/depression, and health-related QoL. Regarding attrition, in the IDES, knowledge of group assignment did not affect remaining in the trial for the entire study period as participants from the control group dropped out at a rate and for reasons similar to those of the exercise group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, as reported above, the risk of attrition bias due to missing data has been adequately prevented and will be treated according to a recent National Research Council report on the topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this trial tests the hypothesis that a theoretical and practical behavioral intervention strategy is more effective than standard care for the promotion and long-term maintenance of free-living PA/exercise as well as for the reduction in SED-time, while reducing modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and improving MS symptoms, well-being, and health-related QoL in T2DM patients.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment was ongoing at the time of manuscript submission.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_1088_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
