<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Thus, the approval pathway of biosimilars is different from generics; very roughly three major steps are employed.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> First, a comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> is done to prove similarity on the molecular level (including in vivo and in vitro assays), second, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study is done to show bioequivalence, and finally, an efficacy study (usually a randomised controlled study) is done to demonstrate clinical equivalence, compared with the reference product. The development of Remsima (code name CT-P13, Celltrion, Incheon, Korea), a biosimilar of infliximab (Remicade, Janssen Biotech, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA), has followed this process<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> and recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The development of biosimilars is anticipated to greatly decrease the economic burden of biological therapy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>SB2 is developed as a biosimilar of infliximab.

Patients had to take MTX for at least 6&#x02005;months and had to be under a stable dose for at least 4&#x02005;weeks before randomisation. For details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, see online supplementary appendix S1.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, multinational, multicentre parallel group study (NCT01936181, EudraCT 2012-005733-37). The study consists of a 54-week main study and an additional 24-week transition (switching) study; this report is about the results of the 54-week main study up to week 30 (for the graphical presentation see online supplementary appendix S2-1), which includes the primary outcome. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB2 or INF of 3&#x02005;mg/kg intravenously. Randomisation and treatment allocation was implemented through an interactive web responsive system (Cenduit LLC, see online supplementary appendix S3-1). Infusion of SB2 or INF was done over 2&#x02005;h; dosing was done at each visit at week 0, week 2, week 6, week 14, week 22, week 30, week 38 and week 46. Dose increases could occur from week 30 by 1.5 mg/kg per visit, up to a total of 7.5&#x02005;mg/kg. The final visit for the main study occurred at week 54. To prevent infusion related reactions (IRRs), premedications such as corticosteroids, antihistamines or paracetamol were allowed per investigator discretion. MTX was given as an oral or parenteral weekly dose of 10&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week with folic acid of 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;mg/week. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids (&#x02264;10&#x02005;mg prednisolone) were allowed if taken for a stable dose for 4&#x02005;weeks before randomisation. Other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs except for MTX were prohibited during the study. All patients were screened for tuberculosis (TB) by medical history, chest X-ray and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube tests (Qiagen); QuantiFERON tests were done at screening, week 22 and week 54. Patients with active TB were ineligible for the study and those who were found to have latent TB had to undergo prophylaxis according to country-specific guidelines to enrol in or continue with the study. The study was conducted in 73 centres in 11 countries from Europe and Asia. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice issued by the International Committee on Harmonisation. All patients gave formal written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assessments</title><p>Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity assessments for all patients were done at each visit before SB2 or INF infusion.</p><p>The primary end point of the study was the ACR 20% (ACR20) response at week 30 in the per-protocol set (PPS). Other secondary efficacy end points included ACR50 and ACR70, disease activity score measured by 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. A post hoc analysis of simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) was done to measure the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (LDA) or remission.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Efficacy components such as tender and swollen joint counts, visual analogue scales scores and health assessment questionnaire of disability index scores were assessed before each infusion.</p><p>Safety assessments included monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, laboratory assessments and reports of adverse events (AEs). AEs were collected in particular for serious AEs, serious infections or TB and IRRs.</p><p>Immunogenicity assessments were done by measuring serum antidrug antibodies (ADAs) to infliximab at each visit before infusion. ADA-positivity was defined as those who had at least one positive ADA result up to week 30. This was a prespecified outcome, according to recommendations from the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It accommodates all measures of ADA incidence over each individual time point that may be subject to variation. Those who were ADA-positive were additionally assessed for neutralising antibodies. A single-assay approach with a SB2 tag was used to assess immunogenicity. ADAs were measured using validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays and neutralising antibodies were measured using a competitive ligand-binding assay (MesoScale Discovery platform, Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland, USA).</p><p>PK assessments were done by measuring the serum trough concentrations (C<sub>trough</sub>) of infliximab before each infusion. Serum infliximab concentrations were determined using a validated ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective was to demonstrate equivalence of ACR20 at week 30. To determine equivalence between SB2 and INF the 95% CI of the ACR20 rate difference had to be within the prespecified margin of &#x02212;15% and +15%. The equivalence margin was determined using data from several INF studies<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and regulatory guidelines.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Sample size was calculated assuming this equivalence margin of &#x000b1;15%, an effect size of 57% and a 20% dropout rate. With a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, a sample size of at least 292 randomised patients per treatment group was required in order to reach the required subject size for the PPS.</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome was analysed using the PPS and the full analysis set (FAS).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> FAS follows the same principles of the intention-to-treat analysis; FAS included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of SB2 or INF. In addition, if missing data occurred, such patients were assumed to be ACR20 non-responders in FAS. For analysis of ACR20, the rate difference was adjusted by baseline C reactive protein and geographical region using a non-parametrical analysis of covariance.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Analysis of ACR50 and ACR70 was also done in PPS and FAS; DAS28, SDAI, CDAI and EULAR response were done only in the FAS (only available DAS28 and SDAI/CDAI were analysed in this case). Subgroup analysis of ACR20 was done by comparing ACR20 response rates within each ADA subgroup (positive or negative) in a prespecified manner. To formally test the differential influence of ADA on SB2 or INF, an analysis of covariance was done including an ADA-by-treatment interaction term in the model.</p><p>A prespecified exponential time-response model using non-linear mixed models<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was fitted to compare the ACR20 response between SB2 and INF over time (see also online supplementary appendix S3-2). The squared differences across all time points from the two curves (2-norm) were measured, and if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the 2-norm was less than 61.80, the two curves were considered equivalent.</p><p>Safety results were presented as the number of patients with percentage who had a particular AE in the safety analysis set (SAF; those who received at least one dose of SB2 or INF). Immunogenicity results were presented as the number of patients with percentages having incident ADA up to week 30 from the SAF. PK assessment was done in the PK population (approximately the first enrolled 50% of the study population) up to week 30. PK results are shown as mean C<sub>trough</sub> with SD and coefficient of variation from the PK population.</p><p>General statistical analysis was done using SAS V.9.2 (SAS, Cary, North Carolina, USA). PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analyses (WinNonlin V.5.2, Pharsight, Mountain View, California, USA).

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In ADA-positive patients we observed an approximately 40% higher rate of infusion reactions for SB2 compared with INF; however, among the ADA-negative patients, infusion reactions were twice as high for INF than SB2. The overall rate of infusion reactions was similar with 5.2% for SB2 and 4.4% for INF. Long-term observation will allow further insights into this important aspect. The PK results showed a comparable distribution of mean C<sub>trough</sub> and variance to previous infliximab studies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>As mentioned, biosimilars are hoped to decrease the economic burden in the treatment of RA. The issue of cost-effectiveness of biologics<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> may have to be addressed again with the advent of biosimilars,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which could also have significant influence on local reimbursement policies.</p><p>While long-term efficacy and safety profiles and pharmacovigilance in the postmarket setting are important considerations<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and will have to be obtained, these are not within the scope of this report. However, to address these aspects at least in part, the main study is continuing with a 54-week end point for assessing long-term efficacy and safety including radiographic damage.</p><p>In conclusion, from the results of this randomised, double-blind study, SB2 has demonstrated clinical equivalence to INF in terms of ACR20 at week 30; other efficacy end points also show consistently similar findings when compared with the originator product. The safety, immunogenicity and PK profiles are comparable between SB2 and INF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2015-207764-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1200" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients who were involved in this study, the study personnel who made this work possible, and the study investigators: <italic>Bosnia and Herzegovina</italic>: Sokolovic S, Mekic M, Prodanovic N; <italic>Bulgaria</italic>: Dimitrov E, Geneva-Popova M, Mihaylova M, Staykov I, Toncheva A, Penev D, Oparanov B; <italic>Czech Republic</italic>: Dokoupilova E, Galatikova D, Ciferska H, Vitek P, Janska L; <italic>Korea, Republic of</italic>: Shim SC, Kang YM, Kim HA, Choe J-Y, Lee S-H, Bae S-C, Kim J, Kwok S-K, Lee YJ, Lee S-K; <italic>Latvia</italic>: Kadisa A, Mihailova A, Saulite-Kandevica D, Saleniece S; <italic>Lithuania</italic>: Milasiene R, Baranauskaite A, Arstikyte I, Basijokiene V; <italic>Philippines</italic>: Santos Estrella P, Hao L, Manapat-Reyes BH, Eullaran R; <italic>Poland</italic>: Porawska W, Kolczewska A, Stasiuk B, Janecka I, Grabowicz-Wasko B, Jedrychowicz-Rosiak K, Leszczynski P, Ruzga Z, Rychlewska-Hanczewska A, Hajduk-Kubacka S, Hilt J, Niebrzydowski J, Zielinska A; <italic>Romania</italic>: Berghea F, Popoviciu H, Mirea G, Pavel M, Ieremia G, Tanasescu C; <italic>Ukraine</italic>: Rekalov D, Zhdan V, Povoroznyuk V, Ignatenko G, Ter-Vartanian S, Vatutin M, Stanislavchuk M, Gnylorybov A, Golovchenko O, Yatsyshyn R, Tseluyko V, Yagensky A, Iaremenko O, Shevchuk S; <italic>UK</italic>: Ong V, Mckay N, and the study team: Ilsun Hong (Samsung Bioepis).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
