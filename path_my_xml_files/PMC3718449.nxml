human body, functions guaranteed mainly by the bone, ligament and muscle structures that
compose this articular complex. Nevertheless, this region is constantly exposed to stress,
since it absorbs a large part of the bodyweight impact during the movements of the human
body, and is considered one of the joints that sustains the most injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup></p><p>Knee ligament injuries are very common nowadays, and are considered epidemiological in
nature, particularly in sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> The
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most affected ligament, especially in individuals
aged between 15 and 25 years who are assiduous athletes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> while the incidence of isolated ACL tears is 30% per year and more than
100 thousand surgical reconstruction procedures are performed annually in the United States.
ACL injuries are frequently associated with meniscal injuries in 96% of chronic injuries and
82% of acute injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> The treatment for ligament injuries is frequently surgical, as it aims to restore the
anatomical and functional stability of the knee joint, allowing the individual to return to
preoperative activity levels, thus improving their quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup> ACL
reconstruction is a procedure widely researched by the scientific community, with a certain
degree of controversy still existing. The gold standard for this surgery is performance
through arthroscopy, a less invasive technique than open surgery and that affords a more
accelerated rehabilitation process.</p><p>The rehabilitation process is essential and targets, after ACL reconstruction surgery, the
reduction of pain, edema and inflammatory process; improvement of neuromuscular control,
muscle strength, range of motion, gait and proprioception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup> Accelerated
rehabilitation protocols have been considered more effective and indicate early mobilization
and weight bearing, yet in this phase the pain and edema can interfere in the rehabilitation
process, hampering the individual's return to their routine activities and their
functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>Cryotherapy is a method used to alleviate the pain and to decrease edema during
rehabilitation, as a low-cost technique of easy access, commonly employed in musculoskeletal
disorders, especially in acute soft-tissue injuries. Some studies demonstrate that after ACL
reconstruction surgery, cryotherapy promotes the reduction of pain, drug intake, length of
hospital stay, the improvement of knee ROM and the patient's quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the widespread use of cryotherapy, there are still differences of opinion in the
literature concerning the effectiveness of its various application methods and the
quantification of variables such as frequency, duration and best time for use. The
cryotherapy application time ranges between 10 and 20 minutes, from two to four times a
day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Based on the hypothesis that cryotherapy is effective in reducing pain and improving knee
ROM, during the immediate post-ACL reconstruction surgery rehabilitation process, the
purpose of this study was to standardize an inpatient physiotherapy protocol associated with
the use of cryotherapy. </p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of cryotherapy in relation to the improvement of pain and
knee ROM in adults submitted to ACL reconstruction surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Pilot study of a randomized prospective clinical trial, carried out at a tertiary care
Public Teaching Hospital located in the city and state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo.</p><sec><title>Sample</title><p>The sample followed the inclusion criteria: adult individuals (over 18), both sexes,
submitted to elective ACL reconstruction surgery, isolated, or associated with partial or
total meniscectomy of one meniscus or both. The exclusion criteria were: complex knee
injuries; patients with vasospastic disorders, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, Livedo
reticularis or acrocyanosis; sensibility alterations such as hypersensitivity to cold,
hives, purpura, or deficit in deep or superficial sensibility, i.e., tactile or painful,
detected through previous evaluation. </p><p>The individuals were recruited electively for surgery and were invited to take part in
the study on the first day of hospitalization (preoperative period), and after acceptance,
signed the "Informed Consent Form", and were then randomized to one of the two groups (A -
Intervention and B - Control). </p><p>The sample size was calculated and consisted of 100 participants; however, as this is a
pilot study (which uses at least 10% of the calculated sample), a minimum of 10
participants would be necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The generation of the allocation sequence was performed by an individual not involved in
the study. The sequential numbers were kept in opaque, non-translucent, sealed envelopes,
and were only delivered to the therapist involved in the study at the time of the
allocation of the individual, i.e., on the first postoperative day.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>The procedures and interventions used in the present study are in accordance with ethical
principles and were evaluated and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina (protocol
CEP 1025/10).</p><p>The patients included in the study were assessed by an evaluator aware of the survey
objectives, on the first postoperative day.</p><p>The care protocol prepared by the Physiotherapy Team of the Orthopedic and Traumatology
Ward of Hospital S&#x000e3;o Paulo (UNIFESP-EPM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table

However, in the Intervention group (A), the patients received the application of an ice
pack (using crushed ice wrapped in sterile plastic material) in the anterior region of the
affected knee, with the limb elevated, for 20 minutes. </p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Post-ACL reconstruction rehabilitation protocol.</p></caption><table frame="below" rules="all"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Post-ACL reconstruction rehabilitation protocol Orthopedic and

beginning and at the end of all the physiotherapy sessions, in both groups. VAS is
represented by a 100mm dash, and is interpreted as follows: values of 0-4mm can be
considered without pain, 5-44 mm medium pain, 45-74mm moderate pain and 75-100mm severe
pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The evaluation of the knee flexion and extension ROM was executed in degrees, through
goniometry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> using a universal
goniometer of plastic material. The articular line of the knee was used as an axis to
position the goniometer, while the fixed arm remained parallel to the lateral surface of
the femur in the direction of the greater trochanter, and the mobile arm remained parallel
to the lateral side of the fibula in the direction of the lateral malleolus. Standard
values of 90&#x000b0;;for knee flexion and 0&#x000b0;; for extension were considered on the
first postoperative day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title><p>The results were presented through a descriptive analysis, with mean and standard
deviation. The evaluation of results was also based on absolute and percentual improvement,
with a comparison between the initial and final condition of the individuals after the
physiotherapy treatment, for groups (A) Intervention and (B) Control. Absolute improvement
demonstrates how many degrees or how many centimeters altogether the patient has improved,
i.e., if the initial pain was 5 cm and the final pain 2 cm, the absolute improvement is 3
cm. The percentual improvement demonstrates the improvement in percentage at the end of the
physiotherapy treatment. In this example it would have been 60%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The flowchart of participants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>

Intervention group was composed of 10 individuals and the Control group of nine individuals.
There was loss of 24%, as they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. The causes for
exclusion were: presence of systemic disease (n= 1), other ligament injuries (n= 2), removal
of osteochondroma in the same surgery (n=1), did not undergo surgery (n=1) and attended only
one physiotherapy session (n=1).</p><p>The characteristics of the sample are represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table
2</xref>. In both groups, the participants received two physiotherapy sessions on the
first postoperative day, one of which was in the morning, and the other in the afternoon.
The knee flexion and extension ROM goniometric measurement was made at the start and at the
end of the physiotherapy sessions, whereas all these measurements were submitted to the
calculation of the mean and standard deviation, and can be observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t04">4</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">3</xref>. We can observe that the Intervention group obtained an improvement in mean knee
flexion ROM compared to the Control group, and as regards to the mean knee extension ROM the
Intervention group started the physiotherapy treatment with a greater knee extension deficit
than the Control group. Nevertheless, at the end of the treatment the group achieved an
improvement in the mean knee extension goniometry in comparison to the Control group.</p><table-wrap id="t02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the Sample.</p></caption><table frame="below" rules="all"><thead><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Sample</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Intervention Group (n=10)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Control Group (n=9)</bold></td></tr><tr align="center"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Average age</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>31.9 (21-58 years)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>27.22 (19-34 years)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Sex</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=9</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=0</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Affected limb</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=6</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=3</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Type of graft</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flexor Tendon</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=9</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Meniscal Injury</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=7</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Meniscectomy</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Partial medial</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=3</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Partial medial and lateral</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=4</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total medial and partial lateral</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Number of postoperative sessions</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="t03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Mean and standard deviation of the range of motion of knee flexion in the Intervention

reconstruction surgery, measured through knee ROM and VAS. As described in the literature,
we observed that the application of the ice pack is an effective method for improving pain
and knee ROM after ACL reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> Warren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>
demonstrated that in various injuries of soft tissues of the knee, the ice wrap presented
better intra-articular temperature reduction in patients when compared to the external knee
cooling device (<italic>Cryocuff </italic><sup>&#x000ae;</sup><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>The association of cryotherapy with compression and elevation of the limb can be considered
a factor of improvement for individuals as regards the analyzed outcomes. Bleakley et
al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> in a systematic review,
presented several comparisons between ice application methods, demonstrating that
associating cryotherapy with compression and elevation is effective when compared to
cryotherapy alone, yet this study did not present an appropriate duration for application of
the ice. On the other hand, Edwards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup> compared the use of ice and of compression with the non-application of
cryotherapy and showed similar effects between the groups, yet this study was considered a
high risk of methodological bias. </p><p>As regards the duration of cryotherapy application, differences of opinion are found in the
literature, and it can range from 10 to 20 minutes to 30 to 45 minutes. In the systemic
review mentioned previously concerning the application of ice, few studies evaluated the
effectiveness of ice after injuries to the soft tissues and there was no evidence of the
best method and duration of the treatment. As a conclusion, further studies need to be
conducted with better standardization of this method in order to clarify which parameter is
best for increasing the effectiveness of cryotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup></p><p>It can also be emphasized that the effectiveness of an accelerated physiotherapy protocol
in this study brought about an improvement in the outcomes analyzed in the two groups. The
subject of physiotherapy treatment after ACL reconstruction has recently been researched in
depth by various authors, consequently there is a focus on the accelerated physiotherapy
protocol since in the immediate postoperative period, it promotes a decrease in
hospitalization time besides an improvement of knee ROM and of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup></p><p>As regards the characteristics of the sample, there were no major differences between the
Intervention and Control groups in relation to age of the participants. They were all male,
underwent surgery with the same type of graft from tendons of the knee flexor muscles and
attended two physiotherapy sessions on the first postoperative day. These findings
corroborate those of a review, showing that gender did not produce differences in relation
to the results found, and it is hard to determine whether there is an effect of age in the
groups or not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup> The Intervention and
Control groups had some differences with regards to the surgery performed, relating only to
whether surgery actually occurred or not, and to the type of meniscectomy; however, the
patients were randomized before the surgery to one of the two groups and thus the surgical
approach to be adopted was not known.</p><p>The procedures and assessment of the patients were not blind, which can be considered a
bias in the results of the present study, yet it is worth mentioning that the tools, such as
the goniometry and the Visual Analog Scale of pain, are a routine practice for
physiotherapists in the hospital environment. In this study there was a standardization of
the evaluation, which consisted of only one evaluator, yet trained to perform the
goniometric measurement through a correct positioning of the goniometer and of the
individual, and we also standardized the method of application of the Visual Analog Scale of
pain, particularly in relation to the verbal command and explanation of the extreme points
of the scale: without pain and maximum pain. </p><p>VAS is the pain intensity scale most frequently found in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> As
it is a subjective scale, differences can be found and questioned among individuals. Pain is
considered an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, presenting a threshold that can
vary among people and the ability to tolerate pain varies according to personality, mood and
the circumstances of each individual. VAS does not evaluate pain in an objective and direct
manner - it only allows us to question the individual to obtain an estimate of the pain that
they were feeling at a particular time. For this reason we cannot affirm that the results
found among the participants are reliable, but we can correlate the effects at the beginning
and at the end of the rehabilitation in the opinion of a single individual.</p><p>According to the results of the VAS, the Intervention group (A) had a decrease in mean pain
when compared with the Control group (B), but we can observe that in the Control group the
point of the second session (afterwards) presents a value that is inconsistent with the
normal evolution of the treatment. This point may be due to the small number of participants
of this study, but even if we disregard this value, the Intervention group (A) still
presents an important improvement in the mean initial and final pain of the sessions when
compared with the Control group. The findings of this study are in accordance with those
found in literature, and the studies indicate reduction of knee pain intensity with the use
of cryotherapy after the ACL reconstruction surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup> and cryotherapy in the immediate postoperative period as it is an
inexpensive measure of easy access and with a high level of satisfaction among
individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> When pain intensity is related to the different types of surgical approach, with regards to
whether meniscectomy occurred or not, it is worth pointing out that in literature, a study
that compared groups in which the individuals did not undergo meniscectomy, or had meniscal
resection, or meniscal suturing, evaluating the evolution of pain intensity over the seven
days of ACL reconstruction surgery postoperative period, showed that there were no
significant differences in pain intensity, using VAS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup> which corroborates the findings of our study.</p><p>The results found for knee flexion ROM showed that the mean goniometry had an important
improvement in the Intervention group at the beginning and at the end of the second session,
when compared to the Control group. Although the Control group had a better mean knee
extension ROM value than the Intervention group at the end, it cannot be said that the
treatment without ice was better, since on average the individuals of the Control group
started the treatment in a better state than those of the Intervention group. It can also be
perceived that in the Control group there was practically no improvement since the initial
condition, while the Intervention group started with greater extension deficit than the
control group, but had an important improvement in the mean knee extension ROM. </p><p>According to similar studies, there is a difference of opinion in relation to the
improvement of knee ROM with the use of cryotherapy after ACL reconstruction surgery. The
studies indicate that there was no significant improvement of ROM in the group that made use
of ice, when compared with the control group; however, these studies do not describe how and
when the goniometry was performed, they just report that the two groups obtained an increase
in the ROM of the knee in the postoperative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, in relation to the absolute and percentual improvement of the treatment, with
baseline in the initial condition and at the end of the physiotherapy treatment, the
Intervention group achieved an important absolute and percentual improvement when compared
with the Control group, for the parameters of pain intensity, flexion ROM and knee
extension.</p><p>Thus, the use of cryotherapy is directly related to the immediate postoperative period and
the prognosis of functionality after hospital discharge. After using ice, the patients,
already in the hospital environment, manage to improve the parameters of pain and ROM,
reducing the hospital stay time, the expenses of the health system with the hospitalization
and the therapy of analgesic medications, therefore also improving the quality of life and
satisfaction of the individuals. An important fact is that cryotherapy is a rehabilitation
method of easy application that can be guided and recommended for use at home, to assist in
the progress of rehabilitation, avoiding the persistence of pain, edema, inflammation and
complications in the postoperative period such as decreased range of movement in the joints,
motor control and gait alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>
Therefore, the use of ice is geared towards functional improvement and the return of
individuals to the level of activities of daily living prior to the injury. This study, as is the case of a pilot study, demonstrated good results with cryotherapy use
after ACL reconstruction surgery in a reduced population. The authors intend to continue
with this work to be able to conclude whether this type of therapy really is effective and
safe, since it is a highly accessible, low-cost method, and future surveys with adequate
methodological criteria would contribute to the scientific community, aiming to improve the
satisfaction and quality of life of individuals after this surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Cryotherapy in the immediate postoperative period in association with an exercise protocol
