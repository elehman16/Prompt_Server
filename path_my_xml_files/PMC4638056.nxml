Studies indicate that even the fairly loose glucose target of 70&#x02013;180 mg/dl is achieved consistently in only a few patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Surgeries may trigger the stress response,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] resulting in hemodynamic, metabolic, and hormonal changes which may alter the blood glucose level.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In order to avoid complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia in surgeries, it seems necessary to minimize effects of anesthetics on blood glucose level. This study was performed to compare the effects of different sedation methods (propofol + fentanyl and midazolam + fentanyl) on blood glucose level as some previous studies suggested that different sedation and anesthesia methods have different effects on it.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Nascimento <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that there is no influence of the preoperative serum glucose level on perioperative clinical complications or visual acuity outcome in cataract surgeries.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, phacoemulsification surgery seemed to be the ideal surgery for this study.</p><p>In a study performed by Cok <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] it was presented that the combination of propofol + remifentanil resulted in greater levels of blood glucose compared to isoflurane + remifentanil. In another study, Kitamura <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggested that the effect on glucose metabolism of propofol is much less than that of sevoflurane.</p><p>In the current study, effects of two common methods of light sedation on glucose were evaluated: Propofol + midazolam and fentanyl + midazolam. Vital signs and drug complications were evaluated as well.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the data revealed that there is no statistically significant difference in the blood glucose level during and after light sedations using propofol + midazolam and fentanyl + midazolam.</p><p>It is also implied that postoperative complications of these two methods have no significant difference in frequency, and in both methods, nausea and bradycardia were the most common complications. Vital signs also did not have significant differences compared in both groups, except for a higher RR in patients receiving propofol + midazolam prior to the surgery.</p><p>Our study faced some limitations. We used glucometer for measuring blood glucose level which is not as accurate as laboratory methods. Moreover, our subjects were not nil <italic>per os</italic> for a similar time, which could have affected their blood glucose level prior to the surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Considering all the presented data above, light sedation methods of propofol + fentanyl and midazolam + fentanyl seemed not to have any differences in alteration of blood glucose level. Therefore, if there are no specific contraindications for using propofol or midazolam, it is suggested that both methods can be used in diabetic patients, and selection of each method is upon the anesthesiologist and with considering other factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was financially supported by a grant (number 392124) from the vice-chancellor for research, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and was carried out in Feiz hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> A grant (number 392124) from the vice-chancellor for research, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and was carried out in Feiz Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Forouhi</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name><name><surname>Wareham</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of diabetes</article-title><source>Medicine (Abingdon)</source><year>2014</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>698</fpage><lpage>702</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25568613</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Levetan</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Passaro</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jablonski</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kass</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ratner</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unrecognized diabetes among hospitalized patients</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><year>1998</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>246</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9539990</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chuah</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Papamargaritis</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pillai</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishnamoorthy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>le Roux</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Morbidity and mortality of diabetes with surgery</article-title><source>Nutr Hosp</source><year>2013</year><volume>28</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>47</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23834046</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lopes</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalil</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Postoperative glucose control following coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Predictors and clinical outcomes</article-title><source>J Am Coll Cardiol</source><year>2013</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>10S</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leslie</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Troedel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Does anaesthesia care affect the outcome following craniotomy?</article-title><source>J Clin Neurosci</source><year>2002</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>231</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12093125</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geisser</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofbauer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Lattermann</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fussel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wachter</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Sevoflurane versus isofluran &#x02013; Anaesthesia for lower abdominal surgery.
