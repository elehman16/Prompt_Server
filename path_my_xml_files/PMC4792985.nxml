with diabetes mellitus. [Subjects and Methods] A clinical, prospective open-label
randomized intervention study was conducted of 60 adult patients, with distal sensorimotor
diabetic neuropathy two groups of 30 patients, with diabetes mellitus type 2 with distal
sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy. Patients in group A were treated with combined physical

significant improvements in conduction velocity and terminal latency of n. peroneus. Group
A patients showed a statistically significant improvements in conduction velocity and
terminal latency, while group B patients also showed a statistically significant
improvements in conduction velocity and terminal latency. This was reflected in a
significant improvements in electrophysiological parameters (conduction velocity,
amplitude and latency) of the motor and sensory nerves (n. peroneus, n. suralis).

diabetes mellitus<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence in
patients suffering from diabetic polyneuropathy varies from 23 to 29%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The presence of neurological symptoms and/or signs in
electroneurographic (ENG) findings is necessary for confirming the diagnosis of distal
sensorimotor diabetic polyneuropathy (DSMP)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Slow sensitivity and motor velocity of
conduction exists in clinically evident neuropathy, especially in the feet, where the
peripheral nerves are the longest. The degree of deceleration of velocity conduction is
proportional to the severity of the underlying disease<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While drug therapy has been widely researched into and is quite well defined in the
treatment of diabetic neuropathy, this is not the case with physical procedures. Physical
therapy for the treatment of patients with distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy has
increasingly been gaining in importance, especially as an analgesic therapy. Furthermore, in
previous studies have neither researched the effects of combined physical therapy on
electro-diagnostic parameters, nor made comparisons the effects of the alpha lipoic acid.
Therapies directed at the pathogenesis process of diabetic neuropathies comprise aldose
reductase inhibitors, alpha-lipoic acid, benfotiamine, protein kinase C inhibitors, gene
therapy, gamma-linoleic acid, immunotherapy, and others<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that is endogenously produced in the body and has
become studies the drug of choice for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is particularly important to emphasize the necessity of prompt therapy, before the
occurrence of severe and irreversible changes in the nerves. Alpha-lipoic acid has a clear
metabolic effect, improves microcirculation, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. All these
facts act synergistically and complexly in a chain of pathophysiological processes in the
development of the diabetic neuropathies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most commonly applied physical agents are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS), impulse magnetic field, stable galvanization and exercise. TENS is a method of
treating the symptoms of pain by stimulating the sensitive nerve endings in the skin. It the
modulations the pain at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and is based on the theory of
control of pain inputs (the gate control theory of pain)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Galvanic current causes hyperemia of the skin and deeper tissues
through which it passes and reduces pain. Hyperemia improves trophic tissue, reduces
swelling and inflammation and helps to alleviate the factors that induce pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical activity is beneficial for the
metabolic processes in the body of diabetic patients and is implemented as a permanent
therapeutic measure (it increases the biological effectiveness of insulin, sensitivity of
insulin receptors, collateral circulation and the transport of oxygen, it lowers levels of
triglycerides, cholesterol and blood pressure)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinical studies have so far investigated the effects of certain modalities of physical
therapy and alpha-lipoic acid in patients with various causes and types of neuropathies<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the available literature has no data on comparative,
randomized studies of the effects of physical therapy and alpha lipoic acid in patients with
sensory neuropathy, especially in the subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus. Bearing
in mind the significant differences between the two therapeutic strategies in terms of
clinical-management and economic aspects, there is an interest in comparative studies in
this field. Thus, the main objective of our research was to investigate the effect of the
application of combined physical procedures to electromyoneurographic (EMNG) parameters of
peripheral sensory and motor nerves (n. peroneus and n. suralis) and compare it with the
effect of treatment with alpha-lipoic acid in patients with distal sensorimotor
polyneuropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A clinical, prospective open-label randomized intervention study was conducted of 60 adult
(18&#x02005;years or older) who were patients at the Clinical Center, Kragujevac, Center for
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation during 2012-2013. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Clinical Center, Kragujevac.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were: patients with DSMP for longer than two months
diagnosed with the presence of signs and symptoms (pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia to
anesthesia, muscular weakness) and EMNG findings; treatment with antidiabetic therapy which
had not been changed for at least 6 months; and a signed, voluntary consent to participation
in the study.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: vitamin B12 deficiency, alcoholism, chronic renal
insufficiency, thyroid dysfunction, immunodeficiency, systemic connective tissue disease,
severe liver damage, cerebrovascular ischemia, cardiac decompensation, acute coronary
syndrome in the previous 6 months, unregulated elevated blood pressure (&#x0003e;160/80 mmHg),
treatment with chemotherapy in the last 10&#x02005;years, state after severe polytrauma, as well as
use of drugs that can damage the peripheral nerves (vincristine, paclitaxel, cisplatin,
streptomycin, isoniazid, ethionamide, dapsone, nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, emetine,
chloroquine, amiodarone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, hydralazine, indomethacin); the existence
of a contraindication to the implementation any of the planned physical agents (pregnancy,
fever, malignancy, acute infectious disease, decompensation of vital organs, the presence of
metal in tissue, diseases or damage to the integrity of the skin at the electrode to
application); or hypersensitivity to alpha-lipoic acid of 60 adult (18&#x02005;years or older),
galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or Lapp lactose deficiency.</p><p>The study was conducted during three diagnostic and therapeutic cycles, each of which
lasted 16 days and the period of time between cycles was 6&#x000b1;1 week with a total study
duration of six months.</p><p>The subjects were divided into two groups of 30 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and
DSMP, based on clinical symptoms and signs, as well as the parameters of EMNG findings.
Using a computer random number generator, each patient was randomly allocated to one of the
two experimental groups (therapeutic arms): Group A or B.</p><p>Group A patients were treated with combined physical procedures. The method of combined
physical procedures included stable galvanization (SG), pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMP),
TENS, and exercise. SG (Galvan plus, Electronic Design Medical, Serbia) was applied once a
day for 20 minutes, using the standard rectangular electrodes placed longitudinally along
both legs. The intensity was 0.1&#x02013;0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the subjective feelings
of patients. PEMP (Magomil-2, Electronic Design Medical, Serbia) was applied once a day for
30 minutes along both lower legs and feet, over the antenna at a frequency of 10&#x02005;Hz and
intensity of 40&#x02005;mT. TENS (TENS-2, Electronic Design Medical, Serbia) was applied once a day
for 30 minutes along both feet longitudinally, at a frequency of 85&#x02005;Hz and with short-term
pulses (4&#x02005;ms) (appliance). Exercise performed once a day for 30 minutes, according to
individually tailored protocol. Active and active-assisted exercises were used to the point
of pain for strengthening the muscles of the lower extremities and to increase the range of
motion of all joints in the lower extremities.</p><p>The second group (Group B) patients were treated with alpha lipoic acid in accordance with
the conditions specified in the license for marketing of the medicine in Serbia
(indications, dosage regimen, precautions, etc.) and standard clinical practice. In the
period from 2 to 15 days of hospitalization, patients were treated with intravenous
administration of alpha lipoic acid (600&#x02005;mg in 500&#x02005;ml of 0.9% NaCl, once a day). Upon
completion of hospitalization, and during the entire period of the study, subjects have
continued to regularly take oral alpha lipoic acid at a dose of 600&#x02005;mg (one tablet a day, in
the morning before breakfast).</p><p>On patient admission and upon the completion of the last (third) diagnostic and therapeutic
cycle (after 6 months) an analysis of EMNG of the sensory and motor nerves of the lower
extremities was conducted (n. peroneus and n. suralis). EMNG testing was performed using the
latest-generation Medtronic Keypoint (Denmark, Skovlunde, www.medtronic.com). The duration
of the procedure was about 45 minutes, including reading of the results. The method examines
individual nerve conduction velocity by registering evoked potentials directly from the
sensitive fibers, while the motor fibers are tested through evoked potentials with or from
muscles innervated by these neurons. The procedure does not require any preparation, and it
is performed by placing surface (skin) and/or deep electrodes, usually both types of
electrodes, as decided by the doctor who is performing the examination of n. peroneus and n.
suralis.</p><p>The median value, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum values, as well as
the normality of the distribution of all continuous variables were determined, using the
Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to compare the mean values of continuous variables within the
tested groups, the paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for data sets with normal
distribution, or alternatively Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test of matched pairs. Differences between the
compared groups were investigated using the independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney test data
sets without a normal distribution. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the frequency
(incidence) of categorical (dichotomous) variables. Statistical significance was accepted
for all the results where the probability of the null hypothesis was less than 5%
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The research results are presented in tabular form. All statistical
calculations were carried out using the commercial software package SPSS version 20.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The basic characteristics of the patients in group A, the physical therapy group and group

program of physical therapy, improved the electromyoneurography parameters of the patients
with diabetic neuropathy, with approximately comparable extent. A larger number of studies
have examined the effects of the physical therapy and alpha lipoic acid in patients with
neuropathy. However, the variety of physical methods, treatment protocols, patient
characteristics and etiological factors of neuropathy results in a distinct methodological
heterogeneity, which is why the results can only be indirectly compared to each other, and
to the results of our study, as well.</p><p>A clinical study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> showed the effect of
pulsed electromagnetic fields on the regeneration of nerves in patients with DSMP, but
without a statistically significant reduction of pain (VAS). In the study by Bosy et
al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, an increase in the speed of
conduction was found through n. peroneus after application of magnetic therapy to n.
suralis. Our results are consistent with that study, except that in our study, in addition
to a magnetic therapy, electrotherapy (TENS and SG) was applied, too.</p><p>In the study by Graack et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, after
application of electromagnetotherapy, a statistically significant reduction the distal
latency of n. peroneus and a significant increase in the speed of conduction through
n.peroneus were shown, but there was no significant change in the amplitude of the action
potential of n. peroneus. Our results also indicated there was a statistically significant
increase in the speed of conduction through n.peroneus in group B patients, and a reduction
in the distal latency of n.peroneus in both groups of A and B; however, no statistically
significant difference was found between the two therapeutic modalities. Unlike the study by
Graack et al., the therapy applied in our study increased the amplitude of the action
potential of n. peroneus in group A patients.</p><p>A four-year study<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
performance of exercise resulted in a statistically significant increase in the speed of
conduction through n. peroneus, while the conduction velocity through n. suralis did not
significantly change. Several other studies have confirmed these results<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In our present study, the performance of exercise combined with magnetotherapy and
electrotherapy also achieved a significant increase in the speed of conduction through
n.peroneus in group B patients, but the application of these physical agents also
significantly increased the speed of conduction through n. suralis.</p><p>A study by Fisher et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated
statistically significant improvements in EMNG parameters (speed of conduction, amplitude
and latency through the motor and sensory nerves) after a 24-week exercise program for
patients with DSMP. Our results are in agreement with the results of that study, but out
method differed in that it combined training with electrotherapy and magnetotherapy. There
was also a difference in the duration of treatment: physical therapy was shorter in our
study than in the study by Fischer et al.</p><p>A study<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the use of alpha
lipoic acid in the treatment of DSMP led to a significant increase in the speed of
conduction through n. peroneus and n. suralis which partially matches the results of our
present study. These results suggest beneficial effect of combining these two methods of
treatment for patients with DSMP, which should be studied in future research.</p><p>The application of physical agents and alpha lipoic acid mentioned above favorably
influenced the course and outcome of patients with symmetrical distal sensorimotor diabetic
polyneuropathy. This was reflected in a significant improvement in electrophysiological
parameters (conduction velocity, amplitude and latency) of the motor and sensory nerves (n.
peroneus, n. suralis). These results present further evidence in favour of the use of
physical agents in the treatment of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy. They also
contribute to the theoretical basis for the planning of further investigations of other
important aspects of different therapeutic strategies, such as the efficacy and safety of
combined treatments and economic studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Serbian Ministry of Science (Grant ON175061).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Daousi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>MacFarlane</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodward</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in an urban
