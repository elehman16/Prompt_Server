But still now failed spinal anesthesia and its further management is a poorly defined and relatively untouched topic in the texts and literature. The word failed implies that spinal anesthesia was attempted, but without resulting in a sensory block or a block that resulted is inadequate for that surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The onset of action differs between various local anesthetic agents. Bupivacaine is one of the extensively studied and well understood of these agents. Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine is considered to have failed if anesthesia and analgesia have not been achieved within 10 min of successful intrathecal deposition of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25 min for isobaric bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] According to current literature, failure rate of spinal anesthesia varies from 16% to &#x0003c;1% but most of the studies reported failure rate between 2% and 4%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>For the last two decades, cesarean section has commonly been done under spinal anesthesia. Complete failure of spinal anesthesia usually managed by either conversion to general anesthesia or by repeating the procedure of spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As all pregnant patients are supposed to have a high risk of aspiration and difficulty in intubation so, conversion to general anesthesia is associated with relatively higher risk than the general population.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>There are few reports and studies about repeat spinal anesthesia after the initial failure of subarachnoid block in cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] But still now no literature clarifies about the dose of local anesthetic to be administered during the repeat spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. Some authors proposed that the dose of local anesthetic was to be reduced while administering repeat spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The aim of our study is to compare the outcome, side effects, and complications of 10 mg and 12 mg doses of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine repeated intrathecally after failed spinal anesthesia in cesarean section.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After taking written informed consent from patients and Ethical Committee approval this prospective, randomized single-blinded study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2014 in our Tertiary Care Institute. One hundred parturients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II, aged between 18 and 40 years, were posted for elective cesarean section in which first spinal anesthesia was failed (i.e., Bromage score 0 and no sensory block even at L<sub>4</sub> dermatome after 10 min of first spinal anesthesia) were included in our study. Patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, heart disease, Bromage scale &#x0003e;0 and absent pinprick sensation below umbilicus after spinal anesthesia, allergy to study drug were excluded from our study. According to our institution protocol detailed preoperative checkup was done in all parturients posted for the elective cesarean section and Ringer's lactate (RL) was started at maintenance rate according to patient's body weight with the 16-gauge cannula. The monitor was attached, and preoperative vitals like heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were measured. After all aseptic and antiseptic precautions, the subarachnoid block was performed at L<sub>3-4</sub> or L<sub>4-5</sub> interspace with 26-gauge Quincke needle in sitting position with 2.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Patients were immediately kept on supine position with a wedge under the right buttock and vitals were monitored. RL infusion rate increased immediately after the drug was deposited in subarachnoid space so that 10 ml/kg fluid was transfused over next 10 min.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Usually, effects of sensory and motor block were noted within 5 min, those who did not manifest effectiveness in 5 min were observed for another 5 min, and then they were tested for motor and sensory block. Motor block was assessed by Bromage scale: (Grade 0 - no motor block, Grade 1 - inability to raise the extended leg, able to move knees and feet, Grade 2 - inability to raise an extended leg and move knees, able to move feet, Grade 3 - complete motor block of lower limb).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] To assess the level of sensory block a blunt pin was taken and placed over the clavicle of the patient and the sensation of pinprick at that region was taken as reference point and then the pin was pricked at the calf muscle, knee joint and back of the thigh (L<sub>4, 3, 2</sub>), just above the groin (L<sub>1</sub>), incision line, at the level of umbilicus (T<sub>10</sub>) on both sides and compared with reference point.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Sensation to cold was also tested in similar fashion on both sides with an ice cube. Surgery was allowed to start on patients who had Grade 3 in Bromage scale and no pinprick or cold sensation at the level of the umbilicus.</p><p>Those ASA I-II patients who had Bromage score 0, pinprick and a cold sensation similar to the reference point at the back of the thigh, knee, and calf muscle (L<sub>2,3,4</sub> dermatome) were considered for inclusion in the present study. After obtaining informed patient consent, the patient was allocated to either Group A or Group B according to a computer generated random number selected by the patient.</p><p>Group A patients received 2.4 ml, and Group B patients received 2 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine respectively. With same precautions subarachnoid block was again performed with 26-gauge Quincke needle in sitting position one space above or below compared to first attempt (one space above in patients where previous spinal was attempted at L<sub>4-5</sub> interspace or one space below in those patients who had previous spinal at L<sub>3-4</sub> interspace) by a senior anesthesiologist who was working more than 3 years in anesthesiology. Patients were made supine immediately with left lateral uterine displacement by wedge under the right buttock, and monitoring started. After confirming the onset of spinal anesthesia by no pinprick and cold temperature sensation at T<sub>10</sub> dermatome on both sides and Bromage score of 3 in lower limbs, the operation was allowed to start. If the patient complained of a pinprick and cold temperature sensation 10 min after repeat spinal was given at T<sub>10</sub> dermatome, then general anesthesia was administered and excluded from our study. However, fortunately, a repeat dose of spinal anesthesia was proved to be successful in all the cases, and no patient had been excluded from our study.</p><p>After the onset of the effect of spinal anesthesia confirmed by sensory and motor block, RL was transfused at 20 ml/kg for first 20 min then at 10 ml/kg/h for rest of the intraoperative period.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Moist O<sub>2</sub> was administered at4 L/min via polymask was administered throughout the intraoperative period.</p><p>Both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were monitored at 2 min interval for initial 20 min then at 3 min interval for rest of the operation. If SBP falls more than 20% of the preoperative value or &#x0003c;100 mmHg then injection phenylephrine 100 mcg intravenous bolus was administered. Continuous HR monitoring was done and injection atropine 0.6 mg was administered if HR &#x0003c;50/min and repeated if HR remained &#x0003c;50/min even after 1 min. SpO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory rate (RR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored throughout the procedure. The level of sensory block was assessed by pinprick. The incidence of complications such as hypotension, bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;60/min), respiratory complications (either RR &#x0003c;10/min or SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;94%), nausea vomiting, shivering, urinary retention, postdural puncture headache, and any neurological symptoms (intra- and post-operative) were all noted. All patients were monitored for 2 h postoperatively with continuous HR, ECG, and SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring and BP was checked at 10 min interval.</p><p>Values were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and percentage (%) for continuous and discreet variables, respectively. Results were analyzed by unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for parametric data and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test for nonparametric data.

To reduce this possibility, we have changed the vertebral interspace while repeating the spinal anesthesia.</p><p>There is a possibility of differential block resulting in autonomic blockade but no sensory or motor impairment due to low concentration of the local anesthetic, thus resulting in excessive high spread of local anesthetic when spinal anesthesia is repeated. To exclude this possibility we have checked that bupivacaine used in the failed spinal belongs to the same batch from which all the spinal anesthesia has been administered on that day, and it was stored in the refrigerator in a cardboard container.</p><p>Sympathetic out flow occurs from T<sub>2</sub> to L<sub>2</sub> segments of spinal cord so; the level of sensory block has been tested up to L<sub>4</sub> in the present study because if there is differential block no sensory impairment at L<sub>4</sub>, it usually signifies no sympathetic block at L<sub>2</sub> level.</p><p>In our study, only ASA I, and II patients have been selected and used bupivacaine as a local anesthetic, thus chance of CSF alkalinity is, and hydrolysis by pseudocholinesterase is minimal.</p><p>About 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine has been used in our study for an initial spinal block because both Riley[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Ginosar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] suggested a dose of 12 mg bupivacaine for cesarean section. As authors suggested a lower dose of local anesthetic while repeating the subarachnoid block due to fear of excessive cephalad spread of block we have compared between 12 and 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine in the present study.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In literature incidence of hypotension in the cesarean section has been described to over 80% depending on the dose which is similar to a present study (82% in Group A and 46% in Group B).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, the incidence of bradycardia occurred in Group A (12%) is much higher than reported incidence of bradycardia (2.5%) during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In a previous study by Pokharel, reported a higher incidence of bradycardia (5.5%), high spinal block (5.5%), and low spinal block (5.5%) compared to Group B of the present study when they repeated spinal anesthesia with 1.8 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine in cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This difference may be due to the difference of case selection in the two studies. In a previous study, they had repeated spinal when the patient complained of pain sensation at the incision line and did not exclude those cases which had sensory block below the line of incision and had some degree of motor block. In another study Abraham and Philip has concluded that giving a second spinal is a safe and reliable method of management of failed spinals. But, they also had repeated the drug in patients with partial motor and sensory block.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In our study SBP, DBP, and HR were significantly low in Group A patients compared to Group B in the first 10 min. The incidence of high spinal, respiratory complications, bradycardia, hypotension, and nausea vomiting are significantly higher in Group A compared to Group B. Respiratory complications which occurred in three patients due to high spinal in Group A was managed by assisted ventilation with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 5&#x02013;10 min, correction of hypotension and assurance. None of the three patients had any loss of consciousness. All the cases of bradycardia which occurred during our study were managed successfully with atropine.</p><p>Recent literature also support the administration of repeat spinal anesthesia if there is no emergency as it avoids the risk of aspiration and difficult airway and preserves patient preference for spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Limitations of our study were, we had not measured sedation score, visual analogic scale score, and plasma catecholamine or stress hormone concentrations which may reveal relations between sympatholytic properties of local anesthetic agents after spinal anesthesia and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia produced by it. Another limitation is that we compared the only two doses of bupivacaine, based on the known optimal doses. However, a study with large sample size needs to be conducted to ascertain optimal dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine which can be used safely and successfully in repeat spinal anesthesia in parturient
