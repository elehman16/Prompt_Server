Taspoglutide is designed to make therapeutic use of the glucoregulatory properties of GLP-1, which enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and reduces food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Taspoglutide contains aminoisobutyric acid substitutions at positions 8 and 35 of the native GLP-1 peptide. These modifications confer a 12-fold increase in stability over GLP-1 when incubated in rat serum and render the compound resistant to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mediated inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Taspoglutide shows high binding affinity to the human GLP-1 receptor and assessment of its relative activity on cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulation in cells expressing the GLP-1 receptor suggests that it is fully active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Taspoglutide improved glucose tolerance, normalized postprandial glucose, improved glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity, and reduced excess body weight in a rat model of Type 2 DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. Its resistance to proteolytic degradation and a zinc-based sustained-release formulation confer an extended half-life and allow for once-weekly subcutaneous administration (s.c.). An early clinical trial showed that a single administration of taspoglutide 8 or 30 mg to patients with Type 2 DM reduced fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels, stimulated insulin secretion and reduced glucagon levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Moreover, reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), fructosamine and body weight were observed in a dose-finding phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. In the latter study, mixed meal tests before and after treatment in a subset of patients revealed that taspoglutide significantly improved pancreatic B-cell function, as measured by improvements in insulin secretion rates and B-cell glucose sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of up-titration to high doses of taspoglutide in patients with Type 2 DM and to determine whether dose titration could be used to administer doses higher than the anticipated therapeutic doses while limiting the expected GI side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial conducted at 27 sites in six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Peru and the USA) between April 2007 and October 2007. The study consisted of a double-blind 8-week treatment period with an additional 4-week follow-up. It was planned to enrol approximately 120 subjects into the study, assigned randomly and equally to each of the treatment groups. This sample size was determined by practical considerations rather than formal calculations. Subjects on stable metformin monotherapy were randomized to receive placebo s.c. once weekly for 8 weeks, or 20 mg taspoglutide s.c. once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of 20 mg once weekly (20/20), or titration up to 30 mg once-weekly (20/30) or 40 mg once-weekly (20/40) taspoglutide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The doses and titration scheme were selected using modelling and simulation. The predicted drug exposure was adequately tolerated in patients with Type 2 DM uncontrolled by metformin in a previous trial where taspoglutide was infused at doses up to 800 &#x003bc;g/day (F. Hoffmann-La Roche; data on file).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dme0027-0556-f1"/></fig><p>A common clinical trial protocol was approved for each site by an institutional review board. All subjects provided written informed consent before participation and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki, including all amendments through the 1996 South Africa revision (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].</p><p>Randomization was implemented via a central system using a stratified randomization procedure based on disease severity (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 8.0% or &#x02265; 8.0%) to avoid imbalances between treatment groups.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was GI tolerability, which was assessed by comparing the number of subjects who withdrew from the study because of GI adverse events (AEs) in the active treatment groups with those in the placebo group. Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight, and pharmacokinetic parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study population comprised men and post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women aged 18&#x02013;75 years with Type 2 DM, treated with a stable daily dose of metformin monotherapy for at least 3 months before screening. The dosage of metformin was not adjusted during the study. Key inclusion criteria at screening were HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 7.0% and 9.5% (inclusive), fasting plasma glucose &#x0003e; 7.0 mmol/l and &#x02264; 13.3 mmol/l, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e; 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and &#x02264; 45.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and weight less than or equal to &#x000b1;10% for at least 3 months before screening.</p><p>Subjects with serious co-morbidities or abnormalities in laboratory tests were excluded from the study, as were those who had previously been treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists (including GLP-1 itself) at any time, or with other glucose-lowering medications (apart from metformin) or weight-loss medications within 12 or 6 weeks, respectively. The use of other glucose-lowering medications, glucose-lowering herbal remedies or weight-loss medications during the study was not permitted (i.e. required withdrawal from blinded study drug). ACE, thiazide diuretics, thyroid hormones and/or lipid-lowering medications were permitted but only with dose(s) stable for at least 6 weeks prior to screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>Eligible subjects who had given prior written informed consent attended clinic visits weekly during the 8-week treatment period, beginning on the day of first treatment (day 0/week 0), and during the 4-week follow-up period. At each visit, vital signs and body weight were monitored, AEs were recorded and fasting blood samples were taken. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 11. Study drug was administered before breakfast during the clinic visits in weeks 0&#x02013;7. Subjects were asked to follow their pre-study diet and exercise plan and metformin regimen throughout the study. Subjects reported to the study site for weekly visits. At each visit the lyophilized peptide was reconstituted at the study site with the diluent (zinc chloride solution). Subjects in the placebo group received 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Study medication was administered by personnel not involved with the preparation of study drug to maintain the blinding and injected s.c. in the abdomen in a different site each time, according to a given scheme.</p><p>AEs were categorized as: (i) &#x02018;mild&#x02019; if transient with discomfort, but no disruption of normal daily activity; (ii) &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; if sufficient discomfort to reduce or affect daily activity; or (iii) &#x02018;severe&#x02019; if the discomfort rendered the subject unable to work or perform normal daily activity. A withdrawal rule for GI AEs was implemented: &#x02018;if severe nausea and/or vomiting requiring therapy persist up to 24 h before the next scheduled administration of the drug, the subject should be withdrawn from the study.&#x02019;</p><p>Standard laboratory assessments (haematology and biochemistry) were conducted weekly. Fasting plasma glucose was measured weekly and HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Population pharmacokinetics were assessed using sparse sampling. Central laboratories (Covance: Sydney, Australia; Singapore; Geneva, Switzerland; Harrogate, UK; Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used to measure all laboratory parameters including drug concentrations of taspoglutide; the latter were measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 7.5 pmol/l.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Safety data were summarized for all subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study drug (the safety population). AEs were categorized according to preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 10.1 (Maintenance and Support Services Organization; Chantilly, VA, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to report the safety results. Data on secondary endpoints were analysed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all subjects who were randomized to the study, received study drug and had a valid baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurement), using the last observation carried forward for dropouts. Data were evaluated using analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) to determine the least squares (LS) means of change from baseline. The <sc>ancova</sc> model included treatment as the fixed effect term and baseline as the covariate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject demographics and disposition</title><p>One hundred and thirty-three subjects were randomized. Four subjects (one from each of the treatment groups) did not receive any study drug; therefore, the safety population consisted of 129 subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The ITT population comprised 125 subjects. The safety population was well balanced across the treatment groups in terms of key demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). During the study, many subjects received common medications for cardiovascular risk factors; most frequently, statins (22%), ACE inhibitors (21%) and fibrates (5%).

The major finding was that titration to higher doses of taspoglutide following 4 weeks of 20 mg once weekly was not associated with a deterioration of GI tolerability.</p><p>As expected from a GLP-1 receptor agonist, early human data documented that transient nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported AEs following administration of taspoglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. However, previous studies have demonstrated for native GLP-1 and for other drugs in this class that gradual dose escalation may help to mitigate the recognized GI side effects through induction of drug tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. In this study, titration to 30 or 40 mg doses of taspoglutide did not result in an increase in the number of subjects reporting GI AEs. The greatest reduction in the number of GI AEs was seen in those subjects who remained on a dose of 20 mg taspoglutide throughout the study. This finding is consistent with studies of other GLP-1 receptor agonists, and with the expectation that the risk of nausea and vomiting decreases with continued drug exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that subjects who titrated to higher doses (30 or 40 mg of taspoglutide) had proportionally higher plasma levels of drug than those remaining on 20 mg once weekly. Significantly, no subjects withdrew from the study because of nausea. The overall low occurrence of withdrawals because of GI AEs, and the timing of these withdrawals, supports the study hypothesis that titration with taspoglutide is feasible well beyond 20 mg.</p><p>While this study was not specifically powered to assess efficacy, taspoglutide 20 mg once weekly led to a statistically significant 1.2% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 8 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, this dose enabled 72% of subjects to attain the current American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes target HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x0003c; 7.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>] from a baseline of 7.8&#x02013;8.0%, with no significant hypoglycaemic episodes. Interpretation of the glycaemic data is limited by the fact that the total treatment period was only 8 weeks, and that, as planned per protocol, the majority of subjects received the highest dose of their assigned regimen for only 4 weeks, an insufficient duration of treatment to assess maximal HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction. Nonetheless, these findings suggest rapid glycaemic efficacy in terms of reduction of both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose.</p><p>It is recognized that treatment with some commonly available diabetes drugs is associated with weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], a distinct disadvantage in a patient population in whom controlling body weight is important to ameliorate the risk of diabetes complications. Despite the short treatment duration of the current study, there was a reduction in body weight in all groups studied, including placebo, with an apparent trend towards greater weight loss in the 20/30- and 20/40-mg groups. This is in line with previous observations of another human GLP-1 analogue that higher doses than necessary for glucose control still further reduce body weight, pointing to a rightward-shift in the dose&#x02013;response relationship for appetite control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>The development of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been an important advance in the field of diabetes medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. These new therapies offer multiple improvements over existing drugs with an emphasis on providing optimal glycaemic control; however, currently approved GLP-1 receptor agonists are administered daily or twice daily. Clearly, there is still a requirement for compounds that are efficacious and safe, but also convenient to administer. Taspoglutide was developed with these optimal attributes in mind.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that taspoglutide, a human once-weekly GLP-1 analogue, provides rapid glycaemic improvement with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Although not yet studied in comparative clinical trials, the GI side-effect profile observed in this study appears to be similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Additionally, this study confirms that dose titration and/or maintenance on the 20-mg dose of taspoglutide was not associated with an increased incidence of GI AEs. Although the short duration of the trial does not allow definitive conclusions, the results support the hypothesis that maximal efficacy is achieved with a 20-mg dose. Indeed up-titration of taspoglutide to 30 or 40 mg, although safe, was devoid of any additional therapeutic effect. Further studies are warranted and have commenced with the 20-mg once-weekly dose of taspoglutide to gain a better understanding of the long-term efficacy and tolerability profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by F.
