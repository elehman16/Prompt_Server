A two-year study was conducted in the greenhouse, under favorable conditions for pollination, to generate information on potential maximum cross-pollination. This maximum cross-pollination rate was 56.1%. A three-year field trial was also conducted to study the cross-pollination rates in terms of distance and orientation to an herbicide-resistant pollen source. Under field conditions, cross-pollination rates varied from 5.5% to 11.6% in plants adjacent to the pollen source and decreased with increasing distances (1.5 to 8.9% at 15 m distance and up to 4.1% at 25 m in the downwind direction). Environmental conditions influenced the cross-pollination both under greenhouse and field conditions. Data were fit to an exponential decay model to predict gene flow at increasing distances. This model predicted an average gene flow of 7.1% when the pollen donor and recipient plants were at 0 m distance from each other. Pollen-mediated gene flow declined by 50% at 16.7 m from the pollen source, yet under downwind conditions gene flow of 5.2% was predicted at 25 m, the farthest distance studied. Knowledge of cross-pollination rates will be useful for assessing the spread of herbicide resistance genes in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> and in developing appropriate strategies for its mitigation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Comisi&#x000f3;n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CICYT)</institution></funding-source><award-id>AGL2004-07101-C02-01/AGR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MAR&#x000cd;A-CRISTINA</surname><given-names>CHUECA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Comisi&#x000f3;n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CICYT) of Spain, project AGL2004-07101-C02-01/AGR.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>A native of the Mediterranean region, <italic>Lolium rigidum</italic> Gaud. (annual or rigid ryegrass) is the most important ryegrass species in Spain where it is commonly found as a major weed in winter cereal crops. It is also widespread across other grain-growing regions in Southern Europe, in Southern and Western Australia, in different states of the USA, and in some areas of South Africa, Chile and Argentina. For years, it has been controlled by pre- or post-emergence herbicides. The excellent efficacy of these herbicides encouraged their widespread repeated use in several countries. This selection process led <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> to become a major problem because of its ability to evolve resistance to the several herbicides used for its control [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> has evolved resistance to 11 herbicide modes of action in 12 countries [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Surveys conducted in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], USA [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Spain [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have revealed widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant <italic>Lolium</italic> species, with biotypes resistant to almost all herbicides available for its control, including biotypes with cross- and multiple-resistances. This situation complicates its management and threatens the productivity and sustainability of current cereal farming systems in these countries. The problem is even greater considering that no major herbicide with a new mode of action has been introduced to the market for more than 20 years [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> is an obligate cross-pollinated species with high genetic variability [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The spread of herbicide resistance may be aided by the pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) among resistant and susceptible plants, which can result in an exchange and progressive accumulation of different herbicide resistance alleles present in populations [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genes can move from plant to plant and among patches at short distances and longer distances to adjacent fields. Even fields with no history of herbicide use can have higher than expected initial frequencies of herbicide resistance genes due to gene flow [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Farmers perceive gene flow, via seed or pollen, to be a major factor in the occurrence of resistance [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In wind-pollinated and highly outcrossed species, as is the case of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic>, gene flow by pollen is of utmost importance. In this species, resistance conferred by dominant nuclear genes will spread rapidly since the resistance alleles are not lost in the heterozygous progeny under herbicide pressure, considerably reducing the number of years necessary to evolve resistance [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, if herbicide is applied at low doses, polygenic broad-spectrum herbicide resistance can evolve by the accumulation of quantitative genes of small effect through cross-pollination among survivors [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite its great importance, the contribution of PMGF to herbicide resistance dispersal is poorly understood and its importance could be underestimated. In recent times, PMGF has received considerable attention in the context of risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops and the possibility of transgene transfer to non-GM varieties and wild relatives [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In general, few PMGF studies have been conducted in wind-pollinated weedy grasses and very little data exist on <italic>Lolium</italic> spp. Maxwell [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], using <italic>L</italic>. <italic>multiflorum</italic> (Italian ryegrass) and diclofop-resistance as marker, found 1% cross-pollination at about 7 m, with resistant seeds collected up to 24 m. About 99% of the expected crosses occurred within 8.6 m from a 1 m<sup>2</sup> pollen source. Giddings [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that pollen flow in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>perenne</italic> (perennial ryegrass) had a leptokurtic distribution and reached up to 80 m distance from the source. For the same species, Cunliffe et al [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that gene flow declined from 20% at 0 m to &#x0003c; 2% at &#x0003e; 36 m. To our knowledge very few studies on PMGF have been conducted in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic>. Only Busi et al [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studied pollen-mediated flow of herbicide resistance genes in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> and found 37.8% of cross-pollination at 0 m from the pollen source using a single susceptible pollen receptor plant (no pollen competition), while this value was three times lower (12.9%) when two receptor plants were used. In this study, 100 m was the next distance in which cross-pollination was measured (0.93%) and cross-pollination was observed up to 3,000 m.</p><p>PMGF can be even important in autogamous species with high levels of self-compatibility as in the case of <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unavarra.es/herbario/htm/Echi_crus.htm">(barnyardgrass</ext-link>), with cross-pollination rates up to 12.5% at 0 m distance [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In other grasses as <italic>Festuca arundinacea</italic> (tall fescue), gene flow rates of 5% were detected at 50 m and less than 1% at 150 m [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while in <italic>Agrostis stolonifera</italic> (creeping bentgrass) effective gene transfer was observed at distances up to 21 km [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In studies conducted with dicotyledonous weeds such as <italic>Kochia scoparia</italic> (kochia, mock-cypress), cross-pollination rates declined from 13% at 1.5 m to 1.4% per plant at 29 m from the resistant plants [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> (Palmer amaranth), up to 50&#x02013;60% of the offspring at 1 and 5 m were resistant to glyphosate, whereas 20&#x02013;40% were resistant up to the 250 and 300 m distances [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For species that lack an effective seed dispersal mechanism, such as <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> (common lambsquarters), average cross-pollination at 2 m was 3%. PMGF plays an important role in the transfer and frequency of resistance alleles within and between populations [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to assess <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> PMGF under a medium-distance scale field experiment conducted under semi-arid conditions.

A single dominant nuclear gene confers ACCase target-site-based resistance in this biotype [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The susceptible (S) population 314, collected in a weed survey conducted in the year 2000 in Castilla-Le&#x000f3;n and characterized as highly susceptible (100% mortality at diclofop-methyl field rate of 540 g a.i. ha<sup>-1</sup>), was used as pollen receptor.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Potential Cross-Pollination in the Greenhouse</title><p>To establish the potential rate of cross-pollination, open pollination crosses between R and S biotypes were performed in 2007 and 2008 in the greenhouse.

Plants were protected from rain but without additional control of light or temperature. The pollen donor was the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> R biotype sown at a density of 500 plants m<sup>-2</sup> in a 9 x 3 x 0.5 m table containing manure, sand, and soil (1:1:1 by volume). Several sets of the S biotype were sown in pots (9 plants per pot) periodically at 15-day intervals at four different times. The plants were watered as required. Two to 3 days before the anthesis of the R biotype, ten pots of the S biotype that overlapped in their flowering with the R pollinator were placed inside the pollen source 1.5 m away from each other and surrounded by R plants for their crossing. At maturity, the seeds produced by all the plants growing in each S pot were harvested, threshed, and stored for 6 months prior to the herbicide screening. Maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, and relative humidity data were collected during the flowering period for all experimental runs when there was a flowering overlap between pollen-donor and -receptor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0157892.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0157892.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157892.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Meteorological data for the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> pollination periods by year and cross-pollination experiment (greenhouse and field experiment).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0157892.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0157892.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Year</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pollination period</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Temperature (&#x000b0;C)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HR (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rainfall mm</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Prevailing wind</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(n&#x000b0;

In the case of cross-pollination under greenhouse conditions, all the seeds produced by each S plant were screened. In the field study, for each S container, 600 seeds per tray and three trays per container were screened, resulting in 5,400 seeds screened for each distance (detection threshold of 0.1% at a probability level of 99%). Seeds were sown in 22 L (40 x 30 x 18 cm) plastic trays filled with the soil mix described earlier. An additional three trays were sown with the S and R biotypes, as controls for herbicide response. The average germination was determined by counting the number of emerged seedlings per tray in relation to the amount of seeds sown. At the 3&#x02013;4 leaf stage, the plants were sprayed with diclofop-methyl (Iloxan EC, 360 g a.i. L<sup>-1</sup>, Bayer Crop Science) at 540 g a.i. ha<sup>-1</sup>, the recommended field rate. Herbicide was applied using a stationary sprayer with one Teejet 8002-E flat fan nozzle delivering 225 L ha<sup>-1</sup> at 200 kPa.

2009, with an average of 5.5% in the plants adjacent to the pollen source (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0157892.t002">Table 2</xref>). These percentages decreased significantly to 2.9% across directions (1.6 to 4.0) at 1 m, and remained about 1.5% (0.1 to 2.3) at 15 m, the maximum distance of that year. In 2010, the PMGF rates were 9.8% (7.1 to 12.8) at 0 m and 6.5% (4.7 to 9.2) at 1 m. At 5 m, the values were similar to those of 2009. The highest values at all distances were obtained in 2011: 11.6% (8.3 to 15.7) at 0 m, 9.5% (4.6 to 13.7) at 1 m, and 8.9% (7.3 to 10.7) at 15 m distance. In 2010 and 2011, additional receptors were placed in the wind direction (C and D) at distances of 20 and 25 m (it was not possible to cover all distances due to space constraints). In side C, 1.8% and 1.2% rates were recorded in 2010 at 20 m and 25 m distance respectively, while these values were higher in 2011 with 5.8%, and 4.6%. At the same distances, 1.6% and 1.4% in 2010 and 8.2%, and 3.5% rates were obtained in side D.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157892.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the curves obtained by fitting an exponential decay model to the cross-pollination rates as a function of distance. Regression analyses were conducted for each year with data pooled across directions from the pollen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The RMSE values for cross-pollination among years ranged from 0.58 to 1.36 and EF values from 0.60 to 0.93 and showed the goodness of fit for the predicted models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157892.g002">Fig 2B</xref> shows the regression curves for the 3-year average, with data pooled across years, and for the worst case scenario with data only from downwind directions in 2011 in which the greatest cross-pollination rates occurred. For the 3-year mean and for the worst case scenario, RMSE values were higher (1.23 and 2.42, respectively) and EF lower (0.61 and 0.50, respectively), which could be due to the higher variations observed. Across years, the predicted gene flow was 7.1% at 0 m distance and declined with increasing distance to 5.7% at 5 m, 3.8% at 15 m and 2.5% at 25 m, the maximum distance of the experiment.

Under open greenhouse conditions, there were great differences between the two years of experiment, with average cross-pollination rates that were three times higher in 2008 than in 2007 (44% vs 14%). These differences could be attributed to environmental conditions. Wilkins and Thorogood [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that high temperatures (34&#x000b0;C) during anthesis increased the degree of selfing in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>perenne</italic> from 2 to 30%, thus decreasing the cross-pollination ability. This may have occurred in our study in 2007, in which mean temperatures were over 30&#x000b0;C for several days. In contrast, during the 2008 crossing period temperatures were lower (monthly average of 13.9&#x000b0;C, with a maximum of 23&#x000b0;C) and RH was higher than in 2007 (70% vs 56%), conditions that allowed a longer pollen viability and therefore higher rates of cross-pollination [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The environmental conditions discussed above also influenced cross-pollination in the field study. The lowest amount of cross pollination occurred in 2009, which was extremely hot and dry. These conditions probably reduced pollen viability and the pollination period, which was the shortest of the 3-year period (16 days). The highest amount of cross pollination occurred in 2011, when temperature and humidity conditions were favourable for cross-pollination. Cross-pollination in adjacent distances to the pollen source varied from 2.3 to 15.7%. As the distance between the receptor plants and the pollen source increased, cross-pollination rates decreased. This was because pollen concentrations rapidly decline at increasing distances [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. At 15 m, PMGF ranged from 0.1 to 10.7%, depending on direction and year. At 25 m downwind, the maximum distance of the trial with empirical data, we recorded cross-pollination of 4.6%. Busi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] under Western Australian conditions and using sulfometuron-resistant and susceptible <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> biotypes, found 12.9% cross-pollination at 0 m and 0.96% at 100 m from the pollen source. At the same distances, and using the model for the 3-year data, a 7.1% cross-pollination was estimated at 0 m. Assuming that predictions beyond the empirical data set require extrapolations whose accuracy may be difficult to determine, a 0.11% cross-pollination rate (1 diclofop-methyl resistant hybrid in 1000 S seeds) would be predicted at 100 m under our conditions. At this long distance, a rate of 0.42% would be predicted in 2011. It is important to consider the relative sizes of donor and receptor populations when considering the risks posed by gene flow. If the recipient population is very small, i.e. one or two <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> plants in the field, the absence of extensive pollen competition will result in higher resistance frequencies. While Busi et al [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] used a pollen source with 1 to 10 R <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> plants m<sup>-2</sup> and a pair of S receptor plants per distance, in our study 100 R plants m<sup>-2</sup> as pollen source and 12 S receptor plants per container and replication were used, which may have resulted in higher pollen competition. The discontinuous experimental design used, with recipient plants in patches, simulates real field conditions with patches of weeds scattered over the field at different distances from a potential source of resistance. Furthermore, weather (temperature, rainfall, air humidity, and wind speed and direction) and topography are major factors that will affect cross-pollination rates.</p><p>The distribution of herbicide resistance alleles can appear at random, suggesting multiple, independent appearances of the mutations or by pollen mediated gene flow from a single individual population or area [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This gene flow increases the initial frequency of herbicide resistance alleles in unselected <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> populations [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The transfer of a single resistance allele might be enough to introduce the character of resistance in a previously susceptible population [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although pollen mediated gene flow rates are dependent on the distance of the receptor plants from the resistant source, these rates are generally higher than the initial frequency of herbicide-resistant individuals in weed populations, which is generally assumed to be about 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], so herbicide resistance transfer by pollen movement could play a major role in the speed at which herbicide resistance evolves in a population. Once resistance has reached a high frequency in a given population, gene flow can propagate it to neighbouring populations promoting the genetic homogeneity of the populations at the landscape level [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157892.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a previously conducted survey of herbicide resistance in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> populations, a significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for herbicide response between populations located within 15 km from a highly resistant ryegrass population, evidencing a resistance hotspot due to the exposure of the populations to similar herbicide regimes in the past and distances close enough for gene flow to occur [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The simulation models on herbicide resistance dynamics in weed populations, reviewed by Renton et al [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], require a lot of plant-specific data. Therefore, it is necessary to generate a detailed data set for each relevant weed species before a management tools for a specific weed species and a particular herbicide can be developed. The experimental design used in this study was not large enough, due to space constraints, to allow observations of cross-pollination at long distances. However, it provides valuable information for assessing the spread of herbicide resistance genes via pollen at medium distances in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic>. We fully agree with Busi et al [<xref rid="pone.0157892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in that simulation models give no or little attention to the pollen-mediated gene flow of resistance genes related to distance and its subsequent dispersion, so its real importance could be underestimated. It is important to stress the lack of data on PMGF in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic> and that the results of limited experimental data from one area may not represent the prevailing situation in another location and climate. Therefore, it will be necessary to extend these experiments on a reduced scale with more studies with larger pollen sources and longer distances. PMGF may not only play a role in gene movement between fields to accelerate resistance evolution, but it could also favor the development of multiple-resistant populations through the stacking of different resistance genes (occurring faster than resistance to two herbicides evolving sequentially), which will make it even more difficult to control resistant populations.</p><p>Herbicide susceptibility in one field will be threatened by the presence of an herbicide resistant trait in the neighboring fields. In the context of the management and mitigation of herbicide resistance, it will be important to eliminate resistant ryegrass before flowering, rather than before seed production, and to introduce integrated weed management practices with cultural, mechanical, and alternative chemical methods to reduce the potential for development of additional resistance problems. Even so, it will not be an easy task in wind-pollinated weeds, like <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rigidum</italic>, in which resistance traits can persist in individuals growing in the field margins, which can survive a multi-year herbicide mode of action rotation and re-introduce the resistance trait into the field. Other options must be studied, such as the limitation of the pollen flow by using barrier crops or zones and spatial planning of land use taking into account the dominant winds. The spatial scales are very important for resistance management, which should consider more than just the single herbicide-resistant population. Therefore, collaborative efforts of many farmers will be necessary in order to minimize occurrence of herbicide resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157892.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Pollen mediated gene flow in <italic>Lolium rigidum</italic> dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157892.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Comisi&#x000f3;n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CICYT) of Spain, project AGL2004-07101-C02-01/AGR.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0157892.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Powles</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name>. <article-title>Evolution in action: Plants resistant to herbicides</article-title>. <source>Ann.
