The reduced percent cuff leak (PCL) can predict the occurrence of laryngotracheal edema in high-risk patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Laryngeal edema is more common after endotracheal intubation for more than 36 h. Other factors which are correlated with these complications include older age, female gender, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and excessive endotracheal tube (ETT) size.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Any intervention that increases the chances of successful extubation is therefore of great interest. Previous studies reported conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic steroid therapy on laryngeal edema, and steroid after extubation. Almost in all of these studies, patients received corticosteroid prior to extubation. However, the timing and methods of administration were different.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Aerosolized budesonide, when used in the treatment of croup, was found to reduce edema without any side effects. Budesonide is a steroid used for the treatment of asthma and non-infectious rhinitis (including hay fever and other allergies), and for the treatment and prevention of nasal polyposis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of administration of nebulized budesonide after extubation. The specific objectives of our study were to determine whether multiple doses of nebulized budesonide are effective in reducing or preventing postextubation edema.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and taking written informed consent from patients or their relatives prior to entrance in this trial, 70 adult (18-65 years) intubated ICU patients between 1 April 2010 and 1 November 2011, who met the inclusion criteria, were included in this randomized, double-blind, prospective study.</p><p>Patients who were intubated for more than 48 h after surgery, and met the weaning criteria defined as respiratory rate (RR) &#x0003c;30 breaths/min, negative tidal volume &#x0003e;5 ml/kg ideal body weight, and shallow index (RR/tidal volume) &#x0003c;105 breaths/min/l were included.</p><p>The exclusion criteria included any history of corticosteroid therapy in the previous week, nasal or throat disease/surgery, pulmonary airway disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Cuff leak test</title><p>One of the ways to do cuff leak test to anticipate postextubation stridor is to measure the PCL. To measure it, we recorded the difference in exhaled tidal volume before and after the endotracheal tube's cuff deflation. Divide this number by the exhaled tidal volume before cuff deflation. This gives the PCL. Patients with a cuff leak of less than 10% are at risk for shorter or reintubation. Patients who met the weaning criteria were therefore included in this trial. Following extubation, all patients received humidified oxygen by nasal prongs or facemask with an oxygen flow of 6 l/min. Patients also randomly received either nebulized budesonide (1 mg/4ml every 12 h for 48 h) [(Group I (B); <italic>n</italic> = 35] or normal saline at an equivalent volume (placebo) (4 ml every 12 h for 48 h) [Group II (S); <italic>n</italic> = 35] via nebulizer face mask with an oxygen flow of 6 l/min in 20 min.</p><p>A physician who was not involved in the patient care prepared the study drug and the identical-looking placebo, and the other physician administered the treatment (i.e., budesonide or placebo). Both physicians were blinded.</p><p>RR, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded for each patient immediately before aerosol administration (time 0), at 30 and 60 min, and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The presence of respiratory distress stridor (heard with the aid of stethoscope), the need to reintubation, and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were recorded within 48 h of extubation. SOFA score is used to evaluate patient's status during ICU admission [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The SOFA score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-182-g001"/></table-wrap><p>To calculate PCL before extubation, patients were mechanically ventilated in the volume-assisted control mode with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg of ideal body weight, an RR of 12 breaths/minute, and a zero positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Postoperative complications such as sore throat and hoarseness are the common complaints in patients receiving tracheal intubation. Although not major complications and usually self-limiting, they affect the satisfaction of patients to a significant extent. Steroids, known for their anti-inflammatory function, are widely used in clinic. The inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), in particular, are widely used for patients at risk of airway diseases, as they can be directly delivered to the airways without introducing a systemic exposure. Previous studies have shown that ICSs are capable of decreasing the incidence and severity of postoperative complications such as sore throat, cough, and hoarseness caused by tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Endotracheal intubation is a useful approach to manage critically ill patients who may or may not require mechanical ventilation; however, this intervention may induce laryngeal mucosa trauma as a result of mucosa abrasion and necrosis secondary to compression, which leads to postextubation stridor. Histological findings of postextubation stridor are characterized by mucosal inflammation, mucosal ulceration, and edema. Corticosteroids have been used in infants and children to prevent or reduce postextubation stridor by suppressing mucosal inflammation, inhibition of leukocyte migration, maintenance of cell membrane integrity, attenuation of lysosome release, and reduction of fibroblast proliferation and tissue swelling.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There are few data in adult patients, compared with pediatric patients, with respect to the use of corticosteroids.</p><p>In our study, there was no significant difference between the two groups in demographic characteristics. Thus, the above groups are comparable and probably there is not any confounding effect between the two groups. Also, according to results of this study, no statistically significant difference was found between two groups in RR, HR, BP, SPO<sub>2</sub>, pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3.</sub> As the results, nebulized budesonide had no harmful effects on hemodynamic of patients. Also, respiratory distress and reintubation rate in the intervention group were lower than in the placebo group (8.6% vs. 31.4%). In addition, reintubation with mechanical support was necessary in 8.6% of patients in the budesonide group, but in 31.4% of patients in the placebo group. Some other studies showed that the use of nebulized budesonide can lead to decrease in postextubation complications. A study done by Chao-Hsienlee <italic>et al</italic>. showed that prevalence of Chao-Hsienlee stridor was 6%-37%,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but in our study, the prevalence of stridor was 8.6% in patients with nebulized budesonide. According to Sinha <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, use of nebulized L-epinephrine (1000 &#x003bc;g) can decrease postextubation complications.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is believed that the postoperative symptoms are the result of mucosal injury-induced inflammation. Under normal circumstances, the inflammation of mucosa (mucositis) is considered as an immune response to airway instrumentation (i.e., laryngoscopy and suctioning) or irritating foreign objects (i.e., endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or oral airway). In the studies performed by Bellissant and Malhotra, use of corticosteroids was found to decrease the airway complications.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] After the potential role of inflammation in the postoperative squeal of airways had been recognized, the use of inhaled and topical corticosteroids was described. It is well known that ICSs&#x02019; inhalation is a direct method of treating airway diseases [i.e., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute pharyngitis] due to their high efficacy in controlling and preventing symptoms with reduced systemic side effects, compared to the therapy with other corticosteroids. The risk-benefit ratio of ICSs is determined by multiple factors. Beneficial properties include low oral bioavailability, high systemic clearance, and sufficient receptor-binding affinity. Since ICSs&#x02019; inhalation possesses these beneficial properties, it has been considered a more secure treatment. In conclusion, our study indicated that administration of nebulized budesonide before tracheal extubation could significantly prevent and reduce the occurrence of throat complaints in ICU patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The authors wish to sincerely thank the support of all the colleagues in intensive care unit staff of Alzahra University Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Isfahan, Iran.
