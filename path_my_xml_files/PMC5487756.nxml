Replacement therapy with immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from human plasma has been the standard of care since the early 1950s. By the 1960s, IgG products were administered intramuscularly, but efficacy was limited by the relatively small quantities that could be administered by that route due to discomfort and painful local side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the 1980s, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) became available in the USA and became the most common treatment for PID patients with impaired humoral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, IVIG is available at concentrations of 3%, 5%, 6%, 9%, 10%, and 12%, with more products available at 10% than at any other concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Gammaplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 5% is a highly purified human IgG liquid product intended for intravenous (IV) administration (Bio Products Laboratory Ltd., Elstree, UK) and approved for use in the USA and the UK for PID and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; Gammaplex 5% is also licensed in Brazil, Brunei, Israel, Lebanon, and Malta. Previous studies of Gammaplex 5% demonstrated efficacy in preventing serious acute bacterial infections (SABIs) and demonstrated tolerability both in patients with PID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and those with ITP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Like Gammaplex 5% (Gammaplex [5%] 5&#x000a0;g in 100&#x000a0;mL), Gammaplex 10% (Gammaplex [10%] 10&#x000a0;g in 100&#x000a0;mL) is a ready-prepared solution for IV administration containing the active ingredient human normal IgG. Both products are manufactured using the same process, but Gammaplex 10% is more concentrated, with an IgG concentration of 100&#x000a0;g/L, and is stabilized with glycine, whereas Gammaplex 5% is stabilized with sorbitol. This study evaluated the bioequivalence of the currently licensed formulation (Gammaplex 5%) and the new formulation (Gammaplex 10%), as well as pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of Gammaplex 10%, in adult and pediatric subjects with PID. This article is the first report of a clinical study of Gammaplex 10% and of the first direct comparison between a 5% and a 10% IVIG product in PID patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par7">This bridging study was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover bioequivalence trial to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of Gammaplex 10% in PID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT01963143; EudraCT, 2013-002290-21) versus the PK, safety, and tolerability of Gammaplex 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Approximately 1 to 3&#x000a0;days before the first planned infusion (visit 1), eligible adult subjects were randomized (1:1) to the following treatment sequences and stratified by dosing regimen (21 or 28&#x000a0;days): either five infusions of Gammaplex 5% followed by five infusions of Gammaplex 10% (sequence 1), or five infusions of Gammaplex 10% followed by five infusions of Gammaplex 5% (sequence 2). Pediatric subjects received five infusions of Gammaplex 10% only. The enrollment of the pediatric cohort was delayed until acceptable safety and tolerability had been demonstrated in &#x02265;5 adult subjects. Samples for PK profiling were collected at specified times for the final infusion of each treatment (visits 5 and 10 for adult subjects; visit 5 for pediatric subjects).</p><p id="Par8">Gammaplex 5% and Gammaplex 10% were dosed at 300&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/kg per infusion every 21 or 28&#x000a0;days. The selected dose was the same as the dose of IVIG administered during the 3&#x000a0;months prior to study entry. Subjects were to be adequately hydrated prior to infusion, but a pre-infusion hydration step was not required for either product. To provide an initial equivalent protein dose, the initial infusion rates were 0.01 and 0.005&#x000a0;mL/kg/min for Gammaplex 5% and Gammaplex 10%, respectively, for the first 15&#x000a0;min. Subjects who tolerated the first infusion with minimal adverse reactions could begin subsequent infusions at 0.02&#x000a0;mL/kg/min (Gammaplex 5%) and 0.01&#x000a0;mL/kg/min (Gammaplex 10%) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For each infusion, the rate was increased incrementally at 15-min intervals, reaching a maximum infusion rate for both Gammaplex 5% and Gammaplex 10% of 0.08&#x000a0;mL/kg/min, depending on the subjects&#x02019; ability to tolerate slower infusions. Additional infusions were permitted to ensure that subjects received five infusions of Gammaplex 10% or Gammaplex 5% at the same dose and were on stable treatment prior to the PK sampling. Infusion visits were scheduled every 21 or 28&#x000a0;days, depending on the subject&#x02019;s cycle of infusions during prior IVIG treatment. Individual infusions could be administered &#x000b1;3&#x000a0;days of the planned schedule. Subjects returned to the clinic 6 to 7&#x000a0;days after the first infusion of either treatment to assess safety (after visit 1 for pediatric subjects; after visits 1 and 6 for adult subjects). Subjects returned for an end-of-study visit 28&#x000a0;days after the final study infusion. The total study duration (screening to end-of-study visit) was 38&#x02013;48&#x000a0;weeks for any given adult subject and 23&#x02013;28&#x000a0;weeks for any given pediatric subject, depending on the subject&#x02019;s frequency of infusion.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Infusion rates for Gammaplex 10% and Gammaplex 5%</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="2">Infusion rate</th><th>Elapsed time</th></tr><tr><th>(mL/kg/min)</th><th>(mg/kg/h)</th><th>(min)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">Gammaplex 5%</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Starting infusion</td><td>0.01<sup>a</sup>

The reduction in trough levels of IgG subclass 4 observed across all treatments and age groups was expected, since IgG<sub>4</sub> is reduced in proportion to other IgG subclasses during the Gammaplex manufacturing process. The role of IgG<sub>4</sub> has not been fully elucidated, and the reductions in levels seen during this study were not clinically significant. In one pediatric subject, consistently low trough IgG levels were observed despite a dose increase; the cause of this was unclear but may have been related to a change in metabolism of IVIG prior to initiating Gammaplex 10% treatment. Since terminating this study, this subject has continued to exhibit inconsistent but increasing IgG catabolism despite product changes and a dosing increase (Bio Products Laboratory, data on file). Among the adult subjects, the mean infusion duration was 34% shorter for Gammaplex 10% than for Gammaplex 5%. Infusion durations were not reduced by half, as might be expected with equivalent doses administered via a 10% versus a 5% product, because the starting infusion rate per study protocol for Gammaplex 10% was half that of Gammaplex 5% (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), to allow for an equivalent initial protein dose.</p><p id="Par33">To minimize infusion-related side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], previous studies of IVIG products have increased infusion rates incrementally at intervals of 30 or 60&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
