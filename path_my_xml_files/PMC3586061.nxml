Predefined asthma events and withdrawals due to predefined events were assessed as secondary study endpoints. Study I (NCT00651651) includes data from predominantly White patients with mild to moderate asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 160/9 &#x003bc;g twice daily (bid; n = 123) or BUDpMDI 160 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 121). Study II (NCT00652002) includes data from predominantly White patients withmoderate to severe asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 124) or BUD pMDI 320 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 109). Study III (NCT00702325) included self-reported Black patients with moderate to severe asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 153) or BUD dry powder inhaler 360 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 148). Study IV (NCT00419757) included self-reported Hispanic patients with moderate to severe asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 127) or BUD pMDI 320 &#x003bc;g bid (n = 123). Patients were to be withdrawn from the studies if they developed an asthma event, as determined by predefined criteria, except for night-time awakenings, where withdrawal was left to the study physician&#x02019;s judgment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, fewer patients in the studies (study I, II, III, and IV, respectively) experienced &#x02267;1 asthma event in the BUD/FM group (18.7%, 29.8%, 37.3%, 25.2%) versus the BUD group (21.5%, 44.0%, 45.3%, 31.7%); only study II results showed a statistically significant difference between treatments. Fewer patients with moderate to severe asthma (studies II, III, and IV) were withdrawn due to &#x02267;1 asthma event in the BUD/FM group (10.5%, 11.8%, 3.1%, respectively) than in the BUD group (20.2%, 18.9%, 6.5%, respectively); however, percentages were similar in the BUD/FM (7.3%) and BUD (6.6%) groups in patients with mild to moderate asthma (study I).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Predefined asthma event rates were numerically or significantly lower for patients with asthma receiving BUD/FMpMDI versusBUD, regardless of race or disease severity. Differences between the BUD/FM pMDI and BUD groupswere smaller in patients with mild to moderate asthma than in those with moderate to severe asthma, most likely because patients with milder disease had lower asthma event rates. Overall, these findings support the efficacy of BUD/FM pMDI in achieving asthma control in patients with moderate to severe asthma.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma disproportionately affects racial and ethnic populations.

An asthma event metric encompassing measures of pulmonary function, symptoms, rescue medication use, and the need for additional medications was investigated in the present analysis. While individual studies were not powered for statistical analyses, predefined asthma event rates in four 12-week, randomized studies consistently showed numerical or significant differences favoring BUD/FM pMDI over BUD across White, Black, and Hispanic patients, regardless of disease severity. Notably, the results of this analysis showing similar predefined asthma event rates among patients of differing racial backgrounds is consistent with the primary analyses showing the efficacy of BUD/FM pMDI in Blacks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Hispanics,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as a study demonstrating the efficacy of ICS/LABA in Blacks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Additional discussion of findings and limitations of the individual studies have been previously discussed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Differences between the BUD/FM pMDI and BUD groups were smaller in patients with mild to moderate asthma than in patients with moderate to severe asthma, most likely because patients with milder disease had overall lower asthma event rates. These data further support the efficacy of BUD/FM pMDI in achieving asthma control in patients with moderate to severe asthma, regardless of race.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE, USA.
