Currently, there is no widely accepted treatment for the disorder, but it is usually treated with bleaching agents because it is considered a variant of inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of niacinamide 4% and desonide 0.05% emulsions compared with placebo in the treatment of axillary hyperpigmentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-four women aged 19&#x02013;27 years with hyperpigmented axillae (phototype III&#x02013;V) were randomly assigned to receive the study treatments in the axillary region. Improvement was assessed at baseline, then clinically and by colorimetry 9 weeks later. Quantitative evaluation including melanin, inflammatory infiltrates, NKI/Beteb, CD1a, CD68, and collagen type IV content was performed by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, assisted by computerized morphometric analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both niacinamide and desonide induced significant colorimetric improvement compared with placebo; however, desonide showed a better depigmenting effect than niacinamide. A good to excellent response was achieved in 24% of cases for niacinamide, 30% for desonide, and 6% for placebo. We observed a marked disruption of the basal membrane in axillary hyperpigmentation and an inflammatory infiltrate that improved after treatment. Decreased pigmentation in the desonide-treated axillae was associated with recovery of disruption at the basal membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Niacinamide and desonide showed depigmenting properties in women with axillary hyperpigmentation. These findings may be explained by their antimelanogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, respectively.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation</kwd><kwd>niacinamide</kwd><kwd>desonide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is one of the most common dermatological complaints in patients with colored skin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ccid-6-029">1</xref> It results from an increase in melanin production or an abnormal distribution of this pigment in the epidermis and/or dermis after external injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ccid-6-029">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ccid-6-029">3</xref> Various inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and reactive oxygen species, are known to induce activation of melanocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ccid-6-029">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ccid-6-029">5</xref> Destruction of the basal cell layer with incontinentia pigmenti and melanophages in the dermis has also been described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ccid-6-029">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ccid-6-029">7</xref></p><p>Axillary hyperpigmentation is a frequent dermatological problem in Latin-American females, although its exact frequency is unknown.

Informed consent was obtained from subjects before entering the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee. This study is registered on the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trial Register (NCT01542138).</p><p>Patients having axillary hyperpigmentation and attending our outpatient clinic were invited to participate. The luminance (L*) value was measured by colorimetry to obtain an objective parameter of the brightness of axillary pigmentation, and those patients with differences between the adjacent skin and axillary area &#x0003e; 2.0 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age 18&#x02013;40 years, good health, and no topical, systemic, laser, or surgical treatment in the axillary area during the previous 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, nursing, menopause, overweight, obesity, acanthosis nigricans, and presence of any systemic or pigmentation disorder. A medical history was obtained from each patient regarding age, occupation, time of onset, hair removal methods, deodorant/antiperspirant use, physical activity, and cleansing habits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study interventions</title><p>The topical study medications were put into similar containers, and the patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive niacinamide 4%, desonide 0.05% (Galderma, Courbevoie, France), or placebo cream on their axillae. Niacinamide cream was formulated by combining niacinamide powder (Spectrum, Gardena, CA) with Cetaphil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> moisturizing cream (Galderma, Ontario, Canada) to yield a 4% concentration, while a Cetaphil cream without niacinamide was used as the placebo. A stability screen using high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that more than 90% of the active ingredient remained in the moisturizer 3 months after preparation. All subjects were instructed to apply a certain amount of the topical medication to a specified area at night (ie, 1 mg/cm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ccid-6-029">2</xref>). Concomitant use of an antiperspirant product containing aluminum chlorohydrate 8% was allowed every morning, and usual hygiene measures were continued throughout the study period (ie, soaps, cleanser items). All adverse events were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Colorimetric and clinical evaluation</title><p>The treatments were administered for 9 weeks, with a baseline evaluation and follow-up at 3, 6, and 9 weeks. The primary outcome measure was reduction in axillary hyperpigmentation. Pigmentary changes were assessed objectively using a tristimulus colorimeter (Chromameter CR-300, Minolta, Osaka, Japan). Changes in coloration were examined by L* (luminosity), where 100 is full white and 0 is total black. Erythema was evaluated using the a* axis which has values from 0 to 50. Measurements were obtained after careful shaving of the axilla, which was done on the day prior to assessment. The axilla was divided into quadrants and the average of four measurements was used for analysis. Improvement was assessed by obtaining the L* axis difference (L*&#x00394;) between the targeted axilla and a nonpigmented area (L*&#x00394; = axilla &#x02013; periaxilla). The selected periaxillary control site was the area located at the intersection of the mid axillary line and the fifth intercostal space. The a* axis was assessed in a similar manner. Clinical improvement was assessed by standardized digital photographic registration. Two independent observers performed a Physician Global Assessment, scored as poor (0%&#x02013;25%), mild (26%&#x02013;50%), good (51%&#x02013;75%), or excellent (&#x0003e;75%).</p></sec><sec><title>Histological samples</title><p>Secondary outcome measures included histological evaluation of skin trauma (ie, epidermal basal membrane integrity and microhemorrhage), inflammatory cells, melanin content, and epidermal thickness. For these evaluations, we obtained a 3 mm punch biopsy at baseline and at the end of the study for each axilla. All samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine general features, with Fontana-Masson staining for evaluation of melanin content and Perl&#x02019;s iron staining for hemosiderin deposits.</p><p>To evaluate the contents of Langerhans cells, melanophages, and mature melanocytes, we used antibodies to CD1a, CD68, and NKI/Beteb, respectively. The integrity of the epidermal basal membrane was assessed using a collagen IV antibody. Sections 4 &#x003bc;m in thickness were taken from frozen tissue fixed in acetone and then processed with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a, CD68 (SC-70761), NKI/ Beteb (SC-52704), and collagen IV (SC-59814, all sourced from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Working dilutions were obtained using trials with positive controls. The skin sections were incubated with serum blocker, and the primary antibodies per hour were then added washing with an HCl buffer at pH 7.6 for 20 minutes. After further washing with the same buffer, the sections were incubated for 30 minutes with a biotinylated secondary antibody and subsequently treated with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were developed with 3-amino-ethyl-carbazole for 3 minutes, washed in water, and counterstained with Mayer&#x02019;s hematoxylin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Image analysis</title><p>To get a scanning view of the epidermis and dermis, every tissue section was captured with 10&#x000d7; and 40&#x000d7; magnification using a digital camera mounted on a microscope (CX31, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a computer. Once captured the images were processed using Image J v 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The inflammatory infiltrate was quantified by two independent blinded observers aided by the cell counter function. The number of cells per mm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ccid-6-029">2</xref> was estimated for the entire specimen. The same procedure was used to count cells expressing NKI/Beteb, CD1a, and CD68.

Therefore, 28 subjects with symmetric axillary hyperpigmentation were needed to ensure 56 evaluable hyperpigmented axillae, allowing a dropout rate of 15%. Permuted block randomization was used to assess the effects of treatment on lesions.

Shaving of the armpit area was the most common hair removal method, and used in 86%. Daily cleansing of the area and use of an antiperspirant containing aluminum chlorohydrate was reported by all patients.

Previous studies have shown that niacinamide limits the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ccid-6-029">21</xref> reduces inflammatory cytokine levels, and decreases expression of major histological complex class II and adhesion molecules on immune cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ccid-6-029">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ccid-6-029">29</xref> Other anti-inflammatory properties may be related to free radical scavenging, and suppression of NAD-dependent enzymes and inducible nitric oxide synthase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ccid-6-029">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ccid-6-029">29</xref></p><p>On the other hand, desonide is a low potency corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties comparable with those of nonfluorinated corticosteroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ccid-6-029">26</xref> Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for dermatitis and reducing inflammation, pruritus, pigmentation, and vasodilatation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ccid-6-029">30</xref> Desonide showed a similar pattern to that of niacinamide, reducing mononuclear and phagocytic cells as well as epidermal melanin levels. The hypopigmentation achieved by desonide could be theoretically related to its anti-inflammatory properties, although it has been shown that corticosteroids, by some unknown mechanism, interfere with synthesis of melanin in smaller melanocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ccid-6-029">30</xref></p><p>Interestingly, in addition to the associated inflammatory cell infiltrates, we found a physical discontinuity of the epidermal basal membrane which, importantly, improved after exposure to both drugs, and was more evident in the desonide group. This disruption of the basal membrane could be primarily or indirectly conditioned by mechanical aggression of the axillary area. We suggest that desonide could reduce the inflammatory response that enhances disruption of the basal membrane, or even block mechanisms that delay its recovery. We did not find any changes in melanocyte count initially or after any of the interventions, so melanogenesis probably depends on increased synthesis of melanin and not on a change in numbers of pigmented cells. All these findings suggest a relationship between trauma, local inflammation, and induction of melanogenesis in axillary hyperpigmentation.</p><p>Side effects, including local erythema, burning, pruritus, infection, and skin atrophy, were absent during the trial. Drawbacks to the long-term use of topical corticosteroids include atrophic skin changes, immunosuppression, steroid acne, and tachyphylaxis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ccid-6-029">30</xref> However, we did not observe any of these during the 9 weeks of administration of desonide, despite the well-known vasoconstrictor effect observed by colorimetry during the trial. These findings suggest that both drugs have a safe profile for use in the axillae.</p><p>Although the frequency of axillary hyperpigmentation is unknown, it is a common complaint among females of dark complexion from tropical areas throughout the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ccid-6-029">8</xref> Axillary hyperpigmentation has not been extensively studied due to its predominantly cosmetic nature and lack of any relevant health implications. Based on the results of our study, we suggest that niacinamide and desonide have some value in the treatment of axillary hyperpigmentation. We assume that associated antiperspirant use during the trial was a negligible factor, considering that all the involved axillae administration were exposed under similar conditions to commercial concentrations of aluminum chlorohydrate, and we observed a clinically and histologically noticeable benefit of the interventions compared with placebo. However, limitations of our trial include its single-center nature, inclusion of a relatively small number of patients, comprising only young women.</p><p>Previous publications have suggested that post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is improved by use of anti-inflammatory and depigmenting agents,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ccid-6-029">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ccid-6-029">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ccid-6-029">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ccid-6-029">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ccid-6-029">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ccid-6-029">31</xref> but few have objectively evaluated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at the histological level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ccid-6-029">14</xref> Our results indicate that both drugs are capable of reducing mononuclear and phagocytic cell infiltrates and repairing the fragmented epidermal basal membrane, thus reducing melanin expression. Further investigation is necessary to expand these findings concerning an impaired basal membrane, the inflammation process surrounding it, and enhancement of melanin synthesis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conficts of interest in this
