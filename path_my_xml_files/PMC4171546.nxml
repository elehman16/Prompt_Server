Few medical remedies effectively influence the course of the disease. Finding effective treatments to maintain function and quality of life in patients with knee OA is one of the national priorities identified by the Institute of Medicine. We are currently conducting the first comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomized trial of Tai Chi versus a physical-therapy regimen in a sample of patients with symptomatic and radiographically confirmed knee OA. This article describes the design and conduct of this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A single-center, 52-week, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi versus a standardized physical-therapy regimen is being conducted at an urban tertiary medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. The study population consists of adults&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;years of age with symptomatic and radiographic knee OA (American College of Rheumatology criteria). Participants are randomly allocated to either 12&#x000a0;weeks of Tai Chi (2x/week) or Physical Therapy (2x/week for 6&#x000a0;weeks, followed by 6&#x000a0;weeks of rigorously monitored home exercise). The primary outcome measure is pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities WOMAC) subscale at 12&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stkiffness and function domain scores, lower extremity strength and power, functional balance, physical performance tests, psychological and psychosocial functioning, durability effects, health related quality of life, and healthcare utilization at 12, 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first randomized comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of Tai Chi versus Physical Therapy in a large symptomatic knee OA population with long-term follow up. We present here a robust and well-designed randomized comparative-effectiveness trial that also explores multiple outcomes to elucidate the potential mechanisms of mind-body effect for a major disabling disease with substantial health burdens and economic costs. Results of this study are expected to have important public health implications for the large and growing population with knee OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

An estimated 27 million people in the United States (US) have OA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and nearly half of all Americans are projected to develop knee OA during their lifetime
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Based on the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, associated insurer and out of pocket healthcare costs account for more than $185 billion per year with another $10 billion lost from absenteeism at work
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Currently available medical treatments have limited influence on the trajectory of the disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen often fail to relieve symptoms and may lead to serious adverse effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Physical therapy, a prominent component of knee OA guidelines, includes aerobics and muscle strengthening exercises. Although clinical trials involving Physical Therapy have been performed with heterogeneity in frequency, intensity, and duration of treatment, current evidence suggests that Physical Therapy produces only moderate benefits for pain and physical functioning with limited durability of effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, identifying new and effective treatments, particularly non-pharmacologic treatments, to further improve and maintain function and quality of life in people with knee OA remains a national priority, as evidenced by its placement on the Institute of Medicine&#x02019;s list of 100 national priorities for comparative effectiveness research.</p><p>Our previous work indicates that Tai Chi, a form of mind-body exercise that combines deep diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation with slow, gentle, graceful movements, can improve both physical and psychological health among patients with chronic conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Significant improvements have been reported in balance, strength, cardiovascular and respiratory functioning, flexibility, pain, depression, anxiety and arthritic symptoms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In our preliminary randomized trial, participants with knee OA who completed Tai Chi exhibited greater improvements in pain, physical function, depression, self-efficacy, and health status compared with an attention control group at 12&#x000a0;weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes also showed durable benefits at 24 and 48&#x000a0;weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, our recent meta-analysis of six Tai Chi studies including 382 participants demonstrated large and significant pain reductions [Effect Size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72 (95% CI 0.97, 0.47)] after 8 to 12&#x000a0;weeks of Tai Chi training compared with a variety of controls with a heterogeneity score (I<sup>2</sup>) of 0%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>These previous trials demonstrate that our adaptation of Tai Chi has the potential to become a unique, logistically feasible way of providing standardized exercises with a complementary mind-body approach for the management of knee OA. The physical component provides exercise that is consistent with recommendations for knee OA (flexibility, muscle conditioning, balance, and aerobic cardiovascular exercise)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], while the mind component has the potential to increase psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and perceptions of health
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we are currently conducting the first comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial in a large symptomatic knee OA population. We hypothesize that Tai Chi will outperform Physical Therapy as typically practiced in a clinical setting. We aim to demonstrate that, compared with Physical Therapy, Tai Chi may be an effective and cost-effective therapy for managing pain and reducing the functional limitations that impact the quality of life for millions of individuals with knee OA.</p><p>In this paper we present the design and detailed protocol of the first comparative effectiveness and economic analysis of a randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi versus a Physical Therapy regimen in adults with knee OA. It is expected that the study will fill important knowledge gaps and generate critical insights to inform clinical decision making for knee OA. The results from this trial will be reported at the completion of the study in accordance with the Consolidation of Standards for Reporting Trials guideline

Over four years, 180 older adults with symptomatic knee OA are randomly assigned to Tai Chi (2x/week for 12&#x000a0;weeks) or a physical-therapy regimen in a clinical setting (2x/week for 6&#x000a0;weeks followed by 6&#x000a0;weeks of home exercise).</p><p>The primary outcome is pain measured by the well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) pain subscale at 12&#x000a0;weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function domain scores, lower extremity strength and power, physical performance tests, psychosocial functioning (mental health, self-efficacy, stress, depression, mindfulness, social support), durability of effect after treatment ends, healthcare utilization, outcome expectation, adherence, and occurrence of adverse events. Covariates include age, gender, body mass index, and comorbidities. We are also examining the economic impact of Tai Chi versus a Physical Therapy regimen based on healthcare utilization data for the treatment of knee OA. Outcome measurements are collected at baseline, every week during the intervention period (WOMAC), upon completion of the 12-week program, and at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. The staff conducting the physical function assessments and the statistician are blinded to treatment assignment.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and who have radiographic evidence of tibiofemoral or patellofemoral OA (defined as the presence of a definite osteophyte in the tibiofemoral compartment and/or the patellofemoral compartment, as assessed on standing anterior/posterior and lateral or sunrise views) are invited to participate
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The study rheumatologist (WH), who conducts the clinical examinations, confirms the presence of knee pain or discomfort and that the individual would be physically able to participate in Tai Chi and Physical Therapy programs.

These strategies include flyers within the hospital and advertisements in the print and online media. To ensure adequate enrollment of a diverse study population, including underrepresented groups, advertisements are placed in a wide range of media outlets including: myHospitalWebsite, Craigslist, Facebook, Tufts Medical Center website, SAMPAN (a Chinese newspaper), the Boston Metro and Boston Fifty Plus newspapers and a booth at a senior expo. Participants are also recruited from the rheumatology clinic patient database at Tufts Medical Center. To accomplish this, we obtain a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver to flag the charts of patients with a billing code of OA who have attended the Rheumatology Clinic within the last year, and approach them for participation. Any interested respondents receive information about the study and answer a brief, scripted survey to determine their eligibility for the trial (Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This screening survey includes items whose predictive values for knee OA are known from population-based data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Enrollment and the informed consent process</title><p>Participants are enrolled in groups of 20 or more participants per cycle in order to ensure a full classroom setting for the group intervention and a one to one ratio for the two interventions. In the three-week period prior to the start of the intervention period, baseline assessments for a group of 30 to 40 pre-screened participants are performed in order to obtain an eligible cohort of participants to randomize. Prior to any information being collected, the principal investigator (CW) or study coordinator completes the informed consent process. Each person who agrees to participate provides informed consent. After providing informed consent, the principal investigator or study staff screen participants to confirm that potential participants meet the eligibility criteria listed above.</p><p>After verifying the participant&#x02019;s potential eligibility, radiographs are obtained as described above for confirmation of radiographic OA. If a participant has a definite osteophyte on any view in the symptomatic knee, the participant is randomized through the process described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomizing participants for a group intervention (Tai Chi) presents some challenges, as does having an active comparator that is not a group intervention (Physical Therapy). Participants who pass eligibility criteria including the radiographic and physical examination screen are offered enrollment in the study. Randomization occurs after the baseline evaluation.</p><p>The study statistician (CS) randomizes assignments using a sequence randomly generated in the R statistical package
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These assignments are then sent to a study staff member other than the study coordinator or PI, who puts them into sealed, opaque envelopes with date and signature labels placed over the seals of the envelopes. The study coordinator then contacts eligible participants by phone, confirms that each one still wishes to participate in the study, opens the consecutive randomization envelope, and informs the individuals of their group assignment. The study coordinator also informs the participants of the schedule for their training sessions (including date and time). These procedures are precisely described in a Manual of Operations.</p><p>The study is conducted in nine cycles of at least 20 participants each for a 12-week treatment course. Participants from this pool are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Tai Chi or Physical Therapy. One of the unanswered questions from our previous studies was whether the observed benefit of Tai Chi depended on the instructor or whether it could be generalized. Systematic differences across instructors would imply that the amount of treatment benefit might depend on the skill level of the instructor; lack of differences would imply that the benefit might apply more generally. Over the course of the entire study, each Tai Chi group is randomly assigned to one of the three Tai Chi instructors so that each instructor teaches one group of approximately 10 participants every three cycles. To evaluate between-therapist differences in Physical Therapy, participants randomized to that intervention are further randomized to receive treatment by one of three physical therapists (two at the hospital Physical Therapy Clinic and one at a community therapy clinic).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study intervention</title><p>Both Tai Chi and Physical Therapy interventions run concurrently to avoid seasonal influences on disease severity. During the first six weeks, both treatment arms receive supervised exercise (either Tai Chi in groups or an individual Physical Therapy regimen with the recommendation to practice these exercises daily for 20&#x000a0;minutes at home). After six weeks, participants randomized to Physical Therapy transition to a personalized home exercise program while the Tai Chi group continues in the group format. Participants in the Physical Therapy group are instructed to engage in home exercises four times a week for 30&#x000a0;minutes and are contacted weekly by phone during their six-week home exercise period to ascertain adherence. Adherence data included frequency, duration of exercise and types of exercises performed. The six week course of Physical Therapy followed by home therapy is consistent with the type and duration of intervention typically received in a normal clinical setting, which is often, in the United States, limited by insurance or other payers to 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Participants are able to continue routine medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and acetaminophen, and maintain their usual treatment visits with their primary care physician or rheumatologist throughout the study.

The intervention classes take place at varied one hour blocks during afternoon business hours, Monday-Friday.</p><p>The three Tai Chi instructors each have extensive experience (&#x0003e;20&#x000a0;years) conducting Tai Chi mind-body programs and follow a Tai Chi protocol specifically designed for individuals with knee OA. In addition, all three instructors completed the required research and human subject protection training prior to initiation of the intervention classes.</p><p>To ensure that instructors are prepared to teach a robust, standardized Yang-style Tai Chi treatment program for patients with knee OA, we conduct a training session with the three Tai Chi instructors to thoroughly review concepts of knee OA and a standardized teaching menu at the beginning of the study and reviewed as needed throughout the course of the study. All sessions are monitored by regularly reviewing video recordings and providing feedback throughout the study to ensure proper instruction.</p><p>Each Tai Chi session lasts 60&#x000a0;minutes and continues twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Participants are also provided with printed materials on the Tai Chi Mind-Body program, including Tai Chi principles, practicing techniques, and safety precautions for participants with knee OA. In the first session, the Tai Chi instructor explains exercise theory and Tai Chi procedures. For the remaining sessions, the procedures include the following components: (1) warm-up and a review of Tai Chi principles and techniques, (2) Tai Chi movement, (3) breathing techniques, and (4) various relaxation methods. All program components are derived from classical Yang style Tai Chi 108 postures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Because of time limitations in executing a study on the use of Tai Chi and based on the literature
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] we condensed the 108 postures of Classical Yang style Tai Chi to 10 forms that could be learned by elderly subjects with knee osteoarthritis within 12&#x000a0;weeks. The 10 forms were selected because (1) they are easily comprehensible; (2) clearly represent progressive degrees of stress to postural stability, with weight bearing moving from bilateral to unilateral supports; and (3) seem to emphasize increasing magnitude of truck and arm rotation with diminishing base of support and, as such, will potentially improve physical function without excessively stressing the joints. An outline of the Tai Chi exercise program is shown in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p><p>All participants are encouraged to maintain their usual physical activities and to perform no new additional strength training other than their Tai Chi exercises. Participants are also instructed to practice Tai Chi for at least 20&#x000a0;minutes per day at home. Tai Chi instructors remind subjects in class of daily practice and give out weekly assignments of Tai Chi poses to practice. The data collected for class attendance are recorded and verified using standard case report forms that include a participant sign in sheet as well as a staff completed attendance sheet to confirm accurate attendance recordings.</p><p>After completing the 12&#x000a0;week intervention (24 treatment sessions), participants are asked to continue with their exercises without direct supervision.

The Physical Therapy intervention takes place at either the hospital or a specific community therapy clinic.</p><p>The three Physical Therapists are experienced in outpatient orthopedic Physical Therapy, each possessing more than 10&#x000a0;years of clinical outpatient experience. Additionally, all three Physical Therapists completed the required research and human subject protection training prior to the initiation of the intervention sessions.</p><p>Prior to recruitment, the supervising Physical Therapy research scientist (MDI) developed an evaluation form (and corresponding coding protocol) based on contemporary orthopedic Physical Therapy practice using the Tufts Medical Center evaluation form as a template (provided in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). A series of training sessions was conducted with the three study Physical Therapists to discuss the content of the examination form, standardize documentation procedures and develop a consensus for performing special tests. Specifically, the Physical Therapy team came to a consensus on a single method for each of the special tests used in a standard Physical Therapy examination for muscle flexibility, ligamentous and meniscal integrity and posture. The initial examination is performed by one of the three study Physical Therapists and generally lasts one hour. The supervising therapist reviews the examination forms for the first 3&#x02013;4 subjects enrolled per Physical Therapist to check for consistency in recording data and to refine the coding protocol. During each recruitment cycle, the supervising Physical Therapy research scientist visits each therapist to ensure documentation of examination procedures is consistent with the established protocol.</p><p>Depending on the diagnostic findings in the initial exam, the Physical Therapist develops tailored personalized Physical Therapy regimens to address specific treatment goals developed collaboratively with the participant and consistent with current recommended guidelines for knee OA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The remainder of the Physical Therapy intervention consists of 30-minute sessions, held twice a week for six weeks at the designated Physical Therapy clinic. The multi-modal Physical Therapy regimen is designed to produce the desired outcomes and in general consists of joint mobilizations, active and passive knee and hip range-of-motion exercises, hip and knee strengthening exercises, stretching lower limb functional exercises, stationary biking, balance exercises, and neuromuscular training. All of the activities are designed to be functional and mutually reinforcing, with repeated and sustained gentle challenges to the end-range of movement. The Physical Therapist increases the repetitions and intensity of strengthening exercises on the basis of participant tolerance. For example, open chain exercises (e.g., straight leg raises) are progressed to closed chain exercises (e.g., mini-wall squats) that are further progressed to activities such as mini-squats. Balance activities are progressed from wide stance to narrow stance (or tandem stance) and eventually to single leg balance (with minor support to no support). The brief examples of the flexibility and straight plane strengthening exercises are shown in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p><p>At each session, the treating Physical Therapist examines the participant for adverse signs and symptoms, such as increased pain, joint effusion, and increased skin temperature over the knee joints. These signs and symptoms of knee OA need to be stable or decreasing before manual therapy or exercise is progressed. The supervising Physical Therapist closely monitors the knee exercise program during each recruitment cycle, visiting each therapist once a cycle to observe the intervention sessions.</p><p>All participants are encouraged to maintain their usual physical activities and to perform no new additional strength training other than their Physical Therapy exercise. Participants are encouraged to practice these exercises daily for 20&#x000a0;minutes at home. The Physical Therapists remind participants during outpatient sessions of daily practice. The data collected for session attendance are recorded and verified using standard case report forms completed by the Physical Therapist on a weekly basis.</p><p>After six weeks, the Physical Therapy regimen transitions to a six-week home exercise program. Participants receive illustrations of exercises and are instructed to exercise four times per week for 30&#x000a0;minutes. Thus, the home program (4 times per week for 30&#x000a0;minutes over 6&#x000a0;weeks plus the initial 6-week, individual Physical Therapy) is equivalent in dose to the Tai Chi intervention (twice a week for 60&#x000a0;minutes over 12&#x000a0;weeks). The home exercise program is essentially the same as the outpatient program with guidelines for progressing exercises provided by the Physical Therapists. The individualized home exercise programs are monitored weekly by study staff through phone interview using standardized forms including questions about frequency, exercises completed, and adverse events. At the end of the six-week home program, participants are asked to integrate their exercise into their daily routine to enable them to continue with their exercises throughout the follow up period. The research team monitors these participants once a month with home calls until the 52-week follow-up evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measurements</title><p>Knee OA outcome measurements are drawn from the core set recommended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International

Power analyses are based on hypothesized changes in WOMAC pain, WOMAC function, chair-stand performance, and the SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores. We are using the outcomes of two RCTs that used attention controls to formulate expected effects. The first study by Baker et al. compared the effects of a 4&#x02013;month, home-based Physical Therapy training program with attention control group among 46 older participants with knee OA. Researchers found that the Physical Therapy strength training group had an 80-point better mean change in the WOMAC pain score and a 270-point better mean change in the WOMAC physical function score
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The second study was our pilot trial of 40 participants with knee OA, comparing Tai Chi with attention control
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We found a 150-point better mean change in the WOMAC pain score and a 500-point better mean change for the WOMAC physical function scale in the Tai Chi group. Based on these data, we expect Tai Chi to be 70 points better than strength training on the WOMAC pain scale and 230 points better on the WOMAC physical function scale. A sample size of 76 per group has 99% power to detect these differences at 0.05 type I error level. For secondary outcomes such as the Chair Stand and quality of life (SF-36 Physical Component Score-PCS), a sample size of 76 per group has &#x0003e;90% power to detect the difference between these two groups. Although we did not have any attrition in our pilot study, we are conservatively assuming a 15% dropout rate. If the dropout rate exceeds our prediction, we will recalculate power effects to see if additional participants are needed. Also, if it is determined that more participants are needed to fill the sessions allowing for between instructor comparisons and comparable group dynamics, the sample size will be reevaluated. Furthermore, we plan to analyze the primary study outcome first for non-inferiority and then for superiority of the Tai Chi intervention. Using a non-inferiority limit of 20 in the WOMAC Pain score and a one-sided error rate of 5%, the proposed sample will provide greater than 95% power to detect non-inferiority if the planned intervention is only half as effective as expected (e.g. WOMAC Pain scores of 115 versus 80 with a standard deviation of 100). The study has 84% power to detect non-inferiority if the difference in WOMAC scores between treatments is as low as 20. If non-inferiority is found then the superiority of Tai Chi will be tested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data and safety monitoring</title><p>We have established an NIH-approved independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB).

In the event that the study is discontinued, the Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University Health Sciences Campus IRB and the participants are informed and intervention-related activities cease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consider external factors such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may impact the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Protect the safety and scientific progress of the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Make recommendations to the PI regarding the appropriateness of continuation, termination, or other modifications to the trial based on observed beneficial or adverse effects of the investigational agent in accordance with clearly-defined data-driven algorithms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assure data integrity, confidentiality, and monitoring results.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The board meets at least once during the study and more frequently as needed. Decisions are made by a majority vote. Following each DSMB meeting, the Chair prepares a report to be submitted to the Tufts Medical Center and Tufts Health Sciences Campus IRB by the PI. All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSMB are highly confidential. The DSMB chair receives reports of all serious events throughout the conduct of the study. We provide to the DSMB a number of reports including serious adverse events or death within 24&#x000a0;hours of knowledge of event occurrence, annual reports of all adverse events as well as routine progress reports prior to each DSMB meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Analysis</title><p>The primary outcome is the measurement of change in knee pain between baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks. The primary analysis of this outcome will be an intent-to-treat analysis in which all participants are analyzed in the group to which they are randomized with no adjustment for covariates and with missing 12-week outcomes imputed as no change. Secondary analyses will adjust for covariates whose baseline distributions differ by treatment group and will explore potential interactions of these covariates with treatment. Such baseline characteristics could include gender, baseline pain severity, opiate use, disease duration, and number of chronic conditions. Because we are interested in potential effects by instructor as well as differences by the two Physical Therapy sites, we will also form contrasts of these strata within treatment groups to explore differences.</p><p>Change in knee pain from baseline at 24&#x000a0;weeks and 52&#x000a0;weeks are secondary outcomes as are all other outcomes (Table&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These will be analyzed in the same way as the primary outcome. In addition, we will analyze the four time points in one longitudinal analysis in order to detect potential time trends and interactions of treatment effect with time. These longitudinal analyses will use mixed models with random effects for patient and fixed effects for time and will explore autoregressive correlation structures to explain residual error.</p><p>These will be analyzed both as individual time points and in longitudinal analyses. Missing values will be imputed by multiple imputations assuming data are missing at random. Because some individuals may drop out early because of poor outcomes, we will also investigate missing not at random models based on informative dropout models. As part of these sensitivity analyses for missing data, we will explore Bayesian models that can incorporate prior assumptions about the non-ignorable missing data mechanisms

Based on the health care utilization during the trial using the full Health Assessment Questionnaire, we will apply standard microcosting methods from the US Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness analyses have become a well-accepted component of clinical trials with the capture of health resource use and health state utilities directly from study subjects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. For each individual, we will focus on the following major and readily captured medical and productivity measures: Physical Therapy and Tai Chi session costs, medications, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and productivity (full-time, part-time work). Cost-effectiveness analysis will assess the trial primary and secondary outcomes based on the duration of the trial itself first and then an extension of projected outcomes beyond the observed trial follow-up, so these analyses will examine the direct and indirect costs and the reduction in pain, improvement in physical or psychosocial function. If outcomes with Tai Chi are improved and costs reduced versus Physical Therapy, then Tai Chi would be cost-saving, but if Tai Chi is more expensive, then incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be determined for each outcome. Because the proposed trial is limited in the duration of observation yet induced benefits or costs may extend beyond the time horizon of the study, we will project the future implications of the observed trial outcomes on long-term health and costs using computer simulation models. To estimate the likely outcomes resulting from the alternative approaches, we will apply decision analysis, a prescriptive, normative approach to decision-making in the face of uncertainty. For these projected costs and outcomes, we will perform the following: (1) a systematic literature search to identify existing data to estimate model parameters (costs, natural history of knee osteoarthritis, disability related to osteoarthritis, knee replacement) and previously published economic models, (2) data synthesis to estimate means and ranges of uncertainty, and (3) Markov and Monte Carlo simulation model development based on the primary trial and literature data. Thus, the outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis becomes incremental cost-utility analysis and is expressed as the cost per additional discounted quality-adjusted life year gained permitting comparison with the cost-effectiveness of other medical interventions. Medical treatment or screening interventions are typically considered to be "cost-effective" in the United States if they fall below $50,000 to $100,000 per discounted quality-adjusted life year gained, a range in which many well-accepted medical strategies fall. Because uncertainty surrounds all data estimates, extensive sensitivity analyses are performed varying each variable or groups of variables over their plausible ranges to determine their impact on the cost-effectiveness of the alternative strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Finding new and cost-effective treatments to maintain function and quality of life in people with knee OA is a national priority. In this project, we are conducting the first randomized comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial. When completed, the study will be the largest mind-body therapy study which compares to a standardized physical therapy regimen on symptomatic knee OA population with long-term follow up. Our robust and well-designed randomized comparative-effectiveness trial will fill a critical knowledge gap in this field, and results of this study are likely to have significant public health implications.</p><p>In addition, testing other secondary outcomes based on the proposed larger sample size will allow us to address unanswered questions remaining from our previous studies, for instance, observed benefit dependent on instructors themselves and whether such observed benefit can be generalized to other populations. Thus, successful completion of the proposed study will contribute to the evidence base of whether Tai Chi instead of physical therapy can be used as a simple, inexpensive, effective, durable treatment for a major disabling disease simultaneously saving economic costs in the healthcare system. The study will be completed by September 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec29"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12906_2014_1908_MOESM1_ESM.doc"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
