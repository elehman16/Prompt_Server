Several studies suggest that adherence to ART in sub-Saharan Africa is adequate <xref rid="pone.0021450-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, but may be disrupted by supply chain interruptions, stock outs, power outages affecting medication storage, employment migration, conflict, and significant cultural stigma <xref rid="pone.0021450-Tuller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-Weiser1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, rates of therapy interruptions in regular therapy management in Sub-Saharan Africa have been reported at 12.8 per 100 person years <xref rid="pone.0021450-Kranzer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Prior studies of CD4-guided ART interruptions in patients with low CD4 counts have not been promising: the largest study to date (SMART) showed that a strategy of structured treatment interruptions (STI) guided by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count (average time off therapy of 16.8 months) was associated with significant non-HIV related morbidities <xref rid="pone.0021450-ElSadr2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-Lundgren1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The duration of uncontrolled HIV viral replication was associated with higher risk of opportunistic infections (OI) <xref rid="pone.0021450-Touloumi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A second study evaluating structured interruptions in Corte d'Ivoire (TRIVACAN study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Danel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) assessed three scheduled interruptions of 2 months each followed by 4 months of continuous ART (c-ART) compared with continuous NNRTI-based ART in subjects with a median pre-ART CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count nadir of 272 cells/&#x000b5;l. While the interruption arm was considered to be non-inferior, there was a significantly higher rate of resistance to non-nucleotides (NNRTIs) in the experimental arm. Importantly, both SMART and TRIVACAN had low re-treatment thresholds (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count &#x0003c;250 cells/&#x000b5;l), exposing subjects to prolonged periods of immunodeficiency. Results from the CD4-driven STACCATO study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Ananworanich1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, with re-treatment threshold of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x000b5;l, suggest that higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thresholds may minimize the risks of interrupting ART, although even in that study the interrupting ARM had higher frequency of candidiasis.</p><p>While open-ended CD4-driven treatment interruptions result in worse outcomes for subjects interrupting ART, trials incorporating fixed-length shorter treatment interruptions have yielded mixed results: the DART study used pre-determined cyclic 12 week ART interruption arms and found this strategy to be inferior due to a higher rate of disease progression than in continuous therapy. However, this study included patients with low CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count nadirs (86 cells/&#x000b5;l) and 52&#x00025; of DART participants had a previous episode of oral or oesophageal candidiasis <xref rid="pone.0021450-DART1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The ISS-PART study, conducted in Italy with ART interruptions increasing in length from 1 to 3 months, did not result in virological failures even though resistance mutations and lower frequency of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count &#x0003e;500 cells/&#x000b5;l were noted in interrupting subjects <xref rid="pone.0021450-Palmisano1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The France-based ANSR-106 study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Marchou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which used a 2-month on/2-month off treatment strategy, did not result in clinical endpoint differences between arms (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count &#x0003e;300 cells/&#x000b5;l), but the interrupting arm had higher frequency of lymphadenitis and candidiasis. The ACTG-5068 study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> incorporated 2 ART interruptions of 4 and 8 weeks. In this study, subjects on the interrupting arm were able to maintain a viral load &#x0003c;1000 copies/ml at greater frequency that subjects on the continuous ART arm, indicating a possible advantage for intermittent treatment strategies. Time to rebound to VL&#x0003e;5000 copies/ml upon ART cessation were similar between interrupting and continuous treatment arm in our Philadelphia-based study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Papasavvas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which also found no significantly different clinical outcomes.</p><p>Together, the current literature (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0021450-Paton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-Ananworanich2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>) suggest that long (e.g. mean 16.8 months in SMART), open ended ART interruption carry an immunological penalty for individuals on NNRTI-based regimens, even when relatively high CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count safety thresholds are in place. However, the immunological and clinical consequences of brief (up to 8 weeks) ART interruptions in individuals with higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count on a PI-based regimen has not been determined, and the present study was initiated with the intent of assessing the immunologic and virologic changes occurring as a consequence of such interruptions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021450.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021450.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was conducted at the Themba Lethu HIV care and treatment clinic located in a secondary government hospital in Johannesburg South Africa.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects; consent procedure included two educational sessions with confirmed understanding by the site investigator.

A sufficient number of individual envelopes, sealed and sequentially numbered, containing the arm assignment for each subject, were provided by the study statistician, and opened in the same order by an independent individual with no patient contact (site Data Manager) at the time of randomization. Specific site training was provided to ensure the correctness of the procedure.</p><p>Participants who were randomized to arm 1 were followed every 4 to 12 weeks for 72 weeks. Three sequential interruption of treatment of 2, 4 and 8 weeks took place with 16 weeks of therapy in between each interruption, a strategy that had proven safe for participants in our prior study <xref rid="pone.0021450-Papasavvas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

If any of these occurred, the patient continued ART and HIV viral load and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count were rechecked in one month. If the above criteria were not met at 16 weeks after ART, the patient was declared to have reached the primary endpoint and discontinued from the experimental procedure yet continually monitored for suppression. Patients in arm 2 were followed every 8 weeks for 72 weeks after randomization. For both arms, HIV viral load, complete blood count, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count, liver function tests, electrolytes and blood samples were collected at each study visit. Adherence was assessed via pill count and patient self-report. If the HIV viral load was &#x0003e;5,000 copies/ml on ART, treatment adherence counselling was implemented and genotypic resistance testing was performed. If the HIV viral load remained &#x0003e;5,000 copies/ml for an additional 16 weeks the subject was declared to have reached primary endpoint.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Genotypic Resistance Testing</title><p>Viral RNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN Group, Germany).

Despite the use of lamivudine, M184V resistance mutation (commonly observed in STI studies) was not found here; the K103N mutation found in one individual may be the result of exposure to ARV at an earlier time, possibly unreported single-dose nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child transmission <xref rid="pone.0021450-Loubser1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, or transmitted drug-resistance.

First, sample size was limited, making it difficult to compare our clinical outcome data against those of larger studies (e.g. SMART). Second, by incorporating safety endpoints (imputed as primary outcomes counted as loss of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells even if observed CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count &#x0003e;350 cells/&#x000b5;l), our non-inferiority definition conservatively favoured the continuous ART arm: we justify this approach under the premise that any adverse clinical outcome associated with this strategy should be reflected in primary end-point. Finally, we note that the observed sample standard deviation is much larger than the standard deviation (7.07) assumed for the initial sample size calculations. If indeed, the standard deviation were 18, then this study was powered to detect non-inferiority defined as a difference (in the mean percentage of CD4 counts &#x0003e;350 between groups) of less than 20&#x00025;. Our conclusion that the results do not support non-inferiority remains appropriate.</p><p>While the results from the present and other studies conducted in resource-constrained countries overall do not support intermittent ART as a routine treatment strategy, treatment interruptions remain a reality of medical care in this environment, due to discontinuity in supply chains and healthcare delivery <xref rid="pone.0021450-Posse1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, displacement <xref rid="pone.0021450-Stephen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and individual behavioural <xref rid="pone.0021450-Marcellin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and economic <xref rid="pone.0021450-Cantrell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-Beyene1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021450-Diabate1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> adherence issues leading to treatment discontinuations and/or modifications <xref rid="pone.0021450-Kiguba1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our data suggest that a PI-based regimen may be less likely to result in clinical failure than NNRTI-based regimens if ART interruptions occur; however, the cost of such interruptions, even in the absence of acquired genotypic resistance to the PI-based regimen or development of OI and AIDS defining illnesses, may be the forfeiture of the long-term gain in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count that would be expected under continuous ART.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0021450.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0021450.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0021450.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0021450.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Daniella Livnat, Ms. Ina de Jongh, and Ms. Marianne O'Neill for assistance in all aspects of study administration and monitoring.
