cleaning tablets for complete denture, in terms of denture biofilm removal and
antimicrobial action. </p></sec><sec><title>Material and methods</title><p>Forty complete denture wearers (14 men and 26 women) with a mean age of 62.3&#x000b1;9.0
years were randomly assigned to two groups and were instructed to clean their
dentures according to two methods: brushing (control) - 3 times a day with denture
brush and tap water following meals; brushing and immersion (experimental) -
brushing the denture 3 times a day with denture brush and tap water following
meals and immersion of the denture in NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup>-based denture tablets
(Medical Interporous<sup>TM</sup>). Each method was used for 21 days. Denture
biofilm was disclosed by a 1% neutral red solution and quantified by means of
digital photos taken from the internal surface before and after the use of the
product. Microbiological assessment was conducted to quantify <italic>Candida

the denture bearing mucosa that affects approximately 50% of patients wearing maxillary
complete dentures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref></sup>, and has a
multifactor etiology. Factors of particular significance are trauma caused by the
denture itself, infection by Candida, poor denture hygiene, continuous denture wear, and
dietary and systemic factors, including suppressed immunocompetence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup>. Especially elderly people wearing
dentures or patients with metabolic diseases, such as diabetics, organ transplant
patients, cancer patients or patients on chronic antibiotic treatment have an increased
risk for developing oral candidiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>The presence of denture biofilm is an important etiologic factor for this disease.
Biofilm found on dentures consists of a complex mixture of fungi and bacteria and
desquamated epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. This
biofilm act as a protective reservoir for oral microorganisms, and <italic>Candida
albicans </italic>and other species of yeast found in biofilm have been reported as
important agents for the installation, maintenance and exacerbation of denture
stomatitis. Scanning electron microscopic evaluation of dentures retrieved from patients
suffering from denture stomatitis demonstrates that <italic>Candida </italic>biofilm not
only colonizes the surface, but also penetrate the cracks and imperfections of the
denture material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition to <italic>Candida sp</italic>., also other pathogenic and opportunistic
microorganisms have been isolated from patient's dentures which include
<italic>Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. </italic>and <italic>Pseudomonas
sp.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, the
colonization of oral surfaces, including denture-seating surfaces, could serve as a
reservoir for disseminated infections, such as gastrointestinal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>. Even respiratory pathogens that are
uncommon in the oral flora have been isolated from dentures, including
<italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, MRSA or
methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>and
Enterobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup>. The presence
of these bacteria increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia and/or aspiration
pneumonitis, in particular when swallowing disorders are observed (e.g.: in patients
with neurological disorder including peripheral or central neuromotor disability, such
as cerebral palsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or Down
Syndrome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup>. For the above
described reasons, adequate removal of pathogenic biofilm present on dentures should be
recommended as a routine practice.</p><p>The efficacy of several denture cleansers has been clinically evaluated in a number of
approaches, and commercially available denture cleansing products are generally not very
efficient in denture biofilm control. In addition, some of these cleansers are either
corrosive or change the colour or hardness of the polymer after repeated use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup>. The ideal denture maintenance product must be effective in the
removal of organic and inorganic deposits, have antibacterial and antifungal biofilm
removal properties, be non-toxic to humans, compatible with the denture materials
including metals, easy to handle and also have a low cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical
efficacy of a novel disinfecting cleaning tablet for complete denture cleansing, Medical
Interporous<sup>TM</sup> (MSI Laboratories AG, Vaduz, Liechtenstein), in terms of
denture biofilm removal and antimicrobial action in denture wearers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 40 complete denture wearers (14 men and 26 women) with a
mean age of 62.3&#x000b1;9.0 years (range: 45 to 70 years). Dentures were inserted at least 1
year (mean 5.5&#x000b1;4.8 years) prior to the study and were made from heat-polymerized acrylic
resin. All participants presented adequate general health conditions. This research
study was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Committee (process number
2007.1.207.58.4). Patients were informed of the nature of the investigation, and written
informed consent was obtained prior to enrolment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: time of denture use less than one year and absence of biofilm
on internal surface of upper dentures during the first examination. This assessment was
conducted by the Additive Index of Ambj&#x000f8;rnsen, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup> (1982). Only subjects wearing upper complete dentures
with scores of "1" or greater were selected. In other words, a zero in one or more areas
of the Additive Index precluded inclusion.</p><p>Volunteers were instructed to clean their dentures according to two methods:</p><p>1) Control: brushing 3 times a day using a denture brush (Denture - Condor S.A., S&#x000e3;o
Bento do Sul, SC, Brazil) and tap water following meals (breakfast, lunch and
dinner);</p><p>2) Experimental: brushing the denture using the denture brush and tap water following
meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and treating the denture with Medical
Interporous<sup>TM</sup> Denture tablets, by immersing the denture into 150 mL of
lukewarm water and then adding one tablet. The denture was then allowed to soak in the
solution for at least 15 min once a day for 21 days. After treatment, the denture was
removed from the solution and rinsed vigorously under running water before replacing
back in the mouth.</p><p>The 40 patients were randomly distributed to each group and received verbal information
and practical demonstration of both control and experimental techniques. After
participants had received their denture maintenance instructions and hygiene materials,
disclosure of the internal surface of maxillary denture of each participating denture
wearer was assessed using a 1% neutral red solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup>. The disclosed dentures were then brushed until complete removal
of disclosed biofilm (biofilm free). For evaluation of the efficacy in the removal of
biofilm, after 21 days of the use of both denture maintenance methods (control and
experimental), the internal surfaces of upper dentures were disclosed again by 1%
neutral red solution. The surfaces were then photographed (digital camera Canon EOS
Digital Rebel EF-S 18-55; and flash: Canon MR-14 EX, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with
standard lens-object distance and exposure time. The camera was fixed on a stand (CS-4
Copy Stand, Testrite Inst. Co., Inc., Newark, NJ, USA). After quantification, biofilm
was eliminated by brushing with the denture brush and liquid soap (JOB Qu&#x000ed;mica, Produtos
para Limpeza Ltda., Monte Alto, SP, Brazil).</p><p>Photographs were transferred to a computer and the total surface area and the areas
corresponding to the stained region were measured using image processing software (Image
Tool 2.02, UTHSC, San Antonio, Texas). Biofilm percentage was calculated using the
relation between biofilm area multiplied by 100, and total surface area of the denture's
internal base.</p><p>For the microbiological analysis, at the end of the 21 days evaluation period, the
biofilm was collected by brushing in saline solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. Serial dilutions were prepared in PBS (10<sup>-4</sup>) and
cultivated in CHROMagar<sup>TM</sup>
<italic>Candida </italic>(CHROMagar, Paris, France) culture medium (CM) under laminar
flow, in duplicate at 37&#x000ba;C for 48 h. The counting of the number of colony-forming units
(cfu) of yeast-like fungi was performed and the identification was carried out on the
basis of the macroscopic morphology and use of code of colors (<italic>Candida albicans
</italic>-green; <italic>Candida dubliniensis</italic> - green; <italic>Candida
glabrata</italic> - purpura; <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> - blue;
<italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> - white). The identity of the isolated yeasts
was confirmed by the tests of tube formation of germination (GT), chlamydoconidia and
tests of fermentation and assimilation.</p><p>The influence of the treatments on the denture biofilm percentage was assessed with an
independent sample t-test. The homogeneity of the variances was tested with a Levene's
test and normality of the residuals was tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test (SW). A
significance level of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was used. The data were transformed to
their square root to meet the assumptions. In the tables, the back-transformed mean
values together with their 95% confidence interval are shown.</p><p>The analysis of the antimicrobial action was performed after processing the original
data (cfu) in Log 10. <italic>Candida sp</italic>. counts were not normally distributed
and were compared by the Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> shows the biofilm percentage in the

because of the increasing numbers of elderly people in the world. Today, approximately
600 million people are aged over 60 years, and this number is estimated to double by
2025, 80% of which live in developing countries. In Brazil, by the year 2050, over 100
million people will be old-aged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup>.
Denture stomatitis is a common clinical pathology observed in elderly populations.
Microbial biofilm on the fitting surface of the denture is one of the principal causes
of denture stomatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>. The
correlation between poor denture cleanliness and denture stomatitis is statistically
significant according to Kulak-Ozkan, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> (2002). Removal of the denture biofilm by means of good denture
hygiene is important in the prevention of the denture stomatitis, in aesthetic aspects
and in the maintenance of a healthy mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. Efficient biofilm control by mechanical or chemical denture
cleansing has produced significant resolution of this oral disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. However, the incidence of denture
stomatitis is still significant affecting 11-67% of denture wearers and recent studies
indicate that 1 in every 3 removable denture wearers in the United States suffers from
denture stomatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>A variety of chemical denture cleansing products are commercially available. These type
of denture cleansers can be divided into five groups: alkaline peroxides, alkaline
hypochlorite, diluted organic and inorganic acids, disinfectants and enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. While chemical biofilm control is a useful and appropriate
procedure, such treatment should always be accompanied by mechanical control of biofilm
in the fitting surface of the denture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup>, and brushing the fitting surface of the prosthesis should be
indicated as an essential technique of hygiene, at least for patients with motors
disabilities. Because of this evidence, the association of both methods was used in the
present study in the experimental group (brushing and immersion in Medical
Interporous<sup>TM</sup> for 15 min)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>Dentures are made of poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and all of them become quickly
colonized by various microorganisms once they are being placed in the mouth. These
microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses, initially adhere to the surface
of the denture material and subsequently penetrate into the dentures via a complex of
pores and tracks formed by the release of gases during the construction polymerization
process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup>. The dentures in this study were at least 1 year old
once it is necessary for patients to be really adapted to the daily use of the denture,
which ensures the formation of biofilm. Moreover, with the continuous use, the resin
looses gradually its polished surface, which also contributes to the buildup of biofilm
and penetration of microorganisms in the porous of the acrylic resin. So, the
effectiveness of the product in biofilm removal, as well as its antimicrobial action can
be evaluated. In another study, Jeganathan, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> (1996) suggested that the increasing occurrence of stomatitis in
some of the analyzed denture wearing patients may be related to the age of the denture:
the denture may become traumatic because of old age and the surface may present
porosities that make it more difficult to keep clean. This may partially explain the
varying number of cfu of <italic>Candida albicans </italic>in the experimental group in
this present study.</p><p>The overall objective of immersing a denture in a cleaning maintenance solution is to
obtain a clean but also decontaminated prosthesis through the destruction of
microorganisms by means of the chemical actions including the effervescency properties
of the cleanser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>. It has been shown
previously that 24 h accumulations can be removed moderately effectively after 15 min of
immersion and completely with overnight soaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>. Coenye, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> (2008) affirmed that the contact time with NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup>
(MSI Laboratories AG, Vaduz, Liechtenstein) needs to be sufficiently long (i.e., at
least 10-15 min) in order to obtain meaningful reductions, and this may be attributed to
the time needed for the disinfectant to penetrate in to the biofilm. In the present
study, the percentage of biofilm in the experimental group has diminished substantially
(from 37.5% to 4.7%) in comparison to the control group after 21 days of use. Although
the use of NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup> is indicated daily for 2 weeks, a period of 21 days
was used in this study as a parameter of comparison with others studies found in
literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>. Panzeri, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup> (2009), while evaluating the mechanical method, found significant
differences between the control and experimental groups, and brushing with experimental
dentifrice presented greater effectiveness in removing the biofilm.</p><p>Hence, regular overnight soaking in this product may increase the antimicrobial
potential even further, clean the denture completely and leave polished and shiny
surfaces. According to Shay, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>
(2000) in addition to the usual instructions in oral hygiene that should be given to
patients wearing prosthesis, the use of disclosing solutions to identify biofilm
accumulations was demonstrated. Since mature biofilm is much more resistant to removal
than the 24 h biofilm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>, the
quantification of the biofilm can be regarded as a good outcome measurement for denture
hygiene. The use of neutral red solution is justified by its high affinity to oral
biofilms and the ease of removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup>. In
addition, photography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup> combined with
quantitative analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup> was employed
to standardize an objective evaluation method. A limitation of most biofilm measurement
techniques, including the present method is the two dimensional nature of the recording.
The use of a disclosing method appears to present no disadvantage when compared with the
biofilm weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, biofilm
staining is the most commonly used technique for denture biofilm
quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>, and hence,
provides a more efficient method if data need to be compared with previous studies. The
analysis used in this study was based on biofilm quantification on the internal surface
of the maxillary complete denture, in accordance with the studies by Paranhos, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> (2007), Keng and
Lim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> (1996), Sheen, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup> (2000). This surface has
greater potential for build-up of pathogenic micro-organisms and the consequent
development of denture stomatitis. As suggested by Paranhos, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> (2007), we did not measure the external
surface, since it accumulates much less biofilm.</p><p>The ideal denture cleanser should be efficient in removal of organic and inorganic
depositions, non toxic, low cost, ease to use and reduce the amount of biofilm, stain
and food of the dentures surface. We observed a significant difference between the
control group and the experimental group in reduction in <italic>Candida sp
</italic>however with some variability. This could be related to the variability in the
number of cfu of <italic>Candida sp</italic>, between the periods of study and the
subjects, as previously described by with Gornitsky, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> (2002).</p><p>Medical Interporous<sup>TM</sup> denture tablets contain NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup>, a
disinfecting formula that demonstrated high <italic>in vitro </italic>biofilm removal
activity against a variety of micro-organisms, namely <italic>Candida albicans,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, including the MRSA type, and
viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>. The efficacy of these tablets in reducing the biofilm
percentage may also be due to the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in its
formula, Moore, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> (1984)
reported that in a group of six cleansers alkaline peroxide cleansers, only two of them
had a superior performance against yeasts, maybe because of the presence of SLS. SLS is
a detergent used to solubilize protein in a variety of biochemical analysis
techniques.</p><p>Coenye, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> (2008), while testing
the modified Robbins device to study the <italic>in vitro </italic>biofilm removal
efficacy of NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup> found that the number of <italic>C. albicans
</italic>biofilm cells on various materials was reduced by 3-4 log units after a single
15 min treatment, while reductions of c. 3 log units were obtained for MRSA and
<italic>Pseudomonas aerouginosa</italic>. This study showed the efficacy of
NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup> and the optimal conditions for the application of this
disinfectant.</p><p>Dills, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> (1988) showed that
brushing combined with soaking treatment removed significantly more organisms than
brushing alone: the level of microorganisms recovered from the prosthesis were
significantly lower, which confirms the results from our current study. In the same
study, Dills, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> (1988) observed
that the denture cleansers tested were not selective in its antimicrobial action, and
that denture cleanser soak treatment displayed a broad spectrum activity in eliminating
gram negative anaerobic rods, gram positive facultative <italic>cocci</italic>, and gram
negative anaerobic <italic>cocci</italic>. These results support the need to use a
denture disinfectant in addition to brushing the prosthesis for proper denture
hygiene.</p><p>Since most elderly people do not know how to keep dentures clean, knowledge of the
efficacy of different denture maintenance protocols is of importance to improve the
quality of life of these dentures wearing patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> and also the durability of the denture itself will be prolonged.
This study suggests that NitrAdine<sup>TM</sup>-based disinfecting cleaning tablets are
efficient in removal of denture biofilm. In addition a clear antimicrobial action was
demonstrated. So, the Medical Interporous<sup>TM</sup> product can be useful clinically,
especially for institutionalized patients, frail elderly patients in nursing homes,
patients undergoing cancer treatment, and HIV infected patients, and seem to be
effective against methicillinresistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(MRSA),
which can cause a type of staph infection that is hard to treat because it cannot be
killed by many common antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Moreover, the "tablet form" application is very easy-to-use and a consumer friendly
method, which is another benefit for the elderly denture wearer. Additional studies are
currently ongoing to address the physicochemical properties of the Medical
Interporous<sup>TM</sup> as well as its mechanism of action in the prevention of
denture stomatitis symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Microbial denture biofilm counts were substantially higher in the control method
(denture brushing with tap water), when compared with the treatment based on denture
brushing and the immersion in Medical Interporous<sup>TM</sup> denture tablets.
Therefore, these tablets should be recommended as a routine denture maintenance method
for the prevention of the development of microbial biofilm-induced denture
stomatitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. Tom Coenye and Prof. Bart Vande Vannet for critical
