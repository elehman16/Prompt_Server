Large numbers of young people with alcohol-related injuries and medical conditions present to hospital emergency departments (EDs). Access to brief, efficacious, accessible and cost effective treatment is an international health priority within this age group. While there is growing evidence for the efficacy of brief motivational interviewing (MI) for reducing alcohol use in young people, there is significant scope to increase its impact, and determine if it is the most efficacious and cost effective type of brief intervention available. The efficacy of personality-targeted interventions (PIs) for alcohol misuse delivered individually to young people is yet to be determined or compared to MI, despite growing evidence for school-based PIs. This study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telephone-delivered MI, PI and an Assessment Feedback/Information (AF/I) only control for reducing alcohol use and related harm in young people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Participants will be 390 young people aged 16 to 25 years presenting to a crisis support service or ED with alcohol-related injuries and illnesses (including severe alcohol intoxication). This single blinded superiority trial randomized young people to (i) 2 sessions of MI; (ii) 2 sessions of a new PI or (iii) a 1 session AF/I only control. Participants are reassessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months on the primary outcomes of alcohol use and related problems and secondary outcomes of mental health symptoms, functioning, severity of problematic alcohol use, alcohol injuries, alcohol-related knowledge, coping self-efficacy to resist using alcohol, and cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will identify the most efficacious and cost-effective telephone-delivered brief intervention for reducing alcohol misuse and related problems in young people presenting to crisis support services or EDs. We expect efficacy will be greatest for PI, followed by MI, and then AF/I at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months on the primary and secondary outcome variables. Telephone-delivered brief interventions could provide a youth-friendly, accessible, efficacious, cost-effective and easily disseminated treatment for addressing the significant public health issue of alcohol misuse and related harm in young people.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12613000108718">ACTRN12613000108718</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alcohol</kwd><kwd>Brief intervention</kwd><kwd>Young people</kwd><kwd>Substance use</kwd><kwd>Telephone</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Personality</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Harmful or hazardous alcohol use is endemic among young people in the developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In Australia, 60% of young people over a 12-month period reported drinking at levels placing them at risk of harm, with up to 30% drinking at levels placing them at weekly or greater risk of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hazardous alcohol use is a major preventable cause of injury, disability and death in young people, as well as a range of adverse mental health, social, educational, vocational and legal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is estimated to contribute to 27.5% of all deaths and 19.5% of substance-attributable disability-adjusted life years among 15&#x02013;29-year-olds in the developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In 2009, the economic burden of alcohol was estimated to equate to 0.45-5.44% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across 12 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In Australia alcohol use represents 1.2% of GDP costing the economy $15 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The rate of alcohol-related emergency department (ED) presentations in young people has increased dramatically in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This presents a unique opportunity to engage traditionally non-treatment seeking youth into brief alcohol treatment. However, EDs are not ideal settings for the delivery of psychological treatments. Medical treatment for the injury or illness must take priority, and patients&#x02019; attention may be impaired by intoxication, distress or the administration of analgesics. An opportunistic intervention involving initial engagement in these settings, followed by delivery of a post discharge telephone-based intervention benefits both acute management and longer term treatment engagement. Global mobile devices and connections grew to 7 billion in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Ninety-nine percent of young Australians own mobile phones, and overwhelmingly prefer electronic sources of health information over traditional ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mobile phones provide an innovative, youth friendly and accessible way of delivering treatment.</p><p>Brief interventions (BIs) have a well established evidence-base for reducing alcohol use and related harm in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], including adults presenting to EDs with alcohol-related injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. They typically comprise 1-2 sessions (from 10-15 minutes to 2 &#x000d7; 1 hour sessions) of personalised assessment feedback and information (AF/I). Many BIs include motivational interviewing, a person-centred therapeutic approach designed to assist individuals resolve ambivalence about problem drinking, set tangible goals for and strengthen commitment to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>There is strong evidence for the impact of brief motivational interviewing interventions (MI) on young college students&#x02019; alcohol use and related problems at 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], 6, 12, 24 and 48 months follow up, compared with no treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. One study has reported positive effects for MI on alcohol use and related problems among adolescents presenting to an ED with alcohol-related injuries at 3 and 6 month follow up, compared to standard care brief advice; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>While MI produces demonstrable reductions in alcohol use and related harm, there is significant scope to increase their impact. Most studies comparing MI and no treatment control conditions report small to moderate differences in alcohol use outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. One reason for this is that treatment effects tend to reduce over time, as young people in control groups also begin to address their alcohol misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is unclear which form of BI is most effective for treating youth alcohol misuse as many studies report small effect sizes when comparing MI with other types of BIs. For example, while Monti <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported ED-based MI was more effective for reducing alcohol use at 6 and 12 months follow up than assessment feedback alone, only small differences in effect size (f&#x02019;s ranging -.24 to -.33) were found. We recently found two sessions of MI had more impact on alcohol use than an AF/I control at 1 (f = -.62) and 3 months (f = -.51) but not 6 month (f = -.47) follow up, in young people accessing a youth primary care service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, two further studies comparing MI with AF/I in college students at 6 and 12 month follow up, did not find superiority for MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Recent theoretical and empirical advances provide new insights into how to increase the impact of BIs for youth alcohol misuse. Most addiction theories focus on two major sources of reinforcement for substance misuse: (i) positive reinforcement linked to the pleasurable effects of substance use and (ii) negative reinforcement, linked to the relief of negative affect or withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Personality risk models of substance use provide one way of understanding individual differences in susceptibility to drug reinforcement. Different personality traits have been shown to be reinforcement-specific, and are related to different patterns of substance misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], distinct motivations for substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and differential sensitivity to alcohol reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Four personality risk factors for youth substance misuse namely: (i) anxiety-sensitivity/proneness; (ii) depression-proneness; (iii) impulsivity-reward dependence; and (iv) sensation seeking, have been shown to differentially predict susceptibility to binge drinking, alcohol-related problems, illicit drug use and coping and enhancement motives for substance use in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Anxiety proneness is a fear of anxiety-related bodily symptoms and has been linked to alcohol misuse and related problems in young adulthood, via a negative reinforcement process where alcohol is used to reduce anxiety symptoms and negative affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Depression-proneness links with drinking to cope with depression-specific emotions and is associated with early onset alcohol and drug problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Impulsivity or a tendency to act without thinking is associated with early onset and problematic alcohol and other drug use, as well as a range of other externalizing problems including antisocial and sexual risk-taking behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Sensation seeking or the need for intense pleasurable experiences, has the strongest links with alcohol misuse (especially binge drinking) and other drug use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and drinking for enhancement reasons via positive reinforcement processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Increasing evidence for a personality risk model of alcohol misuse has resulted in the development of brief personality-targeted interventions (PI), which differentially target the motivational pathways to alcohol misuse underlying these four personality dimensions. Conrod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] developed and evaluated the first brief PI incorporating psychoeducation and motivational and cognitive behavioral coping skills training among female adult substance users. This 90-minute BI was more effective for reducing alcohol misuse at 6 months, than a time-matched motivational film/supportive discussion or a mismatched intervention targeting another personality profile. Similarly, brief (3 x 1-hour sessions) group cognitive behaviour therapy targeting anxiety sensitivity in female students reduced hazardous alcohol use, conformity and emotional relief alcohol expectations at 10 weeks follow up, compared to control group seminar on psychology ethics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Conrod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] developed a school-based group version (2 &#x000d7; 90 minute sessions) of PI, providing cognitive behavioral coping skills training targeting the motivational processes linking the adolescents&#x02019; dominant personality style to alcohol use. Three separate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach for reducing the rates of alcohol use, binge drinking and alcohol-related problems, compared to no treatment at 4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], 6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], 12 and 24 month follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This intervention also reduced growth in the quantity/frequency of alcohol use over time periods of up to 24 months, lessened the uptake of illicit drug use and reduced alcohol enhancement and coping motives at 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. However, research is yet to determine the efficacy of PIs in young people with alcohol and/or illicit drug misuse, or compare its efficacy to other active BIs for alcohol misuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>We will conduct the first RCT to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of three telephone-delivered brief interventions for alcohol misuse in young people. Participants will receive: (i) 1 session of assessment feedback and information (AF/I); (ii) 2 sessions of AF/I plus MI, or (iii) 2 sessions of a new personality-targeted intervention (PI) incorporating AF/I and MI. This study will identify the most efficacious and cost-effective telephone-delivered BI for reducing alcohol misuse and related problems in young people presenting to EDs/crisis support services. Telephone-delivered BIs provide an innovative, youth friendly and accessible way of delivering treatment to the 99% of young people who own a mobile phone.</p><p><italic>It is hypothesised that e</italic>fficacy will be greatest for PI, followed by MI, and then AF/I at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months in terms of:</p><p>(i) the primary outcome variables of alcohol use and related problems, and</p><p>(ii) secondary outcome variables of mental health symptoms, functioning, severity of problematic alcohol use, alcohol injuries, alcohol-related knowledge, coping self-efficacy to resist using alcohol, and cost effectiveness</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a Phase II single blind superiority RCT comparing the efficacy of three BIs for young people presenting to a ED/crisis support service with alcohol-related injuries and illnesses: (i) 2 sessions of MI; (ii) 2 sessions of PI or a (iii) 1 session AF/I control. The design approximates an additive one, since MI includes AF/I, and PI incorporates AF/I, MI and personality specific coping skills training.

Young people with alcohol-related injuries and illnesses identified by ChaplainWatch, DABIT or a research officer working across the two study sites, are asked if they are interested in participating in a research study on BIs for alcohol use, following completion of standard care. Those who express interest are provided with brief information about the study and their verbal consent and contact details (first name, mobile phone number and email address) obtained. De-identified information on the age, gender, and type of alcohol related injury/illnesses of all young people seen by ChaplainWatch/DABIT during project recruitment will allow us to compare the profile of our sample against that population.</p><p>Trained assessors with at least an Honours degree in Psychology contact the young person within 3 days, to provide further information on the study, obtain their informed consent and conduct a telephone eligibility screen. A 20-minute telephone baseline assessment is conducted either at this time or an appointment is made for a time more convenient to the young person. Participants are also required to complete online versions of self-report measures.

AF/I is delivered sensitively, but MI principles are not used. The young person is emailed a copy of this information after the session and an SMS containing generic information on effects of alcohol use. Four subsequent SMSs are sent at 2, 4, 8 and 10 months post baseline containing this information.</p><p>(ii) <italic>MI:</italic> The MI comprises AF/I delivered in a MI style (i.e., empathically, amplifying the person&#x02019;s own concerns). MI about alcohol is then provided to: (a) build readiness and commitment to make a change (including pros and cons of current use and change), (b) negotiate change goals, and (c) develop a plan for change. Individuals do not progress to Step b or c unless they are ready to change (i.e., rating&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7/10 on <italic>Importance of change &#x00026; confidence to change</italic> Likert scales). Homework (cued by emailed session summaries) for MI after Session 1 comprises review of their pros/cons balance sheet, and after Session 2, review of alcohol change plan or harm minimization strategies (if not ready to make a change). Brief post session SMSs remind the young person about the benefits of alcohol change they identified and any alcohol-related goals and plans. The researcher then makes four 5-10 minute phone calls to check-in with the young person and remind them of session content and conduct a <italic>Timeline Followback</italic> (TLFB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] for the past month at 2, 4, 8 and 10 months post-baseline.</p><p>(iii) <italic>PI:</italic> PI incorporates personality specific AF/I, MI and cognitive-behavioral coping skills training components. The intervention is designed to target how individuals with specific personality risk factors cope with their vulnerability to alcohol misuse. It is not intended to change personality, but to alter specific alcohol-related behaviors. In Session 1, the young person is given personalised AF/I, which not only includes a focus on alcohol use, but also includes psychoeducation about their dominant personality trait (anxiety proneness, depression proneness, impulsivity, or sensation seeking), associated problematic, personality-specific coping behaviors (e.g., avoidance, aggression, risky behaviors), and how this may affect their alcohol and other substance use. Using an MI style, therapists guide individual exploration of the personal relevance of these issues. Participants are given information on alcohol harm minimization strategies and are encouraged to think about how they could have used some of these strategies to prevent the recent alcohol-related injury or illness which resulted in their ED admission.</p><p>In contrast to standard MI, PI does not restrict discussion of potential change strategies to participants who elect to change their drinking. Instead, it encourages them to develop implementation intentions, a specific hypothetical or actual plan for change, which takes the form &#x0201c;if situation Y is encountered, I could cope more effectively by using Z, in order to achieve my alcohol use goal&#x0201d;, a technique based on the Theory of Planned Behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 94 studies indicated implementation intentions were stronger predictors of behavioral action and change than generalised change plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Young people are guided to develop an implementation intention for future alcohol use situations. They are asked to identify an alcohol use situation in which they could test this alcohol plan in the next week and are asked to rate their level of confidence (1-10) in implementing the plan. As in MI, they recall past successes in behavior control to build their self-efficacy, and they identify and address any potential impediments. For homework, the young person is encouraged to implement their alcohol use plan, and is emailed a session summary and a brief SMS message as a reminder.</p><p>In Session 2, the young person&#x02019;s success in implementing their alcohol use plan is reviewed and if necessary, the plan is revised. Young people then receive personality-specific training in two cognitive behavioral coping skills. Those predominantly with anxiety proneness are given training in mind chill thought awareness and acceptance training for anxious thoughts and mindful breathing. Young people high in depression proneness are provided with behavioral activation (looking after yourself/positive event scheduling) and thought awareness and acceptance training for depressive thoughts including refocusing their attention on more positive thoughts using the positive psychology three good things technique. Sensation seekers receive training in savouring techniques to increase their awareness and ability to focus on and experience positive feelings from everyday experiences (food, sex, music) and are encouraged to schedule natural highs from these as well as other functional activities (e.g. exercise, skateboarding, rock climbing). Young people with high levels of impulsivity receive mindfulness training to increase awareness of their impulsive urges and urge surfing techniques using the three D&#x02019;s (delay, distract, decide). Those who experience difficulty identifying impulsive urges are encouraged to apply the Stop-Think-Do rubric to help them slow down their decision-making processes sufficiently to consider likely outcomes of behavioral alternatives. Session 2 concludes with the young person developing an implementation intention for future alcohol-related situations, which incorporates their personality-specific coping skills. They are encouraged to rehearse this plan in session, and identify and address potential impediments. A session summary and a SMS reminder of their alcohol use plan are subsequently sent. As in MI, the researcher then makes four 5-10 minute phone calls to check-in with the young person and remind them of session content and conduct a <italic>TLFB</italic> for the past month at 2, 4, 8 and 10 months post-baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Outcome measures are brief, to minimize assessment fatigue.

We found substantial agreement between urine drug screens and self-reported drug use (83%) using the TLFB in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. The age of onset and frequency of alcohol and other drugs use over the previous 12 months is also assessed at baseline.</p><p>(iii) Other alcohol outcome measures. Alcohol-related knowledge is assessed using 20 <italic>Alcohol Trivia</italic> questions developed for this study. Alcohol-related problems (eg., social, medical, legal, family, vocational) are assessed on the <italic>Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index</italic> (RAPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], a 23-item self-report measure commonly used in BI studies. Alcohol-related injuries are assessed on the <italic>Extended Adolescent Injury Checklist</italic> (E-AIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This 12-item measure records minor and major injuries, whether they required medical attention, and occurred in the context of alcohol or other drug use. The 12-item <italic>University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale</italic> (URICA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] is used to gauge motivation for changing alcohol use. The 15-item <italic>Controlled Drinking Self-Efficacy Scale</italic> (CDSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], provides a reliable and valid measure of self-efficacy to resist excessive drinking.</p><p>(iv) Mental Health: Self-report information on the young person&#x02019;s history of mental health and substance use disorders, as well as their family history is collected. The <italic>Kessler 10</italic> (K10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] is a 10-item self-report measure of psychological distress in the past month. Normative data indicates a cut-off of &#x02265; 17 is at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile among Australian youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Depression symptoms are measured using the 9-item <italic>Patient Health Questionnaire-9</italic> (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms are assessed by the 7-item <italic>Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7</italic> (GAD-7). Social phobia is measured by the 3-item <italic>Mini Social Phobia Inventory</italic> (Mini-SPIN).</p><p>(v) Coping and Functioning: Emotion and task-orientated coping are measured with 32-items from the <italic>Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations</italic> (CISS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] scale. The clinician-rated <italic>Global Functioning: Social and Role</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] scales provides two single ratings of the lowest level of social (e.g., peer, family) and role (school, work) functioning in the past month on a 1 (extreme dysfunction) to 10 (superior) scale. Both scales use detailed anchor points for each rating interval and probe questions to increase reliability.</p><p>(vi) Cost-Effectiveness: A total health care and personal cost perspective is taken; it does not include costs to society. Health care costs (government, insurers, patients) include the costs of treatment provision (staff costs, missed appointments, record keeping, training, materials, rent and overheads) and exclude research costs. As participants may seek other treatment elsewhere, information on all other health care service use is collected. Service prices are based on standard Australian Medicare and Prescription Benefit Scheme (PBS) schedules. The 20-item <italic>Assessment of Quality of Life-6D</italic> (AQoL-6D) for adolescents provides a measure of health-related quality of life on 6 dimensions (inc. social, mental health, independent living) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].

MI fidelity is confirmed on the <italic>MITI 3.1.1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Session Component Checklists are also completed to ensure core features of the allocated treatment are delivered and non-allocated treatments are not delivered.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data, safety and risk management strategies</title><p>Safety and risk management protocols manage any safety or urgent treatment issues. Young people who are recruited to this study and are subsequently identified as in need of more intensive treatment will be appropriately referred. A clinical trials committee comprised of the authors meets every 3 months to monitor the project&#x02019;s implementation (inc. study withdrawals), clinical (inc. any serious adverse events) and research (inc. data safety) integrity. Email or telephone consultations are used to determine urgent inclusion or treatment issues, and a record of decision precedents is kept to ensure consistency.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The independent variable is treatment condition, with 3 levels: (i) AF/I; (ii) MI and (iii) PI. The primary outcome variables are alcohol use (TLFB) and related problems (RAPI). Secondary outcomes include mental health symptoms (psychological distress (K10), depression (PHQ-9), social anxiety (Mini Spin), generalised anxiety (GAD-7)), functioning (Social and Role Functioning scales), severity of problematic alcohol use (AUDIT), alcohol-related knowledge, alcohol-related injuries (E-AIC) and coping self-efficacy (CDSE) to resist using alcohol. Preliminary statistical analyses will be undertaken to check for baseline group differences on demographic, primary and secondary outcome variables using one-way analysis of variance (interval data) and chi-square (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) analyses (categorical data). Intention-to-treat strategies will be used for the main analyses. To determine whether there are group differences on the primary and secondary outcome measures at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months a series of mixed effects model repeated measures analyses of variance (MMRM) will be employed. The within groups factor will be time (baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months) and group will serve as the between subjects factor. This technique can also control for potential confounding variables such as gender, age, injury severity and other drug use.</p><p>A two-pronged economic analysis will be conducted. An analysis alongside the trial will display the costs against their benefits in both natural units, such as alcohol-related injuries/illnesses avoided, and QALYs. Costs saved will also be estimated by quantifying visits to GPs and other health service use avoided under the intervention. MI and PI will be assessed against the AF/I arm as comparator. Uncertainty in the assessment will be estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. In the second modelled CEA, the estimated change in alcohol consumption from the trial will be extrapolated to the general Australian population of 16-25 year olds. The interventions will be evaluated using a model developed for the Assessing Cost-Effectiveness of Prevention (ACE-Prevention) project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], which determines DALYs averted by an intervention from changes in risk of 20 alcohol-related diseases and injuries. By using this model, we can compare cost-effectiveness of the PI and MI intervention with other alcohol interventions and up to 150 other preventive interventions (e.g., for illicit drugs, obesity, etc.) that have already been evaluated for the Australian population. Data on alcohol-related diseases and injuries from the Australian Burden of Disease 2003 study will be updated to 2015. Links between alcohol consumption and these diseases and injuries are based on the Comparative Risk Assessment study. The model is a multi-cohort, multi-disease model that follows up the target population until death or age 100. Uncertainty will be assessed using a combination of non-parametric bootstrapping for the effect size (alcohol consumption) and Monte Carlo simulation for all other variables (with sampling uncertainty).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report the study protocol of an RCT comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of three telephone-delivered BIs for young people with alcohol-related injuries and illnesses. The primary aim of the study is to identify the most efficacious and cost-effective telephone-delivered BI for reducing alcohol misuse and related problems in young people presenting to crisis support services/EDs.</p><p>There is strong evidence for the short-term efficacy of MI for reducing alcohol use in young people compared to no treatment. However, it is unclear if MI is the most efficacious and cost effective type of BI available as trials comparing MI with AF/I have given inconsistent results. Considerable debate remains about the most effective duration, content, context and mode of delivery of BIs for alcohol misuse, and there is significant scope to increase their impact. This study uses an additive design to address these research questions comparing (i) 1 session of AF/I which gives feedback and information, with (ii) 2 sessions of MI which includes AF/I, delivered in an MI style, plus other MI elements, to build readiness to change, negotiate change goals and develop a plan for change and (iii) 2 sessions of PI which delivers AF/I and MI incorporating personality-targeted cognitive behavioral coping skills training to determine if this increases MI&#x02019;s impact. This will be the first study to examine the effectiveness of PI in young alcohol users outside of a group-based school prevention program and compare its efficacy to other BIs.</p><p>This design does have some limitations. It could be argued that the shorter duration of the AF/I control condition may be insufficient to produce an effect. However, the content of the AF/I condition can be easily delivered in one session and even briefer AF/I interventions have demonstrated efficacy in the clinical research literature. While the MI and PI interventions are time matched and delivered in two sessions to ensure an adequate dose of treatment is provided, it is possible that the overlaps in session content may wash out any differential treatment effects. However, there are significant and substantial differences between the BIs and treatment fidelity will be comprehensively assessed. Assessment reactivity as a result of the research process itself may potentially reduce any differential treatment effects. Reassuringly, only small assessment effects (&#x0003c;1 standard drink per week or a 1 point difference on the AUDIT) were found in a meta-analysis of 10 studies examining whether questions about alcohol use changed behavior among hazardous drinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. A finding recently replicated in university students receiving alcohol assessment and feedback, alcohol assessment only and a no contact control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. In the current study moderate effect sizes are expected, and any assessment effects occur across all conditions and are unlikely to affect comparative results. Additionally, all of our assessments are brief, and restricted to measures crucial to determine primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>Engaging young alcohol users with alcohol-related injuries and illnesses who present to crisis support services and EDs into alcohol treatment is challenging, as they are unlikely to view their alcohol use as problematic or responsible for their injury or illness. Initial engagement in these settings, followed by rapid and assertive follow up and the provision of telephone-delivered BIs targeting their recent alcohol related injury or illness, provides a more youth friendly way of engaging young people into treatment than traditional services. Preliminary piloting of this process has produced positive results with 50-70% of young people referred to the study engaging in a BI depending on the referral source. The following strategies are also used to maximise participation and ensure dropout is below 30%: (i) obtaining multiple ways to contact participants at baseline; (ii) the development of tracking databases; (iii) adopting flexible appointment hours, giving pre-appointment reminders and rapidly following up missed appointments; (iv) a rising reimbursement schedule for the time associated with completing the baseline and follow up assessments, and (v) the assessment of only primary outcome measures when a young person wishes to discontinue treatment or is unwilling to undertake the full follow-up protocol.</p><p>The large numbers of young people presenting to crisis support services and hospital EDs with alcohol related injuries and medical conditions present a unique opportunity for engagement in BIs targeting their alcohol use. This may also reduce the risk of future alcohol-related injuries, illnesses, disability and mortality in young people, as well as a range of adverse mental health, social, educational, vocational and legal outcomes. The brief alcohol related interventions evaluated in this study can be easily transferred to existing health professionals across ED and other crisis services as well as primary care, mental health and alcohol and other drug treatment settings. Results of this project are expected to exert a significant influence on clinical policy and practice aimed at increasing access to evidence-based and cost-effective care for young alcohol users aimed at reducing the individual, community and economic costs of youth alcohol misuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AUDIT: Alcohol use disorders identification test; AF/I: Assessment feedback/information; AQoL-6D: Assessment of quality of life-6D; BI: Brief intervention; CDSE: Controlled drinking self-efficacy scale; CISS: Coping inventory for stressful situations; CSQ-8: Client satisfaction questionnaire-8; ED: Emergency department; DABIT: Drug and alcohol brief intervention team; E-AIC: Extended adolescent injury checklist; GAD-7: Generalised anxiety disorder-7; GDP: Gross domestic product; HREC: Human research ethics committee; K10: Kessler 10; MI: Motivational interviewing; Mini-SPIN: Mini social phobia inventory; Mth: Month; MITI: Motivational interviewing treatment integrity; MMRM: Mixed effects model repeated measures analyses of variance; PHQ-9: Patient health questionnaire-9; PI: Personality-targeted intervention; RAPI: Rutgers alcohol problem index; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; RBWH: Royal Brisbane and women&#x02019;s hospital; SURPS: Substance use risk profile; TLFB: Timeline followback; URICA: University of Rhode Island change assessment scale; Wk: Week.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>LH developed the Quik Fix brief interventions which are the subject of this trial.
