Despite emerging evidence regarding the acute health benefits of interrupting prolonged sitting time, the effectiveness of different modalities in older adults (who sit the most) is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 10 sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women (mean age 66 years &#x000b1;9; mean body mass index 30.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1;4.2) in a 4-condition, 4-period crossover feasibility pilot study in San Diego to test 3 different sitting interruption modalities designed to improve glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes compared to a prolonged sitting control condition. The interruption modalities included: a) 2 minutes standing every 20 minutes; b) 2 minutes walking every hour; and c) 10 minutes standing every hour. During each 5-hr condition, participants consumed two identical, standardized meals. Blood samples, blood pressure, and heart rate were collected every 30 minutes. Endothelial function of the superficial femoral artery was measured at baseline and end of each 5-hr condition using flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Participants completed each condition on separate days, in randomized order. This feasibility pilot study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in the various outcomes, however, analytic methods (mixed models) were used to test statistical significance within the small sample size.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Nine participants completed all 4 study visits, one participant completed 3 study visits and then was lost to follow up. Net incremental area under the curve (iAUC) values for postprandial plasma glucose and insulin during the 5-hr sitting interruption conditions were not significantly different compared to the control condition. Exploratory analyses revealed that the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes and the 2-minute walking every hour conditions were associated with a significantly lower glycemic response to the second meal compared to the first meal (i.e., condition-matched 2-hour post-lunch glucose iAUC was lower than 2-hour post-breakfast glucose iAUC) that withstood Bonferroni correction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0024 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0084, respectively). Using allometrically scaled data, the 10-minute standing every hour condition resulted in an improved FMD response, which was significantly greater than the control condition after Bonferroni correction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0033).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study suggests that brief interruptions in prolonged sitting time have modality-specific glucoregulatory and vascular benefits and are feasible in an older adult population.

Older adults also have the highest risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (including peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and coronary heart disease), cancer, and frailty, and these chronic conditions increase their mortality risk [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While it is well-established that PA is related to these conditions, a growing body of evidence suggests that sitting time also contributes to such outcomes, independent of time spent engaging in leisure-time PA [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In recognition of the emerging evidence, the American Heart Association&#x02019;s has published a position statement on sedentary behavior, specifically calling for more specific quantitative evidence to inform public health recommendations and real-world interventions [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Recent laboratory studies manipulating specific behaviors have provided initial insights on the merits of sitting time interruption strategies that are acutely beneficial (i.e., within hours) and that can be tested in real world clinical trials. A 2015 review [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found 14 acute laboratory experiments that compared prolonged sitting conditions with sitting interruption conditions. Sitting interruption modalities included standing, walking at different intensities, cycling, and resistance exercises. Frequency of interruptions ranged from every 20 minutes to once an hour. The review concluded that interruption of sitting time resulted in consistently favorable changes in postprandial metabolic parameters, particularly in those who had type 2 diabetes, were overweight/obese, and/or were physically inactive. Plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed for why frequently breaking up sitting may benefit health. Specifically, postural change that occur with standing up from a seated position immediately increases blood flow and hydrostatic pressure, particularly in the lower extremities [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as a result of gravitational force, and requires leg and lower trunk muscle contractions to raise the body and to sustain the standing position. The action of standing up also induces compensatory changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and vascular tone within seconds. As such, it has been hypothesized that frequent transitions from the seated to standing position during waking hours could be favorable for glucose regulation, mitochondrial function, and endothelial function [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Specifically, increased blood flow increases shear stress and reduces oxidative stress in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], enhances oxygen delivery to mitochondria in endothelial and muscle cells (myocytes), and enhances nutrient (e.g., glucose) and hormone (e.g., insulin) delivery to lower extremity myocytes. Increased muscle contraction stimulates intracellular signaling responses that should enhance mitochondrial activity in endothelial cells and myocytes and enhance insulin-dependent and&#x02013;independent glucose uptake in myocytes. Furthermore, large muscle contractions, particularly those that occur when rising from a chair, are related to physical functioning, frailty and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, postural changes, even with low energy expenditure, may be beneficial for health [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Most laboratory studies examining the impact of interrupting sitting time have included younger, active participants and employed interruptions involving PA or long bouts of standing (e.g. 45 minutes). Few studies have examined vascular outcomes that might be affected by brief postural changes, which are considered highly relevant in older adults who have increased cardiovascular risk. In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, we designed this 4-condition, 4-period randomized, controlled, crossover laboratory trial to pilot test the feasibility of our protocol and to investigate the glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes of brief postural changes and brief bouts of PA in sedentary overweight/obese postmenopausal women. Sedentary overweight/obese postmenopausal women are the largest and fastest growing population of older adults and have significant cardiometabolic risk. Older women experience higher rates of mobility disability, consume more health care and require more long-term care services than older men [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, no previous laboratory studies have focused specifically on this high-risk demographic group. In this study, we aimed to compare the acute metabolic and vascular endothelial function outcomes of a control prolonged sitting condition with three different conditions involving brief standing or walking interruptions of prolonged sitting. Our brief, low-intensity strategies for interrupting prolonged sitting were feasible and had modality-specific benefits on glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes in our study population of sedentary overweight/obese postmenopausal women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study protocol</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Overview</title><p>This randomized, 4-condition, 4-period crossover trial was approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Institutional Review Board.

Medication dosing was matched for all visits for each participant. Participants were asked to void their urine at the start of each visit and then were seated in a comfortably padded arm chair. A foot rest was provided if the participant&#x02019;s feet did not comfortably rest flat on the floor. Initial BP and heart rate measurements were collected using an automated BP monitor (GE Carescape, Dinamap V 100; Alaris Critikon Dinamap PRO 300) at study period time -1.0hr.

The mid-protocol bathroom break occurred in a private restroom that was less than 20ft from the study room chair and was concurrent with a sitting interruption break during condition protocols B-D. The post-lead-in, 5-hr sitting condition protocols were as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Control. Participants sat quietly for 5hr and were instructed to minimize excessive movement (i.e., fidgeting) while sitting. This condition was designed as the control condition for comparison in statistical analyses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Frequent Sit-to-Stand Transitions. Participants completed 2 minutes of standing every 20 minutes throughout the 5-hr protocol period. In total, this condition amounted to 15 sit-to-stand transitions, 30 minutes of standing time, and a 10% reduction in sitting time compared to the 5-hr sitting control condition. This condition was designed to test the outcomes of frequent sitting interruptions consisting of short standing bouts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Walking Breaks. Participants completed 2 minutes of light walking every hour throughout the 5-hr active protocol period. Participants were escorted during their walk in unobstructed clinic hallways and encouraged to walk at a comfortable, purposeful pace. In total, this condition amounted to 5 sit-to-stand transitions, 10 minutes of walking time, and a 3.3% reduction in sitting time compared to the 5-hr sitting control condition. This condition was designed to test the outcomes of hourly sitting interruptions consisting of short walking bouts that, if practiced across a whole day, would amount to meeting PA guidelines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stand More. Participants completed 10 minutes of standing every hour throughout the 5-hr active protocol period. Participants stood keeping their hips, legs and feet still on a modestly padded mat. They were permitted small, brief stretching movements of their upper body without lowering their head below waist level, and they had access to a standing desk to facilitate their continued work/reading/game activity while standing. In total, this condition amounted to 5 sit-to-stand transitions, 50 minutes of standing time, and a 17% reduction in sitting time compared to the 5-hr control condition. This condition was designed to test the outcomes of hourly sitting interruptions consisting of standing bout lengths that would be feasible in daily life for older adults and that, when practiced across the day, would amount to the greatest reduction in sitting time compared to the other interruption conditions.

FMD is a well-validated method used to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to an acute period of blood flow restriction and FMD is a sensitive predictor of atherosclerotic risk [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Arterial dilation is a healthy endothelial function response after release of acute blood flow restriction. The FMD procedure was conducted by an experienced vascular sonographer and analyzed by a board-certified physician with an expertise in ultrasound techniques. The FMD protocol was modeled after previously published studies [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, each FMD study was performed with the participant seated upright in the study chair, in a dark, quiet and climate controlled (22&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) condition. A 5 x 84 cm BP cuff was placed on the participant&#x02019;s right thigh, 7&#x02013;8 cm above the knee joint, distal to the site of ultrasound capture. Ultrasound images were obtained with a 2-D high-resolution ultrasound system (Phillips HD15 PureWave) using a 5&#x02013;12 MHz multi-frequency linear-array transducer. The SFA was scanned with the ultrasound probe and a location with clear anterior and posterior intimal interfaces was selected. Landmarks were placed on the participant&#x02019;s skin to ensure similar placement of the transducer for each of the 2 FMD studies conducted on the same day. In addition to imaging the arterial dimensions, Doppler ultrasound was used to measure SFA blood velocity as previously published [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>SFA diameter images and Doppler measurements of blood velocity were continuously recorded for 5 seconds at baseline prior to cuff inflation. The BP cuff was then rapidly inflated 220&#x02013;250 mmHg systolic BP and maintained for 5min until cuff deflation. SFA diameter and blood velocity recordings resumed at cuff deflation and continued for 5min. Ultrasound images were obtained throughout the 5 minutes of the FMD study and stored as &#x0201c;.avi&#x0201d; files. Off-line analysis of SFA diameters was performed using automated edge-detector software (Brachial Analyzer, Medical Imaging Applications, LLC, Coralville, IA, USA) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This software allows the sonographer to determine the region of interest where the near and far vessel walls have the greatest clarity. The same vessel location on the participant was used for measurements throughout each study visit. Analyzed images were reviewed by the sonographer and edited as needed to ensure that diameter measurements were performed at an optimal location, intima-lumen interface at the near and far vessel wall. The peak SFA dilation after cuff deflation was presented as a percentage change from baseline diameter, % FMD: [(peak &#x02212; baseline diameter)/baseline diameter&#x000d7;100] using raw data and after allometric scaling. Sitting protocol condition effects on FMD were assessed using a ratio of the end-of-study measurement FMD 2 (F<sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188544.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) divided by the baseline measurement FMD 1 (F<sub>1</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188544.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

Because it was a pilot study, no attempt was made to power the experiment to detect statistically significant differences in the various outcomes. However, our analytic methods test statistical significance within this small sample size. We used a mixed model to examine associations between condition and each of the outcomes, specifically, a random intercept model with a compound symmetry covariance structure. Eleven repeated measures of glucose, insulin, SBP, DBP, and heart rate collected during the 5-hr condition periods were used for analyses and graphed. For each participant and visit, the net incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of the 11 measures was calculated using a trapezoidal rule [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], providing 4 iAUC estimates (one per condition) for each participant. Measurement #2 at time 0hr was used as baseline for iAUC calculations. These 4 iAUC values (one per condition) were the repeated measures outcome in the mixed models, with condition and baseline outcome level as fixed effects and subject-level random intercept. Statistical significance was assessed using Wald tests. In exploratory studies, separate iAUC values for the first 2 hours of each of the 2 post-meal periods (study period time intervals 0hr-2hr and 3hr-5hr) were also calculated and the above mixed model analyses was repeated for these period-specific iAUCs. The ratio of FMD 2 (afternoon measurement) to FMD 1 (baseline, morning measurement) was used to calculate condition-specific change in arterial dilation response to acute flow restriction. Mixed model analysis was conducted for FMD ratio (afternoon to morning). Statisticians were blinded to the interruption condition types during all analyses. Statistical software used was R. Bonferroni correction of <italic>p</italic>-values was applied to account for multiple testing in the 3- and 4-arm comparisons using a type 1 error cut-off of &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.05. Thus, as noted in respective figure legends, a statistically significant cut-off for 3-arm comparisons was p&#x0003c; 0.0167 (e.g., p&#x0003c;0.05/3) and a statistically significant cut-off for 4-arm comparisons was p&#x0003c; 0.0125 (e.g., p&#x0003c;0.05/4).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec018"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec019"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Ten participants were enrolled in the study and nine participants completed all 4 sitting protocol conditions.

This study was not powered to assess outcome measures but analytic methods were used to test statistical significance within this small sample size. Our pilot study design of 3 sitting interruption modalities incorporating brief standing and walking in sedentary, overweight postmenopausal women yielded results that were suggestive of modality-specific, positive impact on glucoregulatory outcomes and, with respect to the 10-minute standing every hour condition, significantly effective on vascular outcomes relative to prolonged sitting. Participants in our study had a mean age of 66 years and, on average, were obese with central adiposity and impaired glycemic control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188544.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, our study sample is reflective of a population that has significantly elevated risk for cardiovascular disease and for type 2 diabetes and its complications [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recruitment, protocol delivery, and measurement were all feasible and acceptable to study participants. This laboratory study, conducted in at risk, sedentary postmenopausal women, employed prolonged sitting interruption strategies that could be feasible in daily life for this age group.</p><p>Previous laboratory studies of glucoregulatory outcomes in participants who were generally younger and more active than participants involved in our study, showed that walking at various intensities were related to improved postprandial glucose and insulin responses compared to the control sitting condition [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A recent study has shown postprandial glucoregulatory and lipid metabolism benefits in postmenopausal women practicing brief standing or walking breaks (5-minute breaks every 30 minutes&#x02019; of sitting)[<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Other laboratory studies, conducted in participants younger and more active than those involved in our study as well as those who are overweight/obese and/or who have type 2 diabetes, have shown that low- to moderate-intensity walking breaks improve fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] outcomes associated with acute bouts of prolonged sitting. No previous study has tested interruptions as brief or as modest in intensity as those in our study design. Such brief, modest-intensity interruptions may be beneficial for older adults at high risk for CVD, but not other population groups. For example, in contrast to our study results, studies in young, non-obese participants showed that brief standing breaks in prolonged sitting did not lead to improved postprandial glycemic responses [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and that brief walking breaks in prolonged sitting did not improve endothelial function but prevented sitting-induced impairment [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Although we did not observe any statistically significant, interruption condition-specific differences in postprandial glucoregulatory response for iAUC compared to the control condition in our pilot study, we did observe a trend for glucose and insulin iAUC improvement during the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes condition. In exploratory studies, both the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes and the 2-minute walking every hour conditions were associated with significant glucose-lowering during the second meal period (post-lunch glucose iAUC lower than post-breakfast iAUC). Our study design is a randomized controlled cross-over trial so, these meal period-specific impacts may be due to compounding benefits that the interruptions might have across the day, which manifest significantly after 3+ hours of practice. The start time of the post-lunch study period is associated with a 3-hour accumulation of 9 sit-to-stand transitions in the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes condition, 6 minutes of walking in the 2-minute walking every hour condition, and 30 minutes of standing time in the 10-minute standing every hour condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188544.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Head down bed rest studies also suggest that duration, condition-type, and accumulated number of standing or walking bout interruptions are moderators of physiological benefit [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additional studies in a larger sample size are needed to further explore this observation and possible mechanisms. Overall, our results suggest that regular interruptions of sitting throughout the day are needed to generate maximal glucoregulatory benefits. Our current study results are supported by a recent cross-sectional study of ours showing that great numbers of sit-to-stand transitions accumulated throughout the day are associated with lower fasting insulin and lower insulin resistance a similar demographic population [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our current study sample (sedentary, older, overweight or obese women) are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and for type 2 diabetes and its complications; thus, any method that improves postprandial glucose and insulin responses in this population could have clinically meaningful results if practiced regularly.</p><p>We also observed that the 10-minute standing every hour condition resulted in acutely improved endothelial functioning compared to the control condition, using both raw and allometrically scaled data. This suggests that reducing sitting time by only 17% can acutely improve vascular function in a sedentary population with high cardiovascular risk. Further, it indicates that extended postural change, e.g., standing for 10 minutes, but not shorter periods of postural change, e.g., walking or standing for only 2 minutes per bout, can improve SFA FMD. One possible mechanism by which FMD is improved with 10-minute standing every hour is through extended compensatory changes in blood pressure (BP) and vascular tone that occur with standing that would persist during each standing bout. Additionally, standing bout-induced gravitational blood flow would increase shear stress which can reduce oxidative stress in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and result in improved FMD. Additional studies are needed to determine the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which acute interruptions of prolonged sitting benefit this study population. Thosar, et al. and others [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have shown that endothelial functioning, also assessed by SFA FMD, is acutely damped by a 3-hour bout of prolonged sitting and that light walking interruptions (5 minutes at 2 miles per hour each hour) during this sitting time prevent that endothelial dysfunction. We found no evidence that a 5-hour bout of prolonged sitting leads to impaired endothelial dysfunction in our pilot study population. Previous studies, however, enrolled a sample of healthy, active young men, different from our sample of overweight or obese, older-age women. Extended sitting might be less routine in younger, active populations and, therefore, more detrimental to them. In our population of women who each regularly sit for 6 or more hours, no detrimental impact was observed. We specifically selected our population sample because it represents those in greatest need of feasible and effective sitting interruption modalities to improve cardiometabolic aspects of healthy aging [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Significantly elevated DBP observed in the 2-minute walking every hour condition compared to the control condition may be the residual effect of a normal, PA-induced increase in BP that does not rebound quickly in our sample of sedentary older women. One study of overweight/obese adults (average age 53.8 years) observed that a sitting interruption of 2 minutes light- or moderate-intensity walking every 20 minutes resulted in decreased SBP and DBP compared to a control sitting condition [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The women in our study, who normally sit for many hours each day, did not exhibit adverse BP effects during the control prolonged sitting condition, whereas young active group in the aforementioned study was adversely affected. Again, this difference may be due to differences in blood vessel functioning between the two study populations, sample size, or to protocol design.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that healthy aging-related benefits associated with improved vascular function and glucose regulation can be realized acutely by breaking up prolonged sitting time with simple, practical interruptions including frequent, brief sit-to-stand transitions, hourly brief walking breaks, and hourly replacement of sitting time with short bouts of standing. Nearly all participants in our study thought they could practice each of these sitting interruption modalities in their daily lives. A key finding from our study is that the 10-minute standing every hour condition led to improved endothelial functioning compared to the control condition. In addition, exploratory studies showed that the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes condition and the 2-minute walking every hour condition significantly reduced the glycemic response to the second meal. This pilot study suggests that different sitting interruption modalities will have different vascular and glucoregulatory outcomes. Similarly, head down bed rest studies demonstrate that standing and walking breaks can have differential benefits that vary by physiological outcome measure and that are more pronounced with accumulated exposures [<xref rid="pone.0188544.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Feasibility, vascular, and suggestive glucoregulatory outcomes of this pilot study support the need for fully-powered, randomized controlled trials in this population. In general, larger laboratory and real-world intervention studies of pragmatic and effective methods to improve health outcomes through sitting habits change are needed in older adults, men and women, and in age groups across the life-span and activity levels. Furthermore, given that each condition in our study affected different outcomes to different degrees, multiple mechanisms, i.e., both glucoregulatory and vascular, should be explored concurrently in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188544.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Randomization order of protocol conditions per participant.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188544.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188544.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Exploratory analyses of first and second meal postprandial glucose and insulin.</title><p>Postprandial glucose (Panel A) and insulin (Panel B) iAUC averaged across the initial 2-hr post-breakfast period (0hr-2hr, diagonal stripe bars) and the 2-hr post-lunch period (3hr-5hr, horizontal stripe bars). n = 10 for the control, 2-minute walking every hour, and 10-minute standing every hour conditions; n = 9 for the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes condition. p-value for within-condition comparison of 2-hr post-lunch period vs. the 2-hr post-breakfast period. * Statistically significant after Bonferroni correction.
