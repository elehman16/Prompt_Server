Few data are available to understand which of the therapeutic alternatives is the most effective for patients with insomnia, especially for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Chinese herbal medicine, as a typical TCM, is one of the most popular complementary and alternative therapies for insomnia. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Chaihuguizhiganjiang-suanzaoren granule (CSG), a Chinese herbal medicine treatment, in patients with primary insomnia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomised controlled clinical trial. A total of 258 participants are randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group or the placebo group. The intervention group receives CSG and the placebo group receives a placebo granule. The patients receive either CSG or placebo two times daily for 8&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes include the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Total Sleep Time (TST) and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The assessment is performed at baseline (before randomisation), 4, 8 and 12&#x02005;weeks after randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University (reference: 2014BL-003-01). The trial will be helpful in identifying the efficacy and safety of CSG in patients with primary insomnia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN22001145; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ORAL MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Insomnia is a highly prevalent, often debilitating and economically burdensome sleep disorder.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The prevalence of at least one type of insomnia was 9.2% in rural and urban regions of Beijing, China; the rates of difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep and early morning awakening were 7.0%, 8.0% and 4.9%, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The literature suggests that relationships exist between insomnia and major depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, suicide, decreased immune functioning and cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Treatment options for chronic insomnia include pharmacological therapy and non-pharmacological therapy. Pharmacological therapy, particularly benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines, is widely prescribed for insomnia, but its role in the management of chronic insomnia is uncertain because of the long-term efficacy and potential for abuse, dependence and adverse effects.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Psychological and behavioural therapies of insomnia, including relaxation training, paradoxical intention, stimulus control, sleep restriction and cognitive therapy, are supported by empirical evidence. Among these treatments for insomnia, multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy is effective in the short and long terms with few apparent side effects.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Currently, a proportion of patients with insomnia worldwide resort to various kinds of complementary and alternative medicine. In 2002, a national survey in the USA showed that 4.5% of adults reported using some form of complementary and alternative medicine to treat insomnia or trouble sleeping.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), as one of the most popular complementary and alternative therapies of insomnia, either in single herb or in herbal formula, has been commonly used for treating insomnia in Asian countries. Systematic reviews reported that the effects of Chinese herbal medicine were similar to Western medication and placebo. Owing to the poor methodological quality of the studies and the small number of trials included in meta-analyses, these systematic reviews conclude that the current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of CHM for insomnia.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> There is a clear need for further research in this area.</p><p>According to the theory of typical Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), all the related symptoms and signs in a certain disease phase are generalised to a syndrome (&#x02018;Zheng&#x02019; in Chinese medicine), which is the basic unit and a key concept of TCM.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Patients with insomnia can be divided into different syndromes (ie, different Zhengs). In the diagnosis of insomnia, the &#x02018;spleen deficient and liver heat syndrome&#x02019; is the main subtype diagnosed from the viewpoint of TCM and our previous clinical practice.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, we consider &#x02018;Harmonizing liver and spleen&#x02019; as the main principle of treatment. Chaihuguizhiganjiang decoctions are a type of Traditional Chinese Medicine chronicled in Shang Han Lun. Suanzaoren decoctions have a long history of use as part of the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia first documented in the classical Chinese text Jin Gui Yao Lue (essential prescriptions from the golden cabinet) in approximately 210 A.D. by Zhong-Jing Zhang. According to classic theory, Chaihuguizhiganjiang decoctions are beneficial for eliminating liver heat syndrome, while suanzaoren decoctions aid in replenishing the spleen. Together, these two classical compounds cooperate to nourish the spleen and clear liver heat. Tan Y reported that Chaihuguizhiganjiang decoctions plus acupuncture had remarkable effects on improving sleep quality.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A population-based study mentioned that suanzaoren decoctions are the most commonly used Chinese herbal products that were coadministered with hypnotic drugs in treating insomnia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, despite the popular use of Chaihuguizhiganjiang decoctions and suanzaoren decoctions, there is little scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of the clinical use of both. In our preclinical observation, we evaluated 50 patients with primary insomnia with spleen deficiency and liver heat syndrome by sleep diary recording bedtime, rise time, total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Compared with baseline, there were significant differences for total sleep time (p=0.03) and sleep efficiency (p=0.04) after 8&#x02005;weeks treatment. We found that Chaihuguizhiganjiang decoctions in combination with suanzaoren decoctions were effective in sleep quality improvement in patients with insomnia with few adverse events (data unpublished). The aim of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Chaihuguizhiganjiang-suanzaoren granule (CSG) in patients with primary insomnia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study is performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/WHO Good Clinical Practice standards (GCP) including certification by an external audit and has been approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University (reference: 2014BL-003-01). This trial has been registered with ISRCTN at Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN 22001145) on 15 May 2014. At the beginning of the study, we prepared for making case report forms and training the relevant researchers. After all of these preparations were completed, a recruitment poster was displayed outside of clinics in September 2014. Therefore, the first patient was finally recruited on 3 September 2014. Before randomisation, all patients are requested to sign a written informed consent. They are also given enough time to decide whether they are willing to participate in the trial or prefer other treatment options.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 258 patients are recruited from three centres: the Department of Psychosomatic medicine, Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine affiliated to Capital Medical University, the Department of Encephalopathy, Dongfang Hospital affiliated to Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Department of Insomnia, Depression, and Anxiety, Dongzhimen Hospital affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine.

One is to display recruitment posters outside the clinics. The posters contain brief introductions about the population needed, the free Chinese herbal medicine treatments offered to eligible participants, and the contact information of the researcher. The other is to recruit participants in outpatient clinics from the Department of Psychosomatic medicine, Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine affiliated to Capital Medical University, the Department of Encephalopathy, Dongfang Hospital affiliated to Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Department of Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety, Dongzhimen Hospital affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Participants are included if they are aged between 18 and 65&#x02005;years, of either sex, fulfil the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- Fourth Edition criteria for primary insomnia,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the TCM syndrome pattern criteria (pattern of spleen deficiency and liver heat syndrome), present with a primary complaint of sleep difficulties for at least 1&#x02005;month, have sleep difficulties for more than 3&#x02005;days during the last week, and give written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Criteria for exclusion are insomnia caused by drugs, alcohol, pain or physical and mental illness, a self-rating anxiety scale &#x02265;60<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or self-rating depression scale &#x02265;63,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> an ongoing alcohol or substance abuse problem, a history of stroke or coronary heart disease, women in pregnancy or lactation or without contraception, an abnormal liver function and heavy somatic disease, or by participating in other clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Handling of withdrawal and data management</title><p>Participants may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. If any patients wish to withdraw, clinicians should ask whether they would be willing to complete the assessments according to the study schedule and write down their last time of taking the medicine. Incidences of patient loss to follow-up and withdrawal will be recorded and reported. Patients in the placebo group could withdraw from the study if they are determined as requiring withdrawal based on disease progression, serious complications, or if they voluntarily quit. The data collected in this trial comprises information recorded in case report forms. When every visit is completed at each centre, data will be entered using the double entry method.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Concomitant treatments and forbidden drugs</title><p>This trial is not to be combined with any of the following interventions, including other sleep medications (such as zolpidem, zopiclone, alprazolam), antipsychotics, antidepressants, drugs acting on the central nervous system, and any healthcare products or food and beverages that may cause insomnia or hypnotic effects. It is acceptable for patients to have taken other drugs that do not affect the central nervous system before the trial. The dosage, duration and name of any concomitant treatment or medication must be recorded carefully in the CRFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Interventions</title><p>Study interventions are developed in a consensus process with TCM experts, and performed by three trained and licensed TCM doctors who are qualified for at least 5&#x02005;years. One researcher (JZ) trains the doctors in the study procedures to monitor compliance with the protocol throughout the study. All patients go through a standardised interview and receive more information about the study and treatments. After obtaining informed consent from each participant and completing a baseline evaluation, patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are randomised to one of two treatment groups: the intervention group, which receives CSG, or the placebo group, which receives the granule of placebo. The TCM granules are compound preparations of Chinese herbs, and their main components are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008459TB1">table 1</xref>. The placebo granule is composed by 5% of CSG and 95% starch. The colour is made identical to that of CSG by adding artificial pigment. The placebo granule is similar to the intervention group in the aspects of colour, taste, smell and package.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015008459TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Main components of traditional Chinese medicine treatment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Latin name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amount (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chaihu</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Bupleurum chinense</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Guizhi</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Cinnamon Twig</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ganjiang</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Dried Ginger</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tianhuafen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Radix Trichosanthis</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Muli</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Calcined Oyste</italic>r</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Huangqin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Scutellaria</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Danshen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chenpi</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Citrus reticulata Blanco</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chaosuanzaoren</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ziziphus jujuba</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fuling</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Poria Cocos</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chuanxiong</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Zhimu</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Anemarrhena aspodeloidea</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Zhigancao</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All test drug packages are dispensed and reclaimed by trained research nurses (JY, J-LW, M-MW) in each centre.

The first level is for the case number corresponding to groups (group A and group B), and the second level is for the group corresponding to the intervention (the intervention and placebo groups). The numbers are kept in opaque sealed envelopes. The double levels of blinding are sealed separately and given to the leader of the clinical research.

The results of this study may generate scientific and rigorous evidence for CSG in patients with primary insomnia.</p><p>In TCM theory, different Chinese clinicians possess different ideas on diagnosis and treatment. One or more than one core prescription could therefore possibly be obtained. In this case, the question is raised regarding whether the explored core prescription can be generalised from the current study. The spleen deficiency and liver-qi stagnation transforming into fire is a principal pathogenesis of insomnia based on TCM theory. Some factors such as chronic fatigue, mental stress and emotional tension cause the deficiency of spleen and liver. This leads to metabolic disorders of qi-blood and body fluids and disturbance of Zang fu functions, causing the occurrence of insomnia. Therefore, we propose to treat insomnia according to the principle of harmonic liver and spleen.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. One limitation is the absence of polysomnographic sleep parameters. Our study relies only on su+bjective sleep outcomes, which mainly are assessments of patient reports of improved sleep and well-being. Future studies are needed to address these issues. Another limitation is that decoctions are used in preclinical trials, but granule is applied in this study. However, compared with decoctions, granules are more convenient for patients in the study, and patient compliance may be increased. In addition, when we started to design our study protocol, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) had not been published. We decide to use DSM-IV according to prepublished trials. Compared with DSM-IV, DSM-5 shifts towards more data-driven diagnostic criteria, general applicable scope, diagnostic precision improving, emphasising on using biomarkers. In our future studies, DSM-5 will be used to diagnose insomnia disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The trial is sponsored by Beijing Municipal Science &#x00026; Technology Commission (China) (ref: Z131100006813002).
