</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein primarily found on B lymphocytes. Used in the treatment of almost all B cell-related malignancies and autoimmune diseases, rituximab works by depleting CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that &#x02018;innovator rituximab&#x02019; (hereafter abbreviated as RTX) is an effective treatment for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when used in combination with methotrexate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This combination is recommended for RA patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The development of biologic drugs such as rituximab has expanded the therapeutic options for RA and markedly improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">As patents for a number of biologics have reached or approach expiration, interest in the development of biosimilar drugs has increased. The term &#x02018;biosimilar&#x02019; refers to a follow-on drug with proven physiochemical, biological, immunochemical, and clinical similarity to its &#x02018;innovator&#x02019; biologic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Before regulatory approval of a biosimilar is considered, a rigorous comparability testing program must be undertaken to prove similarity with its innovator drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Even after approval for clinical use from regulatory bodies, some concerns about widespread use of biosimilars still exist. A particularly common question is whether patients currently treated with an innovator biologic can be switched to a less expensive biosimilar without affecting treatment efficacy or safety.</p><p id="Par9">CT-P10 is a biosimilar of RTX and shares an identical primary structure. CT-P10 and RTX are also highly similar with regard to their higher-order structures, post-translational modifications, and biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A phase I RCT in RA patients (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01534884) demonstrated the pharmacokinetic equivalence of CT-P10 and RTX over 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The RCT also showed that these drugs had comparable efficacy and safety when patients were followed for up to 72&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CT-P10 is the first rituximab biosimilar to receive market authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is approved for use in all indications held by RTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Here we report the results of a multicenter, single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) study that enrolled patients with RA who had completed the phase I RCT described earlier. In this OLE study, all patients were assessed for eligibility for retreatment with CT-P10 and followed for up to 56 additional weeks. The key objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of CT-P10 in patients with RA who received CT-P10 from the outset (i.e., from the start of the RCT and also in the OLE) with those who received RTX during the RCT and switched to CT-P10 during the OLE. In addition, the longer-term efficacy and safety of CT-P10 was investigated in RA patients in the maintenance group who were treated with the biosimilar for up to 104&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par11">As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the preceding phase I RCT recruited patients with active RA aged 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years who had been diagnosed according to the revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification for at least 6&#x000a0;months and had shown an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF therapy. Additional inclusion criteria for this OLE study included disease improvement during the last course of treatment in the RCT [according to Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) combined with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) or serum C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP)], and completion of all scheduled visits in that study with no major protocol violations.

In the preceding phase I RCT, patients with active RA were randomized 2:1 to receive CT-P10 (CELLTRION, Inc., Incheon, Republic of Korea) or RTX (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) alongside continued methotrexate therapy. Patients received one or two courses of treatment during the RCT, with each course comprising two intravenous infusions of 1000&#x000a0;mg of CT-P10 or RTX separated by a 2-week interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Patients were screened for the OLE study within 8&#x000a0;weeks of their last visit following the first or second course of treatment in the RCT (up to week 48 or 72 of the RCT, respectively). The OLE study had a maximum duration of 56&#x000a0;weeks and the maximum combined duration of both studies was 104&#x000a0;weeks. Eligible patients entered the monitoring period of the OLE study in which their eligibility for CT-P10 infusion was assessed every 8&#x000a0;weeks&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14&#x000a0;days [Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Online Resource&#x000a0;1]. Patients were eligible to receive a course of CT-P10 treatment during the OLE if (1) they had responded to the previous course of treatment but disease activity had then worsened during the monitoring period (DAS28-ESR or DAS28-CRP response worsened by &#x02265;20% vs. the best response during weeks 16&#x02013;24 of the previous treatment course); and (2) their B&#x000a0;cell or immunoglobulin (Ig)M levels were equal to or higher than the lower limit of normal or &#x02265;50% of the baseline level (week 0 of the RCT). Patients received up to two courses of treatment during the OLE, each consisting of two intravenous infusions of CT-P10 (1000&#x000a0;mg) 2&#x000a0;weeks apart. As in the preceding RCT, methotrexate (10&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg/week orally or parenterally) and folic acid (&#x02265;5&#x000a0;mg/week orally) were co-administered throughout the study and patients received methylprednisolone, an antipyretic, and an antihistamine 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min before each infusion. CT-P10 was not administered after week 80. All patients had an end-of-study visit between weeks 96 and 104 unless they withdrew from the study earlier. In the OLE, patients who received CT-P10 during the RCT and OLE were termed the &#x02018;maintenance&#x02019; group, while those who received RTX during the preceding RCT and then CT-P10 during the OLE were termed the &#x02018;switch&#x02019; group.</p><p id="Par14">All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the OLE study which was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH) guidelines.

At week 24 of the preceding RCT, comparable clinical responses were observed between patients who were subsequently enrolled in the OLE and patients that were not, implying that non-responders were not selectively excluded from the OLE. During the OLE study, the efficacy of treatment&#x02014;as measured by DAS28 scores and EULAR responses&#x02014;was highly similar between the maintenance and switch groups. Adverse event profiles were also comparable between the groups and were consistent with the known safety profile of RTX. Overall, switching from RTX to CT-P10 did not appear to adversely affect the efficacy or safety of treatment when patients with RA were followed for up to 56&#x000a0;weeks after switching.</p><p id="Par25">Data from the maintenance arm of this study demonstrated the longer-term efficacy of treatment with CT-P10 following repeated courses of treatment. During the first course of treatment in the RCT preceding this study, mean changes from baseline in DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP at week 24 in the CT-P10 arm were &#x02212;2.1 and &#x02212;1.9, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this OLE, these values in the maintenance group were &#x02212;2.7 and &#x02212;2.2, respectively. Previous reports have shown that repeated treatment with RTX provided similarly sustained efficacy in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a post hoc analysis of the REFLEX (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Efficacy of Rituximab in RA) trial and its OLE study, the mean change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 24 of the third course of RTX treatment (&#x02212;2.99) was comparable with that in the maintenance group of the current study (&#x02212;2.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The proportion of patients in the maintenance group with a good/moderate EULAR-ESR response at 24&#x000a0;weeks after two to three courses of CT-P10 treatment was 78.9%. This compares with 88.8% observed at week 24 after three courses of RTX in REFLEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The good/moderate EULAR-ESR response rate observed in the current study was an improvement on that observed after one course in the CT-P10 group of the preceding RCT (73.0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and comparable with week 24 after the first treatment course of RTX in REFLEX (77.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, there are limitations to comparing these studies as results from REFLEX were from the observational post hoc analysis of the original 24-week RCT and many patients were withdrawn from the study following the first course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">CT-P10 was well-tolerated during this study and showed a safety profile at least as favorable as that observed following multiple courses of RTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Importantly, there were no noticeable differences in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events between the maintenance and switch groups. Of note, infusion-related reactions occurred in one patient in each treatment group, suggesting that switching from RTX to its biosimilar did not increase the likelihood of these events. In the maintenance group, cumulative exposure to CT-P10 did not increase the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events. On the contrary, during the first course of treatment in the preceding phase I RCT, the proportion of CT-P10-treated patients experiencing at least one adverse event (including events unrelated to treatment), infection, or infusion-related reaction was 51.0, 23.5, and 16.7%, respectively; this compares with 23.7, 7.9, and 2.6% in the OLE maintenance group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events has also been observed with repeated RTX treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The proportion of patients with ADAs or NAbs at week 24 was similar between maintenance and switch groups in the current study [ADAs: 5 (13.2%) and 3 (15.0%); NAbs: 1 (2.6%) and 0, respectively]. The eight patients who were ADA-positive at week&#x000a0;24 all had pre-existing ADAs before treatment in the OLE. The presence of ADAs in these patients did not appear to impact treatment efficacy or safety; all except one patient (maintenance group) demonstrated a good or moderate EULAR response at week 24 of the first treatment course of the OLE and none experienced infusion-related reactions or infections.</p><p id="Par28">Limitations of the current study include the fact that it was not powered to formally assess the efficacy or safety equivalence of switching from RTX to CT-P10 versus maintained treatment with CT-P10. Also, due to the study&#x02019;s relatively small size, it was not possible to include an additional control group of patients who were maintained on RTX. An OLE study of an ongoing phase III trial of CT-P10 in RA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02149121) will compare efficacy and safety between patients maintained on RTX and those patients switching from RTX to CT-P10.</p><p id="Par29">In this study, no detrimental effects on efficacy or safety were observed following the switch from RTX to CT-P10. This finding concurs with other biosimilar switching studies involving relatively &#x02018;simpler&#x02019; and lower molecular-weight biosimilars such as the epoetins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of treatment were not affected when patients with RA or ankylosing spondylitis previously treated with the anti-TNF agent infliximab were switched to its biosimilar CT-P13 in two OLE studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The absence of adverse switching effects in most studies reported to date is likely a result of manufacturers following the strict guidelines imposed during biosimilar development by the EMA, the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">This study demonstrated that switching from RTX to CT-P10 had no notable impact on the efficacy or safety of treatment in this population of patients with RA. Comparable improvements in RA disease activity and response rates were observed in patients who continued CT-P10 treatment in this OLE study and also in those who had switched from RTX to CT-P10. In addition, CT-P10 was shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with active RA treated repeatedly with this biosimilar for up to 2&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
