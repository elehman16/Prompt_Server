composite resin bond strength to human enamel restored after tooth bleaching. </p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Forty human teeth specimens measuring 5x5 mm were prepared and randomly allocated
into 5 groups with 8 specimens each: Gct (control group, restored on unbleached
enamel); Gbl (restored immediately after bleaching); Gsa (bleached, treated with
10% sodium ascorbate gel for 60 min and restored); G7d (bleached, exposed to

exposed to saliva <italic>in situ</italic> for 14 days and restored). Restored
samples were cut into 0.8 mm<sup>2</sup> sticks that were tested in microtensile.
Specimens were microscopically analyzed and failure modes were classified as
adhesive, cohesive, or mixed. Pretest and cohesive failures were not considered in
the statistical analysis, which was performed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's

dental offices for tooth-bleaching treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup>. Despite the esthetic benefits brought to patients, it has been
demonstrated that bleaching agents might have a negative influence on the integrity of
organic enamel structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. Mineral loss, increased surface
roughness, decreased microhardness, decreased fracture toughness, and reduced enamel
microtensile strength, which can result in decreased bond strength to enamel by up to
75% immediately after bleaching, have already been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. Changes in the amount, length, and
morphology of resin tags observed in studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
suggest decreased penetration of resin materials into bleached enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>. Clinically, this decrease is important
as bleaching is often performed as a preliminary esthetic treatment on teeth to be
reconstructed with adhesive techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Enamel surface alterations after tooth bleaching, such as those mentioned above, have
been found to be more pronounced under <italic>in vitro</italic> than in <italic>in
situ</italic> settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>. This finding is attributed to the
ability of saliva to prevent such alterations in the dental structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup>, and suggests the reversibility of
bleaching-related changes. By placing bleached teeth under the direct influence of human
saliva, the effects of salivary antioxidants on enamel can be better observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. Hence, <italic>in situ</italic>
methodologies have been used to estimate the time needed to reverse bleaching-related
effects on enamel bonding, and to determine how soon after bleaching teeth can be
restored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup>. Some authors have
postulated a waiting period ranging from 24 hours to 3 weeks before performing bonding
procedures after bleaching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>, while others have suggested a waiting period of 7 days for
enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup> and 14 days for
dentin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in some
clinical situations, patients may not be able to wait to have their teeth rehabilitated.
In order to permit immediate restorations after bleaching, several researchers have
attempted the use of different antioxidant agents prior to performing restorative
procedures, among which sodium ascorbate has shown promising results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the debate on how to more adequately deal with the different clinical demands
of patients who undergo teeth-whitening and their need for rehabilitation afterwards is
still open. In order to shed some more light on the issue, the objective of the present
comparative study was to evaluate the influence of different exposure times to saliva
<italic>in situ</italic> and a treatment with 10% sodium ascorbate gel on composite
bond strength to human enamel after bleaching.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the State University of Maring&#x000e1; Research Ethics Committee
(protocol 609/2009). Volunteers provided their written informed consent before
participating in the study.</p><sec><title>Dental specimen preparation</title><p>Fifty sound extracted human teeth (premolars and molars) were cleaned with
periodontal curettes and ultrasound, submitted to prophylaxis with pumice and
water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>, and stored in 2%
formaldehyde solution (pH 7.0) between 30 to 50 days. An enamel block specimen
measuring 5x5 mm was obtained from the flattest portion of each tooth (proximal face
for premolars and vestibular or proximal face for molars) with a diamond disc
(Diamond Wheel 012" x fine, South Bay Technology Inc, CA, USA) adapted to a
sectioning machine (Isomet 1000, Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) at low speed, under
water cooling. To facilitate their handling during subsequent stages, specimens were
kept with a minimum height of 3.1 mm. After inspection under optical microscopy 20X
(BEL MicroImage Analyzer, Bel Photonics, Monza, Milano, Italy), 10 specimens
presenting cracks, fractures or stains were excluded from the study.</p><p>Before their use in the experiment, specimens were ultrasound-washed with distilled
water for 10 min, dried with jets of air, and randomly allocated into 5 experimental
groups with 8 specimens each: Gct (unbleached specimens restored with composite
resin); Gbl (specimens restored immediately after bleaching); Gsa (bleached specimens
treated with sodium ascorbate gel for 60 min before restoration); G7d (bleached
specimens restored after being exposed to saliva <italic>in situ</italic> for 7
days); and G14d (bleached specimens restored after being exposed to saliva <italic>in

wax (Cera utilidade rosa Epoxiglass, Epoxiglass Ind. Com. de Produtos Qu&#x000ed;micos Ltda.,
Diadema, SP, Brazil) placed on a glass sheet in such a way as to expose the enamel
surface. A thin layer (1 mm) of 37.5% hydrogen peroxide-based bleaching gel
(Pollaoffice +, SDI Limited, Bayswater, Victoria, Australia) was applied over the
enamel surface. After 8 minutes, the gel was removed with a fine tipped suction
device (Sug-Plast, DFL Ind&#x000fa;stria e Com&#x000e9;rcio S.A., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) and
reapplied. This procedure was repeated 4 times, totaling 5 applications. Specimens
were in contact with the product for a total of 40 min, after which they were rinsed
with jets of water for 30 seconds, and dried with compressed air.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment with sodium ascorbate</title><p>Still fixed to the plate of pink wax, bleached specimens assigned to Gsa were treated
with 10% sodium ascorbate gel (pH 7) manipulated according to Kimyai and
Valizadeh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> (2006) shortly
before its application, and placed into a chamber with 100% humidity for 60 minutes.
After this period specimens were rinsed with jets of water for 30 seconds, and dried
with compressed air.</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure to saliva in situ</title><p>To evaluate the effect of exposure time to human saliva on composite bond strength to
bleached enamel, 3 volunteers (two female and one male) were selected. The inclusion
criteria were normal salivary flow, absence of caries or periodontal diseases,
non-pregnant women, and absence of systemic disorders; while the exclusion criteria
were smokers and current use of orthodontic appliances or fixed or removable
dentures. Alginate impressions (Jeltrate Dustless, Dentsply, York, PA, USA) of the
maxillary arches were taken, and plaster models (Durone IV, Dentsply, York, PA, USA)
were prepared for each volunteer. Polyvinyl siloxane blocks (Elite HD+, Zhermack
Clinical, Badia Polesine, Rovigo, Italy) measuring 5.5x5.5x5.5 mm were bonded to the
palatal area of the plaster models with a cyanoacrylate-based glue (Super Bonder,
Loctite, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). The plaster models were then isolated and intraoral
palatal devices were fabricated in acrylic resin (JET, Cl&#x000e1;ssico Artigos Odontol&#x000f3;gicos
Ltda., Campo Limpo Paulista, SP, Brazil). The 16 specimens to be assessed <italic>in
situ</italic> (G7d and G14d) were fixed with sticky wax (Cera utilidade Asfer,
ASFER - Ind&#x000fa;stria Qu&#x000ed;mica Ltda., S&#x000e3;o Caetano do Sul, SP, Brazil) to the cavities left
by the polyvinyl siloxane blocks in the intraoral palatal devices (5 in two models
and 6 in one). To make sure that bleached specimens would be in clear contact with
the oral cavity, they were fixed in such a way that the enamel surfaces would
coincide with that of the acrylic device.</p><p>Each volunteer received their palatal device and were instructed to use it throughout
the day and night. It could only be removed during meals, when ingesting liquids
(except water), or when cleaning their teeth. When removed from the mouth, the
devices were stored in a container with gauze imbibed in distilled water. Volunteers
were instructed to clean their palatal devices under running water only, and to avoid
any contact with fluoride-containing solutions. On the morning of the eighth day,
eight specimens (G7d) were randomly removed from the palatal devices (2, 3 and 3),
and the cavities filled with sticky wax. The devices were then returned to the
volunteers, who wore the palatal devices until the morning of the 15<sup>th</sup>
day, when they were returned and the remaining specimens (G14d) removed. After
exposure to saliva, specimens were rinsed with jets of water for 30 seconds, and
dried with compressed air.</p></sec><sec><title>Restoration with composite resin</title><p>Before being restored, all specimens were measured with a thickness gauge
(Espess&#x000ed;metro Otto inox, Arminger &#x00026; Cia Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Leopoldo, RS, Brazil). The
enamel surface of specimens was treated with 37% phosphoric acid etching for 30 sec
and rinsed under running water for 30 sec. After that, two layers of an adhesive
system (Adper Single Bond 2, 3M-ESPE, 3M do Brasil, Campinas, SP, Brazil) were
applied on the enamel surface, which was light activated for 20 seconds after excess
had been removed with the application of jets of air for 5 seconds. Composite resin
(Filtek Z350, 3M-ESPE, 3M do Brasil, Campinas, SP, Brazil) was then placed in
increments of 1 mm and light activated (600 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) with an halogen-curing
device (Optilux 501 - Demetron, Kerr, West Collins, CA, USA) for 20 seconds. The
restoration was considered concluded when the height of the restoration coincided
with the initial height of the specimen. Final heights ranged from 6.2 to 10 mm.
After restoration, specimens were stored in distilled water at 37&#x000ba;C for 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Microtensile testing</title><p>Each individual specimen was removed from distilled water, jet dried and fixed onto
the acrylic brackets of a precision sectioning machine (Isomet 1000, Buehler, Lake
Bluff, IL, USA) with sticky wax. Specimens were then serially sectioned (Extec Corp.
12205) perpendicularly through the tooth/restoration interface into 0.9 mm slices.
Each slice was then individually fixed to the cutting machine to be further sectioned
as to obtain tooth/restoration "sticks" with a cross-sectional area of approximately
0.8 mm<sup>2</sup>. Measurements were performed with a digital caliper (Zaas
Precision, Amatools, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil). After sectioning, sticks were stored at
100% relative humidity to avoid desiccation before testing.</p><p>Each stick was placed in a special microtensile jig (Odeme Biotechnology, Joa&#x000e7;aba,
SC, Brazil) and the extremities were completely covered with cyanoacrylate glue
(adhesive ZAP and Zip Kicker accelerator, Colas, Pacer Technology, USA), leaving just
the enamel/resin interface exposed. This was done to make sure the stick was
correctly centralized on the device and tension distribution was concentrated at the
interface. Sticks were tensile-tested at 0.5 mm/min in a universal testing machine
(EMIC DL 2000, S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil) until failure. Tensile force in N
was divided by the cross-sectional area in mm<sup>2</sup> and bond strength values
were expressed in MPa. To determine whether a specimen would be included in the
statistical analysis, fragments were observed under an optical microscope 40X (Bel
MicroImage Analyzer, Bel Photonics, Monza, Italy), and fracture types were classified
as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>:</p><p>Adhesive fracture - failure in adhesion, with fracture at the interface;</p><p>Cohesive fracture - enamel substrate failure only;</p><p>Cohesive fracture - restorative material failure only; or</p><p>Mixed fracture - enamel substrate and resin materials fractures (adhesive or resin
composite) in the same test specimen.</p><p>Sticks that presented pretest failures, i.e., broke during preparation for the test,
were discarded from the analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup>.
Moreover, in order to confirm the findings from the optical microscopy, 30% of each
sample was randomly selected for interface analysis under scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Sticks were placed in aluminum stubs, sputter-coated with
gold-palladium alloy (Ion Coater, IC-50, Shimadzu Biotech), and observed under SEM
(SS-550 Superscan, Shimadzu Biotech, Japan). Only sticks with "adhesive" or "mixed"
interface fractures, in which the cohesive part represented &#x02264;10% of the interface
area, were included in the statistical analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To guarantee independence of data, and at the same time reduce the variability,
average microtensile strength was calculated for the sticks originating from each
dental specimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup>. As the results
presented normal distribution, they were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's <italic>post-hoc</italic> test, at 5% global
significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The cross-sectional areas of sticks were statistically homogenous (0.70-0.92
mm<sup>2</sup>, P=0.52), indicating that differences in bond strength among groups
would not be due to differences in the cross-sectional area.</p><p>Mean (&#x000b1;SD) bond strength found were: Gct 39.61 (&#x000b1;13.71), Gbl 25.89 (&#x000b1;11.38), Gsa 36.27
(&#x000b1;16.04), G7d 43.60 (&#x000b1;15.24), and G14d 49.26 (&#x000b1;12.97) MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Results found for Gbl in comparison to Gct indicate that
bleaching significantly reduced enamel adhesiveness (P&#x0003c;0.01). However, no
statistically significant differences were found between Gct, Gsa and G7d (P&#x0003e;0.05),
demonstrating that the treatment with sodium ascorbate and exposure to saliva for 7 days
recovered bond strength to enamel to the same level of unbleached specimens. Although
bond strength found for G14d was statistically the same as for Gct and G7d, it was
significantly higher than that found for Gsa (P&#x0003c;0.01).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mean bond strength (MPa) and standard deviation found in the microtensile testing.

exposure time to saliva <italic>in situ</italic> (natural antioxidant effect) in
comparison to a treatment with 10% sodium ascorbate gel (artificial antioxidant effect)
on composite resin bond strength to human enamel after bleaching.</p><p>The results found for Gbl in comparison with Gct confirmed that the treatment with
hydrogen peroxide reduced enamel adhesiveness in approximately 35%, which is consistent
with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. This finding
may be explained by the delayed release of oxygen due to the presence of peroxides and
their subproducts, oxygen and water, which compete with free radicals produced during
the photoactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>, affecting the
polymerization of resin components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the treatment with sodium ascorbate increased composite resin
bonding to enamel immediately after bleaching. This finding is in agreement with
previous studies that have shown antioxidants to be able to immediately restore bond
strength to bleached enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>. However, Kaya, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12
</xref></sup>(2008) suggested that to obtain effective results the exposure time to
the antioxidant agent should be of at least 60 min. A similar protocol was used in the
present study (Gsa), with satisfactory results. In another study, Torres, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup> (2006) observed that the
treatment of dental specimens with a sodium ascorbate solution for 20 minutes was not
sufficient to restore bond strength to bleached enamel. The authors' findings may have
not only been due to insufficient exposition to the antioxidant agent, but also to the
way it was conducted. In the present study, the sodium ascorbate agent used was in a gel
form, which is easy to apply and, according to some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>, more
effective than solutions, as the active compounds in the gel are released more
slowly.</p><p>Although an <italic>in vitro</italic> study has demonstrated that the amount of sodium
ascorbate required to reduce hydrogen peroxide is directly related to the concentration
of the latter, and the reaction kinetics between oxidant and antioxidant showed that 5
minutes was sufficiently long for the antioxidant to exert an effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>, the exact time required for the
antioxidant to reestablish bond capacity to bleached enamel <italic>in vivo</italic> has
yet to be established. Lai, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>
(2002) recommended the use of 10% sodium ascorbate for at least a third of the bleaching
agent application time. Following this recommendation, Kimyai and Valizadeh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> (2006) left the antioxidant in contact
with bleached teeth for 3 hours, which was considered too long from a clinical
perspective. Studies have also reported differences in the effective application time
between carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide. Studies using 10% carbamide peroxide
showed that bonding strength to enamel was restored within 10 to 180 minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> or 10 to 480 minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> after the application of a sodium
ascorbate gel and solution, respectively. Whereas, for enamel bleached with 35% hydrogen
peroxide, the effective reversal of reduced bonding was achieved after 10-20
minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup> of exposure to a 10% sodium ascorbate solution.</p><p>Sazaki, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> (2009) attempted to
simulate home-bleaching using a tray and artificial saliva. Bond strength to bleached
enamel was not restored by the treatment with 10% sodium ascorbate solution, perhaps due
to the fact that the antioxidant was diluted by the artificial saliva in which it was
incubated for 2 hours. In the present study, dental specimens with the gel were kept in
an environment at 100% humidity without any contact with fluid. This scenario was used
to reproduce the clinical application of the antioxidant in a dental office, which is
performed under relative isolation. Thus, the sodium ascorbate gel used was not
dissolved or diluted, which may have improved its ability to restore bond strength to
enamel more effectively.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, the treatment of bleached enamel surface with 10%
sodium ascorbate antioxidant gel for 60 min was found to be an effective clinical option
for patients in need of immediate esthetic restorations following bleaching. In a
follow-up study performed by Garcia, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> (2012), the authors reported on restorations carried out immediately
after bleaching with the use of 10% sodium ascorbate gel for one hour. The study
demonstrated that no alterations in restoration shape or color were observed after one
year, and considered the method efficient, user-friendly and little time-consuming. One
of the limitations of using sodium ascorbate as an antioxidant, however, is that it
gradually oxidizes with time, becoming less reductive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup>. To circumvent this problem in the present study, the
sodium ascorbate gel used was manipulated shortly before its application. Nevertheless,
further investigations are needed to determine its shelf life.</p><p>No statistical differences between Gct, G7d, and G14d groups were found, indicating that
bond strength to enamel was fully reestablished after exposure to saliva for 7 days
<italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Although
several authors have recommended that restorative procedures should wait between 7 to 14
days after bleaching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>, the findings in this study suggest that exposition to
saliva for at least one week is a satisfactory waiting period for restorative procedures
after in-office dental bleaching treatments. However, different hydrogen peroxide
concentrations can also influence the waiting time required between the end of the
bleaching treatment and the performance of bonding procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>. Studies using hydrogen peroxide have suggested a waiting
period of 14 days after bleaching before starting with the restorative procedure. The
results of the present study support this assumption, as bond strength to bleached
enamel after being exposed for 14 days (G14d) to human saliva was significantly higher
than that found for sodium ascorbate-treated enamel (Gsa).</p><p>Results obtained in laboratory studies may differ from the clinical situation, because
they commonly use artificial saliva to store the specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>. <italic>In situ</italic> studies have the advantage of
being nearest to the clinical situation, as bleached dental specimens are placed under
the direct effect of human saliva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>.
Human saliva acts on the oxidative stress mediated by free radicals, and presents
alternative antioxidants, including ascorbic acid and vitamin E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>. A previous <italic>in situ</italic> and
<italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown that although bleaching agents are capable
of altering dental enamel surface's microhardness, roughness, and morphology, natural
saliva allows for enamel mineral reposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. This process helps to reestablish enamel surface microhardness,
which is an important component in the adhesive strength of enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref></sup>. In an attempt to simulate the clinical
situation, as well as to permit that only the natural antioxidant effect of saliva could
be assessed in the reestablishment of adhesive bond strength after bleaching, volunteers
in the <italic>in situ</italic> experiment were asked to avoid the use of any type of
fluoride-containing products. These products have been shown to alter salivary fluoride
concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>, which could have
had an influence on enamel's remineralization process.</p><p>In this study, 52% of fractures were of the mixed type, while 28% were adhesive. This
means that resin-enamel interfaces were tested in tensile as expected. The frequency of
premature failures in the Gbl group was much higher (78%) than that observed in other
groups. During the specimen preparation procedures, microcracks might have been
inadvertently produced mainly by the vibrations of the cutting instruments. Such
defects, coupled with the brittle nature of enamel, are responsible for the premature
failure of microtensile bond specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>. The high number of pretest failures seen in the Gbl group emphasizes
the fragility of bonding immediately after bleaching. In order to standardize procedures
and avoid variability as much as possible, we followed the recommendations set out by
Roulet and Van Meerbeek<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup> (2007).
Pretest failures were ignored and not used in the statistical analysis. SEM was used to
analyze in detail the type of failure, and only those sticks presenting adhesive or
predominantly adhesive failures were considered, while cohesive failures were discarded
as well. This was done to circumvent the inherent problems with the microtensile tests
mentioned by El Zohairy, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7
</xref></sup>(2010), concerning the high presence of cohesive fractures. Moreover, to
minimize the differences in adhesion that could occur in different parts of the
specimen, we calculated the average microtensile bond strength for the sticks
originating from the same dental specimen.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the results found in this study, the use of sodium ascorbate
after in-office bleaching may be indicated in clinical situations in which the patient
cannot wait for adhesive techniques to be performed. However, whenever possible, bonding
should be postponed for at least 7 days after tooth bleaching. From a chemical-molecular
perspective, the alterations in the bleached enamel caused by the antioxidant treatment
and exposure to saliva remain unknown and warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>1.
