Considerable drawbacks of local anesthesia in these patients include the fact that a few geriatric patients can remain comfortable on an operating table for procedures that exceed two or three hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Closed Claim database, patient movement during ophthalmologic surgery was the second most common cause of eye injury associated with anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Conscious sedation during ocular surgery, especially lengthy procedures like vitreo-retinal surgery is a great challenge for the anesthesiologists. To keep the patients quiet, tranquil, pain-free and obeying verbal commands, with no complications during surgery, requires great skill to manipulate the doses of available sedative drugs and a good understanding of the surgical procedure.</p><p>Many studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] had evaluated the use of propofol and/or remifentanil as sedative drugs during the performance of the block (peri-retrobulbar) and for short ocular procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] However, sedation during the entire period of the prolonged ocular procedures was not adequately studied.</p><p>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the combined use of propofol and remifentanil as a sedative technique in comparison with the use of propofol alone to limit patient discomfort and movement during local anesthesia for vitreo-retinal surgery lasting for more than two hours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized double blind study was carried out in Magrabi Eye and Ear Hospital, Muscat- Oman, between January 2006 and January 2008. After approval from the ethical committee and written informed consent from the patients, 140 patients were included in the study. The patients were scheduled for vitreo-retinal surgery, including vitrectomy, scleral buckle and cryopexy, under local anesthesia using peribulbar block with an expected surgical time of more than two hours.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included patients with ASA physical status I, II and III with no contraindications to local anesthesia or to the drugs used in this study. Exclusion criteria included; age younger than 40 years, operation time less than two hours, patients on aspirin or anticoagulants, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, frequent cough, drug abuse, impaired hearing, neurological or psychological disorders, and partial or failed block.</p><p>Patients were divided randomly using a closed envelop technique into two equal groups. Group I (study group) patients were given propofol bolus of 0.3 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg/h and a remifentanil bolus of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg over 30 seconds followed by a continuous infusion of 0.03-0.05 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, and group II (control group) patients were given propofol as in the first group+placebo (syringe was labeled as 20 &#x003bc;g/ ml similar to remifentanil syringe) with a bolus dose and a continuous infusion like that used for remifentanil in the first group. The sedative drugs were started 10 minutes before performance of the block and continued till the end of the surgical procedure. Propofol, remifentanil and placebo were administered continuously using ACM 5500 syringe pump (Beijing Aerospace Changfeng Co., Ltd, Medical devices branch, Beijing, China).</p><p>Titration of drugs was done with the aim to keep sedation at level 3 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale (patient responds to commands only). In the case of propofol after a bolus dose, the infusion was started at a rate of 0.3 mg/kg/h and increased every five minutes by 0.1 mg/kg/h to a maximum of 0.5 mg/kg/h. In case of remifentanil, after a bolus dose, the infusion was started at a rate of 0.03
&#x003bc;g/kg/min and increased gradually by 0.005 &#x003bc;g/kg/min every 5 minutes to a maximum of 0.05 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. After reaching the satisfactory level of sedation (3 on Ramsay Sedation Scale) the infusion rate was fixed unless there were signs of over-sedation like a respiratory rate of less than 10 per minute, SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 95% or loss of verbal communication, where the rate of infusion was decreased in the same manner.</p><p>The patients were not pre-medicated and were kept fasting for eight hours before surgery. In the operating theatre, monitoring of ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse oximetry was commenced using Insight 8500 informative patient monitor (Beijing Aerospace Changfeng Co., Ltd, Medical devices branch, Beijing, China). An intravenous catheter was inserted and Lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution was given at a rate of 4 ml/kg/h. Oxygen was given by nasal cannula at a rate of 4 l/min.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique of peribulbar anesthesia used</title><p>Skin infiltration was done with 0.5 ml lidocaine using &#x000bd;-inch 25-gauge needle at the junction of the medial two thirds and the lateral one-third of the lower eyelid. Then a one inch 25 gauge short bevel needle was inserted at the same site in a strictly posterior direction. The depth of insertion of the needle was limited to 25 mm. The local anesthetic solution (an equal mixture of 2% lignocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine and 30 IU/ml hyaluronidase) was injected after an aspiration test. The injected volume was not predetermined but adjusted to each patient. The injection continued until proptosis and lid fullness appeared with sensation of full orbit. Compression was applied for 15 to 20 minutes using a Honan&#x02019;s balloon set at 40 mmHg to lower the intraocular pressure. If after 15 minutes, the degree of akinesia was not adequate, a second injection with the same anesthetic mixture was given in a similar way. The block was checked after another 10 minutes. If after the second injection, total akinesia was not achieved, the block was considered unsatisfactory. The procedure was converted to general anesthesia and the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>All surgeries were done by the same surgeon who was blinded about the anesthetic medications used for sedation.

The results of this double-blind randomized study confirm the importance of adding analgesia to sedation in retinal surgery under local anesthesia lasting for more than two hours.</p><p>The combined use of propofol and remifentanil as a continuous infusion before performance of the block and during vitreo-retinal surgery was associated with a lower incidence of patient discomfort, breakthrough pain, and patient movement along with high degree of surgeons&#x02019; satisfaction and hemodynamic stability.</p><p>In this study, there was a significant decrease in heart rate and MABP in each group compared with pre-sedation level starting 10 minutes after the start of the sedation and continued all through the procedure till the end of surgery. This decrease could be attributed to the relief of anxiety and associated sympathetic over-activity caused by fear and apprehension because of surgery,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] in addition, to the effect of propofol and remifentanil on vascular tone and autonomic nervous system. However, this decrease in heart rate and MABP was not significant clinically as it was less than 20% of pre-sedation values.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>]</p><p>The use of propofol alone as a sedative agent was not enough to deal with breakthrough pain or discomfort during the surgical procedure and fentanyl was given as a rescue treatment to relieve pain or discomfort. Adding remifentanil to propofol was effective in masking pain and discomfort during the surgical procedure. Holas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] reported in his study for sedation during eye surgery under retrobulbar block that superior pain relief was achieved with remifentanil used as a sole agent when compared with propofol. Rewari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] studied the use of various doses of remifentanil combined with propofol for sedation during placement of eye block. They found that the combination of remifentanil 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 0.5 mg/kg provided excellent anxiety and pain relief with the least adverse effects.</p><p>There were many causes of discomfort during the surgical procedure as reported by masked observers in this study: Some patients were not comfortable from lying down in the same position for a long period of time, or they had itching in their arms, face or they wanted to change the position of their heads due to pain in the head or neck. In addition, some patients wished to flex their legs due to pain. The incidence of discomfort was higher in the propofol group compared with remifentanil group, which could be explained by the potent analgesic effect of remifentanil.</p><p>The surgeon was satisfied with patient comfort and better surgical conditions as evidenced by reduced patient movement in the remifentanil group. In this study, we have not commented on patient response during performance of block as this has been studied before. Many studies have demonstrated that the combination of propofol and remifentanil was better than the use of propofol alone in limiting patient movement during performance of the block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>The possibility of movement of the patients during surgery, which might affect the surgical outcome, could be considered as a point of weakness for the use of conscious sedation for ocular surgery. However, with proper selection and detailed explanation of the procedure to the patient, this risk could be avoided.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The combined use of propofol and remifentanil as a continuous infusion before performance of the block and during lengthy vitreo-retinal surgery was associated with a lower incidence of patient discomfort, breakthrough pain, and patient movement along with high degree of surgeons&#x02019; satisfaction and hemodynamic stability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
