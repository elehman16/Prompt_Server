Individuals with CKD have a 10- to 20-fold greater risk of cardiac death, mainly because of the high risk for coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications, which virtually coexists with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, lipid abnormalities, hyperaggregability state and endothelial dysfunction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] CKD in the presence of other co-morbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension can lead to early progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD or stage V CKD), which confers a greater risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of premature death in patients with CKD even before their progression to ESRD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The correlation between raised serum creatinine levels and CVD mortality was first observed by Shulman <italic>et al</italic>., in 1989 in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Programme study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] This concept received wide attentions in 2003 after the scientific statement from the American Heart Association endorsed the fact that increased CVD mortality is noted in patients of CKD when compared with the general population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] This begins in the early stages of renal impairment and rises continuously to 20 to 30 times above that in the general population, as the renal damage progresses to ESRD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Antiplatelet drugs have an established place in the prevention of vascular events in a variety of clinical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Very few studies have been done regarding effect of antiplatelet therapy on renal function and warrants further studies. In First United Kingdom Heart and Renal Protection (UK-HARP-I) study the safety of low-dose aspirin was done on patients of chronic kidney disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Deray G <italic>et al</italic>., looked for clopidogrel activities in patients with renal function impairment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily was well-tolerated in patients with both moderate or severe renal failure, and provided good inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation without excessive extension of bleeding time. Though aspirin is encouraged in all patients with CKD the therapeutic use of clopidogrel has not been predominant due to its far greater cost compared to aspirin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] However, the overall hospital care cost of chronic kidney disease with risk of cardiovascular disease may be far in excess. Hence rethinking is mandatory to reassess efficacy, safety, convenience promised by clopidogrel versus risks and benefits associated with aspirin. The present one is a comparative clinical study of aspirin versus clopidogrel in cardiovascular prophylaxis in patients with renal dysfunction under primary nephrology specialty care to generate evidence base for rational therapeutic practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients (<italic>n</italic> = 80) of chronic kidney disease (Serum Creatinine level &#x02265;1.8 mg/dl) with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 50 years and above were recruited from the Department of Nephrology, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.

There is improvement in glycemic status in both the groups but both fasting and postprandial blood glucose was decreased more in clopidogrel group. As the study population was suffering from diabetes for an average of 8 years, the long-term glycemic status was important and measured by glycosylated hemoglobin. It is known that glycosylated hemoglobin concentration predicts cardiovascular risk both in diabetic and non-diabetic population, and may help identify individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular disease for targeted interventions, including blood pressure or cholesterol reduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] So by better controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub> level, clopidogrel has established its better cardioprotective role when compared to low-dose aspirin. In lipid profile, a significant improvement in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol level in clopidogrel group can directly help in retarding the process of atherosclerosis and development of (CAD) Coronary Artery Disease.</p><p>As the study population was suffering from chronic renal disease, assessment of renal function was done by serum urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance and serum albumin. There was significant improvement in all the renal parameters in clopidogrel group but in aspirin group creatinine clearance was decreased suggesting a re-evaluation of the status of low dose aspirin as add-on therapy in chronic renal failure. The previous study by Refael Segal <italic>et al</italic>., concluded that short-term low-dose aspirin affected renal tubular creatinine and uric acid transport in the elderly, which may result in a prolonged or permanent deterioration of the renal function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our study groups, we found hypernatremia and high than normal potassium level. After 8 weeks follow-up electrolyte status has been improved in both groups but clopidogrel group has shown a promising decrease in serum sodium and potassium level.</p><p>C-reactive protein is a reliable marker of cardiovascular risk and its therapeutic implications in end-stage renal disease patients has been shown by Park <italic>et al</italic>. in 2003.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Renal insufficiency has been found to be independently associated with elevations in inflammatory biomarkers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The robust association with future cardiovascular events has provided an analytic opportunity for CRP in clinical use. Based on multiple epidemiological and intervention studies, minor CRP elevation has been shown to be associated with future major cardiovascular risk (hsCRP: &#x0003c;1 mg/L = low risk; 1-3 mg/L = intermediate risk; 3-10 mg/L = high risk; &#x0003e;10 mg/L = non-specific elevation).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Total 76% patients (61/80) of our study population were found to have intermediate risk, whereas rest of the patients had low risk for cardiovascular diseases. In our study along with hsCRP, we have also estimated 2 supporting non-specific inflammatory marker ESR and TLC. All the 3 inflammatory biomarkers were found to be decreased significantly in clopidogrel group promising a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Though 8 weeks is relatively short time to assess cardiovascular risk, these findings clearly establishes superior cardioprotective role of clopidogrel.</p><p>Platelet activation is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic renal injury. Intrarenal platelet activation is an important component that contributes to glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Some studies showed that platelet activation is closely related to inflammation, and platelet activation can induce or increase inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. So inhibition of the platelet activation contributes to the repression of the inflammation. The platelet aggregation study shows that both the anti platelet drugs were significantly decreased platelet aggregation. Though anti-aggregatory effect was more with aspirin, the effect of clopidogrel was found to be considerably close to low dose aspirin.</p><p>The UKPDS risk engine is the first coronary risk calculator to be developed from a cohort with type 2 diabetes. It showed good predictive ability and the risk engine has been externally validated using data from the CARDS study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Finally UKPDS scoring for 10-year risk of CHD shows a significant decrease in clopidogrel group when compared with aspirin group. This improvement is an overall improvement in lipid profile, glycemic control, control of blood pressure and inflammatory status in clopidogrel group.</p><p>Recent understanding of pathogenesis of chronic renal disease may explain superiority of clopidogrel found in this study. Diffuse glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis contribute to the progression of renal damage and constitute the final common pathway for almost all forms of kidney diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In recent years, more attention has been focused on the inflammatory infiltration present in various types of progressive renal diseases in humans and in experimental models. The number of inflammatory cells in the renal tissue closely correlates with the severity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions and loss of renal function. Inflammatory cells and activated intrinsic kidney cells can produce various cytokines, which can promote the progress of glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, so it may be a novel therapy strategy for chronic renal disease to reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Mounting evidence has shown that platelet activation and angiotensin II can promote glomerular inflammation and fibrosis and play a pivotal role in the progression of CKD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] A variety of cytokines, including TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) are important for renal cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Clopidogrel therapy has been found to almost completely abolish macrophage infiltration and attenuated the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and CTGF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] So superiority of clopidogrel found in this study may be attributed to its additional anti-inflammatory effect established by Xiaowen Tu <italic>et al</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The salient benefits of clopidogrel over aspirin given as prophylactic therapy against coronary events in patients with chronic renal failure with type 2 diabetes has been assessed in our study. The better control of metabolic parameters, renal function and inflammatory burden was evident in clopidogrel group and a significant decrease in 10-year risk of CHD has proved its superiority over low-dose aspirin in chronic renal failure. This study renders support to future prospective clinical studies of clopidogrel in chronic kidney disease and its sequels. Because non-blinding and single center were limitations, the findings of this pilot study should be confirmed by multicentric, randomized, double-blind, large population studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Modi</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name><name><surname>Jha</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The incidence of end-stage renal disease in India: A population-based study</article-title><source>Kidney Int</source><year>2006</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>2131</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17063176</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Go</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chertow</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic kidney disease and the risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>351</volume><fpage>S1296</fpage><lpage>305</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sarnak</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Levey</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cardiovascular disease and chronic renal disease: A new paradigm</article-title><source>Am J Kidney Dis</source><year>2000</year><volume>35</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>S117</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10766010</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shulman</surname><given-names>NB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>WD</given-names></name><name><surname>Blaufox</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Langford</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><collab>The hypertension detection and follow-up Program Cooperative.
