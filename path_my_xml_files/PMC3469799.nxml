Each session lasted approximately 50 minutes. The cognitive training program, which was offered in the form of individual sessions, was a multicomponent cognitive training program, targeted largely at memory training. There was one instructor, who was an experienced clinical neuropsychologist. The cognitive training program was conducted in a standardized manner, but the difficulty level was individualized.</p><p>In brief, sessions included a welcome and checking-homework period (5 minutes), reality orientation techniques (10 minutes), attentional training (10 minutes), and cognitive exercises (25 minutes). The cognitive exercises were designed to stimulate one specific cognitive function during each session (eight sessions focused on memory, five sessions focused on visuoconstructional abilities, and five sessions focused on executive functions and abstract thinking). The contents of the components of the intervention are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The goal of the sessions was to improve the participants' daily function. Homework was assigned at every session in order to encourage the patients to practice and apply any strategies learned from the program in their daily life.</p><p>The methods selected for the intervention were reflective of current evidence-based scientific research in cognitive training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref> Strategies for improving organizational and attention skills in learning and remembering were practiced during memory training.

The SAC consists of the following six self-assessment items: 1) I know the date; 2) I recall the name of someone, message for someone, or what I am about to do; 3) I concentrate on some stimuli; 4) I understand what someone is speaking about, book content, or television program; 5) I plan what I have to do and conduct myself to fit the occasion; and 6) I can find my way. The responses for each item were given on the following 5-point scale: 1, 'very impaired'; 2, 'impaired'; 3, 'fair'; 4, 'good'; and 5, 'very good'. The Satisfaction Questionnaire consists of eight items: 1) this program was helpful for reducing anxiety, 2) this program was helpful for adapting to my social life, 3) this program was helpful for gaining confidence, 4) this program was helpful for human relationships, 5) this program was interesting, 6) I will participate in a program like this again, 7) I will recommend this program to others, and 8) my family or friends said that my memory, function or mood was improved after I finished this program. Again, the responses for each item were given on a 5-point scale: 1, 'never'; 2, 'a little'; 3, 'fair'; 4, 'much'; and 5, 'very much'. The SAC and Satisfaction Questionnaire were scored by averaging each participant's ratings (range 1-5), with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with the training program.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The patient's demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.

Participants with aMCI in the trained group exhibited a significant improvement in delayed recall of the SVLT after completing the cognitive training program, and improvements in episodic memory were maintained until 3 months after the end of the cognitive training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Cognitive training might therefore delay the conversion from aMCI to dementia. Global cognition was improved after cognitive training in early AD, but it declined slightly after completion of the cognitive training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The early AD patients in the trained group showed a nonsignificant improvement of verbal episodic memory, but this improvement was reduced after the conclusion of cognitive training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Patients with early AD benefited less from cognitive training than did patients with aMCI. There are three likely explanations for modest effects of cognitive training in early AD: 1) the same training programs were applied to the aMCI and AD patients, and hence the level of difficulty of some of the components may have been set too high relative to the cognitive abilities of this group; 2) the absence of a significant difference could have been due to the small sample in this study; and 3) in AD (even early AD), episodic memory is severely impaired, which may make it difficult to improve episodic memory significantly by memory training.</p><p>While a multicomponent cognitive training program was employed in this study, cognitive training was effective on episodic memory in aMCI relative to other cognitive domains. This finding is in accordance with the results of previous studies on the effects of cognitive training in patients with aMCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> There are several possible interpretations for this finding. First, the improvement in episodic memory may be due to the memory training in the present study being performed more frequently than training of the other cognitive domains. A second possible interpretation is that the cognitive function of the other domains did not improve significantly after cognitive training because the other cognitive functions (aside from memory) were close to normal in the patients with aMCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> A third possible interpretation is that the outcome measures might not be sensitive enough to detect improvements in cognitive functions other than memory because of a ceiling effect of the neuropsychological tests for those other cognitive functions in aMCI. The early AD patients showed improvements in global cognitive status and executive function after cognitive training, and this finding is in accordance with the results of a previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this was a type of transient practice effect. It is therefore crucial to assess the longitudinal course of the efficacy data.</p><p>The training was standardized by having the same instructor administer the training using standardized instructions through all of the sessions in this study. The main advantage of individual programs is tailoring of the training to the needs and complaints of the individual patients. The satisfaction regarding the training program was high among the trained participants. The advantage of the standardized individual training may have contributed to a large improvement in episodic memory in the participants with aMCI. However, the individual training is limited by a single instructor being able to train only a few patients.</p><p>This is a preliminary study, and it has several limitations. First, the patient sample was small. In particular, the number of subjects was smaller in the AD wait-list control group than in the AD trained group. Furthermore, a few of the AD patients agreed to complete the intensive neuropsychological tests without any training, twice with an interval of 20 weeks. This limits the generalizability of the results. Second, this study was not a randomized blind trial. Third, the emotional state of the participants after the training program was not examined. According to some previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> depressive symptoms improve after cognitive interventions. However, none of the patients in the present study had significant depressive symptoms (GDS-K score &#x02265;18) at baseline. Therefore, the observed improvement in episodic memory may not have been related to a reduction in depressive symptoms. Fourth, the effects of the training on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score were not examined in this study. Although according to Petersen's criteria daily functioning must be intact in aMCI, there is some evidence that IADL is slightly impaired in aMCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> Given that MCI is a potentially degenerative condition, IADL scores are likely to deteriorate over time, at least in some patients with MCI. Therefore, the IADL score may be sensitive to early functional changes related to MCI, and this tool should thus be applied as an outcome measure. There was no improvement in the scores on the Functional Activities Questionnaire after intervention in either MCI or in mild to moderate AD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> but a previous study showed that daily activities measured using the Bayer Activities of Daily Living scale-which is known to be a sensitive measure in MCI-were improved after cognitive intervention in MCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> Fifth, the 3-month follow-up evaluation was not conducted for the control patients.</p><p>Cognitive training had a positive effect on episodic memory in aMCI relative to other cognitive domains. The early AD patients showed improvements in global cognitive status and executive function after cognitive training. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the small sample. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the effectiveness of cognitive training in aMCI and early AD. The efficacy of cognitive training programs remains to be verified in larger samples in randomized studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by
