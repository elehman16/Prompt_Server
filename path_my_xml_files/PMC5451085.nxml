Several studies have determined the beneficial effect of wearing CG on performance during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, inconsistent results have been reported in the literature because of differences in experimental conditions (e.g., exercise duration, exercise intensity and modality, CG pressure level exerted and covered area) among studies. These differences in methodological criteria may have masked the effectiveness of CG [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To date, a number of studies focused on the effect of CG on exercise performance during running [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For instance, reduced energy cost of running, i.e. decrease in oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) slow component [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and increased time to exhaustion [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] were observed when wearing CG during submaximal running, whereas previous studies still contain conflicting results for benefit of wearing CG during running [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Possible explanations for these discrepancies may be due to differences in the levels of compressive pressure applied among studies [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Considering that higher compression (&#x0003e; 35 mmHg) may reduce local blood circulation around muscle [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], moderate compressive pressures (15&#x02013;20 mmHg) may be appropriate for improving exercise performance. In this regard, Ali et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] determined the effects of different levels of pressure exerted by CG (covered knee to ankle) on 10-km time trial performance. As a result, two different types of CG, exerting 12 or 18 mmHg pressure at the knee, significantly attenuated the exercise-induced decrease in jump performance compared with the control trial (0 mmHg), while CG with high pressure (23 mmHg at the knee) did not improve performance. Furthermore, Miyamoto et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that wearing CG applying 15 or 20 mmHg to thigh significantly attenuated exercise-induced increase in skeletal muscle proton transverse relaxation times, which reflect the intramuscular pH and Pi levels, compared with wearing CG applying 8 or 25 mmHg. The finding suggested that optimal pressure intensity would exist to obtain beneficial effects of wearing CG. However, similar studies using different levels of CG pressures did not show changes in running performance [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or oxygen uptake [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Taken together, appropriate levels of compressive pressure to improve running performance remain unclear.</p><p>Prolonged running, such as marathon, elicits marked muscle damage and inflammation, leading to impaired muscular function [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Del Coso et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that a decrease in running velocity over a marathon was significantly correlated with an increase in blood myoglobin (Mb) concentration immediately after exercise. Considering that sustained external pressure while wearing CG attenuates mechanical stress by reducing muscle oscillation [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the use of CG during exercise might attenuate increases in muscle damage markers and inflammatory cytokines. Another mechanism underlying effectiveness of wearing CG may be improved venous return, resulting from assisted muscle pump action by the garments [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The augmented muscle pump action by wearing CG would be more advantageous when exercise intensity is relatively lower, because muscle pump action is dependent on exercise intensity. In addition, positive effect of wearing CG is suggested to be observed during prolonged exercise with accumulated fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, most of these previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of wearing CG on cardiovascular and metabolic variables during maximal or intensive endurance exercise lasting less than 60 min [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, little information is available on whether wearing CG during prolonged running (&#x0003e; 60 min) affects exercise-induced changes in muscle damage markers and the inflammatory responses.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of wearing lower-body CG at three different pressure levels (30 mmHg, 15 mmHg, below 5 mmHg) during 120 min of running on exercise performance, muscle damage markers, and the inflammatory response. Based on previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it was hypothesized that wearing CG exerting medium (approximately 15 mmHg) pressure would attenuate the decrease in exercise performance and increases in muscle damage and inflammatory markers during prolonged running.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight male (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation: age, 23.4 &#x000b1; 2.4 years; height, 170.1 &#x000b1; 2.2 cm; body mass, 62.3 &#x000b1; 3.3 kg; body mass index, 21.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; VO<sub>2</sub>max, 50.6 &#x000b1; 4.1 ml/kg/min) participated in the present study. Two of ten subjects were not able to complete 120 min of exercise (exhausted at 90 min). All participants were physically active (i.e., exercising at least 1 day/week) but not well-trained athletes. They had several years of sports participation experience. Exclusion criteria included a history of inflammatory condition and musculoskeletal disorders. Smokers and individuals taking antioxidant supplements were also excluded. Participants were instructed to maintain their normal diet and physical activity level throughout the experimental period. They were also asked to refrain from strenuous activity for at least 72 h prior to testing. All participants gave informed consent after being informed of the purpose and risks associated with the present study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ritsumeikan University, Japan.</p></sec><sec id="sec008" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>All participants visited the laboratory four times over the experimental period. On the first day, they completed an incremental running test on a treadmill (Valiant; Lode B.V., Groningen, Netherlands) to determine individual VO<sub>2</sub>max. The initial velocity was set as 4 km/h for 3 min, and velocity was increased by 2 km/h every 3 min. All participants were required to walk both the 4km/h and 6km/h stages, and they started running from 8km/h stage. After completing above three stages of submaximal running (9 min after exercise onset), running velocity was increased by 0.6 km/h every minute until exhaustion. The treadmill gradient was 7% throughout the test. Respiratory gases were collected and analyzed using an automatic gas analyzer (AE300S; Minato Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). Participants also engaged in sufficient practice of appropriate procedures for the counter-movement jump (CMJ) test and reviewed the subjective rating scale of the measurements for familiarization.</p><p>From the second to fourth visits, participants performed three exercise trials with overnight fast in a random order at the same time of the day. The exercise consisted of 120 min of uphill running (slope: 7%) on a treadmill (Elevation series E95Ta; Life Fitness Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 60% of VO<sub>2</sub>max while wearing one of three different types of garment, separated with at least 4 weeks among trials to eliminate repeated-bout effect. The average running velocity was 6.6 &#x000b1; 0.5 km/h. Uphill running was selected to induce greater metabolic response under relatively lower running velocity. All participants maintained running throughout 120 min of exercise. The present exercise protocol was determined on the basis of a pilot experiment.</p><p>Custom-made garments were utilized to match pressure levels among all participants because interindividual differences in thigh and calf circumferences were reported to produce different pressure levels for working muscles, even if the garment is the same size [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present study, appropriate size of the garment was medium for all participants. However, we prepared several types of garment (different width) for each trial (five garments for the HIGH and MED trials, respectively, three garments for the CON trial), and a garment from several types was selected individually to ensure equal pressure levels among all participants. The compression levels at the thigh and calf were manipulated to match about 30 mmHg for HIGH trial, about 15 mmHg for MED trial, and &#x0003c; 5 mmHg for CON trial, respectively. Accordingly, the exercise trials consisted of 1) wearing lower-body CG exerting high level of pressure (approximately 30 mmHg) [HIGH]; 2) wearing lower-body CG exerting medium level of pressure (approximately 15 mmHg) [MED]; and 3) wearing a lower-body garment without specific pressure level (&#x0003c; 5 mmHg) [CON]. Each garment covered the area from the waist to the ankle and was custom-made by a sportswear manufacturer (DESCENTE Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Prior to the experiment, the pressure levels were determined using an air-packed sensor (AMI3037-2; AMI Techno, Tokyo, Japan).

All participants performed the CMJ on a jump mat (Multi jump tester; DKH Corp., Tokyo, Japan) connected to a computer. They were instructed to jump as high as possible while placing their hands on the lumbar area to eliminate any upper-limb effect. The flight and contact time during the vertical jump were recorded. Each jump test was repeated twice, and the highest CMJ height value was used for analysis in each case. The intraclass correlation coefficient between jumps was 0.99. CMJ height was calculated from flight time using the following formula:

Furthermore, the increased plasma IL-6 concentration during 120 min of running was also impaired in the MED trial than in the CON trial. These findings suggest that optimal pressure (approximately 15 mmHg) exists for decrease in exercise-induced fatigue during prolonged running.</p><p>A unique point of the present study was preparation of several types of custom-made garments to match pressure levels (approximately 15 and 30 mmHg) among participants, because no consensus has been reached about the anti-fatiguing effect of CG, probably due to differences in the compressive pressures applied among studies [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and participants [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the influences of CG exerting different pressure levels on exercise-induced decrease in jump performance. As a result, an exercise-induced decrease in CMJ height was significantly greater in the HIGH trial than in the MED trial. Decreased jump height following prolonged running would be caused by several factors, including impaired neuromuscular function [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], accumulated metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, previous studies revealed that decreases in jump height and running velocity closely related to exercise-induced increases in Mb and CK concentrations immediately after prolonged running [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, greater jump height immediately after exercise, as shown in the MED trial, may reflect maintained lower-limb muscle function during prolonged running. A possible mechanism for improved jump performance may be augmented removal of metabolites (e.g., H<sup>+</sup> and inorganic phosphate) in working muscle because the reduction in intramuscular pH inhibits muscle contractile function (e.g., shortening velocity) [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This notion is supported by previous findings revealing that adequate external pressure assists muscle pump action and improves peripheral circulation, leading to enhanced removal of H<sup>+</sup> and inorganic phosphate from working muscle [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, the effect of lower-body CG on the exercise-induced decrease in jump height was not dependent on the pressure level applied since the post-exercise jump height was significantly lower in the HIGH trial compared with that in the MED trial. Although a high pressure CG would theoretically augment venous return from working muscle, excessive pressure exerted by CG (30&#x02013;40 mmHg) significantly attenuates local blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The reduced local blood flow associated with the strong external pressure applied by CG would aggravate the accumulation of muscle metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Accordingly, impaired jump height immediately after the exercise period in the HIGH trial might be explained by the accumulation of intramuscular metabolites under lower blood flow. Future applications evaluating local blood flow would clarify this hypothesis.</p><p>Exercise-induced decrease in CMJ height was significantly correlated with increases in CK and Mb concentrations immediately after prolonged exercise (triathlon race) [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, no differences in CK or Mb concentrations were observed among the three trials. In contrast, the exercise-induced increase in IL-6 concentration (evaluated by AUC) was significantly lower in the MED trial compared with that in the CON trial. The finding suggests that CG with medium pressure level attenuates exercise-induced inflammation. However, because blood samples were collected during relatively initial phase (60 min) of post-exercise period, we are not able to conclude the influence of wearing CG on muscle damage and inflammation after 60 min following the exercise. Future study is necessary to determine the changes in muscle damage markers and inflammatory cytokines during longer period after exercise.</p><p>A large amount of evidence indicates that HR during exercise is not affected by wearing CG [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the MED trial significantly attenuated the exercise-induced increase in HR. These inconsistent observations among studies may be associated with differences in exercise intensities, as previous studies required relatively high or maximal efforts during exercise, whereas the exercise intensity in the present study was moderate (60% of VO<sub>2</sub>max). Furthermore, mean running velocity was low (6.6 &#x000b1; 0.1 km/h) because we utilized uphill running. MacRae et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] pointed out that a plausible factor for lower HR during wearing CG was augmented stroke volume associated with increased venous return. Considering that venous return would be augmented depending on exercise intensity, the influence of CG on hemodynamics is supposed to be minor during intensive exercise [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In fact, the wearing lower-body CG during 6 km/h treadmill running significantly attenuated the exercise-induced increase in HR, but not during 10 km/h or at 85% of VO<sub>2</sub>max running [<xref rid="pone.0178620.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Besides, the majority of previous studies used CG that provided gradually decreasing pressure levels from the distal part (ankle) to the proximal part (thigh) to enhance venous return. However, the pressures exerted between the thigh and calf were not different in the present study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178620.t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the pressure levels were uniform across the lower-limb muscles. Therefore, wearing lower-body CG exerting medium pressure (approximately 15 mmHg) at both the thigh and calf is thought to be beneficial for reducing the exercise-induced increase in HR.</p><p>Some limitations need to be considered carefully in the present study. First, the number of participants was relatively small. This is because several types of custom-made garments with different width were prepared for each size of garments (five garments for the HIGH and MED trials, respectively, three garments for the CON trial) to match pressure levels applied among participants. However, further experiment with larger sample size would be informative to assist the present findings. Second, we were unable to identify changes in maximal muscular strength, hemodynamics, cardiovascular response, intramuscular metabolites in response to prolonged running. Therefore, how wearing CG attenuated exercise-induced decrease in jump performance still needs further determination. However, the present findings provide novel insight for the importance of compressive pressure in performance enhancement. Since prolonged running under relatively lower running velocity was selected in the current study, the findings would be specially applicable for recreational or amateur endurance runners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Wearing lower-body CG exerting 15 mmHg on the thigh and calf attenuated decrease in jump performance compared with wearing lower-body CG exerting 30 mmHg.
