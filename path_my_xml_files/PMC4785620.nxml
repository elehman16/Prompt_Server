Healthy eating and physical activity can lead to better health and well-being, but this population may experience difficulties adopting healthy lifestyle practices. Personalised behaviour change programmes that are feasible, acceptable and cost-effective are needed. The aim of this trial is to pilot a manualised programme about healthy eating and physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a phase II, individually randomized, parallel, controlled, two-site, pilot clinical trial. Adult endometrial cancer survivors (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;64) who have been diagnosed with endometrial cancer within the previous 3&#x000a0;years and are not on active treatment will be invited to participate. Participants will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio through minimisation to either an 8-week, group-based, behaviour-change programme with weekly 90-min sessions about healthy eating and physical activity or usual care. The intervention will focus on self-monitoring, goal setting and self-rewards. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 8 and 24&#x000a0;weeks from the baseline assessment. Primary feasibility outcomes will include rates of recruitment, adherence, and retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study results will inform the development of a definitive randomised controlled trial to test if the programme can improve the health and quality of life of this population.

Low physical activity, poor diet and obesity are risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These factors may also be linked with quality of life after cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While the evidence on the impact of post-diagnosis health behaviours on endometrial cancer survival is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], evidence from other cancer sites suggests that similar factors that affect cancer development may also influence survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, adherence to lifestyle recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], putting survivors at high risk for other chronic diseases.</p><p>Cancer survivors often report making health behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As survivors might be motivated to practice health-protecting behaviours, a cancer diagnosis has been posited to be a &#x02018;teachable moment&#x02019;. However, survivors rarely initiate lifestyle behavioural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Behaviour change interventions capitalising on the &#x02018;teachable moment&#x02019; might therefore be more effective than those targeting the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While the optimal timing of the teachable moment has not been defined, the post-treatment period seems optimal for the provision of healthy eating interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Promotion of physical activity might be independent of timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but 10 physical activity trials have accrued survivors within a median of 3.1&#x000a0;years after their diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, willingness to participate in health behaviour trials reduces with time since diagnosis in long-term cancer survivors (&#x0003e;5&#x000a0;years since diagnosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Qualitative data in endometrial cancer survivors also support the post-treatment period as the most appropriate time to intervene [Koutoukidis et al: Attitudes, challenges, and needs about diet and physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors: a qualitative study. Submitted]. While in a vital position to do so, health professionals do not tend to provide lifestyle advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], particularly given time constraints. Therefore, feasible and effective interventions are needed to promote implementation of lifestyle recommendations.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>Theory-based behaviour change interventions suggest that improving diet and physical activity is safe, acceptable and feasible with promising effects on both psychological and physiological outcomes, including quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the United States, the two interventions in endometrial cancer survivors have also shown sustained changes in behavioural outcomes and indicated potential changes in quality of life domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02014;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Quality of life and its components are valuable outcome measures, as they are associated with disease status and the presence of co-morbidities, and they are core components of strategic needs assessments for cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the majority of these interventions lasted for 6&#x000a0;months or more and were resource intensive (for example, personalised materials, highly trained coaches). Although cost-effective analyses are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], such intensity or duration may render them inappropriate for wide dissemination. Furthermore, these interventions may not be fully applicable to other cancer groups given the differences between long-term treatment effects. Qualitative work with endometrial cancer survivors suggests they highly desire information regarding specific late-treatment effects and advice on healthy eating and physical activity post-treatment and in person [Koutoukidis et al: Attitudes, challenges, and needs about diet and physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors: a qualitative study. Submitted]. Finally, similarities in effectiveness of programs delivered across developed countries are expected. However, both the health systems and the causes of obesity differ between the USA and the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite the common focus of such programs on healthy eating and physical activity, these differences might make a program developed in one context less applicable in the other.</p><p>A need exists, therefore, to develop effective behaviour change interventions for endometrial cancer survivors that meet an identified need and can be implemented in the cancer care pathway both in terms of length of programme and resource use. Pre-existing programmes for improving diet and physical activity in the general population, which have demonstrated usability within the National Health Service (NHS), may be an untapped resource. These programmes could be adapted to take into account the specific needs and experiences of endometrial cancer survivors while retaining the core components that have made them effective in other populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a manualised healthy eating and physical activity programme in endometrial cancer survivors post active treatment.</p><p>The main research question is as follows: &#x02018;Is it feasible to design a randomised controlled trial that will assess if the <italic>Shape-up following cancer treatment</italic> programme is more effective than usual care in improving the health-related quality of life of endometrial cancer survivors?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary research objective</title><p>The primary research objective is to assess the feasibility of the overall trial procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary research objectives</title><p>Secondary research objectives are to accomplish the following: (1) to obtain variance estimates for clinical outcome measures to be used in the large-scale RCT that will inform the measurement of the primary outcome for the larger trial and, subsequently, the sample size calculation; (2) to assess willingness of the clinical staff to recruit participants; (3) to assess willingness of eligible participants to be randomised; (4) to examine potential adverse effects of the intervention; (5) to perform a basic economic analysis with the aim to inform the larger trial; (6) to assess reasons for loss to follow-up; and (7) to access the overall acceptability of the intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The protocol has been prepared according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].
