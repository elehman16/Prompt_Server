Several biosimilars of filgrastim are now in clinical use in Europe and elsewhere. Acceptance of biosimilar filgrastim is reflected in EORTC guidelines, recommending biosimilar filgrastim as well as the reference product to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [<xref rid="MDV281C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use have suggested that under-utilization is frequent, with patients either not receiving treatment at all or receiving delayed and/or shorter courses than recommended [<xref rid="MDV281C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV281C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Such suboptimal use of G-CSF is associated with poorer outcomes, with patients facing reduced protection against febrile neutropenia (FN) [<xref rid="MDV281C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a time of increasing cost constraints in healthcare, cost considerations may be a factor in restricted access to G-CSF for some patients [<xref rid="MDV281C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, in countries in which patients may need to contribute to treatment costs, high drug prices may result in reduced adherence. In Europe, the availability of filgrastim biosimilars has been accompanied by increased use, suggesting physicians are more able and/or willing to use filgrastim in accordance with guidelines [<xref rid="MDV281C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>This randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase III study was designed to show noninferiority of a biosimilar filgrastim (EP2006) compared with US-licensed reference filgrastim (Neupogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in the prevention of duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The study also examined if alternating between the biosimilar and reference filgrastim or vice versa affected efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdv281_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><sec id="mdv281_s2a"><title>patients</title><p>Patients were women &#x02265;18 years with histologically proven breast cancer scheduled to receive (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (TAC regimen). Other key inclusion criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &#x02264;2 and adequate bone marrow function. Exclusion criteria included history of myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or concomitant sickle cell disease, concurrent or prior radiotherapy within 4 weeks of randomization, use of prophylactic antibiotics, prior chemotherapy or anticancer treatment of breast cancer or previous G-CSF therapy.</p><p>The study was conducted between December 2011 and June 2013 at 25 centers (Russia, <italic>N</italic> = 10; Ukraine, <italic>N</italic> = 6; Hungary, <italic>N</italic> = 6; Latvia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, all <italic>N</italic> = 1). An independent data safety monitoring board monitored patient safety.

Allocation was to either the biosimilar (EP2006) or reference filgrastim (Neupogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for the duration of chemotherapy, or patients alternated between biosimilar and reference filgrastim at each cycle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv281/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). This design assessed the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of alternating between the biosimilar and reference filgrastim or vice versa. The required filgrastim volume was transferred from vials into identical application syringes by unblinded site staff who did not participate in study assessments. Patients, investigators and other site staff involved in study assessments were blinded. Chemotherapy was administered i.v. on day 1 of each cycle and given every 3 weeks for six cycles. Filgrastim was administered (5 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight/day, s.c.) from day 2 of each cycle until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovered to 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l after its nadir or for a maximum of 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="mdv281_s2c"><title>study assessments</title><p>Patient baseline characteristics including laboratory assessments were reported at screening, on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle and at the end of treatment. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were done on day 1 and then daily in cycle 1 until the ANC reached 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l after its nadir or until day 15, whichever occurred first. For cycles 2&#x02013;6, CBC was assessed on day 1, day 7 and daily thereafter. Body temperature was recorded on days 1&#x02013;21 of each cycle and at treatment end. Injection-site reactions were assessed following each application. Concomitant medication and adverse events (AEs) were assessed at every visit.</p><p>Anti-recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) antibody formation was assessed by radioimmunoprecipitation at day 1 of each cycle, at end of treatment and at study end. Eight time points were collected per patient. Serum samples were immediately frozen and shipped to HEXAL AG (Oberhaching, Germany) on dry ice and stored at &#x02264;&#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysis. Samples were incubated with [<sup>125</sup>I]-labeled rhG-CSF tracer. After equilibrium was reached between anti-rhG-CSF antibodies and rhG-CSF, the formed complex was precipitated with Protein-G Sepharose. Specificity of anti-rhG-CSF antibodies was further tested in a separate assay after addition of excess amounts of unlabeled rhG-CSF. The sensitivity of the validated radioimmunoprecipitation was in the single-digit nanogram range.</p></sec><sec id="mdv281_s2d"><title>statistical analysis</title><p>This noninferiority trial design utilized a difference of &#x02212;1 day (noninferiority margin) in DSN in cycle 1 as the largest acceptable difference between the biosimilar compared with reference treatment. TAC chemotherapy induces a median DSN of 7 days in breast cancer patients receiving no G-CSF treatment [<xref rid="MDV281C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while G-CSF treatment reduces the mean DSN to 1.4 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07&#x02013;1.69] [<xref rid="MDV281C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Assuming an expected mean difference of 0.25 days with a common standard deviation of 1.5 days, a 10% dropout rate and a noninferiority margin of &#x02212;1 day, 96 patients per group (biosimilar or reference) were required to have 90% power for showing noninferiority based on a one-sided 97.5% CI.</p></sec><sec id="mdv281_s2e"><title>primary efficacy analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy end point was a comparison of mean DSN (number of consecutive days from ANC &#x0003c;0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l to &#x02265;0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l) during cycle 1 of chemotherapy between biosimilar and reference treatments. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the per-protocol (PP) set including all patients who completed the first chemotherapy cycle without major protocol deviations. A one-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in mean DSN was derived from an analysis of co-variance adjusted for treatment group, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (stratification factor) and baseline ANC used, with noninferiority of the biosimilar confirmed if the lower limit was larger than &#x02212;1 day. In addition, an analysis of variance including only the factor &#x02018;treatment group&#x02019; was carried out for the primary efficacy end point. To evaluate the robustness of the PP results, the primary end point using the full analysis set (FAS: all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication, analyzed according to randomization allocation) was also analyzed. Since five patients had a missing ANC at baseline, their ANC at screening visit was used. The ANC adjacent to a missing post-baseline ANC was used for DSN for a further five patients.</p></sec><sec id="mdv281_s2f"><title>secondary efficacy analysis</title><p>The number of patients who reported &#x02265;1 fever episode (oral temperature &#x02265;38.3&#x000b0;C), total number of days of fever, incidence of FN (oral temperature &#x02265;38.3&#x000b0;C and ANC &#x0003c;0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l on the same day) and hospitalization due to FN were analyzed descriptively for each cycle and across all cycles.

Similar ANC profiles were observed in both treatments. The number of patients with FN, although slightly higher in the biosimilar arm (4.7% versus 1.9% with reference), was still in the expected range of variability. Previous studies have shown that G-CSF is effective in reducing FN risk following chemotherapy, with incidence of FN in the first cycle ranging from 7% to 15% [<xref rid="MDV281C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV281C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], higher than observed in this study. Hospitalization due to FN, incidence of infections, depth and time of ANC nadir and time to ANC recovery in cycle 1 and across all cycles were all similar between the biosimilar and reference groups.</p><p>Results of this study substantiate findings of previous studies with this biosimilar filgrastim [<xref rid="MDV281C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are consistent with results of reference filgrastim studies in patients with breast cancer [<xref rid="MDV281C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="MDV281C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similar results comparable with the reference have also been reported with filgrastim biosimilars approved in Europe other than EP2006 [<xref rid="MDV281C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MDV281C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDV281C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>No clinically meaningful differences were observed between the well-known safety profile of the reference and the biosimilar filgrastim. Most frequently reported AEs were alopecia, nausea, asthenia, fatigue and bone pain. The observed safety pattern is consistent with findings in other studies of filgrastim [<xref rid="MDV281C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="MDV281C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Alternating between the biosimilar and the reference or vice versa showed no clinically meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety. The immunogenic response to filgrastim assessed under the conditions of repeated alternating and nonalternating of products also showed no increased risk of developing anti-rhG-CSF antibodies, which is in accordance with the low immunogenic potential of filgrastim. The lack of an immunogenic response against biosimilar filgrastim is consistent with postmarketing surveillance where there have been no reports of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="MDV281C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The study was conducted in Eastern European countries primarily for feasibility reasons. Patients were treated with TAC according to the approved label and international treatment guidelines. Inclusion and exclusion criteria ensured a homogenous population that is representative of breast cancer patients worldwide. The dose-limiting hematological toxicity of frequent grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia represents a well-established model for studying and comparing G-CSFs. Since the mechanism of action of filgrastim is mediated by selective binding to the G-CSF receptor and is the same across different patient populations, similarity between the biosimilar and reference in the prevention of severe neutropenia shown in breast cancer patients can be extrapolated to other patient populations.</p><p>Medical products are approved on the basis of clinical trials that involve relatively small numbers of patients. Once medical products become available to the general population and for long-term use, postmarketing surveillance is required to collect safety data. This is a continuous process of evaluation that is accompanied by steps to improve their safe use.</p><p>This study demonstrates that biosimilar and reference filgrastim are similar with no clinically meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety (also while alternating between the treatments) in the prevention of severe neutropenia in breast cancer patients receiving (neo)-adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Biosimilar filgrastim could represent an important alternative, benefiting public health by increasing access to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="mdv281_s6"><title>funding</title><p>This work study was supported by <funding-source>Sandoz GmbH</funding-source>, Austria.
