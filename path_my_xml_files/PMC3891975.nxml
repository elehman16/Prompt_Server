Among these therapies steroids are clinically applied and bosentan is experimentally studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these two drugs to treat inflammation in ALI by histopathological comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The five experimental groups (n = 5 per group) were: saline control (Group I); lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + saline (Group II); LPS + dexamethasone (Group III); LPS + 50 mg/kg bosentan (Group IV); and LPS + 100 mg/kg bosentan (Group V). Bosentan was administered orally one hour before and 12 hours after LPS treatment. Dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally in three doses of 1 mg/kg; one dose was co-administered with LPS and the other two doses were given respectively 30 minutes before and after LPS treatment. Vasodilation-congestion, hemorrhage, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration, mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) infiltration, alveolar wall thickening, alveolar destruction/emphysematous appearance, and focal organization were the parameters used as criteria for evaluating inflammation and efficacy of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to the LPS-only group (Group II), dexamethasone treatment (Group III) resulted in significant improvements in vasodilation-congestion, hemorrhage, PMN and MNL infiltration, alveolar wall thickening and emphysematous areas. Treatment with 50&#x000a0;mg/kg dose of bosentan (Group IV) also resulted in significant improvements in hemorrhage, PMN and MNL infiltration, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar destruction. Reducing lung injury and reparative effects of 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan were significant in all parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bosentan is as effective as dexamethasone for treating lung injury in ALI. Bosentan at 100&#x000a0;mg/kg can be recommended as a first treatment choice based on its significant reducing lung injury and reparative effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute lung injury</kwd><kwd>Bosentan</kwd><kwd>Dexamethasone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Sepsis is characterized by progressive development of conditions including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI). Although the pathophysiology of sepsis is not well defined, monocytes orchestrate the innate immune response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by expressing a variety of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6, which are believed to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>ARDS/ALI, one of the potential complications of sepsis, is a serious condition with a high mortality rate (30-50%). Acute pulmonary inflammation is mediated by a number of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by a variety of inflammatory cells. Direct cell damage by ROS is caused by the oxidation of cell membrane lipid moieties. ROS can be produced by activated macrophages, endothelial cells, or polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The infiltration of PMN is mediated by a chemokine gradient and may be the key event that drives a pulmonary oxidant damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>To date, treatment strategies for ARDS/ALI have shown limited success in improving clinical outcomes, with the exception of low tidal volume mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Considering the evidence that inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of ARDS/ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], therapies that attenuate this inflammation &#x02013; such as corticosteroids, potent anti-inflammatory agents and immunomodulators, which act in multiple stages of the inflammatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] &#x02013; should be investigated. There are two opposing views concerning the use of steroids in treating ARDS/ALI. One criticism is that steroids are ineffective in the early or late management of ARDS/ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; however, there have been positive reports that the use of steroids significantly increased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus the role of steroids in the treatment of ARDS/ALI is debatable.</p><p>Treatment options of ARDS/ALI also include experimental drugs reducing lung injury similar to corticosteroids. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor antagonist bosentan is one of such drugs. Endothelin has four receptors (ET-A, ET-B1, ET-B2 and ET-C) and bosentan exerts its effect through ET-A and -B receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ET-1 is a peptide produced by endothelial cells and several studies have demonstrated its important role in lung inflammation. ET-1 has significant pro-inflammatory effects in airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas endothelin receptor antagonists mitigate its pro-inflammatory effects in animal models of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Research into the reducing lung injury of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists is ongoing.</p><p>In the current study, histopathologic techniques were used to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone and two doses of bosentan in treating LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 25 male Wistar rats weighing 220&#x02013;250&#x000a0;g were used.

Sections of 4 micron thickness were taken and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Sections were evaluated by two independent pathologists with an Olympus BX51 microscope according to the following parameters: vasodilation-congestion, hemorrhage, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration, mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) infiltration, alveolar wall thickening, alveolar destruction/emphysematous appearance and areas of focal organization. Parameters were assessed using a 4-point grading system: Grade 0 = none; Grade 1 (+) = mild; Grade 2 (++) = moderate; Grade 3 (+++) = severe.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical methods</title><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed using a Leica Bond-max automated immunostainer (Leica Microsystems, Newcastle, UK), as described by the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

Heat pretreatment was performed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 100&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes. Sections were treated with peroxide for 5 minutes, then anti-Endothelin 1 antibody (ab49591, rabbit monoclonal, 1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was applied for 30 minutes. Antibody binding was detected using a bond polymer refine kit (Leica Microsystems) and diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride solution (Kit HK153-5 K; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) was used as a chromogen.</p><p>The analysis was done using an Olympus BX51 microscope and the two analyzing pathologists were blind regarding the group from which the sections belonged.

A common and frequently lethal complication of sepsis is ARDS/ALI, which is associated with pulmonary microvascular injury and is characterized by severe hypoxemia, diffuse lung infiltration, reduction in compliance, and increased pulmonary resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>It has been recognized that infiltration and activation of phagocytes are mediating factors in LPS-induced ARDS/ALI. Phagocytes are known to play a key role in lung injury by a cascade effect: phagocytes release oxidants and proteases that damage the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells, thus disrupting the alveolar-capillary unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are used in the treatment of inflammatory lung injuries due to their ability to inhibit phagocyte migration to the site of injury and to partially suppress phagocyte reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Dexamethasone pretreatment has also reduced pulmonary elastase activity and chloramine levels, further supporting the anti-inflammatory effectiveness of dexamethasone. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] In this study, dexamethasone treatment produced marked reducing lung injury in all observed parameters (vasodilation-congestion, hemorrhage, PMN and MNL infiltration, alveolar wall thickening, alveolar destruction-emphysematous appearance). These findings support the use of dexamethasone as a treatment for ARDS/ALI.</p><p>Though not applied clinically, the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan is used to treat ARDS/ALI experimentally. Although endothelin is commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension due to its vasoconstrictive effect, it is also a vasoactive peptide that acts as pro-inflammatory agent, stimulating the release of cytokines and production of reactive oxygen species by PMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that bosentan treatment significantly reduced the production of reactive oxygen species by PMN during acute lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Another study demonstrated diminished levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1;, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in rat pulmonary tissue following bosentan treatment of induced emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Both doses of bosentan used in the current study demonstrated pronounced reduction of lung injury. Amelioration of vasodilation-congestion was more significant with 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan rather than with 50&#x000a0;mg/kg. The 100&#x000a0;mg/kg dose of bosentan showed the strongest overall reduction of lung injury among all the treatment groups; this may be attributable to the strong attenuation of vasodilation, which facilitates cell migration. Furthermore, 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan caused significant reduction of focal organization, which indicates amelioration of inflammation. These findings support the efficacy of 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan as reducing lung injury agent.</p><p>Despite the known effects of endothelin receptor antagonists on inflammation in lungs, their impact on the production of reactive oxygen species by PMN following induction of acute lung inflammation is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the current study, endothelin receptor staining using anti-endothelin-1 antibody was performed; staining proportion and intensity were measured to represent prevalence and quantity of endothelin receptor. These values and PMN and MNL infiltration data were analyzed to assess the effect of endothelin receptor on PMN-MNL migration. Treatment with 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan resulted in higher anti-endothelin-1 staining proportion and intensity compared to dexamethasone, but its effect on PMN-MNL migration was similar, suggesting that prevalence and quantity of the endothelin receptor antigen does not affect PMN-MNL migration. However, 100&#x000a0;mg/kg bosentan had the most significant effect on both focal organization and receptor prevalence and quantity, which suggests that an elevated level of endothelin receptor contributes to ameliorating inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, reducing lung injury of bosentan is comparable to that of dexamethasone in the treatment of ALI. Bosentan at 100 mg/kg may be preferable as a first treatment option due to its significant reducing lung injury and ameliorating effects. However, larger clinical trials of bosentan are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors received no financial support for the research and/nor authorship of this article.
