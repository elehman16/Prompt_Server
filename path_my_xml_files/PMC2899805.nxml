Existing options for the treatment of patients with different subgroups of constipation are limited. A new efficacious and safe drug is needed to limit the frequently observed adverse effects induced by laxatives, to improve general wellbeing and quality of life, and to provide an alternative for enemas or even resectional surgery in patients in whom stimulant laxatives cause disabling adverse effects or fail to increase bowel movement frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims:</title><p>The purpose of this article is to assess the current evidence supporting the use of the selective and high affinity serotonin-4 (5-HT<sub>4</sub>) receptor agonist prucalopride in the management of chronic constipation.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence review:</title><p>There are now convincing data from phase II and multicenter phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that prucalopride treatment results in a clinically meaningful increase in the number of spontaneous complete bowel movements, a reduction of perceived severity of symptoms and improved disease-related quality of life in a significant proportion of patients. There is a rapid onset of the effect and the improvement is maintained for at least 12 weeks.</p><p>Prucalopride in a dose of up to 4 mg per day appeared generally well tolerated and devoid of serious cardiac events. Adverse events, most frequently headache and nausea, are usually mild or moderate and occur mainly during the first days of treatment. Prucalopride should be used with prudence and with careful assessment of the benefit-risk ratio until more clinical and electrophysiologic data become available, because relatively few patients have been exposed to the drug for long periods of time.</p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy:</title><p>Prucalopride 1&#x02013;2 mg once daily may be given to patients suffering from chronic constipation for whom laxatives do not provide adequate relief of their symptoms. Patients with severe constipation and slow transit, who frequently develop tolerance to stimulant laxatives, are also eligible for prucalopride

sec-type="intro"><title>Scope, aims, and objectives</title><p>Although the pathogenesis of both normal and slow transit constipation is incompletely understood, there is plenty of evidence to develop serotonin-4 (5-HT<sub>4</sub>) receptor agonists in the treatment of chronic constipation as they accelerate transit, increase stool frequency, and improve stool consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce3_1p45">Cash &#x00026; Chey 2005</xref>).</p><p>Prucalopride (Resolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Movetis) is a selective high affinity 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist that facilitates cholinergic and excitatory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ce3_1p45">Leclere 2005</xref>). The drug is orally active and acts via a systemic mechanism initiating high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs) in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ce3_1p45">De Schryver et al. 2002</xref>). It enhances colonic propulsion and accelerates right colon emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ce3_1p45">Emmanuel et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce3_1p45">Bouras et al. 2001</xref>). Prucalopride also accelerates gastric emptying and small bowel transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce3_1p45">Bouras et al. 2001</xref>).

In daily practice constipation is defined on the basis of a combination of symptoms including &#x0003c;2 bowel movements per week, hard stools, straining, false urge, and the feeling of incomplete emptying. The symptom constellation and underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms may vary considerably among patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce3_1p45">Lembo &#x00026; Camilleri 2003</xref>). Chronic constipation negatively affects health-related quality of life and overall wellbeing, and generates high direct and indirect costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ce3_1p45">Sonnenberg &#x00026; Koch 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ce3_1p45">Rantis et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ce3_1p45">Martin et al. 2006</xref>). It interferes with many aspects of patients&#x02019; lives, including normal work, and is associated with psychologic morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ce3_1p45">Damon et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ce3_1p45">Dennison et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ce3_1p45">Legoretta et al. 2006</xref>). In most patients with chronic constipation no obvious dietary or structural causes for their symptoms can be demonstrated.</p><p>Chronic idiopathic constipation includes normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation, and rectal emptying disturbances with a significant overlap among the subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-ce3_1p45">Velio &#x00026; Bassotti 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ce3_1p45">Mertz et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ce3_1p45">Locke et al. 2000</xref>). They generate symptoms that are nonspecific.</p><p>Patients with normal transit constipation report constipation and associated symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, or straining in the presence of uncoordinated contractions in the left colon with stool traversing the colon at a normal rate. They often fulfil the criteria of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce3_1p45">Crowell 2001</xref>). Patients with slow transit constipation have more severe complaints in the presence of delayed transit through the transverse colon that is accompanied by motility disturbances such as reduced HAPCs and the absence of early postprandial contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ce3_1p45">Bassotti et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ce3_1p45">Bazzocchi et al. 1990</xref>). The etiology of these motility abnormalities is unclear. Occasionally, patients with more severe constipation also have a generalized gastrointestinal motility disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ce3_1p45">van der Sijp et al. 1993</xref>). Rarely, slow transit constipation is associated with colonic inertia not responding to stimulant laxatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce3_1p45">Preston &#x00026; Lennard-Jones 1986</xref>).</p><p>Rectal emptying disturbances, including rectoanal dyssynergia and pelvic floor dysfunction, are characterized by excessive straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation, to application of perineal pressure to assist evacuation or digital evacuation of even soft stools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce3_1p45">Lembo et al. 2003</xref>).</p><sec><title>Role of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the regulation of gut function and constipation</title><p>Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in a broad range of functions in the gut. Serotonin exerts its effect in the body through a series of receptor subtypes of which the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor subtypes are best known in gastrointestinal physiology and physiopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ce3_1p45">Gershon 2004</xref>).</p><p>Binding of serotonin to 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors stimulates peristalsis, modulates fluid content of the colonic content, and decreases visceral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce3_1p45">Crowell 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ce3_1p45">De Ponti 2004</xref>). Patients with slow transit constipation have reduced numbers and function of colonic enterochromografine cells with decreased serotonin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ce3_1p45">El Salhy et al. 1999</xref>). It is postulated that this reduced serotonin activity may be associated with the motor and secretory abnormalities described in patients with slow transit constipation. These data make the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor an attractive mechanistic target for agents that may be useful in the treatment of constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce3_1p45">Cash &#x00026; Chey 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ce3_1p45">Gershon &#x00026; Tack 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Current therapy options</title><p>A variety of treatment options have been proposed for patients with chronic constipation, including nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. However, data on the effectiveness of conservative nonpharmacologic strategies supported by clinical trials are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ce3_1p45">Jones et al. 2002</xref>). There is no evidence that increased exercise, fluid intake, and bowel habit training provide relief of all symptoms in patients with chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ce3_1p45">M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner et al. 2005</xref>). Another conservative nonpharmacologic treatment option, biofeedback retraining of the pelvic floor, has been proposed in well-selected patients with rectoanal dyssynergia. There are now four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which demonstrate that biofeedback is effective in a subgroup of patients with chronic constipation and the treatment of choice for dyssynergic defecation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce3_1p45">Chiarioni et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ce3_1p45">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ce3_1p45">Heymen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ce3_1p45">Rao et al. 2007</xref>). Meta analysis of studies involving biofeedback compared with other treatments suggested that biofeedback conferred a six-fold increase in the odds of treatment success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ce3_1p45">Koh et al. 2008</xref>). However, additional well-designed studies are also needed that take into account quality of life and psychologic morbidity.</p><p>Resectional surgery (subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis) carries the risk of incapacitating adverse effects and can only be considered in well-selected patients with slow transit constipation associated with colonic inertia not responding to stimulant laxatives and enemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce3_1p45">Coremans 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ce3_1p45">Pemberton et al. 1991</xref>).</p><p>Orally and rectally administered laxatives adapted to the individual patient are by far the most popular pharmacologic options for patients with chronic constipation. There is good evidence to support the use of osmotic laxatives, more particularly polyethylene glycol (PEG) in patients with chronic constipation. In contrast, there is a paucity of quality data for stimulant laxatives and glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ce3_1p45">Ramkumar &#x00026; Rao 2005</xref>) and head-to-head comparison to PEG is not available. But although the benefit of stimulant laxatives has not been supported by comprehensive clinical investigations, clinical experience indicates that laxatives such as bisacodyl, senna, and glycerol, tailored to the individual patient, are generally effective. As a rule, stimulant laxatives are effective in patients with slow transit constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ce3_1p45">M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner et al. 2005</xref>). A significant proportion of patients with chronic constipation are dependent on laxatives to achieve satisfactory bowel functions.</p><p>Osmotic laxatives such as nonabsorbed sugars, saline laxatives, and PEG increase intestinal water secretion. They may be used if fibre therapy fails. PEG was found to be more effective than lactulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ce3_1p45">Ramkumar &#x00026; Rao 2005</xref>). The evidence supporting the efficacy of lactulose is only moderate.</p><p>The short-term efficacy, tolerance, and safety of the class of osmotic laxatives are best documented for PEG-based laxatives, which have been shown to increase stool frequency and improve stool consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ce3_1p45">Di Palma et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ce3_1p45">Chaussade &#x00026; Minic 2003</xref>). Obvious limitations of PEG-based laxatives are that only a subgroup of patients with mild chronic constipation respond, lack of effectiveness in providing adequate relief of all symptoms, and that they cause bloating, flatulence, and abdominal cramping eventually necessitating discontinuation of the laxative. There is now convincing evidence to support the efficacy and safety of PEG in the long term (6 months) in adult patients, including elderly patients with chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ce3_1p45">Corazziari et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ce3_1p45">Di Palma et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Stimulant laxatives, both the diphenylmethane and anthraquinone derivates, can be used on a regular basis when osmotic laxatives fail, but their long-term use may be limited by adverse effects, such as severe cramps, eventually necessitating discontinuation of the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ce3_1p45">Shelton 1980</xref>). Tolerance to stimulant laxatives is rare and occurs mainly in the patients with more severe slow transit constipation. In contrast, the need to increase the dose over time is frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce3_1p45">Bengtsson &#x00026; Ohlsson 2004</xref>). There are, however, no convincing data from pathology studies, performed by using adequate techniques, to support the belief that anthraquinone-containing laxatives may induce damage to the colon and its nerve plexuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ce3_1p45">M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner et al. 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Unmet needs</title><p>The treatment of patients with normal or delayed colonic transit or outlet obstruction to defecation is nowadays far from always successful. This is particularly the case in the group of patients with more severe slow transit constipation and in patients with neurologic disorders such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and paraplegia. The main effect of laxatives is limited to emptying of the colon. Laxatives rarely provide adequate relief of all the complaints of the patient and frequently induce nausea, bloating, flatulence, distension, abdominal discomfort, and cramping abdominal pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ce3_1p45">M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ce3_1p45">Di Palma et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective, better tolerated, and safe treatments that normalize bowel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ce3_1p45">Di Palma 2005</xref>). In patients with impaired colonic propulsive motor activity, a gastrointestinal prokinetic may be a better therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce3_1p45">Cash &#x00026; Chey 2005</xref>). Also, in patients with other types of chronic constipation, including those associated with dyssynergic defecation and pelvic floor dysfunction, it is reasonable to expect that the addition of a promotility agent to current standard treatment options may be useful. Patients with dyssynergic defecation may benefit from biofeedback, which produces greater reductions in symptoms, and the use of enemas and suppositories rather than continuous PEG. In most cases however, some form of laxative treatment will be required, particularly in patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia and slow transit constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce3_1p45">Chiarioni &#x00026; Salandini 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ce3_1p45">Chiarioni et al. 2006</xref>). The observation that abnormal serotonin signalling and reuptake appears to play a central role in the symptoms of a subset of patients with chronic constipation provides a rationale for the use of targeted serotonergic agents for the treatment of chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce3_1p45">Cash &#x00026; Chey 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ce3_1p45">De Maeyer et al. 2008</xref>). Tegaserod, a selective partial 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist, and to a much lesser extent cisapride, a first-generation promotility agent, were shown to reduce the need for laxatives and provide relief from multiple symptoms of constipation. However, concern about safety due to cardiotoxicity resulted in withdrawal of both promotility agents after they were approved by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ce3_1p45">Locke et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ce3_1p45">Altabas et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ce3_1p45">Johanson et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ce3_1p45">M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ce3_1p45">Thompson 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evidence for the use of prucalopride in chronic constipation</title><sec><title>Efficacy</title><sec><title>Phase II trials</title><p>An initial phase II trial comparing prucalopride with placebo dates back to 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ce3_1p45">Coremans et al. 2003</xref>). This pilot study, which included mainly female patients with longstanding chronic constipation not responding adequately to laxatives and referred to a single tertiary referral center in Belgium, yielded promising results. Fifty-three patients were randomized in this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. It was demonstrated that prucalopride 4 mg once daily for 4 weeks was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing time to first stool (<italic>P</italic>=0.071), softening stools (<italic>P</italic>=0.036), and decreasing straining (<italic>P</italic>=0.037). Prucalopride also had a positive effect on stool frequency, feeling of complete evacuation, and total gut transit time, but the differences were not statistically significant compared with placebo. Mean spontaneous stool frequency increased by 2.34 stools per week after prucalopride and by 1.48 stools per week after placebo, suggesting a strong placebo effect. The mean weekly frequency of laxative intake compared with the run-in period was reduced by 0.73&#x000b1;0.4 (mean&#x000b1; standard error of the mean) in the prucalopride group and by 0.59&#x000b1;0.24 in the placebo group. The difference, however, was not significant. Relief of constipation was experienced by a greater proportion of patients in the prucalopride group (37%) than in the placebo group (19.2%), and again, although clinically meaningful, the difference was statistically not significant. Dose reduction for excessive gastrointestinal response did not significantly influence stool frequency, stool consistency, degree of straining, or patients&#x02019; overall relief of constipation. Total gut transit time showed a decrease of 10.39 hours with prucalopride compared with an increase of 7.45 hours with placebo. However, intergroup difference was not statistically significant, possibly because the mean total gut transit time during run-in was longer in the prucalopride group compared with placebo.</p><p>This initial experience with prucalopride treatment for severe chronic constipation supported further phase II investigations of prucalopride regimens in different forms of chronic constipation. The efficacy was further confirmed in six other phase II trials involving patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and one pilot phase II dose-escalation study in patients with constipation due to spinal cord injury.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ce3_1p45">Emmanuel et al.

In this single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the UK, prucalopride, not placebo, not only increased spontaneous stool frequency (<italic>P</italic>=0.008) and reduced time to first stool (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), it also significantly improved disease-specific quality of life. Furthermore, prucalopride significantly reduced oro-cecal transit time and increased rectal sensitivity to distension compared with placebo. Prucalopride also reduced the mean number of retained radioopaque markers in the colon compared with placebo, but only in the subgroup with slow transit (<italic>P</italic>=0.069).</p><p>A subsequent phase II dose-finding study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ce3_1p45">Sloots et al.

Twenty-eight patients were randomized to receive prucalopride 1 or 2 mg once daily or placebo. Compared with placebo, prucalopride 1 mg significantly increased the mean number of complete spontaneous stools and all bowel movements per week. It also significantly decreased the percentage of bowel movements with hard stools and straining, and enhanced the urge to defecate. Significant changes in stool frequency, stool consistency, and need to strain were not seen with the 2 mg regimen. This may be explained by a relatively high frequency of bowel movements in this group of patients during placebo treatment. The effect of both 1 and 2 mg prucalopride on mean total colonic transit time was not different from the effect of placebo.</p><p>Another phase II dose-finding RCT including 251 patients conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ce3_1p45">Otten et al.

Clinical improvement with the higher doses correlated with a shorter transit time, with a significant time difference in the descending colon (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and the effect was maintained after 12 weeks.

For patient self-assessment of bowel habit, therapeutic efficacy after 4 weeks of treatment with prucalopride 0.5&#x02013;2 mg was apparent compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Prucalopride also significantly decreased total gut transit time from 49 to 39 hours at 1 mg and from 63 to 54 hours at 2 mg versus placebo.</p><p>These encouraging results were largely confirmed by a further phase II dose-finding study (n=234) with once daily doses of prucalopride 0.5&#x02013;4 mg in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ce3_1p45">Miner et al. 1999</xref>).

In contrast, a physiologic study including 40 patients with chronic functional constipation and no evidence of a rectal evacuation disorder not only demonstrated that prucalopride in a dose of 2 and 4 mg accelerates overall colonic transit and ascending colonic emptying, but also gastric emptying and small bowel transit; the effect appeared to be dose dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce3_1p45">Bouras et al. 2001</xref>).

Overall, 77% of the prucaloprideand 60% of the placebo-treated patients reported one or more adverse events. The frequency of nausea, abdominal pain, and headache occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment groups, whilst diarrhea and flatulence were more common with prucalopride 1 mg once daily.

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache were reported more frequently by patients receiving prucalopride 2 and 4 mg than those receiving placebo. However, these adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and occurred primarily during the first days of treatment. Transient serious adverse events were reported by only 1.4% and 3.4% of the patients receiving prucalopride 2 and 4 mg, respectively. Incidences of adverse cardiovascular effects were similar among the three treatment groups and there were no clinically relevant changes in the electrocardiographic variables including corrected QT (QTc F) interval.</p><p>Based on the available clinical experience prucalopride, a prokinetic with functional overlap with the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists cisapride and tegaserod (both of which have been withdrawn from the market due to adverse cardiac events), appears safe. The drug was not associated with adverse ventricular repolarization effects or associated with increased ischemic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ce3_1p45">Tack et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ce3_1p45">Camilleri et al. 2008</xref>). Electrophysiologic studies with prucalopride on ion-channel currents in isolated cardiac cells showed that the drug had a lower affinity for the cardiac potassium HERG channel than does cisapride, a prokinetic that is associated with a risk of torsade de pointes arrhythmias due to excessive action potential prolongation through HERG-channel inhibition. These studies seem to indicate that although prucalopride blocks HERG channels, a large safety margin at therapeutic concentrations exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce3_1p45">Chapman &#x00026; Paternack 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, some safety concerns persist and additional data have been requested by some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ce3_1p45">Moss 2008</xref>). Taking into account that at the present time relatively few patients have been exposed to prucalopride for longer periods of time, the low rate of occurrence of the life-threatening cardiac side effects related to prolongation of QTc and the lack of more complete electrophysiologic and pharmacologic data warrants a careful assessment of the long-term benefit-risk ratio when prescribing the drug in an individual patient with chronic constipation amenable to prokinetic drug treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic evidence</title><p>There are no published data on the assessment of resource utilization with prucalopride treatment or studies providing an economic evaluation of prucalopride in chronic functional constipation.</p><p>There appears to be less need for laxatives and thus less cost and adverse events that may interfere with the ability to work in patients successfully treated with prucalopride. However, there are as yet no studies that compare prucalopride and laxatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Dosage, administration, and formulations</title><p>Prucalopride is available in oral tablets of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg. The performed trials provide valuable information on the frequency and timing of prucalopride dosing, but it is clear that their results may need to be adapted to the needs of individual patients. Once daily administration appears to be appropriate and this may be related to the long plasma elimination half-life of prucalopride of approximately 24 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce3_1p45">Bouras et al. 2001</xref>). The fast mode of action of the drug with a maximum concentration of &#x0223c;3 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce3_1p45">Bouras et al. 2001</xref>) opens up the possibility of intermittent treatment, but data are currently not available. The effect of prucalopride on stool frequency and constipation-related symptoms is clearly dose related. Prucalopride 2 mg once daily appears to be consistently equally as effective as 4 mg once daily in all published studies. The effect of 1 mg is less consistent and a dose regimen of 0.5 mg once daily proved suboptimal in all studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy</title><p>Chronic constipation is a common motility disorder that may affect overall wellbeing and quality of life. A subgroup of patients with chronic constipation not only has a delayed colonic transit but also a disordered transit through the upper gastrointestinal tract, associated with symptoms of dyspepsia. Another subgroup has symptoms related to impaired rectal emptying due to pelvic floor dysfunction or rectoanal dyssynergia.</p><p>The majority of the currently available treatments for chronic constipation are relatively ineffective, particularly for more severe cases, and have not been tested in well-controlled modern trials. Laxatives remain the most popular treatment for chronic constipation although systematic reviews of these agents do not provide unequivocal evidence that they result in adequate relief of constipation. In daily practice they appear to be generally effective and safe, with no evidence of loss of effect with time in the majority of patients. Tolerance seems to occur mainly in patients with slow transit constipation in whom only stimulant laxatives are effective. A major limitation of chronic treatment with laxatives, however, is that although they increase stool frequency, they do not relieve all the constipation-associated symptoms such as bloating, abdominal discomfort, and pain, resulting in poor compliance. They also may induce troublesome adverse events including flatulence, bloating, and abdominal cramping pain, in itself often associated with chronic constipation.</p><p>Uncovering the role of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and the development of selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists that have clear-cut prokinetic activities offered great opportunities for the treatment of patients with different types of chronic constipation. Specific 5-HT agonists, in contrast to other available drugs that increase intestinal motor activity such as metoclopramide and prostigmine that are poorly tolerated, are an innovative and successful new approach to the treatment of constipation.</p><p>Prucalopride is a selective high-affinity 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist that was developed for constipation, and based on available evidence and compared with its predecessors, cisapride and tegaserod, offers improved efficacy and safety to treat patients with severe chronic constipation. This potent, highly selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist proved an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for the multiple symptoms of chronic constipation. Prucalopride has a rapid onset of enterokinetic activity and increases the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements. Adequate relief of constipation among patients with severe constipation occurs significantly more frequently in patients taking prucalopride compared with placebo. It normalizes bowel function in about 25% of treated patients and has a beneficial effect on associated symptoms such as hard stools, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and straining. Most importantly, it results in improved sense of general wellbeing and quality of life.</p><p>Prucalopride is well tolerated and remained effective in an RCT of up to 12 weeks&#x02019; duration. The most common adverse events of nausea and headache occurred in the first week of treatment in the majority of patients. Prucalopride also appears to be a safe drug and there is no evidence at the present time that it affects the electrocardiogram or prolongs QTc interval.</p><p>A single daily dose appears appropriate. The effects on stool frequency, constipation-associated symptoms as well as adverse effects are dose related. Prucalopride 2 mg once daily appears to be as effective as 4 mg once daily in clinical trials. The effect of 1 mg is less consistent and a dose regimen of 0.5 mg once daily proved suboptimal. The percentages of responders to 2 and 4 mg appear similar. A 2 mg dose regimen appears optimal to start, with dose escalation when needed and dose reduction in the case of adverse events consistent with the prokinetic action that would preclude further treatment with 2 mg once daily.</p><p>Prucalopride significantly increases the stool frequency in a clinically significant percentage of patients, but the effect may remain suboptimal in patients with more severe constipation. Prokinetic agents can then be used in combination with other available therapeutic options such as stimulant laxatives, which were used as escape medication in the RCT, or reeducation of the pelvic floor. Taking into account the rapid action of prucalopride, one could also use this colokinetic agent intermittently and not on a daily basis, side effects permitting. Patients with chronic constipation associated with a disordered transit through the upper gut may also benefit from prucalopride as it accelerates not only total colonic transit and ascending colon emptying but also gastric emptying and small bowel transit. Patients with chronic constipation and pelvic floor disorders are traditionally excluded from trials with colokinetic agents to avoid potential error in the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of these agents in patients with chronic constipation that have no evidence of disordered rectal emptying. Taking into account the obvious overlap of different subtypes of constipation, one may speculate that prucalopride, by accelerating oro-cecal and segmental colonic transit and improving stool consistency, may also contribute to better symptom control in patients with constipation and rectal evacuation disturbances. This is in accordance with the reported beneficial effect of prucalopride in patients with paraplegia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Professor Coremans received honoraria from Janssen Pharmaceutica between 1999 and 2002 for conducting trials with prucalopride.
