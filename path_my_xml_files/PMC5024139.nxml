Flavored effervescent NAC tablets dissolved in water might be a more palatable formulation than oral solution NAC diluted with soft drink.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the relative bioavailability of these 2 formulations and assess subjective preferences between them.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty healthy adult volunteers (mean [SD] = 35.2 [9.14] years) were enrolled in this open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover study, with a 7-day washout period. Volunteers were randomized to receive 11 g effervescent test formulation or the reference product under fasting conditions, after which 19 serial blood samples were collected over 48 hours. Total plasma NAC concentrations were evaluated by LC-MS, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The 2 formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs of log-transformed ratios of pharmacokinetic parameters were within the predetermined bioequivalence range (80%&#x02013;125%) established by the US Food and Drug Administration. Within 15 minutes of dosing, subjects were also asked to rank formulation attributes on a 5-point hedonic scale, with mean group differences analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Safety-profile assessment included treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examination, chemistry, and hematology parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The concentration-versus-time profiles were similar for the 2 formulations, with mean C<sub>max</sub> of 26.5 &#x003bc;g/mL for effervescent NAC tablets and 28.4 &#x003bc;g/mL for oral solution NAC. The 90% CIs for the pharmacokinetic parameters met the criteria for concluding bioequivalence, and subjects preferred effervescent NAC tablets in terms of taste (<italic>P =</italic> 0.0247), flavor (<italic>P =</italic> 0.0082), texture (<italic>P =</italic> 0.009), and overall likeability (<italic>P =</italic> 0.0012), but there was no difference for smell (<italic>P =</italic> 0.0533). All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, with no differences between the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Data from this study of a single dose of 11 g oral NAC demonstrated that effervescent NAC tablets and oral solution NAC met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence in fasting healthy adult subjects. Effervescent NAC tablets appear to be a more palatable alternative for treatment of acetaminophen overdose.

According to the 2015 report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> overuse of either acetaminophen alone or in combinations with other drugs accounted for the highest percentage of fatalities (16.9%) associated with single-substance exposures alone (10.70%) and in combinations (6.23%). In a 2011 epidemiology study,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> acetaminophen-associated overdoses were responsible for an average of 78,414 annual emergency department visits and an average of 33,520 annual hospitalizations.</p><p>Oral solution N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of acetaminophen overdose in 1978. Single large doses or repeated subtherapeutic doses of acetaminophen can deplete hepatic glutathione, which detoxifies N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, a metabolite of acetaminophen that is extremely toxic to the liver. NAC prevents hepatic injury primarily by restoring hepatic glutathione.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The FDA-approved treatment protocol for use of oral NAC as an acetaminophen-overdose antidote requires a loading dose followed by 17 additional doses over 72 hours. Shortened courses of oral NAC (&#x02264;48 hours), guided by laboratory parameters for patient-tailored discontinuation of treatment, have also been studied and are sometimes used.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Intravenous (IV) NAC was approved by the FDA for treatment of acetaminophen overdose in 2004. The FDA-approved treatment protocol for use of IV NAC requires a loading dose followed by 2 additional doses over 21 hours. Both oral solution NAC and IV NAC are highly effective in preventing hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen overdose, with comparable efficacy.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> In the United States, institutional preference for either oral solution NAC or IV NAC for treatment of acetaminophen overdose depends on such factors as manpower and utilization costs associated with delivery of these different formulations.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Because of its sulfur moiety, NAC has a putrid rotten-egg smell and taste, which can cause patients to experience nausea and vomiting and become intolerant of therapy. For patients receiving oral solution NAC, vomiting can be sufficient to impede medication delivery. Gastrointestinal adverse events occur not only with oral NAC solution, which is commonly diluted with diet caffeine-free soft drink to mask the smell and taste, but with IV NAC as well. These symptoms are often treated with antiemetic agents. In a retrospective, 503-patient multicenter comparison of the safety of oral versus IV NAC for treatment of acetaminophen overdose, the rate of nausea and vomiting was higher with oral NAC than with IV NAC (23% vs 9%), but the same percentage of patients in each group required antiemetic medication (25.5% vs 26.5%).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Flavored effervescent tablets are a novel formulation of NAC intended for oral treatment of acetaminophen overdose. When effervescent NAC tablets are dissolved in water, the flavored taste and smell of the solution might be preferred to the combination of oral solution NAC diluted with diet caffeine-free soft drink. Our purpose was to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and relative bioavailability of effervescent NAC tablets and oral solution NAC given as a single 11-g dose under fasting conditions to healthy adult subjects. This study was conducted in accordance with FDA regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence of orally administered drugs.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A secondary objective of this study was to assess subject preferences for attributes of effervescent NAC tablets compared with those of oral solution NAC.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>To evaluate the relative bioavailability of effervescent NAC tablets versus oral solution NAC, we performed an open-label crossover study in 30 male and female subjects with a body mass index &#x0003c; 30 and who were between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Conducted at a single research center, which recruited and paid volunteers to participate, the study consisted of a screening period, 2 crossover dosing periods (Period 1 and Period 2), with the actual dosing separated by a 7-day washout period, and a follow-up telephone call (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Because of the obvious differences between the effervescent formulation and the standard solution, subjects and investigators were aware of treatment assignment.</p><p>The study was approved by the local institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the principles in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration number for this trial was NCT02723669.</p><p>After providing informed consent, subjects underwent baseline testing, which included medical history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and 12-lead ECG within the 30 days before starting the study. Inclusion required being a nonsmoker and a negative &#x000df;-human chorionic gonadotropin test in reproduction-capable women. Subjects were not allowed prescription or over-the-counter drugs (including vitamins and natural supplements) throughout the study duration.</p><p>On study Day 0, a basic metabolic profile with liver-function tests, complete blood count, and urinalysis were administered. Subjects were then provided a standard meal and fasted overnight for at least 10 hours. Subjects then underwent randomization using a balanced block randomization schedule, generated before the start of dosing, to ensure alternating NAC formulations for the crossover investigation.</p><p>Subjects received the first assigned formulation on Day 1 (Period 1), with samples for PK analysis collected predose and at scheduled postdose time points through 48 hours. Subjects completed a formulation-attribute survey within 15 minutes after completing dosing activities. Period 1 ended when subjects were discharged on Day 3. They then were readmitted on Day 7 for the beginning of Period 2. The crossover washout was 7 days&#x02014;from the administration of the first dose on Day 1 to the administration of the assigned crossover NAC formulation on Day 8, again under fasting conditions. During Period 2, subjects underwent the same PK and safety-profile assessments and completed the same formulation-attribute survey as during Period 1. Patients were discharged on Day 10 after a final evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Study drugs and study drug administration</title><p>The effervescent tablet formulation of NAC (Cetylev, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Atlanta, Georgia) was available in strengths of 500 mg and 2.5 g. Each tablet was white, round, flat, and debossed to signify the dose strength. When a tablet was dissolved in water, the mixture had a lemon-mint flavor. The tablets were packaged in silver 2-count peelable foil blister packs, which were not opened until the time of use. The reference oral solution NAC, manufactured by Gland Pharma Ltd for APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Schaumburg, Illinois), had a dose strength of 20% (200 mg/mL).</p><p>A dose of 11 g NAC was selected for evaluation because it approximated the therapeutic loading dose for an adult weighing 70 to 79 kg who was receiving treatment for acetaminophen overdose (a loading dose of 140 mg/kg).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The doses of effervescent NAC tablets, dissolved in water, and of oral solution NAC, diluted with soft drink, were used within 10 minutes of preparation and were administered to subjects while in the sitting position.</p><p>Subjects received 11 g (four 2.5-g and two 0.5-g tablets) effervescent NAC dissolved in 300 mL room-temperature bottled water. After the complete dose was consumed, the dosing glass was rinsed with 100 mL water that was swallowed. Subjects received 55 mL 20% NAC solution (a total of 11 g NAC) diluted with 165 mL diet caffeine-free lemon-lime soft drink (a volume of 220 mL) (Shasta Diet Lemon Lime Twist, Shasta Food Service, Gainesville, Georgia). The prescribing information for generic oral solution NAC specifies that dilution should occur with diet cola or with other diet soft drinks. A soft drink with a lemon-lime flavor was chosen for dilution because that flavor seemed most similar to the lemon-mint flavor of effervescent NAC tablets. After the dose of oral solution NAC was consumed, 80 mL room-temperature water was poured into the same container and swallowed, for a total volume of 300 mL. After the complete dose was consumed, the dosing glass was rinsed with 100 mL water that was swallowed. A visual mouth check was performed after drug administration to confirm that each study subject had completely swallowed the full dose. Subjects remained in a sitting posture for the first 4 hours after dose administration in each period, except in cases of study or procedural requirements. All subjects maintained a fasting state for at least 4 hours after dosing in each period.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>PK evaluation</title><p>Blood samples were collected from all subjects on Day 1 and Day 8 for the measurement of NAC. For PK analysis, samples were collected predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose in each period. The predose sample was obtained within 60 minutes before dosing. An indwelling venous catheter was placed for PK blood sample collection through 12 hours, and direct venipuncture or an indwelling catheter could be used for PK sample collection at 24, 36, and 48 hours. The start time of each PK sampling was recorded electronically.</p><p>Plasma samples of all subjects were assayed for total NAC using LC-MS/MS carried out at AIT Bioscience, LLC (Indianapolis, Indiana).

No deaths or other serious adverse events were reported during this study.</p><p>One 38-year-old male subject did not complete both treatment periods of the study. He experienced a nonserious, mild, and unrelated TEAE of syncope and seizure-like activity (ie, convulsion) without a postictal period before dosing during Period 2 and was discontinued from the study. The event occurred more than 24 hours after the subject received the reference oral solution NAC during Period 1, with the total event lasting 2 to 4 minutes.</p><p>Because there were no meaningful differences between effervescent NAC tablets and oral solution NAC in terms of TEAEs, vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values, the safety profile for effervescent NAC tablets was found to be comparable to that for oral solution NAC.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Subject preference</title><p>The results of the preference survey indicated that subjects preferred effervescent NAC tablets over reference oral solution NAC for all 5 surveyed formulation attributes (ie, taste, smell, flavor, texture, and overall likeability).

Thus an advantage of the availability of a more palatable oral formulation of NAC for treatment of acetaminophen overdose&#x02014;a formulation that better mitigates the putrid smell and taste of NAC&#x02014;might be that NAC administration would be delayed for fewer patients. Unlike IV NAC, orally administered NAC undergoes an extensive first-pass metabolism so that the entire dose passes through the liver, the potential site of damage, with resulting high NAC concentrations.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>The availability of a more palatable oral NAC formulation might also reduce the number of patients requiring antiemetic agents or several doses of such agents to tolerate treatment. In a small, retrospective study comparing antiemetic use between patients receiving oral solution NAC (n = 20) and IV NAC (n = 17) for treatment of acetaminophen overdose, Miller et al<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> found that subjects receiving oral solution NAC required 2.8 (0.7) doses of antiemetic medication, whereas subjects receiving IV NAC required 1.1 (0.2) doses of an antiemetic medication (<italic>P =</italic> 0.04). Altogether, 75.0% of patients treated with oral solution NAC received antiemetic therapy in contrast to 58.8% of the patients treated with IV NAC (<italic>P =</italic> 0.48).</p><p>Another advantage of effervescent NAC tablets might be preparation convenience for practitioners and patients outside the emergency department in selected cases. For example, after administration of the loading dose of NAC in the emergency department for acetaminophen overdose, if the patient is well and clearly not intending self-harm, the patient could be discharged from the emergency department with additional doses of oral NAC (70 mg/kg) to be taken every 4 hours, with scheduled returns to an outpatient clinic for repeat measurements of alanine aminotransferase activity.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>There were limitations to the present study. Data were obtained from a small number of healthy adult subjects, under fasting conditions, after administration of a single 11-g dose of NAC. The PK profiles of effervescent NAC tablets and oral solution NAC might be different in other populations, although that is unlikely because both products were administered as oral solutions. Because this was a single-dose PK study, meaningful safety-profile conclusions cannot be drawn from small differences between the treatments. The lemon-mint flavor of the effervescent NAC tablets dissolved in water was not exactly the same as the lemon-lime flavor of the diet caffeine-free soft drink in which oral solution NAC was diluted, a difference that could have affected the preference of formulation attributes. Because the formulation attributes were not defined for the subjects before the study began, their meaning was subjectively interpreted, and that could have affected preference choices. Finally, the study was open label, with subjects and investigators both aware of formulation assignment, which might have affected the evaluation of tolerability and influenced subject preference of formulation attributes.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data from this study of a single 11-g dose of oral NAC demonstrated that effervescent NAC tablets and oral solution NAC met the regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence in fasting healthy adult subjects. Both formulations were well tolerated, but subjects preferred the formulation attributes of effervescent NAC tablets to those of oral solution NAC.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>This research was funded by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Atlanta, Georgia.
