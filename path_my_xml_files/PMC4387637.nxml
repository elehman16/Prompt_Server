Although exercise has been suggested to resolve this complication, most patients are not active. The present study aimed at determining the effects of twice-weekly, 40-min sessions of pedaling on a stationary bicycle on mean fasting blood sugar (FBS) and 2-h postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) among continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, convenience sampling was used to select 22 patients [age: 51.4 (12.3) years] undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [mean duration: 12.5 (8.5) months] from university hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (test and control). The test group participated in an 8-week exercise program in which they pedaled a stationary bicycle with an intensity of four on Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion. FBS and PPBS were measured at baseline and at the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> sessions of exercise.

This will not only increase blood glucose, but also lead to changes in the peritoneal membrane structure. Such changes include vasculopathy, thickening of the peritoneal membrane, and reduced ultrafiltration (a vital function in renal patients).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Consequently, metabolic complications due to excessive calorie intake and the subsequent weight gain, and increased blood glucose are among the side effects of peritoneal dialysis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As the latter two complications, either alone or in combination, are found in 84% of peritoneal dialysis patients, metabolic control in these patients requires a comprehensive strategy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] As the resulting physical inactivity and exacerbation of cardiovascular problems account for a large proportion of mortality in dialysis patients,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] most researchers recommend exercise to reduce these side effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] While the researchers believe that exercise facilitates muscle glucose uptake and thus lowers blood glucose levels,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the majority of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis do not have physical activity and cannot enjoy improved glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Lack of adequate encouragement for the patients, inaccessibility of sports sites,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and problems caused by the pathophysiology of the disease are among the barriers to exercise.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Despite the various obstacles to motivating patients to exercise,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] a proper exercise program will undoubtedly contribute to better control of their blood glucose levels. Numerous studies worldwide have evaluated the effects of exercise on blood pressure, heart function, adequacy of dialysis, quality of life, and urea and albumin levels in hemodialysis patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] They have mostly used training protocols including 30&#x02013;60 min of pedaling on stationary bicycles for two to three times a week during courses of 6 weeks to 12 months. Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion is the most commonly employed method to determine exercise intensity.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis refer to hospitals less frequently than do hemodialysis patients. It is thus more difficult to persuade the first group to attend a fitness center. This means that individual sports or exercises that can be done at home or workplace have to be considered in designing an exercise program for these patients.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moreover, these patients will need accessible, affordable, safe, and easy-to-use exercise equipment that suits their physical conditions.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Accordingly, being small, safe, and portable makes stationary bicycle a good choice for individuals who cannot exercise outside their home. Pedaling on a stationary bicycle increases the patient's aerobic capacity,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] while enabling him/her to constantly monitor his/her cardiac function and blood pressure during exercise. Besides, working out in a sitting position helps patients with orthopedic limitations, balance disorder, and orthostatic blood pressure change use the equipment.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Cycling and walking are both aerobic exercises. Research about the effects of aerobic exercise on blood glucose in diabetic patients has reported contradictory results. Shivananda <italic>et al</italic>. found that 6 weeks of aerobic exercise (walking on treadmill) significantly decreased fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Similarly, Chiyan <italic>et al</italic>. showed 12 weeks of treadmill exercise to significantly decrease fasting blood glucose in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In contrast, Micaus <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 7 days of treadmill exercise did not affect fasting blood glucose in type II diabetics.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In their attempt to control the complications of peritoneal dialysis, nurses are required to promote healthy lifestyle[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and encourage patients to exercise.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, few studies have assessed the effects of exercise on peritoneal dialysis patients. In addition, there is no agreement about a safe and accessible exercise for these patients.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Considering the need for broader studies in this field,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] we consulted a nephrologist about the safety of stationary bicycles for the mentioned group of patients and designed a study to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise with this equipment on mean fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This clinical trial was conducted for 2 months in 2011. After the research project was approved by the ethical committee of the university and research permission was issued in nursing and midwifery, sampling was started. A total of 22 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients were selected from Alzahra and Ali Asghar hospitals (Isfahan, Iran) through convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria were: age above 18 years, at least 3 months of having undergone peritoneal dialysis,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and being dialyzed with dialysates containing 1.5% glucose.

Hospitalization for any reason, changes in the type of dialysate, symptoms suggestive of peritonitis, and receiving insulin or hypoglycemic tablets during the course of the study were the exclusion criteria.</p><p>The selected patients were explained about the objectives of the study and asked to sign written informed consent forms. Then, they were randomly divided into two groups of 11 each (test and control groups) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The intervention group participated in an 8-week aerobic exercise program[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] comprising two 40-min sessions of pedaling on an electric stationary bicycle (made in Taiwan) per week. The sessions were held between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. in a quiet ventilated place with sufficient light while the patient had comfortable clothing on. Before each session, the patient relaxed on a chair with back support for 5 min. The spine was in neutral position and no pressure was exerted on the abdomen during this time. After blood pressure and temperature control, the exercise started only if blood pressure was less than 180/110 mmHg, systolic blood pressure was more than 90 mmHg, and temperature was less than 37.8&#x000b0;C.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and disease-related characteristics of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients in the two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-165-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The active phase of exercise (30 min of pedaling) was preceded and followed by 5 min of static stretching of lower extremities and adjusting the bicycle at 35 rounds per minute (warm up and cool down, respectively). Since the subjects were not ready for intense physical activity, an increasing exercise program was employed, i.e. the first session included 5 min of warm up, 15 min of pedaling with an intensity of 4 on the 10-point Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion, and 5 min of cool down. The pedaling time was increased to 30 min from the second session and then kept constant until session 16.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] At 5-min intervals during the active phase, the patients were asked about exercise intensity and allowed to adjust the bicycle in order to maintain an unchanging intensity (level 4).</p><p>Using a sphygmomanometer, the participants&#x02019; blood pressure was measured at the 10<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 30<sup>th</sup> minutes of the active phase. Pedaling was stopped if the patient's blood pressure exceeded 220/110 mmHg or decreased by 20 mmHg compared to the previous measurement in the same session. It was also discontinued by patient request and in case of dizziness, loss of consciousness or vision, speech problems, any evidence of cardiac ischemia (chest pain, shortness of breath), and damage to the bicycle. The intervention was resumed only if the problem was resolved within 24 h. Otherwise, the subject was withdrawn from the study.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>At the beginning of the study, a glucometer (Bionime, Switzerland) was used to assess the patients&#x02019; mean blood sugar levels after 6 h of fasting, 2 h after a meal, and 2 h after breakfast, which was identical for all subjects. The measurements were repeated after 8 and 16 sessions of intervention and the results were compared.</p><p>Due to convenience sampling and random assignment of the subjects, the test and control groups were similar as much as possible. On the other hand, Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test confirmed the normal distribution of variables. Therefore, parametric tests were used for data analysis.

Moreover, the mean FBS and 2-h PPBS levels of the control group did not show significant changes throughout the study. In the test group, however, eight sessions of aerobic exercise could make statistically insignificant reductions in both the mentioned values. The reductions turned to be significant after the 16<sup>th</sup> session. Mikas <italic>et al</italic>. reported 7 days of aerobic exercise to have no significant effects on FBS levels and considered low number of sessions as the possible reason.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Generally, 40 min of pedaling on a stationary bicycle, twice weekly for 8 weeks is accepted to significantly lower FBS and 2-h PPBS levels in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In a study on 16 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, Chi Yan <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that 12 weeks of treadmill workout significantly decreased the patients&#x02019; mean FBS from 95.4 &#x000b1; 12.6 to 90 &#x000b1; 10.8 mg/dl.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Walking can also be effective in controlling blood sugar. In 2011, Ahmadi and Ghajari evaluated the effects of an 8-week course of walking on blood sugar levels of 20 patients with type II diabetes. At the end of the study, they found the intervention group to have significantly lower mean FBS compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a 6-week study, Shivanandan <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effects of walking on the mean blood sugar of 10 non&#x02013;insulin-dependent diabetics. At the end of the study, they identified the intervention group to have significantly lesser mean FBS and 2-h PPBS levels compared to the control group. They concluded that since working muscles are more sensitive to insulin, aerobic exercise facilitates glucose uptake by the muscles, and can thus be a definitive tool in blood glucose control.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Ragers,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Bernard,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Baldy and Esnoling,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Isfahani[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that aerobic exercise (walking and bicycle riding) can help better to control blood sugar in patients with type II diabetes. They believed that aerobic exercise increases insulin binding to the receptors of monocytes, which in turn causes higher production of insulin and thus greater glucose absorption, and finally reduces the blood sugar level. On the contrary, Mikas <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 7 days of aerobic exercise (walking and stationary bicycling) could not significantly decrease FBS among the studied subjects.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Such an inconsistency might have been due to the difference in the number of subjects, duration of exercise, and exercise program designs. Hence, further research to assess the impact of longer periods of exercise on blood sugar levels is warranted.</p><p>In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, impaired glucose metabolism is seen in the form of glucose intolerance, decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. Both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia increase the risk of atherogenesis and hyperlipidemia, and can eventually lead to or exacerbate atherosclerotic events (either cardiovascular or cerebrovascular). Exercise is one among the interventions to control weight, blood lipids, and blood sugar in these patients. Research has confirmed that exercise enhances the capillary bed and increases the number of insulin receptors. Since working muscles are more sensitive to insulin than resting muscles, each unit of insulin will cause more glucose absorption during exercise. This reduces blood sugar, especially in mild- to moderate-intensity exercises. Thus, aerobic exercises, which are safe and easy, can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease insulin resistance, lower blood sugar, and ultimately improve the quality of life in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. As nursing care for these patients aims to reduce metabolic complications, nephrologists and nurses in peritoneal dialysis units are required to examine patients and encourage those without contraindications to get involved in safe exercises (such as pedaling on a stationary bicycle) in the peritoneal dialysis units, at home, and even at work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>According to the results of this study, aerobic exercise (pedaling on a stationary bicycle) can significantly decrease FBS and 2-h PPBS levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.

However, since small sample size in the present study limits the generalizability of the results, future studies in this field are suggested to use larger sample size and longer duration of intervention with other types of safe aerobic exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>The authors wish to thank all the participating patients, and staff of peritoneal dialysis centers in affiliated hospitals of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences who assisted us in conducting the present study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>TQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>YY</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Development and psychometric evaluation of the dialysis patient &#x02013; perceived exercise benefits and barriers scales</article-title><source>Int J Nurs Stud</source><year>2009</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>166</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19577751</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ghafourifard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rafieian</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shahgholian</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mortazavi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of linear and stepwise sodium and ultra filtration profiles on intradialytic hypotension and muscle cramps in renal disease patients</article-title><source>J Shahrekord Univ Med Sci</source><year>2010</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>22</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chikotas</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunderman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Oman</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Uremic syndrome and end-stage renal disease: Physical manifestations and beyond</article-title><source>J Am Acad Nurse Pract</source><year>2006</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>195</fpage><lpage>202</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16681706</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hosseinpanah</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasraei</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nassiri</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Azizi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>High prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Iran: A large population &#x02013; based study</article-title><source>BMC Public Health</source><year>2009</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>44</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19183493</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zolfaghary</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Arezomanianc</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Shariat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sahbaey</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammad</surname><given-names>Zadeh SH</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Zolfaghary</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Renal deiseas</article-title><source>Comperhensive Nursing</source><year>1386</year><edition>5th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Tehran</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Boshra</publisher-name><fpage>345</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Peritoneal dialysis.
