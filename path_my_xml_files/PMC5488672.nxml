<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> A child afflicted with facial deformities such
as cleft lip and palate usually affects their parents, because of difficulties in
nutrition, speech, aesthetics and social connections, and also imposing a lot of stress on
them. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a happiness program on the
perceived stress in the mothers of children with cleft lip and palate.</p><p>
<bold><italic> Methods:</italic></bold> This study was a quasi-experimental study in which
64 mothers of children with cleft lip and palate were divided by simple random sampling
into intervention and control groups (n=64). The program of happiness training was
implemented within 10 sessions and the questionnaires of demographics and Cohen perceived
stress were filled out prior to and two months after the last session in intervention
group. Data analysis was done using SPSS Ver.13.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Independent t-test indicated a significant
difference in the perceived stress mean score after training in the intervention and
control groups. Also paired t-test indicated a significant difference in perceived stress
mean score before and after training in the intervention group, but the difference was not
statistically significant for the control group.</p><p>
<bold><italic> Conclusion:</italic></bold> Considering the effect of happiness program on
reducing stress in the mothers of children with cleft lip and palate, it is recommended
that this model can be used as an intervention in the maternal care for more involvement
in the process of treatment and care of their child, in addition to reduce psychological
problems in the parents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Happiness</kwd><kwd>Psychological stress</kwd><kwd>Cleft lip-palate</kwd><kwd>Mothers</kwd></kwd-group><counts><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p>Please cite this paper as: Hemati Z, Abbasi S, Paki S, Kiani D.

Risk factors include race, geographic region and the economic level.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In the
United States, the prevalence of cleft lip is 1 in every 1000 live births, and the
prevalence of cleft palate is also 1 in 2000 live births. Additionally the prevalence of
cleft lip with or without cleft palate is obtained to be (3.6 per thousand live births)
among Native Americans, (2.1 per thousand live births) among Asians and (1.1 per thousand
live births) among whites.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In terms of the
gender, cleft lip is more common among boys than girls (2: 1). While cleft palate is more
common among girls than boys (2: 1).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p> These disorders can result in problems such as nutrition, speech, aesthetics<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and social communications.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These children are comparatively reluctant to
get involved in social interactions because of their facial appearance and their
speech.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This affects the parents as
well. These factors might undermine the efforts of the parents directed at the growth and
development of their children .<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Since
genetic factors are also known to be involved in this disease, there are a lot of parents
who feel guilty over the situation, which ultimately increases their stress level.
Additionally, there are a host of other factors that can seriously heighten the level of
stress that parents go through, including the child's communication difficulties, the
mothers&#x02019; concerns about the stability in the conditions of their off springs, low acceptance
in society and even by some family members, low social support, financial problems,
isolation and the parents&#x02019; lack of awareness of the child&#x02019;s development and growth that can
increase their stress. In fact, stress is a condition which results in a conflict between
the individual and the environment and cause disharmony between the requirements of a
position and sources of biological, psychological and social of individuals. In general,
parents&#x02019; stress refers to the conditions or situations where the parents are facing demands
and challenges handling which takes a lot more than the social and personal resources at
their disposal. In the meantime, women experience is a lot of stress that is essentially
associated with their satisfaction with life.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> High levels of parental stress makes them more inclined to use inflexible
manners, intimidating and aggressive parenting and have fewer health programs and services
to benefit children, then they fail in taking decisions about the most appropriate
strategies for their children. This often has negative impacts on children's growth and can
lead to more destructive behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> Lei et al., found that high stress levels are observed in parents of children with cleft
lip and palate.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The study of O&#x02019;Hanlon et
al., also showed that parents of children with cleft palate had lower compliance of parents
with healthy children.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The results of
another study in 2012 demonstrated the need of parents of children with cleft lip and palate
for psychological and social supports to better adapt to their children.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Hasanzadeh et al., in their study demonstrated
that the mothers of children with cleft lip and palate faced chronic psychological disorders
more frequently.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p> So, considering the fact that high levels of parental stress can interfere with child's
treatment and care processes,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the use of
early psychological intervention seems necessary for effective support of the parents. The
psychological interventions may include happiness programs and creating support networks,
which can be useful for increasing and improving family health and mental health.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The findings suggest that happiness programs
can have positive outcomes such as physical and mental health and optimal
performance.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In other words,
happiness and health compose a mutual chain in which strengthening one will reinforce the
other.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p> Additionally, the happiness training has proved to be effective in increasing efficacy and
reducing anxiety and depression.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>Bitsko et al., found that
happiness affects the quality of life, depressive symptoms and treatment severity of teens
who survived the cancer.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>North et al.,
also showed that happiness training causes changes in family relationships, increasing
efficacy, reducing anxiety and depression.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p> Relevantly, Khodadadi et al., demonstrated that positivist group psychotherapy was
effective in promoting health and led to an enhanced level of happiness in the mothers of
children with special needs.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Fordyce
actually developed a model to enhance happiness.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> More clearly, Fordyce happiness training leads to certain changes in
cognitive and affective status of people and helps them adopt a more positive attitude
towards life events and respond to circumstances and situations optimistically and
adaptively.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p> Therefore, considering the vital role that women play in maintaining the psychosocial-
social stress, their high level stress leads to appearance of disorders in their family such
as anxiety, depression, aggression and problems in the family interactions,<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and since there is no research on related to
psychological interventions on mothers of children with cleft lip and palate, this study
aimed to study the effect of happiness on the perceived stress in mothers of children with
cleft lip and palate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This semi experimental study was conducted from March, 2015 to December 2015 (during a
period of 10 months). In this study, the sample size was calculated to be 32 in each group
(&#x003b1;=0.05, &#x003b2;=0.2) .<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p> Ethical approval was issued by Research and Technology Deputy of Isfahan University of
Medical Sciences (ethics code number: 293076) and relevant authorities for this study.</p><p> The study was conducted at cleft lip and palate clinic of Faculty of Rehabilitation
affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The sampling was done among the
patients referring to cleft lip and palate clinic. For sampling, the patients were enrolled
by simple random sampling so that the first referring individual with inclusion criteria was
assigned to intervention group and the second to control. The sampling continued until the
desired number was reached.</p><p> Inclusion criteria were mothers with Iranian nationality, literacy, ability to discuss and
debate in training classes, and children with cleft lip and palate at the age range of 0-12
years (because of psychological effects on family due to an affected child within this age
range,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and no previous participation
in similar training. The exclusion criteria were failure to attend two consecutive and/or
one fourth of all sessions and discontinue participate in the study, or having emergency
severe conditions throughout the study (that is the participants possessed complete mental
health and consciousness and no mental retardation at the time of the research).</p><p> The researcher completed pretest questionnaires after she described the research purposes
for the mothers and received written consent from them. Then, the training sessions were
scheduled and the classrooms of Faculty of Rehabilitation were appointed.</p><p> Consisting of eight cognitive components and six behavioral components, teaching material
was offered according to Fordyce approach.</p><p> The material for each session was as follows:<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p> First session: Participants&#x02019; getting acquainted with each other, reviewing sessions&#x02019;
structure, relevant regulations and protocol, and training techniques of getting more
active, Second session: Techniques of enhancing social relationships and intimacy, Third
session: Techniques of expressing emotions and developing optimism and positive thinking,
Fourth session: Techniques of decreasing expectations and appreciating, Fifth session:
Living at present, Sixth session: Techniques of giving value to happiness and resolving
problems and negative emotions, Seventh session: Techniques of discontinuing worries, Eighth
session: Techniques of enhancing creativity, Ninth session: Techniques of planning and
organizing daily activities; and Tenth session: Filling out the questionnaires two months
after the ninth session. The training was done by a psychologist as a group and individually
through speech, brainstorming and educational aids such as PowerPoint within a 2-hour
session a week. Also, the participants were given the researcher&#x02019;s phone number to demand
further advice and support during the two-month follow-up if necessary. Therefore the
mothers could call if they had any questions.</p><p> After the follow-up, the participants in both groups filled out the questionnaire of Cohen
Perceived Stress again. For ethical considerations, the researcher trained the patients in
both groups similarly after filling out the questionnaires. The data were gathered by a
questionnaire on demographic data and Cohen Perceived Stress Questionnaire.</p><p> This Scale has three versions, 4, 10, and 14-item, administered to measure overall
perceived stress. This scale measures thoughts, stress-causing incidence, and control,
overcoming, coping with the psychological pressure and experienced stresses. The items are
scored on a 5-point Likert scale as never (0), almost never (1), sometimes (2), often (3),
and many times (4). The items 4-13 are scored inversely ranging from never (4) to many times
(0). It should be noted that for positive statements (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13) the scores
were calculated inversely. Overall, the scores ranged from 0 to 56, and the high scores
showed higher levels of stress.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> The concurrent validity with the scales of positive and negative emotions, happiness, and
depression was employed to assess the validity of the questionnaire. There was a significant
correlation between positive emotion and positive (r=0.73) and negative (r=0.53) perceived
stresses, as there was a significant correlation between negative emotion and positive
(r=0.68) and negative (r=0.68) perceived stresses. Happiness was found to be significantly
correlated with positive (r=0.68) and negative (r=0.43) perceived stresses while depression
was found to be correlated with positive (r=0.57) and negative (r=0.49) perceived stresses.
The results of the study in Iran showed that its reliability was r = 0. 84- 0.86%.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.76. The data were analyzed by descriptive and
analytical statistics (paired t-test, independent t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient)
in SPSS software ver.13.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> The mean age of the mothers in intervention and control groups was 33.3 (6.3) and 33.5
(5.8) years, respectively. The mean age of the children in the intervention and control
groups was 6.34 (3.37) and 5.03 (3.36) years, respectively, with no significant difference
between the two groups by independent t-test (P&#x0003e;0.05). Also, there were no significant
differences in the mothers&#x02019; education and occupation, and the number of children in the
families between the two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p> Independent t-test indicated a significant difference between the mean perceived stress
scores of the two groups after training (P&#x0003c;0.05), while the difference was not
statistically significant in the two groups before training. Also, paired t test exhibited a
significant difference in the mean perceived stress score before and after the training in
the intervention group (P&#x0003c;0.05), but the difference was not statistically significant for
the control group (P&#x0003e;0.05), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p> Results of Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated that in the intervention group,
perceived stress was significantly associated with child's age and mother's occupation
(P&#x0003c;0.05), and was not significantly associated with child's gender or mother's age,
gender, education, and number of children.</p><p> In addition, the perceived stress was significantly associated with child's age, and
mother's age in the control group, and was not significantly associated with child's gender,

perceived stress of mothers of children with cleft lip and palate. In this study, there was
no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in demographics,
including children&#x02019;s age and gender, mothers&#x02019; age and education level as well as the number
of children. The findings of Sharif&#x0200f; et al., were in line with those of the our
study.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, the mean score of the perceived stress of mothers in the control
group was not statistically significant before and after the study, while in the
intervention group the difference was found to be significant. In this regard, Sharif et
al., aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of stress management on the mental health of
mothers with hyperactive children in the intervention group and the results showed that the
program contributes to improving mental health and reducing stress levels of mothers in the
experimental group.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Khodadadi et al.,
indicated that the mean happiness score of the mothers after positivist psychotherapeutic
intervention was significantly higher in the case group than the control one.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p> Nazari et al., showed that increased supportive psychotherapy was effective in enhancing
the children&#x02019;s awareness and allows mothers to express feelings and concerns outwardly about
the disease and thus reduce their maternal anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p> To elaborate on the results, we might add those parents, especially the mothers of
children with developmental problems, or with problems such as reception disability, fatigue
and coping are facing financial difficulties for the child care. Constant pressure and
depression lead to further weakening of the mothers, making them unable to spend adequate
time with the family and seriously undermines their relationship with their spouse, children
and the affected community.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore,
psychological interventions can be very useful for the parents, especially mothers of
children with disabilities, and might encourage proper control of the situation through
education.</p><p> The results of the present study indicate that the mean score of maternal stress in the
intervention and control groups showed a significant change before and after the treatment
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Sharif&#x0200f; et al., studied the effect of
cognitive-behavioral stress management training on the mental health of mothers of children
with ADHD and found that cognitive-behavioral stress management techniques can reduce their
stress, and thus lead to improvement of mothers&#x02019; health.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The results of the study by Valizadeh et al., also showed that training
the mothers with stress-coping skills was an effective way to deal with stress and actually
improved the coping skills in mothers of children with mental retardation.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Hajloo et al., also showed that stress
management training has a significant effect on the quality of life and psychological
dimensions of mothers.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p> Along these lines, Zandvakili et al., showed that group training of positive thinking,
encouraging the participants to be happy, in a good mood, and to have positive emotions,
hope and satisfaction resulted in lower rates of depression and anxiety in the
participants.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, Riahi et
al., found that training the management of negative mood caused mental health to improve at
the subscales of anxiety, insomnia, physical symptoms, and social functioning in the mothers
of children with autism by enhancing their self-identification and helping them use
efficient techniques to resolve conflicts.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, appropriate training caused the mothers of children with cleft lip
and palate to further recognize themselves and their children further, to embrace the
realities through identifying strengths and weaknesses and to cope with the existing
circumstances more appropriately, which leading to happiness in them. Also the nature of the
adopted group training in sessions, where individuals could find out that others may have
problems similar to theirs, contributed to the mothers&#x02019; embracing reality and coping with
the current conditions.</p><p> Inaddition, the findings indicated that in the intervention group, the children's age and
the mothers' employment status were directly and significantly associated with perceived
stress. Because these children, as they grow, tend to socialize less often because of their
facial appearance and speech, their parents feel saddened and disappointed by having such
children and hence become more and more agitated.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p> In addition, since these children need to refer to healthcare team repeatedly to undergo
relevant therapeutic processes, the employment of their mothers can be considered as an
obstacle facing these processes. These mothers, therefore, tend to tolerate high levels of
stress.</p><p> The most considerable limitation of the study was scheduling of training classes with
regard to work hours of employed mothers and therefore the researcher held the classes at
weekends to allow all women attend all sessions. Small sample size was another limitation in
this study. So, it is recommended that studies be conducted with a large sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> The results of the research, and the important role of supportive training and
rehabilitation nurses offer the use this method of teaching, as a cost effective way and
