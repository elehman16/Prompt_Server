Among many contributing factors, free fatty acids (FFAs) have been implicated as the key culprit. As major oxidative fuels for heart and resting muscle, plasma levels of FFAs are elevated in patients with diabetes and they induce insulin resistance, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction.</p><p>In cultured endothelial cells (ECs), the inhibitor of &#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b2; (IKK&#x003b2;) appears to be the common effector in FFA-mediated vascular insulin resistance and inflammation, as transfection of the ECs with a dominant negative IKK&#x003b2; abrogates FFA-mediated insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of wild-type IKK&#x003b2; recapitulates the effect of FFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). IKK&#x003b2; is a serine kinase that controls the activation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B and is a critical link between inflammation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To date, evidence strongly suggests that FFAs induce inflammation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.</p><p>We have previously shown that insulin at physiological concentrations potently increases microvascular recruitment in both cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) in humans. Insulin&#x02019;s vasodilatory effect appears to be mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/protein kinase B/endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment is impaired in the presence of high plasma concentrations of FFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Whether inflammation is involved in this FFA-induced microvascular insulin resistance is not clear.</p><p>In the current study, we examined the effect of salsalate, an anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits IKK&#x003b2;, on lipid-induced microvascular and metabolic insulin resistance in healthy humans. Our results suggest that lipid likely induces microvascular and metabolic insulin resistance in humans via an inflammation-mediated mechanism, as salsalate treatment restored muscle microvascular insulin response, which was associated with decreased metabolic insulin resistance in the presence of high plasma concentrations of FFAs.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocols</title><p>Young, healthy subjects with no history of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia were screened in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the University of Virginia.

Our results indicate that high plasma concentrations of FFAs induce both microvascular and metabolic insulin resistance and that pretreatment with salsalate prevents FFA-induced muscle microvascular insulin resistance and attenuates whole body metabolic insulin resistance in a group of healthy young adults.</p><p>FFAs cause endothelial insulin resistance via activation of IKK&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In cultured ECs, FFAs increase IKK&#x003b2; activity and inhibit insulin-mediated eNOS phosphorylation and NO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Salsalate is a potent anti-inflammatory drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and our observation that salsalate prevents FFA-induced microvascular insulin resistance and attenuates whole body metabolic insulin resistance strongly suggests that in humans, FFAs cause microvascular insulin resistance via an inflammation-mediated pathway, which contributes to the metabolic insulin resistance. This is clinically significant because treatment with either aspirin or salsalate improves insulin resistance and glycemic control in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and clinical trials also have shown promising results. Indeed, studies in obese humans have shown that salsalate treatment significantly improves glycemia, decreases circulating C-reactive protein, and increases insulin-mediated glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Salsalate treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes for 14 weeks significantly decreases glycated hemoglobin levels and improves circulating triglyceride and adiponectin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, acute elevation of plasma FFA concentrations abolished insulin-mediated increases in skeletal and cardiac muscle microvascular recruitment and decreased insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal. This is in line with our previous reports in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and a previous report in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Strong evidence has confirmed that FFAs inhibit insulin signaling through the PI3-kinase pathway in both vasculature and muscle. In humans, high plasma concentrations of FFAs induce oxidative stress, impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation, blunt insulin-mediated vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and decrease muscle insulin receptor substrate-1-associated PI3-kinase activity and glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Increased FFA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species generation, which may reduce the bioavailability of NO and impair vascular reactivity. In addition, insulin has been shown to induce eNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and an insulin-resistant state may impair vasodilation by blocking insulin-mediated induction of eNOS. It is interesting that salsalate treatment prevented the lipid-induced decrease in whole body glucose disposal during the first 60&#x02013;90 min only. Toward the last 30 min of clamp, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rates were not different from the lipid group. That pretreatment with salsalate restored insulin response in muscle MBF suggests salsalate treatment completely prevented lipid-induced microvascular insulin resistance in muscle. Thus, the resolution of microvascular insulin resistance may have contributed to the early phase improvement of metabolic insulin sensitivity, whereas later muscle insulin resistance (without the vascular component) might have prevailed. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that insulin-mediated capillary recruitment contributes to 40% of insulin-mediated whole body glucose disposal and that vascular insulin resistance might be more important as a determinant of the rate of onset of insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Although salsalate treatment completely restored insulin responsiveness in skeletal muscle microcirculation, in the heart, there was no difference in either MBV or MBF before and after insulin infusion during the Intralipid plus salsalate admission. However, the absolute post&#x02013;insulin infusion values were similar to those seen in the insulin control study. This was most likely secondary to the baseline increases in both MBV (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06) and MBF (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) induced by lipid infusion in the setting of salsalate treatment. In the salsalate plus lipid protocol, basal MBV was 21 &#x000b1; 9% higher than in the saline control subjects and only 4% less than the insulin-treated control subjects in the saline control protocol. Thus, the increase in MBV induced by lipid infusion after salsalate treatment may have preempted any insulin effect. The mechanisms underlying these increases in MBV and MBF in the heart are unknown. We and others have previously reported that lipid infusion increases basal cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and total leg blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). It is interesting that the addition of salsalate to lipid infusion further enhanced basal cardiac MBF. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Given that plasma insulin concentrations increased significantly in the basal state, it is likely that both insulin and FFAs may have contributed to this increase in basal flow.</p><p>Inasmuch as salsalate is capable of increasing insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and the plasma insulin trended higher during the salsalate plus lipid study than the lipid alone study, the improved microvascular and metabolic responses could be secondary to increased circulating insulin concentrations. Indeed, the significantly lower preclamp FFA concentrations are also suggestive of possible insulin effect. However, this probability is rather low because both the preclamp (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08) and postclamp (<italic>P</italic> = 0.51) insulin concentrations were not significantly higher during the salsalate plus lipid admission than the lipid alone admission. In addition, insulin increased muscle MBV only by &#x0223c;25% when its concentrations were raised by 10-fold in the current study.</p><p>The concentrations of FFAs used in the current study are higher than those observed in insulin-resistant states. We opted to use high concentrations of FFAs because in the past, we have demonstrated that FFAs at these concentrations blocked insulin- and mixed meal&#x02013;induced muscle microvascular recruitment in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, it is very much likely that salsalate treatment could be more effective in the setting of low plasma concentrations of FFAs.</p><p>In conclusion, high plasma concentrations of FFAs cause muscle microvascular and whole body metabolic insulin resistance in healthy human adults. Salsalate treatment blocked FFA-induced microvascular insulin resistance, which was associated with a significant improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity. Thus, our data suggest that FFAs cause microvascular insulin resistance and dysfunction likely via an inflammation-mediated mechanism and that this contributes to metabolic insulin resistance in humans. Treatments aimed at inflammation inhibition may afford an opportunity to improve diabetes control and prevent cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>E.J.B. has received National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01-DK-057878 and R01-DK-073759.
