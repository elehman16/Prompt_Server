The Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of chronic COPD. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators continue to be the mainstay of current management. Aclidinium bromide (Tudorza&#x02122; Pressair&#x02122;) joins tiotropium as a long-acting inhaled antimuscarinic bronchodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the maintenance treatment of COPD. Early studies demonstrated aclidinium&#x02019;s significant bronchodilatory effects supporting once-daily dosing; however, two Phase III studies, Aclidinium Clinical Trial Assessing Efficacy and Safety in Moderate to Severe COPD Patients (ACCLAIM/COPD) I and ACCLAIM/COPD II, in which patients were randomized to receive aclidinium 200 &#x003bc;g daily, failed to achieve the minimal clinically important difference in improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), suggesting the need for higher doses or more frequent dosing. Additional studies &#x02013; Aclidinium to Treat Airway Obstruction in COPD Patients (ATTAIN) and Aclidinium in Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease (ACCORD) I &#x02013; were undertaken to compare 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g twice-daily dosing. The mean improvements from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> in the 400 &#x003bc;g groups were +129 mL over 24 weeks and +124 mL over 12 weeks in ATTAIN and ACCORD I, respectively. Aclidinium also had beneficial effects on health-related quality of life and other endpoints, such as rescue medication use and rates of exacerbations. Aclidinium bromide inhalation powder is generally well tolerated in patients with COPD, with headache, cough, diarrhea, and rhinosinusitis among the most commonly reported adverse events. Cardiovascular side effects were rarely reported. Patient satisfaction studies found that patients using the aclidinium delivery device had fewer errors affecting drug delivery than those using the tiotropium device and, overall, the aclidinium device was preferred to the tiotropium device. In conclusion, aclidinium bromide is approved for use in the US at a dose of 400 &#x003bc;g twice daily and is a promising alternative to tiotropium.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>aclidinium</kwd><kwd>antimuscarinic</kwd><kwd>anticholinergic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comprises a group of respiratory conditions that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.<xref rid="b1-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Most patients with COPD exhibit features of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema; differentiation is no longer considered relevant.<xref rid="b2-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> COPD is characterized by chronic inflammation that causes airway remodeling and parenchymal destruction, leading to persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive.<xref rid="b3-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The resulting features are decline of expiratory flow and inadequate lung emptying on expiration.

Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, which include the long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists salmeterol, formoterol, arformoterol, and indacaterol, and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist tiotropium continue to be the mainstay of the current management of COPD.

M<sub>3</sub> receptors are located in the smooth muscle of the airways and are primarily responsible for the bronchoconstrictor response to cholinergic nerve stimulation. Antagonism of the muscarinic receptors, particularly M<sub>3</sub>, mediates bronchodilation and smooth-muscle relaxation. M<sub>2</sub> receptors are also expressed in the heart, the antagonism of which is theorized to cause bronchoconstriction and tachycardia.<xref rid="b6-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Aclidinium bromide is a potent inhibitor of all muscarinic receptors, exhibiting kinetic selectivity for the M<sub>3</sub> receptor (with a 29.2-hour residence half-life) comparable to that of tiotropium.

This 24-hour improvement compared with placebo suggested the appropriateness of once-daily dosing. A randomized double-blind Phase IIb study compared aclidinium at doses of 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 &#x003bc;g with placebo and open-label tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g daily over a 4-week period.<xref rid="b15-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The primary efficacy endpoint of trough FEV<sub>1</sub> of aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g was shown to be statistically significantly superior to placebo at week 4 at +148 mL (<italic>P</italic>=0.006) and +128 mL (<italic>P</italic>=0.018), respectively, achieving similar results to tiotropium (+151 mL, <italic>P</italic>=0.003).

This level of bronchodilation was maintained throughout the 52-week study, with both trials showing superiority over placebo at reported time points.

Similar improvements were noted in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on day 15 for aclidinium and tiotropium groups versus placebo (+186 mL, +150 mL, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and in reduction of rescue medication use. On day 15, aclidinium had significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>12&#x02013;24/24h</sub> (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and forced vital capacity (FVC) AUC<sub>12&#x02013;24/24h</sub> (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) compared with tiotropium, suggesting better evening bronchodilation associated with the second dose of aclidinium. Supporting this finding was the significant improvements in evening symptom scores for the aclidinium group versus the placebo group, unlike for the tiotropium group versus placebo group. Results of this trial were supported by a Phase IIb study comparing aclidinium 100, 200, and 400 &#x003bc;g BID with placebo and formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g BID in patients with moderate to severe COPD over a 7-day period.<xref rid="b18-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The primary efficacy endpoint of FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> on day 7 compared with placebo for aclidinium 100, 200, 400 &#x003bc;g, and formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g BID was +154 mL, +176 mL, +208 mL, and +210 mL, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 for all), with aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g producing statistically significant improvements compared with 100 &#x003bc;g (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).

Patients were well matched at baseline overall, with a SGRQ score approximately 46.3&#x000b1;16.8 units and a baseline dyspnea index (BDI) of 6.8&#x000b1;2.1 units. In terms of the primary efficacy endpoint, both aclidinium bromide 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g significantly improved trough FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with baseline at 24 weeks versus placebo (+99&#x000b1;22 mL and +128&#x000b1;22 mL, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for both). Of the two doses, only one met the MCID for this efficacy outcome, suggesting clinically significant improvement for only aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g. This improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> with aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g was maintained throughout the study time points, with a range of +105 to 140 mL, maintaining clinical significance. Peak FEV<sub>1</sub> was significantly improved at all time points for both doses, with similar FEV<sub>1</sub> results at weeks 12 and 24. Both doses produced statistically significant improvements in FVC and inspiratory capacity (IC) compared with placebo at all prespecified time points. Both doses of aclidinium provided statistically significant improvements in health status over the 24-week period with a mean change of &#x02212;3.8&#x000b1;1.1 versus &#x02212;4.6&#x000b1;1.1 units in SGRQ scores for aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g, respectively, which met the MCID. A lower proportion of patients met the MCID in the placebo compared with the aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g groups (41%, 56%, and 57.3%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for aclidinium compared with placebo). Similar to the results for the SGRQ, both aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g improved TDI scores by +0.6&#x000b1;0.3 units (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and +1&#x000b1;0.3 units (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), respectively, with the 400 &#x003bc;g dose meeting MCID for clinical significance. This increase in health status was paralleled by a significant reduction in the use of rescue medication for both doses of aclidinium compared with placebo. Further, reductions in the rate ratio of COPD exacerbations of any severity was significantly lower with aclidinium 200 (rate ratio =0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.52&#x02013;0.99) and 400 &#x003bc;g (rate ratio =0.67, 95% CI =0.48&#x02013;0.94) compared with placebo, despite the study not being powered specifically for exacerbations.</p><p>Similar to the ATTAIN study, the Aclidinium in Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease (ACCORD) I study, a Phase III, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial over 12 weeks, compared aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g BID with placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD.<xref rid="b20-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The subjects had an average age of 64.2&#x000b1;9.4 years, 53% were male, and 44.8% were current smokers with a smoking history of 54.3&#x000b1;26.8 pack-years. Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> was 47.2%&#x000b1;14.1% predicted an average baseline SGRQ of 46.5&#x000b1;17.1 units and BDI of 6.4&#x000b1;2.1 units. For the primary efficacy outcomes, aclidinium 200 &#x003bc;g statistically significantly increased trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks (+86 mL, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), while aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g both clinically and statistically significantly increased trough FEV<sub>1</sub> (+124 mL, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). In addition, both doses were associated with significant improvements in peak FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks (+146 mL, +192 mL, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 for both). Both IC and mean FVC AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3/3h</sub> statistically significantly improved from baseline compared with placebo at the end of 12 weeks. In the first week, maximal bronchodilation was achieved and maintained throughout the study. Mean improvements in SGRQ scores compared with placebo at 12 weeks were &#x02212;2.7 units in aclidinium 200 &#x003bc;g (<italic>P</italic>=0.013) and &#x02212;2.5 units in aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g (<italic>P</italic>=0.019), meeting statistical but not clinical significance. Similarly, statistically significant improvements were found for both doses at week 12 in the TDI score, with aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g achieving clinical significance. Non-validated questionnaires developed by the sponsor specifically for this study were utilized to assess changes in symptoms and rescue medication use. Compared to placebo, aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g produced significant improvements in daily symptoms at 12 weeks, with aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g numerically higher than 200 &#x003bc;g. Aclidinium 200 &#x003bc;g did not meet statistical significance in improvement of nighttime breathing and nighttime sputum production, where the 400 &#x003bc;g dose also did not meet statistical significance in improvement in sputum production. Both doses of aclidinium were associated with significant reductions in rescue medication use at the end of the 12-week period. Both doses of aclidinium were associated with significant reductions in rescue medication use at the end of the 12-week period. Similar to the ATTAIN study, a reduction in rates of COPD exacerbations of any kind with aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g compared with placebo was demonstrated, with 0.55, 0.41, and 0.79 exacerbations, respectively, resultant per patient year.

For patients re-randomized from placebo to aclidinium, improvements were seen in FEV<sub>1</sub> similar to those seen in the initial ACCORD I study, although results were not reported. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in SGRQ scores occurred at 52 weeks in the continuous aclidinium group, with a mean improvement of &#x02212;7.0 units in 200 &#x003bc;g and &#x02212;7.9 units in the 400 &#x003bc;g group. In patients changed from placebo to aclidinium, clinically and statistically significant improvements in SGRQ scores also occurred with improvements of &#x02212;4.9 units in the 200 &#x003bc;g group and &#x02212;5.7 units in the 400 &#x003bc;g group. All groups also experienced reduced use of rescue medication for the treatment of COPD symptoms.</p><p>A third Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe COPD comparing aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g with placebo over a 12-week period, ACCORD II, was undertaken to confirm results of previous trials.<xref rid="b22-copd-9-369" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This study was performed in patients with an average age of 62.8&#x000b1;8.9 years and 53.1% of subjects were male. Approximately 53.3% of patients were current smokers, with a 53.8&#x000b1;29.1 pack-year history. Baseline pulmonary function showed an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 52.5%&#x000b1;13.4% predicted, a baseline SGRQ score of 49&#x000b1;17.6 units, and TDI of 6.2&#x000b1;2.1 units. Two patients in the placebo group had mild COPD and one patient in the aclidinium 200 &#x003bc;g group had very severe COPD discovered after randomization. Additionally, an uneven dispersion of patients with moderate and severe COPD existed between the placebo and both aclidinium groups, with more moderate COPD favored in the placebo group and more severe COPD in the aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g group. The primary efficacy endpoint of trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks was statistically but not clinically significantly superior to placebo, with an improvement of +51 mL and +72 mL for aclidinium 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g BID, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for both). Patients also showed improvements in peak FEV<sub>1</sub>, IC, and FVC from baseline in both aclidinium groups compared with placebo.

Until recently, tiotropium was the only long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist available for use in the US. Although limited head-to-head trials comparing the efficacy and safety of tiotropium and aclidinium have been conducted, placebo-controlled trials show they are comparable in terms of improving lung function and health status in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Clinical studies suggest a good safety profile and low incidence of both anticholinergic side effects and medication-related cardiovascular events. The adverse events most commonly reported with aclidinium use were headache, cough, diarrhea, and rhinosinusitis. Cardiovascular side effects were rarely reported in two extension trials and one dedicated safety study (all of 52 weeks&#x02019; duration). Post-marketing studies will be conducted to further determine the risk of potential cardiovascular side effects.</p><p>The choice of agent should also consider patient preference for dosing schedule and administration. Once-daily dosing would be expected to be the preferred option, however, studies that examined patient satisfaction found the aclidinium delivery device was preferred to the tiotropium device. Aclidinium&#x02019;s feedback mechanisms appear to reinforce proper administration with fewer administration errors compared with the tiotropium inhaler.</p><p>Aclidinium bromide, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, is approved for use in the US at a dose of 400 &#x003bc;g BID for the maintenance treatment of COPD. It is a promising alternative to tiotropium, having demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in several clinical trials. Future studies will likely include products that combine muscarinic receptor antagonists and long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists in one device.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
