using electromyographic biofeedback (EMGBF) and ultrasound biofeedback (USBF) on maximum
voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), pain assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
and vastus medialis oblique (VMO) thickness in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty females over 65&#x02005;years of age who had been diagnosed with
knee osteoarthritis were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups, each comprising
of 10 subjects. The Subjects in the EMGBF training and USBF training groups were trained
with the corresponding physical training exercise program targeting the vastus medialis
oblique, whereas the subjects in the control group were treated with conventional physical
therapies, such as a hot pack, ultrasound, and transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation. Subjects in each group were trained or treated for 20&#x02005;min, 3 times a week for
8 weeks. [Results] The MVIC in the EMGBF and USBF training groups was significantly
increased compared with that in the control group, and the VAS score (for measurement of
pain) in the EMGBF and USBF training groups was significantly decreased compared with that
in the control group. Only the EMGBF training group showed a significantly increased VMO
thickness compared with before training. [Conclusion] These results suggest that USBF
training is similar to EMGBF training in terms of its effectiveness and is helpful for
treating patients with knee OA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Conventional physical therapy</kwd><kwd>Electromyographic biofeedback</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound biofeedback</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disease in the elderly<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is estimated that the prevalence
rate of this disease in the population over 65&#x02005;years of age is 38.1% in South Korea and that
the percentage of women affected by this disease is three times higher than that of men
affected by this disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent survey
in India reported that the prevalence of OA in the elderly over 65&#x02005;years of age was 60.3% in
urban populations and 32.6% in rural populations<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and knee OA affects approximately 9.3 million Americans<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Knee OA is accompanied by pain and
weakening of the quadriceps in general<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and it affects a person&#x02019;s walking ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The weakening of the quadriceps in particular makes the knee joint
unstable, thereby resulting in less frequent use of the knee joint, and as a result,
weakening of the muscle worsens<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
weakness of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) causes an increase in joint pain, and it is
related to the lower knee extension strength and range of joint motion<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to animal studies, degenerative arthritis is
associated with the muscle volume in the infiltrated joints and decreased strength of the
antigravity muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Quadriceps volume
rather than quadriceps activation is a far more reliable prognostic factor<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in the VMO size after
treatment of knee OA was reported to ameliorate pain in the afflicted joint and to be good
for compensating for structural changes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the quadriceps muscle in patients
with knee OA was found to be lower than that of the quadriceps muscle in a normal
person<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reduced MVIC of patients
with knee OA can be improved by voluntary quadriceps activation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this is
considered an adequate and reliable method for assessment of the effect of therapeutic
exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isometric exercise was found to be easily applicable in the
elderly suffering from knee OA for improving the MVIC of the quadriceps<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, isometric exercise employing biofeedback has been introduced for treatment of
patients with OA. The EMG biofeedback device transforms the action potential of the muscle
into visual or audible signals<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> so that
it can increase or decrease the level of voluntary activity, and it is effective in
generating active participation of patients during treatment<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The real-time information obtained from electromyographic
biofeedback (EMGBF) can lead to adequate muscle contraction, thus maintaining body alignment
and normal body movement<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was
reported that selective strengthening of the VMO with this type of the treatment resolved
malalignment of the patellofemoral joint<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultrasound biofeedback (USBF) has been used to measure
cross-sectional area and thickness by visualizing real-time muscle activity and
contraction<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it can detect and measure specific muscle activity during
isometric contraction<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been
recognized that ultrasound is useful for differentiating between the type of muscle
contraction and the timing of muscle activation, and it could be an important part of
rehabilitation<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Callaghan et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> employed ultrasound to quantify the
contraction of the quadriceps and suggested that physical therapy and rehabilitation
programs using ultrasound would be feasible.</p><p>USBF training has been used for abdominal muscle training or for studying the effect of
pelvic floor muscle training for managing urinary incontinence<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there
are apparently no other studies employing USBF for knee OA. In addition, a comparative study
between the effects of EMGBF training and USBF training on knee OA has not yet been
reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of EMGBF training or USBF training on
the MVIC of the quadriceps, pain, and VMO thickness in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was performed in elderly women who visited welfare facilities for the aged in
Jinju City, Gyeongsangnam-do. Fifty subjects diagnosed with knee OA were selected through
a survey. Ultimately, 30 subjects, in whom the disease had been diagnosed radiographically
and the inside of the affected side of the knee had been viewed by anteroposterior
radiographs, participated in this study. Subjects who had a BMI of more than 38, who were
being treated with steroid injections, who had rheumatoid arthritis, or who had had
surgery on the knee joint in the last 6 months were excluded. The mean age of the subjects
was 72.8&#x000b1;8.8&#x02005;years, mean height of the subjects was 158.2&#x000b1;6.0&#x02005;cm, mean body weight of
subjects was 60.7&#x000b1;7.5&#x02005;kg, and mean BMI of the subjects was 24.3&#x000b1;2.5. We classified the
cartilage defects in the patella according to the Outerbridge classification<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean Outerbridge osteoarthritis
grade was 2.5&#x000b1;0.9, and tests for homogeneity of variances using Levene&#x02019;s F statistics
showed that there was no inconsistency in the equal variance hypothesis in the medial,
lateral tibiofemoral, and patellofemoral joints (p&#x0003e;0.05). In the subjects who suffered
from OA on both sides of the knee joints, the severe side was selected for therapeutic
intervention. Every subject provided written informed consent for participation in the
study. This study was approved by the IRB of the International University of Korea.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized, and single-blind clinical investigation. The
subjects were assigned randomly to three groups by computerized number generators, and
each group comprised of 10 subjects. The first group was the electromyographic biofeedback
(EMGBF) training group, the second group was the ultrasound biofeedback (USBF) training
group, and the third was the control group, CPT group, which received a hot pack,
ultrasound, and TENS.</p><p>The Myomed 932 (Enraf-Nonius, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) was used for EMGBF training.
This device is a complete unit for EMG feedback, and the EMG signal when the muslces
contract is graphically reproduced. Electromyographic electrodes were attached as
suggested in the Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of SENIAM
protocol<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prior to placing the
electrodes, the skin area was shaved, and if necessary, it was cleaned and disinfected
with alcohol to reduce skin impedance. A skin adherent surface electrode was used to
record the muscle activity. Two electrodes were attached 4&#x02005;cm above and 3&#x02005;cm medial to the
superior medial border of the patella to record the recruitment of the VMO. The ground
electrode was attached 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;cm below the patella on the same side. The subjects laid down
on the floor by straightening their knees, propping a rolled hand towel behind the knee,
and bending the knee joint naturally. They were then instructed to straighten the knee
(&#x0201c;extend the knee and pull the patella towards themselves&#x0201d;) maximally for 5 sec beyond the
threshold level to monitor the VMO activity<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the actual training session, the subjects were allowed to
relax for 10 sec after at least 5 sec of contracting the VMO beyond the threshold level.
The contracting and relaxing exercise was repeated during 20&#x02005;min sessions, 3 sessions a
week, for 8 weeks.</p><p>A Mylab<sup>TM</sup>One ultrasound system (Esaote, Genoa, Italy) was used for USBF
training. This device is a dedicated ultrasound system and has up-to-date image and data
management capabilities. A linear probe was placed 4&#x02005;cm above and 3&#x02005;cm medial to the upper
edge of the patella in this group. Minimal pressure just adequate enough to attach the
whole surface of the probe to the skin was applied, and the patients were provided with
audible signals for 5 seconds. During the first session, the participants were trained for
the muscle contraction mode using manual palpation and feedback to optimize the VMO
contraction quality. The training included the mode of muscle contraction devoid of a
disturbed posture affecting muscle contraction<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. During subsequent sessions, the physical therapist encouraged
the subjects to keep practicing while reviewing and reinforcing the VMO contraction
technique adequately<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Articles
describing training of the pelvic floor muscles were referenced, since a training
technique for VMO contraction could not be found. The training period, exercise time, and
session numbers were the same as those in the EMGBF training schedule.</p><p>For the control group, a conventional physical therapy, including a hot pack (Daewha
Medipia, Busan, Republic of Korea; 15&#x02005;min), ultrasound (Ito, Tokyo, Japan; 1&#x02005;MHz
continuous at 1.2&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5&#x02005;min), and TENS (Homerlon, Tokyo, Japan; auto
lower soft program for 15&#x02005;min), was carried out as per the same schedule used in the
experimental groups<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A strength dynamometer (TSD121C, Biopac Systems Inc., Holliston, MA, USA) was used to
acquire the MVIC of the VMO muscle under isometric constraints. The MVIC of the quadriceps
was recorded at a knee flexion angle of 70&#x000b0; while the subject exerted MVIC of the knee
extensor muscles of the affected side. The subject was tested on a leg extension machine
set at 120&#x000b0; by leaning backwards. Straps were applied to the waist and chest to stabilize
the body. The arms were crossed across the chest. The strength dynamometer was attached to
the frame of the machine to record the MVIC. Measured data were converted to 13.2 &#x003bc;V/kg by
a software program and recorded. Three measurements were obtained, and the largest values
were averaged and used as the MVIC<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Pain was scored on a 10&#x02005;cm long VAS; 0 was no pain, and 10 was the maximum tolerable pain.
The pain felt by the subjects at rest was scored on the scale through self-reporting.</p><p>The Mylab<sup>TM</sup>One ultrasound system, the device used for the USBF training, was
used to acquire ultrasound images for measuring the thickness of the VMO. The ultrasonic
transducer used to assess the ultrasound images was a 7.5&#x02005;MHz linear transducer. Values in
the gain (G55) and dynamic range (C04) were fixed and applied to every examination.
Scanning was performed in the supine position by propping a rolled towel up against the
popliteal fossa to relax the upper thigh. Prior to measuring the muscle thickness, all
subjects rested for 15&#x02005;min, and the arms and legs were extended in the supine position.
The probe was coated with water-soluble transmission gel to provide acoustic contact
without depressing the skin surface. During scanning, the least amount of pressure
possible was applied to reduce the pressure on the muscle. The site of muscle thickness
measurement was mapped using a transparent paper to ensure that measurement was performed
at the same site during the next session. All of the images were digitalized and analyzed
with Mylab<sup>TM</sup>Desk3 (Esaote, Genoa, Italy) after each training session. The
interfaces between the muscle and subcutaneous fat and between the muscle and bone could
be identified on the images, and the distance between the structures was considered the
muscle thickness. One day later, all of the measurements were repeated with the assessor
blinded to the former values.</p><p>The data were analyzed with the SPSS 18.0 statistical program. A 3 (groups) &#x000d7; 2 (times)
ANOVA was used to evaluate the difference between the groups, and Bonferroni correction
was applied to the post hoc analysis. A paired sample t-test was conducted to measure
changes within each group. The significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic details of the subjects, including age, height, weight, and body mass

the MVIC of the quadriceps, pain, and VMO thickness in patients with knee OA. While EMGBF
and USBF training significantly increased the MVIC of the VMO and reduced pain in the
affected side, the control treatment, conventional physical therapy, did not cause any
significant change in the MVIC of the quadriceps. Interestingly, only the EMGBF training
group showed a significant increase in the VMO thickness, whereas the other two groups did
not show any change in the VMO thickness.</p><p>Wasielewski<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lepley<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that EMGBF training improved the
MVIC of the quadriceps in patients with knee OA. The results of this study showed that EMGBF
training of the VMO increased the MVIC of the quadriceps, and this finding is consistent
with that in the earlier studies. EMGBF training during isometric exercise provided the
subjects with visual and auditory stimulation, which might have encouraged them to
participate actively, resulting in improvement in the MVIC<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. USBF training also improved the MVIC of the quadriceps in patients
with knee OA, but we were unable to find any studies reporting the effects of USBF training
on knee OA that could be compared with this study. Auditory and visual biofeedback in USBF
training has been used to increase motor performance<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sensory biofeedback in this study might have enhanced muscle
activation during the early training period. USBF training has been used to perform muscle
training for reducing back pain<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup> and
urinary incontinence<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> and to detect
changes in the size of the quadriceps<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are very few studies assessing the
effect of USBF on MVIC of the quadriceps for treatment of knee OA. Therefore, the finding of
this study that USBF training enhanced the MVIC of the knee quadriceps could be considered
meaningful, as it provides an alternative treatment in patients with knee OA.</p><p>Weakening of the VMO in patients with knee OA leads to functional disorders<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, which in turn have been reported to
increase pain<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason the EMGBF and
USBF training groups in this study showed significantly reduced pain compared with the
control group, in which a simple modality was applied, appears to be that these two training
techniques enhanced the MVIC of the quadriceps, resulting in improvement of the functional
disorder and subsequently breaking of the vicious cycle of pain.</p><p>EMGBF training significantly increased the MVIC of the quadriceps as well as the VMO
thickness. This finding could be due to an increase in the muscle strength through muscle
hypertrophy<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup><sub>,</sub> improved motor learning abilities<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>, or both. USBF training significantly increased the MVIC
of the quadriceps but did not increase the VMO thickness. In this regard, Lucca<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that muscle strength was enhanced
without muscle hypertrophy when there was an increase in motor learning abilities. That is,
even though the size of the muscle remains unchanged, continuous training promotes the speed
of motor unit recruitment and motor learning abilities, resulting in an increase in the MVIC
of the quadriceps. Segal<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
neuromuscular activation of the knee extensor rather than the muscle mass should be the
target to prevent the occurrence and worsening of knee OA, which is consistent with our
observation that USBF training increased the MVIC without any change in the muscle
thickness. The conventional physical therapy, however, did not cause any change in the MVIC
of the quadriceps and VMO thickness.</p><p>In the literature, there are a limited number of studies on the effects of USBF training on
the MVIC of the quadriceps, pain, and VMO thickness in patients with knee OA. We observed
that USBF training was as effective as an exercise program and had effects similar to those
of EMGBF training in patients with knee OA. We not only observed an increase in the MVIC of
the quadriceps but also a decrease in pain and improvement in the VMO thickness. Therefore,
we can recommend USBF training for treatment of knee OA. A limitation of our study is the
lack of long-term training and observation. Because we evaluated the patients with knee OA
only at the end of training, it is not clear whether the improvements were maintained in the
long term. Further studies are needed to clarify the long-term effects of USBF training and
the clinical significance of continuation of training.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was financially supported by the research fund of the International University
