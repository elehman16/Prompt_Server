Because macaque vaccine studies suggest that inguinal (versus limb) vaccination may better target sexually-exposed mucosa, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase I trial in HIV-1-uninfected volunteers, using the recombinant Canarypox (CP) vaccine vCP205 delivered by different routes. 12 persons received vaccine and 6 received placebo, divided evenly between deltoid-intramuscular (deltoid-IM) or inguinal-subcutaneous (inguinal-SC) injection routes. The most significant safety events were injection site reactions (Grade 3) in one inguinal vaccinee. CP-specific antibodies were detected in the blood of all 12 vaccinees by Day 24, while HIV-1-specific antibodies were observed in the blood and gut mucosa of 1/9 and 4/9 evaluated vaccinees respectively, with gut antibodies appearing earlier in inguinal vaccinees (24&#x02013;180 versus 180&#x02013;365 days). HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs) were observed in 7/12 vaccinees, and blood and gut targeting were distinct. Within blood, both deltoid and inguinal responders had detectable CTL responses by 17&#x02013;24 days; inguinal responders had early responses (within 10 days) while deltoid responders had later responses (24&#x02013;180 days) in gut mucosa. Our results demonstrate relative safety of inguinal vaccination and qualitative or quantitative compartmentalization of immune responses between blood and gut mucosa, and highlight the importance of not only evaluating early blood responses to HIV-1 vaccines but also mucosal responses over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00076817?term=NCT00076817&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00076817</ext-link>

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective, it is costly, and requires lifelong administration and continuous monitoring, which is limiting in resource-poor endemic regions. Thus, the development of a safe and effective vaccine against HIV-1 remains a critical goal to stem the pandemic. Of over 30 vaccine candidates tested in human trials, only one has shown a hint of efficacy <xref rid="pone.0088621-RerksNgarm1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> in preventing HIV-1 acquisition, and none have had any effect on immune control after infection <xref rid="pone.0088621-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The vast majority of HIV-1 transmissions occur through sexual contact and exposure of mucosal surfaces. Mucosal tissues of the genital and intestinal tracts are pro-inflammatory environments rich in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, which are the preferred targets for HIV-1 infection. Numerous studies in non-human primates and humans have demonstrated that the gut mucosa, which contains about the 50% of total body lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0088621-Shacklett1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, is the predominant site of early HIV-1 replication and amplification regardless the route of infection<xref rid="pone.0088621-Veazey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, the mucosal immune system is compartmentalized; immune responses to the same antigen(s) can differ between anatomic compartments in terms of specificity, avidity and memory T cell phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0088621-Belyakov1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088621-Ferre1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus it is clear that the mucosa is a key site for eliciting protective immunity by novel vaccine strategies against HIV-1.</p><p>Systemic immunization has been proven to be adequate for most vaccines, including some against mucosal pathogens. There is evidence, however, that mucosal immunity can play an important role in protection but is dependent on the route of vaccine administration. Oral polio vaccine (live attenuated) generates gut mucosal immunity that limits subsequent shedding of poliovirus after infection, while shedding in stool is noted after vaccination via deltoid intramuscular injection (inactivated), although both vaccines prevent systemic dissemination and poliomyelitis <xref rid="pone.0088621-Hird1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Murine and macaque vaccination models indicate compartmentalization of the immune system and the potential importance of the route of vaccine delivery <xref rid="pone.0088621-Belyakov1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Belyakov2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Bolton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Here, we utilize the HIV-1-recombinant Canarypox vaccine ALVAC-HIV vCP205 to examine blood versus gut mucosal immune responses when the vaccine is delivered via two different vaccination routes: deltoid/intramuscular (deltoid-IM) versus inguinal/subcutaneous (inguinal-SC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088621.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088621.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the UCLA Office of the Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Board (UCLA IRB #10-000520) with all participants providing written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this Phase 1 trial were to (i) evaluate the safety of inguinal immunization using an already human-evaluated HIV-1 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0088621-Lehner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, (ii) define and compare differences in immune responses to the vaccine carrier (canarypox) and HIV-1 proteins in blood and gastrointestinal mucosal biopsy samples. The working hypotheses were that the inguinal immunization route would be safe, that both mucosal antibody and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lmphocyte responses would be detectable in gut mucosa and blood, and that blood and gut mucosa responses would differ. The protocol was designed by the investigators with collaborative input and IND-support from Aventis Pasteur (now Sanofi Pasteur). This Phase 1 interventional clinical trial started recruitment in October 2003, enrolling the first subject 11/17/03 and ending follow-up of the last patient 7/27/05.

Participants were defined as &#x0201c;enrolled&#x0201d; after completing baseline examinations but prior to receiving the first vaccination. Randomization, which was not stratified by any baseline covariate, was performed by a study statistician working directly with the research pharmacy. Participants were randomized first to receive either placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) or vCP205 vaccine (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12). The subjects within each of those groups then were randomized into equal numbers to receive injections either via deltoid-intramuscular or inguinal-subcutaneous routes (placebo deltoid n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3, placebo inguinal n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3, vaccine deltoid n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6, vaccine inguinal n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6). All vaccinations were administered in a double-blinded fashion (the syringes and their contents were visually indistinguishable between placebo and vaccine), and all study staff remained blinded to randomization codes until data lockdown by the study statistician following the pre-determined data quality management protocol. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at each study visit to detect any interval/intercurrent infections. Participants were given a symptom diary and encouraged to call/report any unexpected symptoms, and were called daily by the study coordinator for the week following each vaccination. The primary objective was to determine the safety profile of the vaccine. Secondary objectives were to determine: (i) whether deltoid and inguinal vaccinations induced differential immune responses (humoral and cellular); (ii) if detectable mucosal responses arose; and (iii) whether mucosal responses varied by vaccination route and matched those seen in blood.

Results for reactivity against peptide pools spanning protein sequences contained in the vaccine were expressed as spot-forming cells (SFC) per 10<sup>6</sup> CTLs after background-subtracting the mean of the negative controls (consisting of peptide pools spanning protein sequences not contained in the vaccine, generally &#x0003c;50 SFC/well, usually &#x0003c;20 SFC/well). Baseline responses before treatment were established for every subject. These responses gave a false positive rate of 1.5%. The mean of the baseline responses was &#x02212;5.5 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> CTLs (95% CI &#x02212;7.4 to &#x02212;3.6).</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with Minitab&#x000ae; Statistical Software (State College, PA). The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used for comparisons of measurements from the same person across different time points. The Mann-Whitney test was utilized to compare groups of values, i.e. measurements from persons who received placebo versus vaccine, and measurements in the blood versus gut compartments. Note that in the blood versus gut compartment comparisons, both paired and non-paired non-parametric analyses were performed (to cover both possible assumptions regarding dependency between compartments) and yielded almost identical results.

Among placebo vaccinees, all AEs in both deltoid and inguinal groups were mild (grade 1 or 2). Among the six deltoid-IM vaccinees, there were 31 grade 1, 3 grade 2, and no grade 3 or 4 AEs. Among the six inguinal-SC vaccinees, there were 29 grade 1, 5 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and no grade 4 AEs. All grade 3 AEs were in the same individual receiving vaccine (Subject M), who had swelling, tenderness, and erythema at the injection site. Of the six inguinal-SC vaccinees, Subjects C and M halted vaccinations due to injection site inflammation after the second vaccination; the symptoms resolved spontaneously and these two subjects completed the full monitoring and sample collection protocol. Thus, in contrast to deltoid-IM vaccination with vCP205, inguinal-SC vaccination was not entirely safe.</p><p>One subject (Subject S) in the deltoid-IM placebo group had true HIV-1 infection detected only at the final study visit (Day 365) demonstrating 9,870 copies/ml of plasma HIV-1 RNA, and reactive serum anti-HIV antibodies confirmed by Western blot including reactivity against non-vaccine HIV-1 proteins.

To date, no large scale clinical HIV-1 vaccine trial has evaluated immunity in this compartment, and only one vaccine has demonstrated any hint of clinical efficacy. This vaccine, tested in the RV144 trial, was a prime-boost combination of recombinant canarypox (vCP1521) and gp120 subunit (AIDSVax) vaccines, each of which failed to produce their intended cellular and humoral immune responses when tested individually. In this study, we utilize vCP205 (based on the same vector as vCP1521), and test it in an FDA Phase I trial for capability to elicit gut mucosal immune responses when delivered in an intensive regimen of 4 weekly administrations, and evaluate whether inguinal vaccination might augment vaccine-specific immune responses in the gut.</p><p>Past macaque data indicate that inguinal vaccination can boost mucosal immune responses in comparison to standard intramuscular immunizations <xref rid="pone.0088621-Lehner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and our trial evaluated the clinical feasibility and mucosal immunogenicity of this approach. The data indicated that the protocol is safe and well tolerated by the volunteers, similar to our earlier small study examining inguinal versus deltoid vaccination with a recombinant vaccinia virus HIV-1 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0088621-Anton3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In general, the inguinal subcutaneous vaccination route was safe and well tolerated, with only minor localized injection site symptoms.</p><p>Evaluation of humoral immunity showed a discrepancy between responses to the vector versus its HIV-1 inserts, likely related to the relatively large proteome of the canarypox vector versus the HIV-1 inserts, without regard to route of vaccination. After vaccination, antibodies recognizing canarypox could be detected in the blood at the Day 24 time point (two days after the last vaccination), but HIV-1-specific antibodies were not detectable at that time, and seen only at the next time points of 180 or 365 days in 4/9 tested individuals. Titers of these antibodies in gut mucosal secretions were far below those seen in HIV-1-infected persons <xref rid="pone.0088621-Anton3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and appeared to wane in Subject Q. The requirement of several months to generate these responses was unexpected, but the data highlight the compartmentalized nature of blood versus gut mucosal immunity. Our low blood HIV-1 humoral response rate is not inconsistent with the generally low responses detected in blood in trials of recombinant canarypox vaccines without heterologous priming or boosting <xref rid="pone.0088621-Tartaglia1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Papagno1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and may be even lower due to the short term vaccination in our study (Days 0, 7, 14, 21) versus the usually prolonged regimens in other studies (Months 0, 1, 3, 6, &#x000b1;9, &#x000b1;12).</p><p>While vCP205 vaccine was designed to generate HIV-1-specific CTL responses, it was found to be weakly immunogenic for HIV-1-specific CTLs in prior clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0088621-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Tartaglia1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-ClementsMann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our data demonstrated a blood response rate of 4/12 (33%), similar to the earlier trials of this vaccine, and a gut mucosal response rate of 6/12 (50%) overall. Although response rates appeared similar for deltoid versus inguinal vaccination, there appeared to be a difference in the kinetics of the responses. Inguinal vaccination resulted in earlier gut mucosal responses than deltoid vaccination, suggesting that the closer anatomic proximity of injection yielded more direct access.</p><p>Our data also hinted at compartmentalization of CTL responses between blood and gut mucosa. Of the seven CTL responders (Subjects B, F, G, M, R, T, and Q), three had responses in both compartments (B, T, and Q), one had responses in the blood only (F), and three had responses in the gut mucosal compartment only (G, M, and R). For persons targeting both compartments, CTL targeting demonstrated distinct profiles. The highest magnitude responses against peptide pools in each compartment were not observed in the other compartment, which indicated that this was not an artefact of the limit of detection. It is unclear whether these results reflected bias due to weak immunogenicity of the vaccine, in which case a strongly immunogenic vaccine might give concordant results in both compartments, as we have observed for HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0088621-Ibarrondo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and others have observed with recombinant adenovirus vaccination of macaques <xref rid="pone.0088621-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Pal1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Still, the data do suggest that the route of immunization affected the quantity of antigenic access to the two compartments. The timing of sampling was based on anticipation that peak responses would occur soon after the final vaccination, but surprisingly our assessments likely missed peak responses between 24 and 180 days, rendering comparisons of peak magnitude and breadth of CTL responses unreliable. Still, there were observed differences at the evaluated time points, indicating at least differences in the kinetics of immune responses.</p><p>A potentially important difference between our vaccination protocol and prior macaque inguinal vaccination data showing better access to the mucosa <xref rid="pone.0088621-Lehner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> was the limitation of our inguinal vaccination to subcutaneous tissue, compared to deep inguinal vaccinations performed in macaques, prompted by safety concerns. Still, our results suggested that even subcutaneous inguinal vaccination might better access the lower gut mucosal immune compartment, although deltoid intramuscular vaccination also showed mucosal access, perhaps delayed because those CTLs trafficked from the periphery. Anatomically, superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain through muscle and skin, whereas deep inguinal lymph nodes share drainage with intra-abdominal structures. Animal data suggest that direct mucosal vaccination is superior for generating mucosal immune responses <xref rid="pone.0088621-Belyakov1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088621-Bolton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but it is unclear whether a replication defective vector would achieve enough immunogenicity without mucosal injection, which would be clinically difficult in humans.</p><p>In conclusion, this HIV-1 vaccine demonstrated differential immunogenicity for blood and gut mucosal compartments. The kinetics and targeting of humoral and CTL responses varied considerably between these compartments, and there was a surprising lag in gut mucosal responses after deltoid vaccination. Our results highlight a potential importance of route of vaccine administration, and also indicate that short term measurements of immune responses in the blood are unreliable for assessment of mucosal immunity from HIV-1 vaccine candidates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0088621.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
