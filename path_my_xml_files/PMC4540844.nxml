accompanied by cognitive tasks on the balance and gait of stroke patients. [Subjects]
Twenty stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups 10 to an experimental group
that performed a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks and 10 to
a control group. The control group performed a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
exercise program. Balance was measured with the Berg Balance Scale. Gait was assessed
using the Timed Up and Go Test. The paired t-test was used to compare groups before and
after the experiment. The independent t-test was conducted to assess differences in the
degree of change between the two groups before and after the experiment. [Results]
Within-group comparison in the experimental group showed significant differences in the
Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test. In a comparison between groups, the
differences in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test in the experimental group
appeared significant compared with the control group. [Conclusion] The results of the
experiment indicate that a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks
has a positive effect on the balance and gait of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke occurs when vessels supplying blood to the brain are damaged or blocked, resulting
in disorders of movement, sensation, perception, cognition, and language, depending on the
area damaged<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impaired mobility after
stroke causes body imbalance and hemiplegia, that is paralysis on either left or right side
of the body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia results in
asymmetric posture and abnormal balance that cause decreased ability in weight translation
and gait<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impairment in gait and balance
ability leads to limited movement and injuries from falls in stroke patients; recovering
these two functions is regarded as the chief objective in stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognition is the ability to understand phenomena in everyday life, process received
information, and take action. It ranges from basic functions, such as concentration and
memory, to higher-level functions consisting of planning, organizing, problem-solving,
calculating, and abstract thinking abilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive task exercise is a method of recovering function through
repetitious training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the assumption
that reorganization would occur to replace functions of a damaged brain part, this training
improves memory, attention, and cognitive abilities through number and word
memorization<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, cognitive and physical task exercises have been applied
in stroke patients for physical rehabilitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With advanced scientific technology, treatment methods based on virtual reality with a
simulated environment and activities have been adopted<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality is an
interactive simulation designed to give users an experience similar to the real world
through computer hardware and software<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It allows users to perform given tasks and effectively control movements through interaction
with various types of feedback<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
it induces a sense of reality and enables persistent and active exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality exercise programs are reported to improve the
balance and gait of stroke patient<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies using virtual reality exercise programs have been reported<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are few studies on the
effect of virtual reality exercise programs accompanied by cognitive tasks in stroke
patients. The aim of this was to assess the effect of a virtual reality exercise program
accompanied by cognitive tasks on the balance and gait of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this research were 20 patients who were diagnosed with stroke; based on
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results more than six months
prior, understood the research purpose, and agreed to participate in the experiments.
Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 10 (6 males and 4 females) to an
experimental group, which performed a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by
cognitive tasks, and another 10 (5 males and 5 females) to a control group. All subjects
scored over 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), could independently walk
over 10 meters, could acknowledge understanding of instructions and communication, and had
no visual impairment, visual field defects, or orthopedic disease. All participants were
informed about the research purpose and provided informed consent before the experiment. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nambu University and was
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The

160.2 &#x000b1; 11.2&#x02005;cm, and 65.2 &#x000b1; 10.5&#x02005;kg, respectively. For the control group, age height and

simultaneous cognitive tasks in virtual reality space. The virtual reality exercise program
used the city walking (left-right weight shift), hot air balloon (up-down weight shift), and
bubble (total weight shift) activities available in BioRescue (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez,
France). BioRescue has a 610&#x000d7;580&#x000d7;10&#x02005;mm platform and a total 1,600 pressure sensors. Each
subject stood on the BioRescue platform and maintained their balance by shifting their
weight while watching a monitor. As a cognitive task, addition and subtraction by tens; and
backward reading of two or three words or numbers were added. To avoid a learning effect
while performing cognitive tasks, subjects randomly chose slips of paper on which cognitive
tasks were written. The control group performed a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
(PNF) exercise program. PNF exercises included D (diagonal) 1 and D2 patterns for the lower
limbs. D1 patterns are hip joint flexion, hip joint adduction, hip joint external rotation,
and knee joint flexion, and then hip joint extension, hip joint abduction, hip joint
internal rotation and knee joint extension. D2 patterns are hip joint flexion, hip joint
abduction, hip joint internal rotation and knee joint flexion and then hip joint extension,
hip joint adduction, hip joint external rotation and knee joint extension. Both exercise
programs for the experimental and control groups were performed 45 minutes a day, 3 times a
week, for 6 weeks.</p><p>Balance was measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS is divided into three
sections, including sitting, standing, and changing posture, and scores 14 items to evaluate
balance ability objectively. The score ranges from 0 to 4, and the total score is up to 56
points. Higher scores indicate good balancing ability. Gait was measured using the Timed Up
and Go Test (TUGT), which estimates functional mobility. In the TUGT, the time required for
a subject sitting on an armchair to stand up when signaled, walk 3 m, and return to the
armchair and sit down is measured.</p><p>Collected data were statistically processed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) for
Windows. Subjects&#x02019; overall characteristics were evaluated by descriptive statistics. The
paired t-test was used to compare groups before and after the experiment. The independent
t-test was conducted to assess differences in the degree of change between the two groups
before and after the experiment. The significance level was set to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in BBS and TUGT are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table

accompanied by cognitive tasks on the balance and gait of stroke patients. The experimental
group showed a significant difference in BBS in the within-group comparison. In a comparison
between groups, the BBS score of the experimental group was significantly improved compared
with the control group. According to a study by Liorens et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, an experimental group of chronic stroke patients treated
with virtual reality exercise showed significant improvement in the BBS. McEwen et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balance ability was
meaningfully improved when an experimental group of 59 stroke patients performed virtual
reality exercises. Research by An et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that, as a result of performing cognitive and physical tasks, an experimental group
of 18 stroke patients had significantly improved balance relative to that of a control
group. A virtual reality exercise program provides motivation and visual, auditory, and
tactile feedback, which aids in active movement and balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it induces
proprioceptive stimulation from the vestibular system and improves balance ability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, repeated performance of cognitive and physical tasks improves
concentration during both tasks<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase in concentration during
cognitive tasks could help increase concentration during physical tasks; and could have a
positive effect on balance. Prior research and this study prove that a virtual reality
exercise program with cognitive tasks positively affects the balance ability of stroke
patients.</p><p>Gait is the fundamental motion for body transfer; and requires continuous and repetitive
movement of each segment for functional walking<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The asymmetric gait tendency exhibited by stroke patients cause
difficulty in independent walking<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
this research on the change in gait, the TUGT of the experimental group showed significant
differences in a within-group comparison. In comparison between groups, the TUGT results of
the experimental group were significantly improved compared with the control group. McEwen
et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that use of virtual
reality exercises for stroke patients had a positive effect on gait ability. In a study by
Jung et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, use of both cognitive and
physical tasks for stroke patients resulted in gait improvement. Research by An et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that a group of chronic stroke
patients that performed cognitive and physical tasks had improved gait. The results of prior
research and this study are consistent. A virtual reality exercise program accompanied by
cognitive tasks improved stroke patients&#x02019; balance and gait ability.</p><p>This research has a limitation with respect to generalization on the findings to all stroke
patients, since it was conducted in a small group. In addition, follow-up was not performed,
so the duration of the effect is unknown. Further study is needed with a larger number of
patients for a longer time period of follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mahabir</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickram</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gulliford</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke in Trinidad and Tobago: burden of illness and risk
