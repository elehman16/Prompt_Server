Although this phenomenon is thought to facilitate state changes (e.g., relaxation), few empirical studies have reported on whether binaural beats produce changes in autonomic arousal. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of binaural beating on autonomic dynamics [heart rate variability (HRV)] during post-exercise relaxation. Subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 21; 18&#x02013;29 years old) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study during which binaural beats and placebo were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). At the onset of each visit, subjects exercised for 20-min; post-exercise, subjects listened to either binaural beats (&#x02018;wide-band&#x02019; theta-frequency binaural beats) or placebo (carrier tones) for 20-min while relaxing alone in a quiet, low-light environment. Dependent variables consisted of high-frequency (HF, reflecting parasympathetic activity), low-frequency (LF, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF normalized powers, as well as self-reported relaxation. As compared to the placebo visit, the binaural-beat visit resulted in greater self-reported relaxation, increased parasympathetic activation and increased sympathetic withdrawal. By the end of the 20-min relaxation period there were no observable differences in HRV between binaural-beat and placebo visits, although binaural-beat associated HRV significantly predicted subsequent reported relaxation. Findings suggest that listening to binaural beats may exert an acute influence on both LF and HF components of HRV and may increase subjective feelings of relaxation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>auditory driving</kwd><kwd>autonomic</kwd><kwd>binaural-beat</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>heart rate variability</kwd><kwd>relaxation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Binaural beating is an auditory illusion that is perceived when two or more pure-tone sine waves of similar but different frequencies (under 1500 Hz and less than 40 Hz apart) are presented dichotically via stereo headphones (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Draganova et al., 2008</xref>). For example, if a 510 Hz pure tone is presented to a listener&#x02019;s right ear while a 500 Hz pure tone is presented to the listener&#x02019;s left ear, the listener perceives an illusory binaural beat with a frequency (perceived tempo) of 10 Hz. Binaural-beat perception originates in the brainstem&#x02019;s inferior colliculi (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1975</xref>) and superior olivary nuclei (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Oster, 1973</xref>), where sound signals from each ear are integrated, and continues as the neural impulses travel through the reticular formation up the midbrain to the thalamus (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Swann et al., 1982</xref>), auditory cortices and other cortical regions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Draganova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Research findings suggest that music and sound can modulate autonomic arousal through entrainment (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Trost and Vuilleumier, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Rega&#x000e7;one et al., 2014</xref>). Entrainment is a process through which two autonomous rhythmic oscillators with similar but different fundamental frequencies interact, resonate, and synchronize (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cvetkovic et al., 2009</xref>). Classic examples of entrainment include the synchronizing of human sleep-wake cycles to the 24-h cycle of light and dark (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>), the synchronization of a heartbeat to a cardiac pacemaker (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cvetkovic et al., 2009</xref>), and the use of rhythmic auditory stimulation in the rehabilitation of motor functions (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Thaut and Abiru, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have reported positive effects of purported binaural-beat entrainment on clinically relevant outcomes including: heart rate, blood pressure, electrodermal response, and finger temperature (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kennerly, 2004</xref>), performance vigilance and mood (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lane et al., 1998</xref>), hypnotic susceptibility (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brady and Stevens, 2000</xref>), mental and physical relaxation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Foster, 1990</xref>), attention and memory (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kennerly, 1994</xref>), depression and mood regulation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cantor and Stevens, 2009</xref>), generalized anxiety (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Le Scouarnec et al., 2001</xref>), as well as pre-operative anxiety and intra-operative anesthesia requirements (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kliempt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Padmanabhan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dabu-Bondoc et al., 2010</xref>). Many of these studies employed the Hemi-Sync<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> auditory-guidance system (which combines binaural beats, music, pink noise, natural surf sounds, and verbal guidance) which is designed to employ &#x02018;brainwave entrainment&#x02019; and facilitate ergotropic (increasing arousal) or trophotropic (decreasing arousal) changes in consciousness (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Atwater, 2004</xref>). In spite of these prior positive findings, it remains uncertain whether binaural beats alone modulate autonomic arousal. In order to ascertain the clinical effectiveness of binaural beats, they must be experimentally isolated from possible confounding variables such as verbal guidance and instrumental music.</p><p>In the present study, we chose to employ theta-frequency (4&#x02013;7 Hz) binaural beats to facilitate the post-exercise relaxation response. The relaxation response is an innate physiological response characterized by diminished sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and increased theta-brainwave activity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Benson et al., 1981</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that combining exercise&#x02014;a practice known to produce anxiolytic effects (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Raglin and Morgan, 1987</xref>) and improve long-term stress-resiliency (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Salmon, 2001</xref>)&#x02014;with subsequent relaxation training significantly reduced blood pressure and post-exercise blood pressure response to a laboratory stressor (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Santaella et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, exercise followed by conscious relaxation may provide for a deeper relaxation response than either intervention alone &#x02013; a finding that might inform treatment for a wide-variety of stress-related conditions. In addition to the aforementioned positive effects of combined exercise and relaxation training, the decision to investigate binaural-beat effects post-exercise was made in an effort to capitalize on known autonomic effects of exercise and exercise-recovery (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Parekh and Lee, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, exercise serves as an ergotropic stimulus which increases SNS activity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bricout et al., 2010</xref>). In healthy populations, exercise elicits characteristic intensity- and duration-dependent effects which can interact with fitness level (i.e., VO<sub>2</sub>max; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buchheit and Gindre, 2006</xref>). We aimed to induce sympathetic activation via exercise, and then compare the effects of binaural beats to those of a placebo on post-exercise autonomic arousal, as indicated by heart rate variability (HRV) &#x02013; a sensitive probe of autonomic tone. HRV was chosen as an autonomic probe (opposed to other measures such as event-related potentials or skin conductance) due to the monitor&#x02019;s low-cost, minimal invasiveness, and portability. Generally, the effects of exercise include increased low-frequency (LF) power [a measure of both parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) activity] and decreased high-frequency (HF) power (reflecting PNS activity) relative to pre-exercise values, with the net effect of increasing sympathetic dominance (i.e., LF/HF ratio; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Parekh and Lee, 2005</xref>). Recovery from moderate/intense exercise normally involves an acute reduction in LF power and an increase in HF power, which then typically return to near baseline levels within 30-min to an hour &#x02013; resulting in the eventual restoration of baseline sympathovagal balance (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Terziotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gladwell et al., 2010</xref>). It is important to note that while exercise-induced increases in SNS activity can be inferred through the LF component of HRV, LF HRV signal is contributed to by both SNS and PNS components &#x02013; making interpretations based on LF power alone somewhat dubious (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Camm et al., 1996</xref>). HF HRV signal, however, is considered to be exclusively mediated by PNS. Post-exercise, heart rate decreases towards baseline levels, reputedly through a combination of SNS withdrawal and increased PNS activation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Pierpont and Voth, 2004</xref>). For heart rates above 100 bpm, SNS withdrawal dominates; as heart rate falls below 100 bpm, further reductions are primarily mediated by PNS activation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Pierpont and Voth, 2004</xref>).</p><p>First, we hypothesized that exercise would decrease parasympathetic activity (as measured through decreased HF HRV component) and increase sympathetic activity (as measured through increases in the LF HRV component). Second, we hypothesized that exposure to theta-frequency binaural beats (relative to placebo) would result in increased parasympathetic activity following exercise (increased HF HRV component). Third, we also hypothesized concomitant decreases in the LF HRV component (reflecting a combination of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity), as well as in overall LF/HF ratio &#x02013; often referred to as sympathovagal balance. Lastly, we hypothesized that binaural beats would facilitate entry into a deeper state of relaxation, with participants reporting increased perceived relaxation during the binaural-beat condition relative to the placebo condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>SUBJECTS</title><p>Twenty-two college students were recruited by announcement and signed informed consent approved by Ithaca College&#x02019;s institutional research review board.

Over the course of a 20-min presentation, carrier tones were changed in seamless ten-second cross fades to facilitate listener vigilance.

Participants who failed to comply with all study requirements over the 24-h period prior to testing were excluded from participation (one subject due to medical reasons). To control for diurnal hormone fluctuations known to play a role in HRV, each subject was scheduled at the same time of day for each experimental session (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 2011</xref>).

We hypothesized that binaural beats would increase HF power and decrease LF power and LF/HF ratio in a manner consistent with the binaural-beat entrainment model (i.e., that theta-frequency entrainment would effect trophotropic changes in autonomic arousal).</p><p>Consistent with our hypotheses, results demonstrate that, relative to placebo, 20-min of exposure to binaural beats significantly increased HF power &#x02013; a known marker of parasympathetic activation that is driven by activity in regions of the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2009</xref>). Binaural-beat exposure also decreased LF power and LF/HF ratio. Initial response to binaural beats (i.e., within the first 2-min) was characterized by significantly reduced LF power relative to placebo, with no differences in HF power or LF/HF ratio. This was the only time point where subjects showed a significant difference in mean HRV between conditions. However, significant interactions indicated a differential response to binaural beats vs. placebo, with subjects exhibiting an increase in parasympathetic dominance while listening to binaural beats, but an increase in sympathetic dominance while listening to placebo. Subjects exhibited a decrease in LF power over the first 10-min of listening to placebo but showed no change during the same period while listening to binaural beats. These findings suggest that theta-frequency binaural beats initially modulate LF power post-exercise, followed by subsequent modulation of HF power, with an overall net effect of increasing parasympathetic dominance. It appears that even a brief administration (e.g., &#x0003c;2-min) of binaural beats may produce acute effects on autonomic nervous system response post-exercise.</p><p>Notably, subjects entered into the relaxation protocol with a mean post-exercise heart rate of 98 bpm, which did not vary significantly by condition. After 2-min of the relaxation protocol, mean heart rate had dropped to 85 bpm, which also did not differ by condition. Research has shown that post-exercise heart rate recovery is initially mediated by a combination of sympathetic withdrawal and parasympathetic activation, but as heart rate falls below 100 bpm, parasympathetic activation begins to dominate (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Pierpont and Voth, 2004</xref>). Over the course of the relaxation period, mean heart rate dropped to 74 bpm. This suggests that initial decreases in heart rate may have resulted from a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, while subsequent decreases were increasingly mediated by parasympathetic activation (i.e., increases in HF power as well as decreased LF and LF/HF ratio).</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, aerobic fitness level was found to significantly interact with both Time and Condition, producing differential LF and LF/HF responses to binaural-beat vs. placebo. Specifically, in the placebo condition, greater aerobic fitness was associated with larger change scores for LF and LF/HF &#x02013; suggesting that fitter individuals exhibited less sympathetic withdrawal over the course of the placebo relaxation period. Conversely, while in the binaural-beat condition, aerobic fitness was negatively correlated with relaxation LF and LF/HF change scores, suggesting that fitter individuals exhibited greater sympathetic withdrawal while listening to binaural beats. In part, this explains why simple main effects of Time were observed for the binaural-beat condition but not for the placebo condition, when aerobic fitness was included as a covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>PERCEIVED RELAXATION FINDINGS</title><p>Interestingly, subjects&#x02019; sympathovagal balance during the middle of the relaxation protocol significantly predicted 43% of the variance in self-reported relaxation while listening to binaural beats, but none of the variance during the placebo condition. Further, subjects also reported being significantly more relaxed while listening to binaural beats then while listening to the placebo. Findings from this double-blind placebo-controlled study may suggest a role for binaural beats in facilitating access to more restorative states of post-exercise relaxation with subtle, yet somewhat durable psychophysiological effects. These findings should be interpreted with caution, however, given that the change in HRV measures during relaxation were not correlated with the change in relaxation scores. Regardless, results may suggest that binaural-beat associated HRV may be coupled with subjective perceptions of relaxation more so than HRV associated with standard music perception.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title><p>In summary, we present preliminary evidence for a role of binaural beats in acutely modulating autonomic arousal, as measured through HRV. We also provide evidence linking autonomic correlates of binaural-beat exposure with a subsequent behavioral measure &#x02013; perceived relaxation. Given that our sample comprised young, healthy college students, it is important for future research to investigate how binaural beats might interact with autonomic activity in a broader demographic (e.g., high-stress and clinical populations, meditation practitioners). Future studies, outside of the exercise context, that include measures of control for baseline differences in autonomic tone are warranted in order to evaluate the putative beneficial effects of theta-frequency binaural beats on the facilitation of relaxation. Further, binaural-beat technology is often designed as a training device: to assist users in accessing various altered states of consciousness. Future research will need to ascertain the extent to which structured binaural-beat training might provide for a cumulative training effect.</p><p>Although these findings suggest that theta-frequency binaural beats may facilitate relaxation post-exercise, it is important to note that other factors may have contributed to these findings. First, no measure of relaxation was taken prior to the relaxation protocol; thus, it is uncertain whether or not the observed results were a direct result of binaural-beat exposure or some other factor affecting perceived relaxation. Second, at baseline, subjects exhibited significantly lower sympathovagal balance during the binaural-beat condition relative to the control condition. It is possible that this caused the timeline of the exercise-recovery period to be offset, potentially explaining the differential autonomic response observed during the relaxation protocol between conditions. However, baseline HRV differences were controlled for in our analyses, and as previously noted, baseline sympathovagal balance predicted mid-relaxation HRV, but did not predict self-reported perceived relaxation. Only HRV indices while listening to binaural beats predicted subsequent reported relaxation. Furthermore, exercise served to bring subjects into a comparable state of physiological arousal which did not significantly differ by condition. Third, the study&#x02019;s small sample size is an important limitation, although we attempted to offset this through our repeated-measures design. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings with a sample larger than 30. Fourth, according to the BMI scale, our sample was, on average, classified as slightly overweight. It is important to note that BMI was not a primary independent variable, dependent variable, or covariate in our study. Height and weight were necessarily collected as they were used in the regression formula for predicted VO<sub>2</sub>max. Further, it is also important to mention that many of our study&#x02019;s participants were collegiate athletes with elevated lean muscle mass, a demographic that is notoriously misclassified as &#x02018;overweight&#x02019; or &#x02018;obese&#x02019; by the BMI (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ode et al., 2007</xref>). Lastly, given that subjects showed an initial decrease in LF power while listening to the placebo, it is unclear to what extent the observed differences in LF power, and absence of placebo-associated changes in autonomic tone over the course of the relaxation protocol, are a result of binaural-beat assisted sympathetic withdrawal, or placebo-associated inhibition of sympathetic withdrawal. Further research with a &#x02018;no-music&#x02019; condition will be needed to resolve this issue.</p><p>Crucially, however, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the putative role of binaural beats in affecting autonomic nervous system activity in isolation from common confounds such as verbal guidance or instrumental music. Therefore, while the current study is not without limitations, when taking these limitations into consideration in our analytic strategy, we still demonstrated acute binaural-beat effects on parasympathetic activation and sympathetic withdrawal post-exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Acute exposure to theta-frequency binaural beats in a young, healthy sample of college students resulted in increased parasympathetic activation, increased sympathetic withdrawal, and increased self-reported relaxation post-exercise. Binaural-beat-associated HRV appeared to be more tightly coupled with self-reported relaxation than placebo-associated HRV. These findings support the putative clinical effectiveness of binaural beats in their own right, the effects of which may be synergistically enhanced through combination with other therapeutic factors such as verbal guidance and music.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Patrick A.
