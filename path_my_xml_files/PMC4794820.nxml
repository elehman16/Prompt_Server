The misuse of inhalers is a significant problem in COPD because it is associated with reduced therapeutic drug effects leading to lack of control of both symptoms and disease. Despite all advice, health care professionals&#x02019; practice management of inhalation treatments is usually deficient. Interventions to improve inhaler technique by health care professionals are limited, especially among primary care professionals, who provide the most care to patients with COPD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention to train general practitioners (GPs) in the right inhalation technique for the most commonly used inhalers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are conducting a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. The sample population is composed of 267 patients diagnosed with COPD using inhalation therapy selected from among those in 20 general practices, divided into two groups (control and intervention) by block randomisation at 8 primary care centres. The sample has two levels. The first level is patients with COPD who agree to participate in the trial and receive the educational intervention from their GPs. The second level is GPs who are primary health care professionals and receive the educational intervention. The intervention is one session of the educational intervention with a monitor given to GPs for training in the right inhalation technique. The primary outcome is correct inhalation technique in patients. Secondary outcomes are functional status (spirometry) and quality of life. The follow-up period will be 1&#x000a0;year. GPs will have two visits (baseline and at the 1-year follow-up visit. Patients will have four visits (at baseline and 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months). Analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We carried out three previous clinical trials in patients with COPD, which showed the efficacy of an educational intervention based on monitor training to improve the inhalation technique in patients. This intervention is suitable and feasible in the context of clinical practice. Now we are seeking to know if we can improve it when the monitor is the GP (the real care provider in daily practise).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN Registry identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN93725230?">ISRCTN93725230</ext-link>.

The disease cost represents 2&#x000a0;% of the annual budget of the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in the European Union the total costs of respiratory disease are estimated to be about 6&#x000a0;% of the total health budget; 56&#x000a0;% of this cost is due to COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Two thousand euros per year has been estimated as the mean direct cost generated by these patients. The major part (43.8&#x000a0;%) corresponds to hospital admissions, followed by controlled drug consumption (40.8&#x000a0;%) in patients with mild COPD. This percentage decreases to 37.4&#x000a0;% and 28.4&#x000a0;% in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages III and IV, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The administration of drugs using inhalation technologies has changed the treatment of respiratory diseases. These drugs have advantages over systemic therapy, including faster delivery to the targeted organ and reduction of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The effectiveness of inhaled drugs can be influenced by numerous factors, which are mainly age, sex, education level, years of diagnosis, type of inhaler, use of the right inhalation technique or use of different devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The misuse of inhalers is a significant problem in asthma and COPD because it is associated with reduced therapeutic drug effects leading to a lack of control both symptoms and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The educational interventions proposed by these guidelines must include aspects such as positive reinforcement, smoking cessation advice, diet and exercise information, adherence to the therapeutic regimen and verification of the right inhalation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>International guidelines on the management of COPD refer to the following aspects related to the inhalation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. (1) The effectiveness of the bronchodilator therapy should be assessed on the basis of not only the pulmonary capacity of the patient but also other aspects, such as improvement of symptoms, improvement in daily activities, capacity to perform exercise and self-control of the symptoms. (2) Most of the patients, independently of age, can learn to use the proper inhalation technique with appropriate training. (3) Once the patient has shown the ability to perform the right inhalation technique, the device should be prescribed. (4) The patient&#x02019;s ability to use devices must be checked regularly by highly trained health care professionals, and, if necessary, the patient must be retrained in the proper inhalation technique.</p><p>Despite these recommendations, the use of inhaler devices by health care professionals is deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interventions to improve inhalation technique in health care professionals are limited, especially among primary health care professionals, who provide care to most patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims</title><p>Our research group has studied the management of chronic illness in primary care for more than 15&#x000a0;years, focusing mainly on COPD. The first step taken was to carry out trials to develop tools to assess therapeutic adherence and educational interventions to improve adherence. Our first educational intervention was designed with three components (motivational and cognitive aspects, as well as skill development in inhalation techniques). The intervention was evaluated in a randomised controlled trial which showed that treatment adherence improved by 48&#x000a0;% (relative risk) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6.37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the last 3&#x000a0;years, our clinical trials have been focused on the evaluation of educational interventions to improve inhalation techniques in patients with COPD. We have designed two educational interventions to improve inhalation technique: (1) only written information (leaflet) or (2) written information (leaflet) reinforced by instructor training. These trials showed that an intervention with a demonstration by a trainer is significantly more effective than an informative leaflet alone, with an increase in the number of patients who develop proper inhalation technique by 48&#x000a0;% at 3&#x000a0;months and by 41&#x000a0;% at 1-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The next step is the start-up of an intervention focused on primary health care professionals so that they are well-trained. The main goal is to evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention to train general practitioners (GPs) in the right inhalation technique for the most commonly used inhalers and, afterwards, to evaluate the improvements in inhalation techniques performed by their patients. The secondary outcomes of this intervention will be a clinical control improvement and follow-up of the disease as well as improvement in health-related quality of life. All of these outcomes have been key goals for more than 10&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p>On the basis of current published evidence, inhalation techniques in patients with COPD are insufficient, and this overlaps with a lack of well-trained health care professionals. Our working hypothesis is that providing an educational intervention to primary care professionals (GPs) will increase by at least by 25&#x000a0;% the number of patients who report use of the correct inhalation techniques compared with a control group of patients receiving standard care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overview</title><p>This study is a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There are various circumstances in which the pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial has shown to be the most appropriate design, particularly when health programmes are more focused on the organisational level. This design can also avoid &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; between patients when an educational intervention is applied in a primary care centre, owing to its having been individually randomised. This contamination is due to communication between participants, which can change the real effect of the intervention. Finally, when educational strategies for the right patient control are focused on health care professionals, the only adequate strategy is the randomised allocation of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study scheme. <italic>COPD</italic> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1269_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>For our trial, the cluster design is based on two levels: the higher or second level, represented by the GP (who will receive the educational intervention), and the lower or first level, represented by the GP&#x02019;s patients (who have agreed to participate and will receive the educational intervention from their GP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 267 patients diagnosed with COPD and receiving inhalation therapy will be selected from 20 general practices in 8 primary care centres in M&#x000e1;laga and Almer&#x000ed;a, Spain. This sample size is enough to detect a 25&#x000a0;% difference between groups regarding the right performance of inhalation technique, with a power of 80&#x000a0;% and a confidence level of 95&#x000a0;%. The sample size was adjusted according to the standard criteria for cluster randomised trials, using the design effect (DE) of 2.3. The DE was calculate as follows: DE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(<italic>n</italic><sub>c</sub> &#x02013; 1)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ICC (where <italic>n</italic><sub>c</sub> is the mean number of individuals in the cluster and ICC is the intra-cluster correlation coefficient). The ICC in the present work was considered to be 0.1, and the mean cluster size was assumed to be 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A potential loss of 40&#x000a0;% was estimated. Therefore, inclusion of 267 patients and 20 GPs will be required, with all of them signing consent forms to participate in the study.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>First-level participants: patients</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria are a COPD diagnosis, being treated at the primary care centres included in the trial, being prescribed inhalation therapy and consenting to participate in the trial by signing the informed consent form.

The exclusion criteria are refusal to participate in the trial or having to leave the job during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>For the selection of GPs, the research project will rely on pre-selected primary care centres. Twenty GPs will be selected by using a non-probabilistic consecutive sampling method: 10 GPs as the control group and 10 GPs as the study group. To do that, GPs will be invited to participate and will be included in either group by using a block randomisation technique. Each block is formed by four GPs among whom the two study arms will be uniformly distributed. Once the blocks have been created, they will be distributed using a sequence of random numbers and the final list of GP allocations will be created. The final list of GP allocations will be guarded by the principal investigator of the project, and he will inform the allocation of each GP included in the trial.</p><p>The GP&#x02019;s inclusion visit will be carried out once the randomisation has been done. In this visit, all of the study&#x02019;s variables are collected and the inhalation technique of each inhaler is evaluated through a specific step-by-step test.

However, there are strategies that minimise this bias, and we are using these in this study. First, the selection and follow-up of patients (patient inclusion visit and visit 1) will be carried out by an external researcher who will have no knowledge of GP randomisation. Second, the effect of the intervention over recruitment can lead to different recruitment indexes, depending on the groups, due to the possibility that GPs in the control group could be less motivated to participate. Moreover, to avoid different recruitment indexes in both groups, once the trial is finished, the GPs in the control group will be trained in the same way as the study group professionals were trained (if the intervention shows a significant improvement in patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another study limitation is the potential for loss to follow-up. To minimise these losses, patients will be contacted at least three different times and at different times of day. However, loss to follow-up was taken into account in the sample size calculation and will be taken into account in performing data analysis (intention-to-treat analysis).</p><p>Another bias is the Hawthorne effect, which relates to how participants in a study change their behaviour under observation. However, we believe that the effect of this bias will be minimal because of patients&#x02019; being trained and followed by their GPs, with the exception of the inclusion and final visits. Besides, there is a control group in which the follow-up will permit us to minimise the real impact of this bias.</p><p>There could be measurement bias due to mistakes in recording of some variables or interviewer bias due to the administration of the questionnaires. To minimise these biases, interviewers will have been trained previously to ensure that visits will be as homogeneous as possible. A DCF and a manual that explains how each variable is measured at the follow-up visits will be given to the GPs in the intervention group.</p><p>Finally, we point out that a rescue mechanism is contemplated for the control group. This mechanism will be applied when the patients perform critical errors in the inhalation techniques that compromise the totality of the drug deposition and its effect. This rescue mechanism can create an information bias which could change the effect of the educational intervention in this study. However, we must ensure the well-being of the patient. All adverse events will be reported on the DCF and will be taken into account in the post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study has been approved by the local ethics committee of Malaga (CEI Provincial de Malaga; 12/12/13). Patients and GPs will sign informed consent forms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the last 20&#x000a0;years, multiple studies have been carried out showing that health care professionals prescribe inhalers without adequate knowledge about their use. Current guidelines on treating COPD recommend that physicians demonstrate to patients how to use the different devices at their first appointment, and then to correct improper use at follow-up visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, this approach is not widely applied in routine clinical practice, as shown by the high percentage of health care professionals who are incapable of simply demonstrating the correct use of the inhaler devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This lack of knowledge has not improved recently, despite efforts by health care education institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>It is widely accepted that poor disease control among patients with COPD is due to improper use of inhalation medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The inhalation device may affect inhaler technique because there are a wide range of inhaler devices, some of which are easier to use than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. So, these potentially confounding factors will be considered in our strategy of statistical analysis.</p><p>Mishandling of inhalation devices decreases patient adherence to the inhaler therapeutic regimen, compromising treatment efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If the proposed educational intervention is effective, it stands a good chance of being implementable, owing to its simplicity. It could be exported to any health care field for inpatients and outpatients, both nationally and internationally, with adaptation for the most commonly used inhalers in each area. Previously conducted clinical trials by our research group have shown that a simple educational intervention is altogether more effective in teaching patients with COPD about the right management of their inhalers. This proposed clinical trial will verify and confirm our previous proof-of-concept work which indicated that a simple educational intervention delivered by GPs in primary care can improve inhaler technique among patients with COPD. This would provide high-quality evidence about educational interventions with primary health care professionals to improve the management of inhaler treatment, the clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life of patients with COPD, all of which are key aims in any assistance process. These factors have high importance in primary care, where most patients with COPD are treated with this kind of technique.</p><p>In addition to patient benefit related to implementation of the inhalation technique intervention (better treatment adherence, improvement in clinical status and health outcomes), we expect the intervention to be cost-effective, too, with reduction in the direct and indirect costs associated with the management of COPD. This will have a positive impact in organisations, resource management, health care services and health politics, and overall in the health and well-being of patients with COPD.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>We have divided the participant recruitment into two phases and are recruiting GPs and patients for the second phase of the study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD PAI</term><def><p>COPD Process of Andalusian Health Service Guidelines</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCF</term><def><p>data collection form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DE</term><def><p>design effect</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOLD</term><def><p>Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>intra-cluster correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEPAR</term><def><p>Sociedad Espa&#x000f1;ola de Neumolog&#x000ed;a y Cirug&#x000ed;a Tor&#x000e1;cica</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGRQ</term><def><p>St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PBF, JLF and FLF have participated in the design of the study intervention.
