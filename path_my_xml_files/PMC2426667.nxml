Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists (LRAs) and synthesis inhibitors are widely used as anti-asthma therapies and they have been convincingly shown in research studies to improve lung function and clinical status as well as reduce exacerbation rate and airway inflammation. However, in clinical practice, therapeutic response is difficult to predict and quite variable. Head to head studies have confirmed that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and ICS/long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist combinations are superior to the LRAs in achieving clinical control and the place of LRAs in asthma management guidelines remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Studies of LRAs have confirmed their safety and this is one of the attractions compared to ICS therapy, but no studies have specifically looked for evidence of tolerance or rebound deterioration on drug withdrawal.</p><p>Zafirlukast (Accolate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Astra Zeneca) is a highly selective LTD<sub>4 </sub>antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the clinical benefits of zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily (b.d) would be sustained over 12 weeks treatment and whether there was any potential for short-term deterioration in asthma control following drug withdrawal. We were secondarily interested in whether clinical benefits were related to any potential anti-inflammatory effects of zafirlukast and whether these would similarly deteriorate on drug cessation. Treatment was assessed in two distinct groups of subjects with <underline>persistent</underline> asthma: in symptomatic subjects maintained on &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists alone and in subjects with persistent asthma symptoms despite moderate doses of ICS. Both of these asthmatic groups are ones in which clinicians may consider the use of a LRA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)</title><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient demographics at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists + Placebo (N = 7)</td><td align="center">&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists + Zafirlukast (N = 14)</td><td align="center">ICS-treated + Placebo (N = 8)</td><td align="center">ICS-treated + Zafirlukast (N = 16)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Sex, male/female</td><td align="center">3/4</td><td align="center">8/6</td><td align="center">2/6</td><td align="center">9/7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Age, years</td><td align="center">29 (21&#x02013;55)</td><td align="center">42 (21&#x02013;69)</td><td align="center">45 (30&#x02013;65)</td><td align="center">37 (19&#x02013;65)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Ex-smoker</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">FEV<sub>1</sub>, L</td><td align="center">2.7 (2.3&#x02013;3.7)</td><td align="center">2.1 (1.4&#x02013;4.2)</td><td align="center">2.8 (2.0&#x02013;3.8)</td><td align="center">2.7 (1.4&#x02013;4.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, % predicted</td><td align="center">80 (65&#x02013;102)</td><td align="center">85 (69&#x02013;107)</td><td align="center">76 (60&#x02013;95)</td><td align="center">77 (56&#x02013;98)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Inhaled corticosteroid, &#x003bc;g/day</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">1600 (1000&#x02013;2400)</td><td align="center">1600 (1000&#x02013;2400)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">PD<sub>20 </sub>methacholine, &#x003bc;g *</td><td align="center">0.008 (0.001&#x02013;0.04)</td><td align="center">0.04 (0.005&#x02013;1.3)</td><td align="center">0.03 (0.004&#x02013;0.2)</td><td align="center">0.02 (0.001&#x02013;0.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are given as median and (range) except * geometric mean and (range).

Before coughing, saliva was discarded to minimise buccal contamination. This procedure was repeated to a maximum of six nebulisations. FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured if the patient felt uncomfortable and sputum induction was terminated when the subject had expectorated &#x02265; 2.5 mLs of sputum with visible airway "plugs". Following sputum induction, FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured and salbutamol administered if FEV<sub>1 </sub>was &#x02264; 80% of the pre-induction value.</p><p>Whole sputum sample processing and cell counting was performed according to the methods of Fahy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Briefly, a volume of dithiothreitol 0.1% (Sputalysin; Calbiochem Ltd. CA, USA) equivalent to four times the weight of sputum was added. The sample was placed in a water bath at 38&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes and mixed at intervals to ensure adequate homogenisation. The sample was then centrifuged (Shandon II cytocentrifuge) at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes and cell-free supernatant decanted and stored at -80&#x000b0;C (see later). The cell pellet was resuspended with phosphate buffered saline to the original sputum volume. A total cell count was performed in a Neubauer hemocytometer and the resuspended sample spun in a cytocentrifuge (Shandon cytospin III, Runcorn, UK; 82 g) for 10 minutes. Cytospots were stained with Diff-Quik and two slides per sputum sample were analysed by an observer blinded to subject. At least 200 non-squamous cells were counted on each slide and the results averaged. A sputum sample was considered adequate if the percentage of squamous cell contamination was less than 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Total cysteinyl leukotriene and prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>assays</title><p>CysLT and PGE<sub>2 </sub>were extracted from induced sputum supernatants by immunoaffinity purification using affinity sorbents (mouse monoclonal cysLT or PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody covalently bound to Sepharose 4B, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). After thawing, 0.2 ml of sputum supernatant was incubated with 20 &#x003bc;l of cysLT affinity sorbent or 50 &#x003bc;l of PGE<sub>2 </sub>affinity sorbent with gentle mixing for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4 min), the supernatant was discarded and the sorbent pellet was washed with 1 ml of PBS. CysLT or PGE<sub>2 </sub>were then eluted from the sorbents with 1 ml of methanol or 95% ethanol, respectively. The methanol or ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness under vacuum and then resuspended in enzyme immunoassay buffer. Total CysLT (LTC<sub>4</sub>/LTD<sub>4</sub>/LTE<sub>4</sub>) and PGE<sub>2 </sub>concentrations were determined with specific enzyme immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical). Using this methodology, processing with DTT has been shown to have no effect on detectable levels of sputum CysLT or PGE<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recoveries of cysLT and PGE<sub>2 </sub>through the extraction and enzyme immunoassay were assessed by spiking sputum supernatants with known amounts of LTD4 and PGE<sub>2</sub>, with the unspiked samples being assessed in parallel for endogenous concentrations of cysLT and PGE<sub>2</sub>. The mean recovery of LTD4 was 65.5% &#x000b1; 10.9% (SEM, n = 8) and the mean recovery of PGE<sub>2 </sub>was 115.8 &#x000b1; 8.8% (SEM, n = 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Exhaled breath nitric oxide determination</title><p>NO measurements were obtained using the method described by Silkoff with patients inhaling NO-free gas (Medical Air, Air Liquide Australia, Melbourne) and exhaling against a fixed resistance to ensure closure of the soft palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Exhaled NO (eNO) was measured using a fast response, high sensitivity chemiluminescence analyser (Sievers NOA 270 B, Boulder, Colorado, USA) with a lower detection limit for NO of 0.3 parts per billion (ppb).</p><p>The mean concentration of the plateau phase of the single breath test was recorded from 3 technically acceptable measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Independent professional statistical advice was obtained for the analysis. Analyses were performed according to the distribution of the data with or without log transformation. Clinical data are expressed as least square means with standard errors of the means (SEM). Sputum and blood results are expressed as median and range. Changes in diary card and lung function parameters with treatment were compared using a repeat measures analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with the mean of the variables for the last seven days of the diary card during run-in as a covariate. Changes in diary card entries were assessed based on the mean recordings for the last 14 days of the study treatment periods between baseline and five weeks and between six weeks and 10 weeks (inclusive). The mean diary card recordings for the week prior (week 11) to study drug withdrawal at week 12 were then compared to baseline and the mean recordings for the one-week post-withdrawal. Within-treatment group changes from baseline for normally distributed data were assessed using paired t-tests. If there appeared to be a deviation from normality, statistical analysis was repeated using Wilcoxon's sign rank test to confirm the ANCOVA. Sputum and blood results were analysed according to the non-normal distribution of the data: Mann-Whitney U test was used to test differences between treatments and Wilcoxon was used to determine within-treatment group effects. Analyses were based on an intention to treat (ITT) principle wherever data were available, in order to allow several minor protocol violators to be included in-spite of the danger of positive signals being diluted. AHR data are presented as geometric means and ranges for PD<sub>20FEV1</sub>. Changes from baseline for PD<sub>20FEV1 </sub>values after acute dosing and following washout are expressed as a doubling concentration dose of methacholine using the following formula:</p><p><disp-formula>[Log<sub>10 </sub>PD<sub>20FEV1 </sub>(treatment) - Log<sub>10 </sub>PD<sub>20FEV1</sub>(baseline)]/log<sub>10</sub>2</disp-formula></p><p>The study was designed to detect a doubling dose difference of 1.0 in PD<sub>20FEV1 </sub>between weeks 0 and 12 between the treatment arms in each asthmatic subpopulation studied (12 patients on zafirlukast and six on placebo) with 80% power. Correlations between categorical variables were analysed using Spearman's rank test. Statistical analyses were undertaken in SPSS with a two-tailed p &#x02264; 0.05 being considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Adverse events and withdrawals</title><p>Twenty-one subjects using &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists alone (median age 41 years, range 21&#x02013;69 years, 10 female; Group I), and 24 asthmatic subjects maintained on ICS (median age 42 years, range 19&#x02013;65 years, 14 female; Group II), met the entry criteria for the study.</p><p>In Group I, of 14 subjects randomised to zafirlukast, one withdrew consent shortly after randomisation for personal logistic reasons and another subject withdrew for similar reasons after four weeks treatment. One subject developed an upper respiratory tract infection and asthma worsening following cessation of zafirluklast and was unable to undergo repeat determination of eNO levels at visit six. One additional subject did not complete their diary card following zafirlukast withdrawal, because this occurred over the Christmas period. Two subjects completed the study but did not undergo methacholine challenge at visit five: one subject was unable to withhold rescue medication for six hours prior to testing, and FEV<sub>1</sub>deteriorated to &#x0003c; 60% predicted pre-test in another subject, thus precluding methacholine challenge. Of the seven subjects in Group I randomised to placebo, one withdrew consent shortly after randomisation and one subject completed the study but did not undergo methacholine challenge at visit five because of worsening lung function. Twelve subjects in Group I randomised to zafirlukast and five subjects in the placebo arm therefore completed the entire active treatment phase.</p><p>In Group II, three subjects of the 16 initially randomised to zafirlukast did not complete the treatment phase of the study; one subject because of worsening rheumatoid arthritis, one was found to have been inappropriately randomised because of neutropenia at screening and one subject developed angina necessitating cardiology referral. Two of these subjects completed the first four weeks of the study and their data were therefore entered into the prospective analyses. Following cessation of zafirlukast in Group II, two subjects developed clinical asthma worsening and one of these suffered a frank asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids. Outcome analysis in this sub-population was therefore based on the 15 subjects randomised to zafirlukast and eight randomised to placebo.</p><p>Adherence was assessed at each study visit by tablet counting and was found to be greater than 90% in all volunteers for the duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>In both groups overall, there was a pattern of improvement over the first two weeks with zafirlukast, but these changes then deteriorated back to baseline, or below baseline, by 12 weeks, with further deterioration or even frank exacerbation in one individual, in the withdrawal period. These changes were most marked in Group I, whereas in Group II there was some confounding by more general trends toward improvement in both active and placebo arms, probably related to "trial-induced" improvement in adherence to ICS therapy.</p><p>In Group I, initial improvement compared to placebo was most marked for laboratory-measured FEV<sub>1 </sub>and home recorded morning PEF (p &#x0003c; 0.01), with borderline levels of significance for early improvements in total mornings per week awakening with asthma (p = 0.03), total awakenings with asthma (p = 0.09) and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use (p = 0.06) for within-treatment group comparisons. Following withdrawal of zafirlukast there were significant deteriorations in FEV<sub>1 </sub>and evening PEF compared to placebo (p = 0.05, p = 0.03, respectively). Additionally, within-treatment group comparisons also revealed a significant deterioration in morning PEF (p &#x0003c; 0.001) for zafirlukast.</p><p>In Group II, only FEV<sub>1 </sub>improved significantly (p = 0.04) after 2 weeks treatment with zafirlukast compared to placebo. Within-treatment group comparisons revealed significant improvements in morning PEF (p = 0.01), &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use (p = 0.02) and asthma severity scores (p = 0.02), and a trend toward improvements in evening PEF (p = 0.08). There were subsequent deteriorations in the group as a whole in morning and evening PEFs and mornings waking with asthma after six weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Following withdrawal of zafirlukast, FEV<sub>1 </sub>deteriorated significantly compared to placebo, (p = 0.04), and there were within-treatment group rebound deteriorations in evening PEF (p &#x0003c; 0.005) and nocturnal awakenings (p = 0.04).</p><p>Overall, with both groups combined, these changes in morning and evening PEF and FEV<sub>1 </sub>reached statistical significance compared to placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Thus, of particular note was the quite definite deterioration in both asthmatic groups on cessation of zafirlukast in a range of indices.

Asthma control then significantly deteriorated overall when zafirlukast was withdrawn, i.e. to worse than baseline in many patients, especially in those not treated with an ICS. The changes with treatment and on withdrawal were less obvious in asthmatic subjects maintained on moderate doses of ICS (Group II), but the parallel improvement in the placebo group in this sub-population suggest our findings were probably confounded by improved adherence to ICS therapy as tends to occur during research studies. There was no evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect for zafirlukast, but drug withdrawal was accompanied by a significant increase in circulating neutrophils in both asthmatic groups. The changes with zafirlukast in both asthmatic populations were remarkably consistent and strongly suggest the development of tolerance and rebound deterioration on treatment withdrawal.</p><p>The leukotriene receptor antagonists (LRAs) have been attributed with potential disease modifying effects, although most of the evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect comes from studies of montelukast. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] No previous direct evidence of tolerance to the LRAs has been presented in persistent asthma, although studies of exercise-induced asthma do suggest that tolerance can develop, but what may be most important is the dose and type of LRA used. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] Ours is the first clinical study to prospectively demonstrate this possibility in persistent asthma and the challenge is to explain these findings in the light of large studies that have failed to find such an effect. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]</p><p>The majority of studies of zafirlukast have been undertaken over short periods of <underline>six weeks</underline> or less, which may not have allowed sufficient time for tolerance or tachyphylaxis to develop or to be recognised. In our study, <underline>definite</underline> loss of clinical benefit generally occurred from the sixth week of treatment onward in <underline>both</underline> asthmatic groups, suggesting shorter treatment courses may not allow enough time for tolerance to occur. Although a handful of studies have demonstrated zafirlukast 20 mg bid over 12 weeks and longer to be significantly superior to placebo, the majority of clinical benefit has usually occurred within four weeks with little change thereafter. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] Only larger than conventional doses of zafirlukast have shown improvements consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect, but whether tolerance develops to such aggressive dosing regimes remains unknown. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]</p><p>The significant physiological deteriorations to below baseline values, especially in Group I, on zafirlukast withdrawal are inconsistent with simple removal of a bronchodilator effect, especially as FEV<sub>1 </sub>and PEF in most subjects had already deteriorated back to baseline values by the end of active treatment. There was a clear "over-shoot" to worse than study entry values in essentially all lung function and clinical parameters. There was also no relationship between initial improvements and subsequent deteriorations on zafirlukast withdrawal, so they do not seem predictable. A drop-off in adherence with zafirlukast over the 12 weeks of the study is unlikely to be an explanation for the gradual loss of benefit, as we assessed this very carefully at each study visit and the rebound deterioration observed only in subjects who received zafirlukast, which would be very much against poor adherence with active treatment.</p><p>We found no evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect for zafirlukast, despite our assessment of sputum and peripheral blood eosinophils as well as AHR and eNO levels. This would be against any worsening of inflammation related to some "masking" effect to explain the loss of clinical benefit over time. Following zafirlukast withdrawal there was a significant increase in peripheral blood neutrophils, especially in the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist group. Neutrophils express cysLT1 receptors and montelukast has been shown to reduce sputum neutrophils in stable COPD and there are also suggestions that neutrophil function may be modulated by LRAs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]</p><p>Acute dosing with zafirlukast appeared to confer some protection against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in both asthmatic groups, but this was not significant compared to the effects of placebo and our study was handicapped by the number of subjects, especially in the zafirlukast arm, who did not undergo repeat challenge testing at the end of active treatment or following withdrawal because of clinical deterioration. However, despite the small numbers available for analysis, PD<sub>20FEV1 </sub>did not deteriorate in either group following withdrawal of zafirlukast, suggesting that any acute protective effects were small and that LTD<sub>4 </sub>hypersensitivity was not manifest as increased AHR to methacholine.</p><p>One potential explanation for the clinical deteriorations over time in those subjects receiving zafirlukast would be up-regulation of LTD<sub>4 </sub>receptor expression in the airways, including on smooth muscle cells, induced by chronic receptor occupation by the LRA. Our data suggest that this may occur irrespective of clinical benefit. The lesser "tachyphylaxis" and rebound in Group II suggests ICS may protect against this, but the confounding of better adherence with disease-modifying ICS makes differences difficult to interpret. If LTD<sub>4 </sub>receptor expression is indeed up-regulated, then concomitant failure to reduce CysLT production by airway eosinophils could result in excessive receptor occupancy and activation on treatment withdrawal. The existence of this sort of dynamic receptor regulation is well described with histamine (H<sub>2</sub>)-receptor antagonists and explains the development of tolerance in peptic ulcer disease and rebound acid hypersecretion on drug withdrawal. H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists demonstrate "inverse agonist" activity which leads to increased H<sub>2</sub>-receptor cell-surface expression. A recent short-term cell-culture model has demonstrated that zafirlukast and montelukast both function as reverse agonists causing cells to increase surface expression of CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptors. This effect is likely to be much greater with longer-term exposure to LRAs. The importance of these observations is that they support the existence of dynamic cell-surface CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression and lend biological plausibility to our explanation for the loss of asthma control over time and rebound on LRA withdrawal. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] Tachyphylaxis to &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist therapy is another example of the potential for dynamic receptor expression, although in this context the effect is in the opposite direction with down-regulation of cell surface receptors following long-term exposure to agonist therapy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] Interestingly, ICS are known to modulate the development of tachyphylaxis to &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists and although speculative, perhaps ICS also affect CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression to explain the lesser evidence of tolerance to zafirlukast in the ICS treated group observed in our study, but this requires further investigation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</p><p>The question still remains as to whether our findings indicate a "class effect" or whether this is more likely with zafirlukast. The <italic>in vitro </italic>demonstration of up-regulated CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression with zafirlukast and montelukast would suggest a class effect, but several long-term clinical studies of montelukast have not suggested tolerance. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] However, there are a number of reasons why tolerance could be masked: 1) it was not specifically looked for; 2) the population on average may not decline sufficiently for the effect to become clinically obvious, especially if improvements in a responsive sub-population counter-balance deteriorations in the remainder. The majority of absolute changes (deteriorations) in clinical status and lung function seen in our subjects treated with zafirlukast were quite small, albeit real, and would support this explanation. Additionally, drop-outs due to deterioration would reinforce this false impression of well-being in the "survivor population"; 3) ICS might modify the effect or patients may increase the ICS dose to counter any negative effects of tachyphylaxis that appear; 4) higher doses of LRAs may overcome the effect; and finally, 5) importantly, age may be a factor in the response to LRAs. Our asthmatic subjects who received zafirlukast were generally older (median age 42 years), than in most other studies of LRAs, which was just fortuitous.</p><p>A recent retrospective analysis in subjects over the age of 50 years demonstrated actual worsening of lung function and an increased exacerbation rate on zafirlukast therapy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] The same appeared true, but to a lesser extent, in subjects over the age of 40. Masking of airway inflammation was one of the explanations put forward, but our study found no evidence for this. A further suggestion of potential tolerance comes from a Cochrane systematic review of ICS <italic>versus </italic>LRA that demonstrated a substantially increased risk of exacerbations with LRAs over treatment periods longer than 12 weeks, although increased exacerbations were already apparent even after only 4&#x02013;8 weeks LRA therapy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] This risk seemed highest with zafirlukast compared to montelukast. Unfortunately, the reviewers did not explore these observations and failed to consider tolerance or a potential age effect.</p><p>Our prospective data are very suggestive of a rebound deterioration on cessation of drug &#x02013; this would be highly supportive of true tachyphylaxis and the increase in circulating neutrophils is concerning. Our reading of the literature would suggest that these potential problems with LRAs have not been looked for in a comprehensive fashion despite several large studies and their current widespread use. The possibility that age may influence the effects of reverse agonist activity and dynamic receptor expression is of particular concern and warrants further specific assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None of the authors have a conflict of interest.
