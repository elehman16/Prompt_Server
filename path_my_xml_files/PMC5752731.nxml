They may have difficulties in any component of literacy, including decoding (word attack), word reading (word recognition), spelling, vocabulary and reading comprehension (Alamprese, MacArthur, Price, &#x00026; Knight, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Ehri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>; Sabatini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>). This preliminary intervention study addresses the diverse needs of adult struggling readers by teaching analysis of complex vocabulary words to adults seeking alternative high school diplomas or General Education Diplomas (GED) with sixth grade reading skills on average. Vocabulary instruction involving analysis of words&#x02019; morphemes (smallest units of meaning) and phonemes (smallest units of sound) is compared to a more traditional kind of vocabulary instruction involving the study of whole words.</p><p id="Par3">Twenty percent of American public high school students drop out (National Center for Education Statistics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>) often with low literacy skills and few opportunities for meaningful employment (Wayman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2001</xref>) and civic engagement (Levinson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). In one study of GED students, up to half of them read below the fifth grade level, and about forty percent of those between 16 and 20&#x000a0;years old had learning disabilities or attention deficit disorders (Perin, Flugman, &#x00026; Spiegel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Many students in adult education programs have reading difficulties consistent with dyslexia (Greenberg, Wise, Morris, Fredrick, Rodrigo, Nanda &#x00026; Pae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>), a severe reading disability characterized by reduced decoding and spelling skills with poor phonological awareness, awareness of words&#x02019; sound structures (Stanovitch &#x00026; Siegel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1994</xref>) that persists through the lifespan (Shaywitz &#x00026; Fletcher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1999</xref>). Adults with reading disabilities tend to have uneven component reading skills, performing better on tests of word reading than on tests of phonological and decoding skills (Greenberg, Ehri, &#x00026; Perin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>; Sabatini, Sawaki, Shore, &#x00026; Scarborough, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2010</xref>). For example, when adult struggling readers were matched with typical readers in third to fifth grade, they outperformed the children on sight word reading tasks, but performed more poorly on tasks of decoding, sound deletion and phoneme segmentation, indicating severe phonological deficits in reading disabled adults (Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1997</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theories of word learning that connect morphemes, phonemes and spellings</title><p id="Par5">Several theories of word learning assert that teaching connections between words&#x02019; morphemes, phonemes and spellings will increase poor readers&#x02019; component literacy skills. Chomsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1970</xref>) promoted the teaching of &#x0201c;lexical spellings&#x0201d; to draw readers&#x02019; attention to the ways in which English orthography reveals deep semantic relationships between morphological relatives, such as words that share the same root or base morphemes, despite superficial alternations in pronunciations (e.g., <italic>precise</italic> and <italic>precision</italic> have related meanings preserved in their shared base word spellings, despite the vowel and consonant pronunciation shifts). Similarly, Ehri (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2005</xref>) theorized that readers must analyze words&#x02019; multi-linguistic identities (e.g., semantic, phonological and orthographic structures) in order to amalgamate those identities into a single orthographic image stored in the lexicon, an image whose linguistic identities have been fully analyzed, thereby enabling the reader to recognize the word instantly, by sight. In her theory of sight word learning, the mapping of words&#x02019; meaning, sound and spelling structures results in accurate, automatic reading of individual words (sight words), the hallmark of skilled reading. Sight word reading develops through phases of increasing awareness of linguistic connections within words, in which &#x0201c;the consolidated alphabetic phase replaces the full alphabetic phase when the predominant types of connections for retaining sight words are morphographic&#x0201d; (Ehri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2005</xref>, p. 150).</p><p id="Par6">In the Lexical Quality Hypothesis, Perfetti and Hart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2002</xref>) also view the role of precise word knowledge and fluent word reading as central to literacy learning. Poor readers lack high quality internal representations of words called lexical representations. Readers have high quality representations when they know precisely words&#x02019; spellings, meanings, and pronunciations, and are able to read them fluently. Readers have low quality representations when they have not precisely specified words&#x02019; orthographic, semantic, and phonological structures. Poor ability to analyze connections between words&#x02019; spellings, meanings, and pronunciations obstructs fluent word level reading. Low quality lexical representations subsequently impede reading comprehension, which depends upon accurate, fluent word recognition (Perfetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>). Thus, the Lexical Quality Hypothesis views proficient reading as a nested process, in which higher level reading skills, like vocabulary and comprehension, depend upon lower level reading skills, like word analysis and word recognition. In support of this hypothesis, there is evidence that complex word identification serves as a moderator between morphological awareness and reading comprehension for fifth graders with poor multi-syllabic word reading skills (Gilbert, Goodwin, Compton, &#x00026; Kearns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The importance of vocabulary for older struggling readers</title><p id="Par7">Vocabulary difficulties are often seen in minority language learners, who comprise a large proportion of students in adult learning programs (e.g., Perin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2006</xref>). English Language Learners tend to perform substantially below average on vocabulary tests (Proctor, Carlo, August, &#x00026; Snow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2005</xref>; Swanson, Saez, &#x00026; Gerber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2006</xref>), and so do students from minority language backgrounds who may speak a dialect of English, such as African American English or Chicano English. In fact, native English speakers from minority language backgrounds perform only slightly better than English Language Learners on tests of vocabulary (Beech &#x00026; Keys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>; Droop &#x00026; Verhoeven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>; Hutchinson, Whitely, Smith, &#x00026; Connors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>; Leseman &#x00026; de Jong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1998</xref>; Verhoeven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2000</xref>). Thus, vocabulary instruction is a crucial element in the literacy needs of minority language learners, including both English Language Learners and native English speakers of minority dialects.</p><p id="Par8">Literacy achievement depends on accurate comprehension of complex vocabulary in academic language, which is &#x0201c;the specialized language, both oral and written, of academic settings that facilitates communication and thinking about disciplinary content&#x0201d; (Nagy &#x00026; Townsend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>, p. 92). Academic vocabulary words are typically morphologically complex, with base words and multiple affixes, such as derivational suffixes (e.g., <italic>environmental</italic>, whose base word <italic>environ</italic> has two derivational suffixes, <italic>ment</italic> and <italic>al</italic>). They include both general terms used within academic settings (e.g., <italic>hypothetical</italic>) and specific terms residing within certain disciplines (e.g., <italic>Reconstruction</italic> in Amercian History) (Nagy &#x00026; Townsend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>). In one instructional program called Word Generation, 697 middle school students were taught 5 general academic vocabulary words each week, within highly motivating topics and activities in math, social studies, and English, resulting in medium treatment effect sizes on measures of word knowledge (Snow, Lawrence &#x00026; White, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2009</xref>). Although there is a paucity of research on vocabulary interventions for minority language learners, one such study provided 18&#x000a0;weeks of a program called Academic Language Instruction for All Students (ALIAS) to 476 sixth graders in English Language Arts classrooms. Eight or nine general academic vocabulary words per unit were taught over 18&#x000a0;weeks, using engaging texts with activities in reading, writing and morphology. Results showed significant gains in vocabulary knowledge and morphological awareness (awareness of morphemes) for both language minority learners and native English speaking peers (Lesaux, Kieffer, Faller, &#x00026; Kelley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Although the importance of teaching academic vocabulary is well established, most teachers require guidance on how to teach them (Nagy &#x00026; Townsend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>) and students rarely receive high quality vocabulary instruction leading to independent use of new words (Beck, McKeown, &#x00026; Kucan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Gersten, Dimino, Jayanthi, Kim, &#x00026; Santoro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). High quality vocabulary instruction is particularly important for students in low income urban schools, where high proportions of minority language learners face significant obstacles to academic achievement, including teacher shortages, large class sizes, and low student expectations (Anyon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1997</xref>; Lankford, Loeb, &#x00026; Wyckoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002</xref>). Students who learned English as their second language start school with lower vocabulary skills than their middle income, native English speaking peers (e.g., Cobo-Lewis, Pearson, Eilers, &#x00026; Umbel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>) and the disparity in vocabulary skills widens as they advance in age (Kieffer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2008</xref>; Nakamoto, Lindsey, &#x00026; Manis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Morphology&#x02019;s role in literacy</title><p id="Par10">English spelling reflects words&#x02019; phonemes, as in letter-sound correspondence (e.g., <italic>link</italic> in which each sound is represented by each letter), and words&#x02019; morphemes, as in affixes whose spellings remain stable despite pronunciation changes (e.g., <italic>linked</italic> in which the past tense morpheme is spelled as &#x0201c;ed&#x0201d; despite the <italic>/t/</italic> pronunciation). Teaching literacy in ways that increase readers&#x02019; awareness of both morphemes and phonemes makes sense given the morpho-phonemic structure of English orthography (Chomsky &#x00026; Halle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1968</xref>; Venezky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1999</xref>), yet many literacy programs do not include direct teaching of morphemes (Henry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>; Nunes &#x00026; Bryant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">While it is well established that increasing phonological awareness leads to improved reading skills (Ehri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; National Reading Panel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2000</xref>), it is less common knowledge that increasing morphological awareness also improves literacy at all levels of K-12 schooling, especially for reading disabled students (Bowers, Kirby &#x00026; Deacon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>; Goodwin &#x00026; Ahn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). A meta-analysis of 17 studies of morphological intervention for K-12th graders found moderate treatment effect sizes for overall literacy, phonological awareness, morphological awareness and vocabulary with smaller, still significant, effect sizes for reading comprehension and spelling (Goodwin &#x00026; Ahn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). One review (Bowers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>) analyzed the effects of morphological teaching on component literacy skills by considering several linguistic layers of instruction. Drawing from peer-reviewed intervention studies for K-8 students, researchers coded literacy outcomes according to three linguistic layers on which the treatments focused. Morphological teaching at the sub-lexical (within word) layer, such as morphemic analysis of roots and affixes, produced medium to large treatment effect sizes. Morphological instruction at the lexical (word) layer, such as word identification, resulted in medium effect sizes. Morphological training at the supra-lexical (phrases, sentences and discourse) layer, such as reading comprehension, produced only small effect sizes. Thus, focusing on the sub-lexical layer with direct parsing of morphemes within words appeared to produce greater, perhaps more immediate, literacy gains than indirect teaching of morphemes within sentences and passages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The need for morpho-phonemic instruction with older readers</title><p id="Par12">Correlational studies reveal close relationships between component literacy skills and readers&#x02019; awareness of words&#x02019; phonemes and morphemes. In a study investigating the literacy skills of adults in GED, pre-GED and basic education programs, phonological decoding predicted spelling, listening comprehension and reading comprehension. Morphological awareness predicted spelling, listening comprehension and vocabulary, which indirectly predicted reading comprehension. Phonological decoding correlated highly with morphological awareness. Those findings led authors to recommend morphological instruction in adult literacy (Fracasso, Bangs &#x00026; Binder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014</xref>). Similarly, in assessments of fifth grade readers who had difficulty reading complex words, the interaction between morphological awareness and complex word reading accounted for significant variance in reading comprehension. Researchers concluded that complex word reading may serve as a mediator between morphological awareness and reading comprehension (Gilbert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>). Thus, morphological training may promote increased accuracy for complex word reading, and ultimately, better reading comprehension.</p><p id="Par13">Some intervention studies of adolescent and adult struggling readers have reported limited treatment effects (e.g., Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Sabatini, Shore, Holtzman, &#x00026; Scarborough, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>), though novel approaches teaching complex word analysis have shown promise. For example, adults with third to sixth grade reading levels received treatment focused on decoding, fluency, comprehension, extensive reading and combined approaches, yet made relatively limited literacy gains (Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>). However, adult poor readers who were taught the morpho-phonemic structure of English orthography (Venezky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1999</xref>), through analysis of words&#x02019; meaning, sound, and spelling connections, and use of a meta-cognitive strategy to decode complex words, made greater gains in decoding than those taught using a more traditional approach with a children&#x02019;s curriculum adapted for adult use (Alamprese et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). Similarly, adolescent struggling readers who learned to parse complex words into syllables transferred their learning to recognize untaught words, whereas those who learned to read whole words did not demonstrate learning transfer (Bhattacharya &#x00026; Ehri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Morphological training as compensatory strategy for older struggling readers</title><p id="Par14">Morphological instruction may provide older poor readers who lack phonological and orthographic awareness with a compensatory strategy to increase word recognition, fluent word recognition, thereby enabling access to reading comprehension (Elbro &#x00026; Arnbak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Gilbert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>; Law, Wouters, &#x00026; Ghesquiere, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Elbro and Arnbak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>) found that morphological processing may offer a compensatory strategy for Danish adolescents with poor phonological skills. In their first experiment, 15&#x000a0;year olds with dyslexia read compound words faster than non-compound words, and faster reading rates correlated highly with better reading comprehension skills. In their second experiment, adolescents with dyslexia read text faster when it was parsed into morphemes than when it was parsed into syllables, outperforming younger typical normal readers on that task of morphological awareness.</p><p id="Par15">Law et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>) investigated the word reading skills of college adults with dyslexia and results suggested use of morphological compensation in decoding tasks. They divided students with dyslexia into one group who had compensated and another group who had not compensated for their disability. Those who had compensated for dyslexia had histories of poor word reading skills but had advanced their skills to the normal range by the time they were in college, whereas those who had not compensated had poor word reading skills that persisted in college. The compensated group had higher vocabulary skills, so an adjustment was made for vocabulary, before comparing the two groups&#x02019; morphological awareness skills. Even after adjusting for the vocabulary difference, morphological awareness skills accounted for 17% of the variance in word reading. Moreover, when morphological awareness was compared with all other literacy measures, its relationship to word reading was the strongest. Authors concluded that adults who had compensated for dyslexia may have forged a new morphological pathway to successful decoding, and noted that &#x0201c;explicit teaching of morphological rules and methods for the morphological decomposition of words could potentially improve adult dyslexics&#x02019; morphological awareness, subsequently improving their word reading skills&#x0201d; (Law et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>, p. 269).</p><p id="Par16">While some studies of older struggling readers have provided evidence of morphological compensation to offset poor phonological awareness (e.g., Elbro &#x00026; Arnbak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Law et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>), others have shown weaknesses in morphological knowledge. Leong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1999</xref>) examined phonological and morphological knowledge in a group of adults who were enrolled at a technical institute and pursuing post-secondary certificate programs in science, technology and health. Students with severe reading disabilities, marked primarily by poor word reading skills, were matched on age and reading level with typical students. Participants completed measures of phonological knowledge, such as oral reading of pseudowords and rhyme matching, and measures of morphological knowledge, such as production of base words and derived forms. Results revealed both qualitative and quantitative differences between adult struggling readers and the control groups. Specifically, the group with low literacy lacked sophistication in word reading skills, even for basic words. That finding led authors to recommend that &#x0201c;remediation of college students with learning/reading disabilities should likely begin at this basic word level, and instruction aimed at this level should go beyond grapheme-phoneme correspondence to include the morphological structure of words&#x0201d; (Leong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1999</xref>, p. 236). Similarly, Deacon, Parrila and Kirby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2006</xref>) asked post-secondary students with and without histories of reading disabilities to complete lexical decision tasks for derived and pseudo-derived words. Typical readers read true derived forms faster than they read pseudo-derived forms; in contrast, adults with histories of reading disabilities showed no such benefit in reading real derived forms over pseudo-derived forms. Thus, the adults with histories of poor reading skills demonstrated a lack of sensitivity to derivational processing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Rationale for the current study&#x02019;s interventions</title><p id="Par17">Half of the participants received novel instruction in semantic mapping with morpho-phonemic analysis (SM-MPA) that implemented five elements of evidence-based practice: (1) using the principles of effective morphological teaching, (2) creating word sums, (3) studying morphological relatives, and (4) teaching flexible syllable segmentation, and 5) assigning primary syllable stress. Using the principles of effective morphological teaching for adolescents included teaching morphology within the context of rich vocabulary instruction, teaching a cognitive strategy such as hypothesizing about unfamiliar word meanings based on known morphemes, teaching morphemes systematically, and teaching words within meaningful contexts (Kieffer &#x00026; Lesaux, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>). Creating word sums (e.g., <italic>please</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ant</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ly</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>pleasantly</italic>) has resulted in large learning gains through morphemic analysis and synthesis (Bowers &#x00026; Cooke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>; Bowers &#x00026; Kirby, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Bowers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>). In prior research, participants have read morphological relatives (e.g., words that share the same base, like <italic>professor</italic>-<italic>profession</italic>) faster than they have read morphologically unrelated words (Nagy, Anderson, Schommer, Scott, &#x00026; Stallman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1989</xref>). Teaching flexible syllable segmentation to adolescent struggling readers has resulted in greater learning transfer than teaching whole word study (Bhattacharya &#x00026; Ehri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>). Finally, sensitivity to syllable stress has predicted reading achievement in children (Holliman, Wood, &#x00026; Sheehy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>; Jarmulowicz, Taran, &#x00026; Hay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Half of the participants received the more traditional vocabulary instruction, semantic mapping with whole word study (SM-WWS) that included three elements of evidence-based vocabulary instruction: (1) information about definitions and sentence contexts, (2) multiple exposures to vocabulary words, and (3) student engagement in deep processing of words&#x02019; meanings (Baumann, Kame&#x02019;enui, &#x00026; Ash, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>; Beck &#x00026; McKeown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>; Blachowicz &#x00026; Fisher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>). Beck and McKeown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>) used an intervention program called Elements of Reading<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>: Vocabulary (EOR-V) that delivered all three elements of effective vocabulary instruction to K-5 students from low income school districts, resulting in significant language learning gains. In a large randomized control study, teachers implemented the EOR-V program with primary and intermediate students to supplement their regular literacy curriculum. They taught sophisticated vocabulary words that occurred across multiple content area subjects, called Tier 2 vocabulary. Weekly vocabulary units included reading aloud, viewing photos depicting the words, and discussing specific uses of words in sentence contexts. Students who received the EOR-V instruction made significantly greater gains on tests of word knowledge than did those who received only the regular literacy instruction (Apthorp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Research also demonstrates the value of multi-sensory spelling instruction to support component literacy skills (Cunningham &#x00026; Stanovich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1990</xref>; Hulme &#x00026; Bradley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1984</xref>) as spelling requires integration of visual-motor, kinesthetic and linguistic processes (Graham &#x00026; Weintraub, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). With regard to adult struggling readers and the importance of spelling, a recent analysis of the literacy skills of high-risk young adults found that 44% of the variance in their reading performance was explained by one component comprised of spelling, word reading and decoding together (Mellard, Woods &#x00026; McJunkin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Research questions</title><p id="Par20">The central question was whether semantic mapping with morpho-phonemic analysis would lead to greater gains in component literacy skills (word attack, word recognition, vocabulary, spelling and comprehension) than semantic mapping with whole word study for adult struggling readers. Based on the results of prior literacy studies with older students, Ehri&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2005</xref>) sight word theory and Perfetti and Hart&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2002</xref>) Lexical Quality Hypothesis, two predictions were made.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Fidelity measures</title><p id="Par38">Fidelity checks measuring adherence to scoring procedures and treatment protocols revealed high levels of consistency between tutors for test scoring accuracy and adherence to the treatment protocols, although slightly more time was spent with participants in the SM-WWS condition. All test scores were checked by two independent scorers, with 98% scorer agreement. Due to an irregularity, one participant&#x02019;s Letter Word ID score was not included in the analysis. Twenty-five percent of the worksheets in participants&#x02019; binders were randomly checked by a second person for fidelity to treatment using a rubric of scripted instructional elements. Both groups had a high level of adherence to treatment protocols, with 92% adherence for the SM-WWS group and 98% adherence for the SM-MPA group. Analyses of variance revealed a significant difference in teaching time (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05) with the SM-MPA group receiving less instruction time on average (<italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;427&#x000a0;min) than the SM-WWS group (<italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;454&#x000a0;min).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">The first hypothesis, that adult struggling readers who received morpho-phonemic analysis would show significantly greater learning of target words, was supported by only one of the five target word assessment tasks. Unexpectedly, both groups made equally large gains for the Read Words, Spell Words, Match Definitions and Complete Sentences tasks. As expected, the group taught morpho-phonemic analysis made significantly larger gains than the group taught whole word study on the Extract Base Words task. That difference reflected the intervention emphases, as only the SM-MPA group was explicitly taught to circle base words in word sums and morphological relatives.</p><p id="Par40">The second hypothesis, that participants who received morpho-phonemic teaching would demonstrate greater gains on standardized reading and language tests received partial support in the area of word reading. Specifically, participants given morpho-phonemic analysis made significantly greater gains on the WJ-III Letter Word Identification and Word Attack subtests. Letter Word Identification involved reading words, whereas Word Attack involved reading pseudowords. That finding is important because lower level reading skills like word recognition and word attack are among the first linguistic hurdles to clear for successful reading comprehension. If readers are unsuccessful in reading and analyzing words, then they are also likely be unsuccessful in comprehending words and sentences, because higher level skills depend upon accurate, automatic word reading skills (Perfetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Group gains did not differ significantly on standardized measures of vocabulary, spelling, or comprehension, contrary to the second hypothesis. Although the morpho-phonemic group surpassed the whole word group for all standardized measures except the WJ-III Spelling of Sounds subtest, those differences were small and not significant. Group differences must be interpreted with caution given the small number of participants and the small gains in scores. The fact that gains were not greater for vocabulary and comprehension may reflect the short 8 h, 4 week duration of the treatment. These findings may lend support to those of Bowers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>). Morphological teaching at the sub-lexical layer of word attack, and at the lexical layer of word recognition may tend to produce greater, and perhaps more immediate, gains than morphological teaching at the supra-lexical layer of reading comprehension.</p><p id="Par45">Results of this preliminary study support teaching older readers to use sub-lexical analysis to parse words&#x02019; morphemes and syllables, rather than teaching them to study whole words. Participants had greater learning transfer after word analysis. This finding is consistent with Bhattacharya and Ehri&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) study of adolescent struggling readers. They found superior transfer of word learning after instruction in word analysis, compared with a lack of word learning transfer for whole word instruction. Although their study differed from the current study in that it did not include morphological analysis, both studies provided syllable segmentation.</p><p id="Par46">Results of the present study support prior research demonstrating benefits from morpho-phonemic analysis and evidence of morphological compensation for adult readers. In Alamprese et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>) study, adults with low to intermediate literacy skills were taught about the morpho-phonemic structure of written English through analysis of phonemes, morphemes and spellings. Those who were taught morpho-phonemic word analysis made greater gains in decoding than those taught the regular adult literacy curriculum. In the current study, adults given structured word analysis showed greater gains not only in decoding, but also in word recognition. With regard to morphological compensation, college students with dyslexia appeared to be using morphological decoding, rather than purely phonological decoding, as an alternative pathway to decoding complex words (Law et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Similarly, the participants in the current study may have utilized their newly developed morpho-phonemic decoding strategies to better recognize unfamiliar words.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Implications for practice</title><p id="Par47">Three reasons why morpho-phonemic instruction may be more effective than whole word instruction are that it is sound from a theoretical perspective, it casts a wider instructional net covering more component literacy skills, and it is a more efficient use of teaching time due to learning transfer.</p><p id="Par48">First, morpho-phonemic literacy instruction is sound from a theoretical perspective with regard to the morpho-phonemic structure of English orthography and theories of word learning and literacy. Ehri&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2005</xref>) theory of sight word learning asserts that readers must analyze words' linguistic identities (e.g., meanings, pronunciations and spellings) in order to amalgamate their identities into an orthographic image that is recognized in the lexicon automatically. In the current study, this may have been accomplished as participants learned to analyze constituent morphemes and syllables within words and extract common base words from morphologically related words. Similarly, learning words&#x02019; meaning, sound, and spelling connections may have enabled readers to enrich their internal representations of words or lexical representations, thereby increasing fluent word reading skills as theorized in Perfetti and Hart&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2002</xref>) Lexical Quality Hypothesis. A lengthier morpho-phonemic intervention ought to lead to additional benefits in vocabulary and comprehension, after efficient word identification skills have been achieved (Perfetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Second, teaching poor readers to analyze words&#x02019; morpho-phonemic structures casts a wider instructional net to reach the diverse needs of adult struggling readers. Although they may have difficulties with any component of literacy, a large proportion of adults with low literacy skills struggle with decoding and recognizing words, as seen in severe reading disabilities like dyslexia (Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>). In addition, a substantial proportion of adults in adult education programs come from minority language backgrounds with vocabulary difficulties (Perin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2006</xref>) and adolescent minority language learners have responded well to vocabulary instruction teaching morphemes (Lesaux et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>). In the current study, although both interventions focused on vocabulary, morpho-phonemic analysis concurrently addressed students&#x02019; needs in decoding, resulting in gains in both word attack and word recognition.</p><p id="Par50">Finally, teaching morpho-phonemic analysis appears to be a more efficient use of teaching time than whole word study because it leads to learning transfer. In the current study, the morpho-phonemic group actually received significantly less teaching time, yet they succeeded in reading more unfamiliar words after learning to analyze morphemes, the building blocks of all words. In contrast, those provided with whole word instruction learned to read only the words that they were directly taught, necessitating word by word instruction at too slow a pace for adult struggling readers to catch up and attain proficient literacy skills.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par52">The study was strong in its design to minimize threats to internal validity. Participants completed screenings in nonverbal intelligence and English proficiency. Testers were blind to the treatment when they conducted the standardized posttesting and research assistants were not made aware of the hypotheses being tested. Controlled instruction further reduced threats to validity, with parallel teaching elements and structured semantic maps for each treatment condition. Instructional elements were reportedly clear to both participants and tutors. Differences between treatments were easily distinguishable, both visually and verbally, to enhance teaching clarity. Teaching scripts were presented via PowerPoint presentations, that were color coded to indicate which sections were to be read aloud by the tutors and which were to be read aloud by the participants. Finally, fidelity checks measured high levels of adherence to scoring procedures and treatment protocols. All tests were scored by two independent scorers, with an inter-scorer reliability rate of 98%. Adherence to treatment protocols ranged from 92 to 98%, based on a sampling of 25% of participants&#x02019; workbook binders. Only the analysis of teaching time showed significant differences between the groups, favoring the SM-WWS group.</p><p id="Par53">The study was limited by its sampling procedures and design in several ways. First, results may not accurately represent the population of young adults in urban secondary education because participants were volunteers who reported in the debriefing interview that they had participated in order to be paid and to improve their literacy and vocabulary skills. Therefore, they may have represented a lower socioeconomic status group with a greater incidence of reading disabilities than typical GED students. The study was also limited by its sample size, duration and group comparisons. If there had been a larger participant sample who had received the treatment for a longer period than only 8&#x000a0;h, the benefits of instruction may have been more robust for component reading skills. Having a second control group who only received instruction through the GED program would have also been informative. Follow-up studies ought to include a pretest and posttest containing a set of morphologically complex words that were different words from the training words, but similar in terms of their affixes and complexity, in order to isolate the ability to analyze words morphologically, the underlying skill that was being trained.</p><p id="Par54">Another potential criticism of the study is that the SM-MPA group had more practice reading lengthier complex words during the reading of morphological relatives portion of the treatment. However, the SM-WWS group was actually required to read a greater number of morphologically complex words within the second sentence context, although those words were presented within facilitative sentence contexts and were less complex. Specifically, the SM-MPA group was required to read 80 complex words during the morphological relatives portion, with a mean morpheme length of 2.4 morphemes, whereas the SM-WWS group was required to read 201 complex words during the second sentence context portion, with a mean morpheme length of 2.0 morphemes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Future directions for morpho-phonemic instruction</title><p id="Par55">Future studies are needed to pinpoint which instructional elements of morphophonemic instruction are most effective for adult struggling readers. Although it appeared that the instruction in word origins, word sums, morphologically related words, flexible syllable segmentation and assignment of primary stress were highly effective, no attempt was made to isolate the separate elements of the teaching to determine which ones were most effective. One of the most effective elements of the treatment may have been the assignment of primary syllable stress, leading to greater accuracy in the pronunciation of complex words (Jarmulowicz, Hay, &#x00026; Taran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>). Further studies are needed to investigate how to teach adult struggling readers to read complex words whose relationships to derived forms are less transparent, such as words whose pronunciations or spellings change from base words to derived forms (e.g., the vowel changes from <italic>aspire</italic> to <italic>aspirations</italic>, or the spelling change from <italic>abolish</italic> to <italic>abolitionists</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">Few randomized control studies have investigated interventions for adult struggling readers. This experiment compared the impact of morpho-phonemic and whole word vocabulary instruction on component literacy skills of adults with sixth grade level reading skills on average. Greater word reading gains were found after readers were taught to analyze word origins, create word sums with morphemes, extract common base words from morphological relatives, use flexible syllable division and assign primary syllable stress. Results are consistent with theories of word learning and literacy that predict increased reading skills after sub-lexical analysis revealing connections between words&#x02019; meaning, sound and spelling structures.</p><p>Morpho-phonemic analysis may have been more effective than whole word study in improving word reading skills because it addressed a wider range of component literacy skills. In addition to addressing vocabulary, it concurrently provided instruction in word analysis to address the decoding deficits seen in those with severe reading disabilities like dyslexia. Furthermore, morpho-phonemic analysis appears to have been a more efficient use of teaching time due to greater word learning transfer. Effectiveness and efficiency of instruction are crucial factors when teaching adults who have immense gaps in vocabulary and literacy.
