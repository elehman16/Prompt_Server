There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group.

The incidence of (solid) cancer increases substantially with age [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With the increase of life expectancy in the developed countries, the incidence of cancer, and respectively volume of cancer surgery in patients older than 65 years, increases steadily. In Europe, it has been estimated that this age group accounts for approximately 58% of all cancers, and 69% of cancer deaths [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Surgery, as the &#x0201c;state of the art&#x0201d; therapy for most solid tumors, must now be performed in elderly patients, a major risk group with the highest perioperative mortality rate, ranging from 7% to 15% [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], prone to prolonged hospital stay [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Postoperative morbidity and mortality is associated with an immense socio-economic burden, making prevention of postoperative complications, improved quality of care, and reduced length of in-hospital stay a permanent interest of research [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>As early as in 1958, Janis described that successful emotional inoculation could be achieved in patients facing severe stress by giving them preparatory information containing accurate warnings about what to expect [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since then many studies investigated the influence of psycho-educational interventions on postoperative recovery [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Further, the studies hitherto published were conducted only for minor surgical procedures or cardiac bypass surgery comprising only small patient populations [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present trial is the first such study focusing on major onco-surgery in elderly patients.</p><p>This RCT was aimed at investigating whether the short- and long-term outcome of elderly onco-surgical patients can be improved by patient empowerment, with specifically designed information, compared to a standard-of-care control group. Primary clinical outcomes were in-hospital length of stay (short-term perioperative risk) and global health-related quality of life (HRQoL, long-term perioperative risk). Secondary outcomes included perioperative quality of care such as postoperative stress, e.g. level of pain and postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study PERATECS (&#x0201c;Patient empowerment and risk-assessed treatment to improve outcome in the elderly after gastrointestinal, thoracic or urogenitary cancer surgery&#x0201d;) was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki declaration.

Criterion for improved HRQoL was an increase of at least 5 points in the global health-related quality of life scale of the EORTC QLQ C30 within twelve months in the intervention group.</p><p>The sample size calculation was conducted with respect to the long-term primary endpoint in a worst-case scenario. Bonferroni-adjusted error of the 1<sup>st</sup> kind &#x003b1; = 0.025 two-sided, power 80%, and the following quantities [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]: Global health-related quality of life score according to EORTC QLQ C-30 [mean (SD)]: 68.82 (15.51) [before intervention], 73.12 (13.73) [after 12 months follow-up].</p><p>Assuming the nonparametric Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test, a sample size of 230 patients per group was to be included in the study.</p><p>With 12 days versus 10 days (time to fulfill discharge criteria from the hospital) and an effect size of 0.5 (according to own studies) for the first primary, a sample size of 83 patients per group would follow (&#x003b1; = 0.025 two-sided, power 80%, calculations using nQuery Advisor&#x000ae; Release 7.0, Stat. Solutions Ltd. &#x00026; South Bank, Crosse&#x02019;s Green, Cork, Ireland).</p><p>The global HRQoL values after 12 months of both groups were tested for significant differences using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Due to the high impact of gender on global HRQoL, the data were also analyzed separately for both genders. Values of baseline and 12 months global HRQoL were descriptively compared to published normative data for the German population [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) and, when not normally distributed as median (interquartile range, IQR). For categorical variables, differences between groups were tested using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Differences between groups in normally distributed continuous variables were evaluated using the students&#x02019; t-test respectively the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for continuous non-normally distributed variables. Odds ratios (OR) and regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined in robust and logistic regression analysis.</p><p>To identify predictors of prolonged LOS, univariate robust regressions followed by a multiple robust regression with the endpoint postoperative length of stay were performed. Multiple robust regressions were adjusted for patient age (years), gender, tumor site (genito-urinary vs. gastrointestinary), intervention vs. control, occurrence of major complications (yes vs. none), TUG (&#x0003c;20 sec vs. &#x0003e;20 sec), length of anesthesia (minutes), educational degree (&#x0003c;high school vs. &#x0003e; high school), nutritional state (normal vs. malnutrition), and severity of surgery (minor/moderate vs. major).</p><p>Beside variables of particular clinical interest, only variables associated with a univariate significant impact (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.10) on outcome were introduced in the multivariate models. After calculation with all the chosen variables (full model), most relevant characteristics were identified by backward feature selection.</p><p>Predictors for one year global HRQoL were identified by multiple linear regressions. Included variables were: intervention vs. control, gender, age (years), ASA state (I/II vs. III/IV), Charlson Comorbidity Score (points), tumor site (genito-urinary vs. gastrointestinary), nutrition state (MNA: normal/risk for malnutrition vs. malnutrition), Timed Up and Go-test (&#x0003c; 20 sec vs. &#x0003e; 21 sec); Severity of surgery (minor/moderate vs. major), pre-operative global HRQoL (points), major complications (yes vs. none), depressions (none vs. manifest), Fatigue (no/mild vs. severe), Activities of Daily Living (points), Mini Mental State (points).The tests for the primary outcome (postoperative length of hospital stay and global health-related quality of life) have been carried out in a confirmatory understanding, but all other tests for secondary endpoints are to be understood in the area of exploratory data analysis; therefore no adjustments for multiple testing have been made.</p><p>For analysis of the course of global HRQoL from pre- to postoperative, the difference from baseline HRQoL to 1 year HRQoL for each patient was calculated. Means of the difference score between intervention and control group were tested for significance using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. The data were also analyzed separately for both genders. Survival data were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier methods and compared univariately with log rank statistics.</p><p>Statistical significance was defined as p &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical tests were two tailed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 22.0 SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R 3.0.3.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec022"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec023"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p>The outline of patient recruitment and follow-up is shown in <xref rid="pone.0137824.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

Postoperative delirium is a seldomly recognized complication [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and in this study, the postoperative delirium rate of 10% was lower than expected. However, both centers participating in this study have well established postoperative delirium screening and therapy protocols, which has been shown to reduce delirium rates [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, at enrollment all patients had a Mini Mental State of 24 or higher, and might have been less vulnerable for cognitive disturbances than frail patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Despite the high rate of complications, the mortality rate within the first 30 days was surprisingly low. In 2012, the perioperative mortality rate in the EUSOS study was as high as 4% for an unselected inpatient surgery within the first seven days following surgery [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For Germany, the in-hospital rate was still 2.5%. In the present study, the patient cohort is a selected study population 65 years old or older in addition to a severe disease, i.e. cancer followed by major onco-surgery. Thus, the anticipated mortality rate was higher than the observed rate of 1.1%. Aside from a selection bias, possible reasons might include the participation in the present RCT, which was combined with daily visits of all patients.</p><p>Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are established outcome parameters [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Empowering patients can achieve a better health-related quality of life in patients [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the present study, both study groups showed an improvement in global HRQoL close to the 5-point improvement we assumed for this study. The control group had a trend for higher decline. The intervention showed no influence on the HRQoL one year after surgery. Identifying other determinants of global as well as functional and symptom related parts of HRQoL would be subject of a sub analysis.</p><p>Regarding hospital LOS, the present study revealed that amongst others, pre-operative nutritional state and physical functional capacity were independent in elderly cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Many factors are associated with in-hospital LOS after elective onco-surgery: age, severity of surgery, blood loss, surgical volume, and surgical complications have been previously described as influencing variables [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Interestingly, impairments in functional capacity were not reflected in ASA scores or in the performance status. This strengthens the assumption that the routinely used pre-operative assessments are unsatisfactory for elderly patients, although published data concerning this issue are still conflicting [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A pre-operatively conducted geriatric assessment could identify patients who are functionally impaired, and interventions for improving their physical status may be indicated in order to enhance their postoperative recovery [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><sec id="sec038"><title>Limitations</title><p>Additional to the limitations already mentioned above, there might be a selection bias in our study population. The study protocol and battery of questionnaires, including cognitive and physical tests, were time consuming and sometimes even stressful for the participants. Further, the intervention started a day prior to surgery. Several study participants were hesitant to be enrolled in a study due to the severity of their diagnosis and the impending major surgery. A considerable number of patients expected to be completely healed after surgery and therefore saw no need in further interventions. Even more patients felt sometimes too weak, or were simply not able to keep their diary due to their postoperative physical and/ or cognitive condition. In particular, patients transferred to the ICU postoperatively were often not able to keep the diary. Hence, contrary to other studies showing beneficial effects of diary keeping [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], perioperative patient empowerment is limited in elderly patients. The patients that refused to participate could differ significantly from the study population in terms of mental and physical health, leading to another possible limitation of this study. We cannot eliminate the possibility that the daily visits and close interaction of study-staff with the participants influenced the primary endpoints, compared to patient settings in the daily routine. Due to the study protocol there was no reference group to facilitate direct comparisons.</p><p>Further, the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire was not specifically designed for elderly patients. The now available EORTC QLQ &#x02013;C15-PAL, which is specifically designed for elderly patients, did not exist when the present study was designed and conducted [<xref rid="pone.0137824.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, the study has several strengths: the prospective design, the homogenous patient collective, the high recall in long-term follow-up, and the reasonable size of the study population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec039"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient empowerment in terms of additional pre-operative information failed to shorten postoperative in-hospital stay or improve global HRQoL in elderly patients undergoing major onco-surgery. Postoperative length of stay in elderly cancer patients is mainly influenced by pre-operative nutritional, cognitive and functional state, magnitude of surgery, length of general anesthesia, as well as postoperative complications. Patient empowerment can enhance quality of care in regards to pain, and since over-treatment of pain is particularly harmful for elderly patients, patient safely can thus be improved. Pre-operative information was received well by patients who were cognitively and physically fit.</p><p>Pre-operative comprehensive geriatric assessment might be beneficial for this high-risk patient group, helping to provide a tailored perioperative management aimed at reducing cognitive and physical barriers, and ultimately improving postoperative outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec040"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137824.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137824.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137824.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Changes in global HRQoL from baseline to follow-up.</title><p>Detailed clinical changes in global HRQoL from pre-operative to 12 months follow-up.
