The regeneration process can only be initiated by periodontal ligament cells derived from the remaining periodontium as these are the cells capable of differentiating into new fibroblasts, cementoblasts, and osteoblasts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Nyman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] suggested the placement of a physical barrier between the flap and the root surface to exclude gingival connective tissue and epithelium from the healing process, giving the periodontal ligament cells the opportunity to repopulate the coagulum on the root surface. This technique was named GTR.</p><p>The barriers recommended for the use in GTR, regardless of the material used, must be safe, biocompatible, and non-toxic, not induce any inflammatory response, and be designed for clinical applicability based on the morphology of the osseous defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The barrier used are either nonresorbable or bioresorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes are preferred as nonresorbable membranes require second surgical procedures to remove it. Furthermore, gingival recession, device exposure, infection, and inflammation are frequently experienced with nonresorbable membranes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Among resorbable barriers, investigators have examined type-I collagen for the use in GTR procedures as it is a major extracellular macromolecule of the periodontal connective tissue. Also collagen is known to be a weak immunogen, has a chemotactic property for fibroblasts, and acts as a barrier for migrating epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Collagen from mammalian sources, primarily bovine skin, has been utilized in foods, cosmetics, and biomaterials and has the advantage of biodegradability and low toxicity. Therefore, there have been various attempts to use mammalian collagen in the medical field as a scaffold for developing artificial organs. However, the use of bovine collagen has been reconsidered, as some reports have shown the risk of transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to human beings. Recently, there has been interest in non-mammalian collagen sources, primarily in fish collagen such as that of shark and salmon, as it is known to have low risk for transmission of infectious disease to humans than bovine collagen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Hence, an attempt was made to assess, a bioresorbable collagen membrane of fish origin (Periocol&#x02122;, Eucare pharmaceuticals Private limited, Chennai, India) in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The study was planned with the following objectives.</p><p>

Subjects having bilateral isolated intra osseous defects in the mandibular posterior teeth were screened based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: (a) patients of either sex having chronic periodontitis, (b) patients who were systemically healthy with no contraindication to periodontal surgery, (c) non smokers, (d) presence of an intrabony defect with residual PPD of five millimeters (mm) and with radiographic evidence of the affected site, (e) patients having 2 to 3 mm band of keratinized tissue to allow surgical manipulation and suturing, and (f) patients who were co-operative and able to come for regular follow up. Exclusion criteria: (a) patients allergic or sensitive to any medication or any ingredient of the test material, (b) patients showing unacceptable oral hygiene compliance during or after phase I therapy, and (c) pregnant and lactating mothers.</p><p>Following selection of subjects based on inclusion criteria, patients were given an explanation of the study, and an informed consent was obtained. The study was analyzed and approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethical Clearance Committee of the institution. All patients underwent initial therapy consisting of oral hygiene instructions and scaling and root planing. Randomization was done by a coin toss to select the sites to be treated by GTR using a bioresorbable membrane (i.e., test group) and control sites treated by conventional open flap debridement (OFD). All the surgeries were performed by the same operator, and the measurements were recorded by a blinded examiner.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical parameters assessment</title><p>Plaque index,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] gingival bleeding index,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] RAL, PPD, and R were recorded from baseline, 3, 6, and at 9 months using University of North Carolina-15 (UNC) probe. A customized acrylic occlusal stent with a vertical groove was made for proper guidance and orientation of the periodontal probe in the same plane [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The stents were preserved in the study casts to minimize distortion for follow-up measurements[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]. RAL was measured from the reference point (RP) on the stent to the base of the pocket (BOP). Recession was measured from RP to the free gingival margin (FGM).

Intra-oral periapical radiographs were taken using a long cone/extension cone paralleling technique with the positioning device (Rinn<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> XCP, Dentsply, IL, USA.) and a size 2E speed intra-oral periapical radiographic film (Kodak X-ray film, USA) was used in a roentgen machine operating at 70 Kilo Voltage Power (Kvp), 0.6 milli amperes (mA). Bite registration was done using rubber base impression material and stored for follow-up assessment. Radiographs were scanned using a scanner (HP 3010G) at an input of 400 dpi and 100% scale. The scanned images were then analyzed with the help of auto CAD 2007 software. Radiographic parameters were recorded as follows: (1) distance from cementoenamel junction to base of the defect (CEJ to BD) =A, (2) distance from cementoenamel junction to alveolar crest (CEJ to AC) =B, (3) defect depth = A-B, (4) DF was measured as the difference in defect depth from baseline to 6 months and 9 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Patients were anaesthetized with 2% lignocaine solution at the surgical site. Intracrevicular incisions were given both buccally and lingually and full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated. After the reflection of the flap and exposure of the osseous defect, a thorough surgical debridement was carried out to remove sub-gingival plaque, calculus, diseased granulation tissue, and pocket epithelium [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The surgical sites were irrigated with sterile saline, and care was taken to keep the area free of saliva. The GTR membrane was removed from the sterile package and hydrated in normal saline for few seconds before placement on to the defect to improve adhesion properties and malleability. The membrane design was custom prepared chair side to receive for an intrabony defect and then carefully tweezed through the interproximal contact area [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] and extended 2 to 3 mm beyond the bony margin, to provide a broad base during placement. Prior to closure of mucoperiosteal flaps, decortication of the osseous defect was done to induce bleeding. Surgical flaps were repositioned to the pre-surgical level and sutured with 3-0 silk suture (Mersilk -Ethicon, Division of Johnson and Johnson Ltd, Aurangabad, India) utilizing an interrupted direct loop suturing technique thereby achieving primary closure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Care was taken not to displace the GTR membrane during suturing. A non-eugenol periodontal dressing (Coe-pack - GC America INC. ALSIP, IL, USA) was placed on the surgical area following which the post-operative instructions were given.

The true endpoint is determined by histology. However, due to ethical reasons and patient concerns, re-entry procedures and histological analysis are not feasible in clinical trials. Hence, clinical criteria that provide surrogate evidence of periodontal regeneration were considered.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The plaque and gingival bleeding indices were assessed to monitor patient's oral hygiene and its effect on soft tissues. There was a reduction in mean plaque index and gingival bleeding index for the test and control group from baseline to 9 months with a high statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between test and control groups with respect to plaque and gingival scores thereby showing that there was a good maintenance of oral hygiene throughout the study. Cortellini and Pini-prato[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. have reported the clinical effect of plaque control and the influence of increased bacterial contamination on the outcomes to GTR.</p><p>The clinical parameters on the sites treated with the barrier were similar to those of open flap surgery. PPD in the test group at baseline was 7.22 &#x000b1; 2.28 mm which reduced to 4.00 &#x000b1; 1.94 mm at the end of 9 months. In the control group, the mean PPD reduced from 7.00 &#x000b1; 2.55 to 4.33 &#x000b1; 1.73 mm at 9 months. The clinical attachment level or RAL has become widely accepted as the primary clinical endpoint of regenerative attempts around natural teeth. Significant loss in clinical attachment levels is reflected in histological loss of the tooth's attachment apparatus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The mean RAL in the test group reduced from 12.33 &#x000b1; 2.83 to 9.78 &#x000b1; 2.28 mm at 9 months. At the control sites, the mean RAL reduced from 12.44 &#x000b1; 3.00 to 10.89 &#x000b1; 2.47 mm at the end of 9 months. Although these clinical changes were statistically significant between baseline and final measurements within the groups, no statistically significant differences were found between the test and control groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Cortellini[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and Falk[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. have reported greater gain in the clinical attachment level after GTR; however, these authors were dealing with deeper initial intrabony defects. The defects in this study were smaller as compared to other studies. This may suggest that clinical attachment level after GTR is dependent up on the initial defect depth.</p><p>During the surgical procedures, efforts were made to preserve the interproximal soft tissues. In relation to gingival recession, there was no significant statistical difference in test and control sites. There was a decrease of 0.3 mm of recession from baseline to 9 months in GTR-treated sites. The possible explanation could be due to non-exposure of the barrier membrane following placement in any of the test sites. This would have prevented undue exposure of the barrier to oral environment, thereby preventing infection or soft-tissue inflammation, which would lead to faster resorption of membrane and cause recession. In contrast, studies by Cortellini[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and Becker[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. in 1996 have shown that sites treated with GTR have increased amount of recession between 1.8 and 2 mm. Gottlow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. in 1986 has postulated that the greater the degree of gingival recession, shorter the root surface area that is provided for the repopulation of the periodontal ligament cells thereby negatively influences new attachment formation.</p><p>New bone formation is frequently used as a primary outcome variable in controlled clinical trials of regenerative therapy. Radiographic monitoring of alveolar bone changes following regenerative procedures is a non-invasive painless alternative to direct bone measurement. The radiographic variables assessed were the levels of crestal bone and extent of DF. Crestal bone resorption is a characteristic feature after the flap procedures. Most of the alveolar bone changes following regenerative therapy of intrabony defects occur in the intrabony component while crestal resorption may be minimal or may not occur at all.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In our study, no significant change in the level of the alveolar crest was seen in both test and control groups after 6 and 9 months. This was in accordance with a similar study done by Becker[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. where in 0.33 mm of crestal resorption was noted in GTR-treated sites.</p><p>There was a significant difference in defect depth from baseline to 9 months in test and control groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) while an inter group comparison did not show any significant differences in defect depth. Similarly, no significant difference was found in percentage of DF both within and between the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>]. This observation is in accordance to the findings by Gottlow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. in 1986, Becker[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. in 1993, and Micheal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000. In our study, conventional radiography with image analysis software (Auto CAD 2007) was used to assess radiographic parameters as applicability and reliability of the image analysis system in alveolar bone measurement have been studied previously by Micheal,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Hausmann[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>., and Verdonschot[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. However, advanced radiographic techniques like subtraction digital radiography remain the method of choice if subtle changes in mineralization of alveolar bone need to be detected.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Radiograph of test site at baseline in relation to 46 and 47</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g008"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Radiograph of control site at baseline in relation to 36 and 37</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g009"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Radiograph of test site at 6 months in relation to 46 and 47</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g010"/></fig><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Radiograph of control site at 6 months in relation to 36 and 37</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g011"/></fig><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Radiograph of test site at 9 months in relation to 46 and 47</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g012"/></fig><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Radiograph of control site at 9 months in relation to 36 and 37</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-624-g013"/></fig><p>The GTR material utilized in this study is an orange-brown color type-I fish collagen. It is available in dimensions of 1 &#x000d7; 1 cm and 1 &#x000d7; 2 cm and can be easily manipulated and adapted to the root surface. It has a resorption time of 6 weeks. In fish, the largest concentration of collagen is found in the skeleton, fins, skin, and air bladder. Use of this barrier in our study did not show any case reporting with any form of allergy or hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>The results of the study is difficult to compare due to a number of possible differences like in small sample size, study design, patient/defect selection, percentage of one/two/three wall defect components, baseline depth of defects, probing forces, and evaluation method. Hence, the regenerative potential and beneficial effects of this GTR membrane should be further evaluated with larger sample size, longer follow ups, use of advanced radiographic aids (like cone-beam-computed tomography, etc.) and with combination therapy involving bone grafts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of the study, it can be inferred that no significant differences were found either by using a collagen membrane of fish origin or open flap debridement in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects both clinically and radiographically.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Authors would like to acknowledge the former principal Dr. Usha Mohandas MDS, V.S Dental College and Hospital (V.S.D.C and H) and Dr. Manjunath MDS, Professor and Head of the Department of Oral medicine and radiology, V.S.D.C and H, for their support and guidance throughout the study.
