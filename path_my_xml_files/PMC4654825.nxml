Secondary outcomes will include resident quality of life (Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia [QUALID]), whether a palliative approach is taken (e.g. hospitalisations, non-palliative medical treatments), staff attitudes and knowledge (Palliative Care for Advanced Dementia [qPAD]), and cost effectiveness. Processes and factors influencing implementation, outcomes and sustainability will be explored statistically via analysis of intervention &#x02018;dose&#x02019; and qualitatively via semi-structured interviews.

Maximising quality of life (QOL) for persons with advanced dementia and their families requires careful and regular assessment of physical, psychosocial, cultural and spiritual needs at timely junctures in the illness trajectory to inform management decision-making and advance care planning. Symptom assessment and management must be tailored to the specific needs of advanced dementia, with an understanding that deterioration is often complicated by comorbid conditions. Pneumonia and feeding problems are common and require focused management and planning. People with advanced dementia have limited capacity to effectively communicate their needs and participate in decisions about care, such that symptoms (e.g. pain) often go under-recognised and under-managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interventions for acute medical problems (e.g. intravenous antibiotics/hydration, tube feeding) should be applied only at times where they will provide net benefit, rather than compromise comfort and distress families for little or no survival benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Delivery of palliative care to nursing home residents with advanced dementia is often suboptimal, either because staff lack awareness that a palliative approach is required or else find it difficult to apply this to dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Major barriers include an inadequate skill-mix, poor communication between nursing home staff, health services and families, and inadequate planning and/or inconsistency in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If an advance care plan is not in place, staff may be unable or unwilling to manage symptoms within the nursing home, leading to unnecessary transfer to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hospital admissions for people with dementia are more likely to be lengthy and terminal compared to those for people without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hospitalisation is often frightening for residents and is associated with care focused on acute medical conditions rather than QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Acute care staff may have limited knowledge about dementia and the person&#x02019;s unique needs, and family may have a reduced role in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Case conferencing has been promoted as a promising approach for improving care outcomes for people with dementia living in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It brings together relevant health professionals and other decision-makers to discuss healthcare problems with the person and their family, provides a formal framework to understand expected changes, and can build consensus on goals of care for advance care planning. For residents with advanced dementia who cannot speak for themselves, case conferences can facilitate the sharing of different perspectives regarding what each resident would have wanted were (s)he able to choose. The lack of resident capacity for decision-making mandates involvement of family members with legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the resident. Moreover, involvement of family in decision-making may lead to improvements in their satisfaction with care in and of its own right [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This fits well with the philosophy of a palliative approach more generally, which assumes that the unit of care includes family members as well as the person with life-limiting illness him/herself. However, direct evidence for a relationship between case conferencing and improved QOL in nursing home residents with dementia is limited to a cross-sectional survey study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While two recent systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case conferencing in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], none were concerned with palliative care or care for residents with advanced dementia. Moreover, the case conferencing approaches used in these RCTs did not include family decision-makers, and only two included health professionals from disciplines other than nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Stronger evidence for an impact from case conferencing on palliative care quality and outcomes is available in the community palliative care setting, where two RCTs have found case conferencing to lead to better maintenance of physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and decrease hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The interventions in these studies facilitated case conferencing via strategies for building staff knowledge and motivation to undertake case conferencing, providing staff with detailed guidance for care planning, obtaining organisational and administrative support for case conferencing, and facilitating general practitioner attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The positive results from these trials highlight the structure and support needed for case conferencing to succeed in the community setting. Support of this kind may be even more important in the nursing home setting where staff are sometimes confused about the purpose of case conferencing and its role in healthcare, uncertain about the need for multidisciplinary input and the role of different disciplines, and where there is often a lack of collaborative culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The current paper reports the protocol for a cluster RCT called the IDEAL Project (Implementing Dementia End of life care At Local aged care facilities).

In a <italic>development phase</italic>, a case conferencing toolkit was compiled by members of the team for use in a general nursing home population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. During a <italic>feasibility and piloting ph</italic>ase, the toolkit and method of implementation was subjected to preliminary testing for residents with advanced dementia in six nursing homes in metropolitan and rural New South Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The pilot demonstrated the acceptability and clinical relevance of the toolkit, dementia-specific &#x0201c;triggers&#x0201d; for conduct of case conferences based on resident characteristics and/or clinical events (e.g. on admission to the nursing home, change in clinical status), and a palliative care framework for mapping the trajectory of residents in specific domains of disease progression (functioning, swallowing, weight loss, continence, level of consciousness, communication, and factors related to comorbid illness) and identifying issues that case conferencing should address. The pilot also informed development of a list of competencies for the role of case conference coordinator and associated training materials for the nursing home staff, and demonstrated feasibility of collecting descriptive data and outcome measures in the <italic>evaluation phase</italic>. Baseline data collected in the pilot also confirmed previous findings that, without facilitation, case conferences may seldom occur and/or be of poor quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study design</title><p>The IDEAL Project will use a parallel cluster RCT design because the intervention requires system-level changes that make it impossible to randomise individual residents within the same nursing home to different arms without contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>We follow previous trials of case conferencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in taking a pragmatic approach to design with the aim of improving external validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Features of pragmatic trials considered valuable by the project team include: 1) broad inclusion criteria to reflect the diversity of nursing homes and residents with advanced dementia and multiple comorbidities; 2) tailoring of the intervention to local conditions and individual resident needs; and 3) selection of endpoints focused on clinically important outcomes. We suggest that these benefits outweigh the disadvantages of a pragmatic design, namely poorer internal validity and inefficiency, as discussed below.</p><p>Ethics approval has been granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of New South Wales and ratified by HRECs at the University of Technology Sydney and Queensland University of Technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Block randomisation of nursing homes will use a computer generated allocation sequence and occur after initial consent. Randomisation will be stratified by organisational affiliation to control for the influence of organisational culture, policy and procedures on quality of care. Randomisation will also be stratified by rurality and dementia-specificity following evidence that these variables may be associated with quality of care for residents with advanced dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The pragmatic nature of the trial and complex nature of the intervention requires careful consideration of the feasibility versus desirability of blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The statistician (GL) will be blinded to nursing home identity for randomisation and analysis. However, nursing home managers will not be blinded to allocation because they need to make a fully informed decision regarding nursing home participation. Nursing staff and families at nursing homes in the intervention arm will also know that facilitated case conferencing is being implemented because they will be participating. The design seeks to limit potential for bias by omitting from participant information any reference to the study&#x02019;s evaluative aims or allocation of nursing homes to intervention versus usual care arms. Instead, verbal and written information will describe the study&#x02019;s aim in more general terms as being concerned with understanding the factors associated with quality of care for residents with advanced dementia by comparing between nursing homes with different characteristics. Research assistants collecting process and outcome data will also be blinded to the specific design and aims of the study, and each assistant will visit nursing homes in either the intervention or usual care arm only. However, the lead investigator (MA), the national project coordinator (TL), and two state-based project managers will remain unblinded for the purpose of liaising with implementation personnel and ensuring protocol fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sites</title><p>The study will be conducted in nursing homes in two Australian capital cities (Sydney, New South Wales, and Brisbane, Queensland). Nursing home inclusion criteria are designed to ensure sufficient numbers of eligible residents and are: 1) &#x02265;100 beds, 2) &#x02265;50&#x000a0;% residents with dementia, and 3) designation as &#x02018;high care&#x02019; (i.e. the most intensive level of care provided by Australian nursing homes). To minimise selection bias, nursing homes will be identified from listings on an Australian government website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and approached in random order.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Residents will be eligible to participate if they have a diagnosis of dementia documented in nursing home records and identified as having advanced disease as determined by: 1) a score on the Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in dementia of &#x02265;6a that has been stable for 1&#x000a0;month, and 2) a score on the Australia&#x02013;modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] of &#x02264;50 (i.e. a performance status of &#x02018;considerable assistance and frequent medical care required&#x02019; or worse). The FAST was chosen because of its utility in the advanced stages of dementia and its prognostic value; a FAST stage 7c combined with functional dependency (measured here by the AKPS) is predictive of an average survival of &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Potentially eligible residents will be identified by nursing home staff and screened by the project team.</p><p>Because residents will lack capacity to provide informed consent, this will be sought on their behalf from someone with designated authority as defined by legislation in New South Wales (&#x02018;person responsible&#x02019;) and Queensland (&#x02018;statutory health attorney&#x02019;). For each participating resident, written informed consent will be obtained additionally from a family member who visits the resident regularly and has authority to be involved in decisions about the resident&#x02019;s care. This person can be the same or different to the person responsible/statutory health attorney who gives consent for the resident to participate.</p><p>Permanent nurses and care assistants who provide care for enrolled nursing home residents will be invited to participate via group emails and face-to-face staff meetings. Community health professionals (e.g. GPs, community nurses, allied health professionals) attending case conferences for participating residents will be invited to provide written informed consent to participate in exit interviews and to allow case conferences to be audio-recorded for content analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conditions</title><p>The intervention and usual care arms to be compared in this study are as follows.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention &#x02013; facilitated case conferencing</title><p>The intervention utilises elements of two models for bringing about change in organisational culture, namely clinical leadership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and train-the-trainer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A Palliative Care Planning Coordinator (PCPC) will be appointed at each nursing home and trained to work on the project in a funded capacity for 16&#x000a0;h (0.4 full time equivalent) per week. Because change may be more sustainable when led from within an organisation, PCPCs will be appointed from existing nursing staff at intervention nursing homes based on criteria relating to clinical training and expertise (typically a senior registered nurse), relationships with staff, and identification by managers as a 'change champion' using established criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>As part of their orientation to the role, PCPCs will attend one week (35&#x000a0;h) of interactive training in which they will be provided with materials and tuition on the principles of person-centred palliative care for people with dementia as well as the organisation, conduct and documentation of case conferences and person-centred care plans. Materials will be based on a previous resource developed by members of the team for case conferencing in aged care more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], recently adapted to meet the specific needs of residents with advanced dementia and their families. In practical terms, PCPCs will be trained to: 1) use evidence-based &#x02018;triggers&#x02019; to identify residents with advanced dementia at a time-point likely to benefit from a case conference (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); 2) organise, set an agenda, facilitate and document case conferences with optimal involvement from family, multi-disciplinary nursing home staff and external health professionals (e.g. GPs); 3) develop and oversee implementation of palliative care plans; and 4) train other nursing home staff in person-centred palliative care.

In the absence of established minimal clinically important differences on the EOLD Scales, we follow a common rule-of-thumb for patient reported outcomes and assume 0.5 standard deviation (SD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Sample size is based on the EOLD scale with the highest intra-cluster correlation (ICC) (i.e., requiring the greatest number of clusters), namely the CAD-EOLD. To detect a change in CAD-EOLD of half a standard deviation (i.e. a change in score of at least 3), with a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level, power of 80&#x000a0;% and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 (estimated from unpublished data sourced from Dutch nursing homes), a sample size of 8 clusters per group (16 in total) with 15 residents per cluster will be necessary. Given an anticipated dropout rate at the resident level of 10&#x000a0;%, a recruitment sample of 272 residents (17 per site) will be needed for a final sample of 240 residents. We will also over-sample nursing homes by two in each arm (i.e. 10 in each arm, 20 in total) to protect against drop-out by managers.
