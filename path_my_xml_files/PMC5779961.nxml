The aim of the present study was to investigate the action of a novel protocol of co-treatment with PEMFs and hydroxytyrosol (HTY) on the proliferation and differentiation potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The HUVECs were assigned randomly into three groups: Control, PEMF-treated and PEMF + HT-treated. The intensity of the electromagnetic field used in this protocol was 2.25 mT, the frequency of the bursts was 50 Hz and the application time was 15 min. A Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to assess cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL apoptosis assay kit and calcein-acetoxymethyl/propidium iodide dual-staining assay. In addition, protein and mRNA expression levels of protein kinase B (Akt), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 and p53 were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays, respectively. The CCK-8 assay demonstrated that HTY contributed to HUVEC proliferation mediated by PEMFs in a time-dependent manner. The Transwell assay and scratch wound results demonstrated that co-treatment of HTY and PEMFs could increase HUVEC migration. Furthermore, the levels of apoptotic cells were reversed by pre-incubation with HTY in the PEMF treatment group, while PEMF treatment alone had no such effect. The proteins and mRNA expression levels of Akt, mTOR, TGF-&#x003b2;1 were elevated in co-treatment of HTY and PEMFs, whereas there was no effect on levels of p53. Therefore, the results indicated that combined exposure of HUVECs to PEMFs and HTY exerted protective effects in HUVECs by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate the beneficial roles of HTY and PEMF combined treatment in HUVECs, which may represent an effective treatment for wound healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pulsed electromagnetic fields</kwd><kwd>human umbilical vein endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>hydroxytyrosol</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wound healing is clinically defined as the completion of the closure of the wounded skin area, which is an interactive and dynamic process. It includes phases of hemostasis, cellular proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix synthesis and remodeling, and formation of granulation tissue (<xref rid="b1-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The evolution of the wound healing process involves a series of phenomena which represent attempts in reestablishing the anatomical structure and function of the normal tissue. One aspect of wound repair that has always been considered to be essential for adequate healing is the creation of new vasculature via angiogenesis (<xref rid="b2-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the correct sequence of molecular and cellular processes that occur during wound healing is critical for the development of novel treatments. Previous studies have demonstrated that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are capable of altering the structure of the cell membranes, and diversifying the permeability of different ion channels and the potential of the cellular membranes. At the molecular and cellular level, PEMFs have been advocated to exert a direct effect on the production of proteins and promote the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins that regulate gene transcription (<xref rid="b3-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, previous studies have suggested that the process of angiogenesis, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, may be influenced by various forms of electrical stimulation, including direct current, combined electromagnetic fields and PEMFs (<xref rid="b4-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In another study, Athanasiou <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b3-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) demonstrated that short duration PEMFs appear to facilitate and improve the quality of skin wound healing in a rat model. Nevertheless, further studies are required to define the optimal characteristics of the PEMFs, in order to ensure a faster and more effective wound healing process. Furthermore, PEMFs may also affect several membrane receptors and stimulate endothelial cells to secrete several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, connective tissue growth factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, PEMFs have been demonstrated to inhibit the process of hypoxia-induced apoptosis and augmented tube formation, migration and proliferative capacities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref rid="b7-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). To date, PEMFs have been applied experimentally and clinically to promote wound healing for many years (<xref rid="b8-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Hydroxytyrosol (HTY), or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, is one of the hydroxyaromatic components of secoiridoids, which is a very bioactive alcoholic ortho-diphenol. Accumulating experimental, clinical and epidemiological data have indicated that HTY is antioxidant and antimicrobial and that it has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and in several human diseases (<xref rid="b10-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Zrelli <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b12-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) revealed that HTY upregulates heme oxygenase-1 expression by stimulating the nuclear accumulation and stabilization of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, which leads to the wound repair of vascular endothelial cells crucial in the prevention of atherosclerosis. In another study, Scoditti <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b13-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) revealed that HTY could reduce inflammatory angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells, through matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, supporting a potential protective role for dietary polyphenols in atherosclerotic vascular disease and cancer. However, the exact function of HTY on endothelial cells has not been fully uncovered until now, especially in association with co-treatment with PEMFs.</p><p>When developing a wounding and healing model for PEMFs studies, endothelial cells appear to be an ideal system to investigate (<xref rid="b14-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The present study investigated the impact of the co-treatment of HYT and PEMFs on HUVEC function, and evaluated their influence on proliferation and migration in primary cultures of HUVECs. The present study also investigated the expression of functional parameters such as migration, viability and apoptosis, and the gene expression of protein kinase B (Akt), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 and p53 under the influence of different doses of HYT and PEMFs on HUVECs. The results demonstrated that PEMFs may provide novel research options in the field of wounding healing by promoting endothelial cell growth and by enhancing the healing response of the endothelium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HUVECs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

The cells were cultured in 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>PEMF exposure</title><p>The PEMFs used in the current study was one that was clinically available for the treatment of wound healing. The devices were supplied by Electro-Biology, Inc. (Parsippany, NJ, USA). The model required a voltage of 230 V with a frequency of 50/60 Hz to generate PEMF with a maximum intensity of 0.015 T (150 Gauss) and an impulse repetition frequency of up to 100 Hz. At the beginning of the experiment, the intensity of the magnetic fields generated inside the solenoid was measured with a Gaussimeter PCE-G28 (PCE Group, Albacete, Spain) with a triaxial probe. The intensity of the electromagnetic field used in this protocol was 2.25 mT, the frequency of the bursts was 50 Hz and the application time was 15 min. PEMF irradiation was performed on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of culture, with the solenoid inside the incubator, under the same conditions of temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>The cell viability was calculated using the Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HUVECs (1&#x000d7;104/well) were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for different time points. Following this, the cells were exposed to PEMFs at days 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, or treated with HTY (0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 150 &#x000b5;M) at day 2, or treated with a combination on days 0, 1, 2 or 4.

The lower layer of the chamber contained 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. The chambers were placed at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h. Non-migrating cells on the top of the membrane were removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had migrated to the bottom were fixed with 95% ethanol, stained with 0.2% crystal violet staining (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and imaged by bright-field microscopy (IX71; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and counted using Image-Pro Plus v6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).

The SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was used for qPCR to quantify RNA levels of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1). GAPDH served as an internal control. qPCR was performed on the 7300 FAST Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 40 cycles. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, then 40 cycles of 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 sec.

Proteins were solubilized and extracted with 200 &#x000b5;l lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and kept for 20 min on ice. Following this, the lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and the insoluble fractions were discarded. Equal amounts of protein (~60 &#x000b5;g) from each sample were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (EMD Millipore). After a 1 h incubation with 5% non-fat dry milk powder, the membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GADPH (1:5,000 dilution; cat. no. 97166), anti-Akt (1:2,000; cat. no. 9272), anti-mTOR (1:1,000; cat. no. 2983), anti-human TGF-&#x003b2;1 (1:2,000; cat. no. 3711) and anti-p53 (1:2,000; cat. no. 2524; all Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Several clinical studies have demonstrated that PEMFs can effectively alleviate tissue swell, traumatic pain and promote wound healing (<xref rid="b19-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Guerriero <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b21-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) described the first reported case of an innovative PEMF therapy, emysimmetric bilateral stimulation (EBS), used to successfully treat refractory skin ulcers in two elderly and fragile patients. They demonstrated a supportive role of PEMFs in the treatment of skin ulceration in diabetes, which was suggestive of a potential benefit of EBS for this clinical condition. HTY is a major phenolic compound in virgin olive oil in both free and complex forms. Catal&#x000e1;n <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b22-mmr-16-06-8826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) revealed the protective effect of HTY and its predominant plasmatic human metabolites, synthetized for the first time by using an intestinal cell model, which may be responsible in part for the protection against endothelial dysfunction. However, no previous findings have suggested that the combined treatment of PEMFs with HTY is a potentially promising therapeutic strategy for treating wound healing. To further investigate the mechanism of PEMF- and HTY-mediated neovascularization, the present study investigated the effects of co-treatment of PEMF and HTY on endothelial biological modification <italic>in vitro</italic>. The synergistic effect of PEMFs and HTY were identified, which may improve multiple endothelial functions including migration, proliferation, anti-apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting the therapeutic potential of PEMF- and HTY-combined treatment on pre-existing endothelial vasculature. However, other mechanisms involved in PEMF- and HTY-mediated neovascularization may exist; therefore, several limitations of the current research should be highlighted. For example, the present study used cell models, and the findings may not be extrapolated directly to animal models and humans. The gene activation and protein production of the HTY-stimulated HUVECs will require further study to confirm the beneficial effects of PEMFs on wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic>. Precaution should be taken when applying the results of this study to patients. Nevertheless, these results provide a basis for future studies to investigate whether the effects of co-treatment of PEMFs and HTY are also applicable in a clinical setting.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that combined exposure of PEMFs and HTY to HUVECs demonstrated protective effects on proliferation, migration and apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, implicating the potential benefits of this treatment for wound healing in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-mmr-16-06-8826"><label>1</label><element-citation
