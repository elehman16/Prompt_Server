Balance problems and fear of falling are two major challenges, and recent systematic reviews have revealed that habitual physical exercise training alone cannot reduce the occurrence of falls in stroke survivors. However, recent trials with community-dwelling healthy older adults yielded the promising result that interventions with a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) component can simultaneously promote balance and reduce the fear of falling. Therefore, the aim of the proposed clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of CBT and task-oriented balance training (TOBT) in promoting subjective balance confidence, and thereby reducing fear-avoidance behavior, improving balance ability, reducing fall risk, and promoting independent living, community reintegration, and health-related quality of life of patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study will constitute a placebo-controlled single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial in which patients are assessed immediately, at 3 months, and at 12 months.

Both groups will receive 45 min of TOBT twice per week for 8 weeks. In addition, the experimental group will receive a 45-min CBT-based group intervention, and the control group will receive 45 min of general health education (GHE) twice per week for 8 weeks.

It is a debilitating post-fall syndrome stemming from low balance self-efficacy and the fearful anticipation of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The reported prevalence of FoF varies between post-stroke stages, ranging from 54% before discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] from an acute unit to 44% at 6 months after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and 58% among community-dwelling patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If no action is taken, FoF spirals into a loss of physical function, dependency on others for assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), restrictions on daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and a higher fall rate, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] eventually compromising community integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Two recent systematic reviews synthesized the findings of interventions targeting FoF. Bula et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] review of 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 6794 community-dwelling elderly persons revealed that the majority of the reviewed studies (<italic>n</italic> = 38) focused on fall prevention and balance improvement, with FoF regarded as a secondary outcome. In the eight studies directly addressing the fear of fearing, the use of physiological interventions such as tai chi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; strengthening, balance and walking exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; and guided relaxation and exercise imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was reported to help reduce FoF among community-dwelling older people.</p><p id="Par22">In another systematic review, Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] examined 19 clinical trials addressing FoF among people with stroke. Despite its significant influence on stroke rehabilitation, FoF was regarded only as a secondary target in the studies reviewed. Tang&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials with 627 participants revealed that intensive exercise-based physiological interventions, such as gait training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], exergaming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and a combination of fitness, mobility and functional exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], can reduce FoF with a medium effect size (standardized mean difference 0.44; 95% confidence interval (0.11&#x02013;0.77); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009). No improvements were noted in the four reviewed studies using psychological interventions (motor imagery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and no retention effect was noted in the studies with a follow-up assessment. However, the effectiveness of CBT as a psychological intervention in reducing the FoF of stroke patients has not been examined.</p><p id="Par23">CBT is a psychotherapeutic approach that redirects negative cognitive, emotional, or behavioral responses to help people develop coping mechanisms and self-confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For example, people with FoF originating from impaired balance self-efficacy can use CBT to change their self-defeating beliefs, improve their balance self-efficacy and replace their unrealistic anticipation of falls and magnified FoF consequences with a realistic, positive perspective on falls, in turn reducing their fear avoidance.</p><p id="Par24">As summarized by Bula et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], studies have shown that physical exercise can reduce FoF in older people and people with stroke as either a primary or a secondary outcome. As psychological interventions offer another possible means of reducing FoF, we aim to examine the effectiveness of a combination of CBT and task-oriented balance training (TOBT) in reducing the FoF of people with stroke. TOBT will be used in the proposed study because it targets stroke-specific impairments and has been clinically proven to improve the balance performance of people with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The inclusion of CBT in our treatment arm is based on our hypothesis that CBT is an adjunct therapy capable of optimizing the treatment effects of exercise in reducing FoF. It is expected to tackle FoF directly through the promotion of balance self-efficacy, and its indirect effects will be mediated by repeated exercise and reduced fear-avoidance behavior, further enhancing balance performance and ADL, and thereby improving community integration. The combined effects of CBT and TOBT in reducing FoF are expected to improve patients&#x02019; balance, reduce their risk of falling, increase their independence, and thereby promote their community integration. Indeed, in Huang et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] recent RCT with elderly persons, CBT with an exercise intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 27) performed better than either CBT alone (<italic>n</italic> = 27) or treatment as usual (<italic>n</italic> = 26) in reducing FoF and depression and enhancing mobility and muscle strength, with retention effects observed up to 5 months later. Therefore, the proposed study aims to determine whether combining CBT with TOBT augments the latter&#x02019;s positive treatment effects on FoF, and thus fear-avoidance behavior, balance ability, fall risk, independent living, enhancing community integration, and health-related quality of life among community-dwelling seniors with stroke.</p><p id="Par25">To develop an intervention for clinical use, a protocol is necessary to ensure the consistency of implementation and ease of replication. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to report the details of a protocol for combining CBT and TOBT to reduce FoF among people with stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par26">The proposed study will be a placebo-controlled single-blind parallel-group RCT with a 12-month follow-up, conducted with community-dwelling chronic stroke survivors with FoF at a university-based rehabilitation center.

The participants in both groups will undergo 45-min sessions of TOBT in groups of three to five. TOBT is a rehabilitation strategy designed to improve muscle strength in lower limbs and to correct for balance deficits on the paretic side of patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

From week 3 to week 8, two major techniques, cognitive restructuring and behavioral modification, will be used in the CBT sessions to achieve participants&#x02019; personal goals. Cognitive restructuring attains thought alteration in the following four steps: (1) identification of automatic thoughts, (2) examination of cognitive distortion originating from automatic thoughts, (3) disputing the cognitive distortion and automatic thoughts, and (4) developing adaptive beliefs. In the proposed study, these four steps will be undertaken in the form of CBT homework assignments and sharing and discussion during CBT group sessions.</p><p id="Par43">After effecting cognitive restructuring, the CBT group sessions will target behavioral modification, another crucial component of the intervention. The participants will be equipped to identify potential risks and develop behavioral strategies to prepare them to increase their activity levels safely. The CBT sessions will also serve as a platform for vicarious learning, social persuasion, and social modeling for the participants through group discussion and observing the success of others. In addition, mastery experiences can be gained through the successful application of CBT in daily situations. Indeed, according to Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], this is the major source of self-efficacy. Therefore, the use of cognitive-restructuring and behavioral-modification techniques is expected to enhance the participants&#x02019; subjective balance confidence and reduce their fear-related avoidance behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par44">The control group will attend 16 health talks (two sessions per week for 45 min per session) delivered as an inactive attention placebo by a research assistant in groups of three to five.

The BBS consists of 14 items, each rated on a five-point scale. A score of 41&#x02013;56 indicates the ability to walk independently, 21&#x02013;40 indicates the ability to walk with assistance, and 0&#x02013;20 indicates wheelchair-bound movement.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Fall risk</title><p id="Par49">Fall risk will be quantified using the Short-form Physiological Profile Assessment (S-PPA), which consists of five tests: a vision test, a proprioception test, a lower extremity muscle force test, a hand reaction time test, and a balance test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Composite scores are measured on a seven-point scale according to the participants&#x02019; responses to the tests. Potential fall risk ranges from &#x02212;2, representing a very low fall risk, to 4, which represents a very marked fall risk.

As no previous studies have addressed the effects of CBT in reducing FoF in stroke populations, the effect size used to calculate the sample size is the same as that calculated for our pilot sample of ten subjects (0.26), in which five subjects received the CBT, another five subjects received the GHE, and both groups received 45 min of TOBT. The ABC-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] is the primary outcome measure at eight weeks after the end of treatment.

In the community under study, more than half of the patients with stroke experience impaired subjective balance confidence and have suffered at least one fall since discharge. Interventions for fall prevention have focused on balance training, leaving the FoF of stroke survivors under-addressed. The aim of the proposed clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of TOBT and CBT in reducing FoF, and in turn reducing fear-avoidance behavior, increasing balance, enhancing engagement in ADL, decreasing fall risk, promoting community reintegration, and enhancing the quality of life of patients with chronic stroke.</p><p id="Par57">CBT is a form of clinically proven psychotherapeutic intervention designed to shape patients&#x02019; thinking and actions to achieve therapeutic goals. Research has shown that multidimensional programs with CBT components provide an effective means of treating FoF and reducing the incidence of falling among healthy older adults. This sheds light on the effects on stroke recovery of CBT combined with customary physical training. The inclusion of CBT with customary physical training will help to break the vicious cycle of FoF and actual falls and thus, enhance the rehabilitative outcomes of patients with chronic stroke.</p><p id="Par58">One of the limitations of this study is not collecting data on actual falls. However, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the augmenting effects of CBT on existing physiotherapy in enhancing subjective balance confidence. The occurrence of post-stroke falls is a complex issue involving the interplay between physical, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Future studies could further examine the roles of subjective balance confidence in developing fall prevention strategies for patients with stroke. Besides, this study may involve community-dwelling stroke patients with a range of balance ability levels. Thus, the use of BBS may not be adequately sensitive to capture the balance improvement among subjects with mildly affected balance ability.</p><p id="Par59">It is hoped that the results of this study will provide scientific evidence supporting the use of CBT to augment the effects of physiotherapy in enhancing subjective balance confidence and thus, stroke rehabilitation. If effective, our intervention will offer a safe, cost-effective, and readily transferrable therapeutic approach to clinical practice that reduces fear-avoidance behaviors and fall risk, improves balance and level of independence, enhances health-related quality of life, and decreases associated healthcare costs.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par60">Recruitment started in October 2016.
