This technique was repeated 3 times at 90-second intervals, if necessary. In the case of persistent bleeding, 90 seconds after the last dose, a second medicine was given for bleeding control.

</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hemoptysis is one of the symptoms of pulmonary diseases such as parenchymal diseases (like infections) and endobronchial lesions (like tumors) as well as vasculitis (like Wegener&#x02019;s disease and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease).<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Based on its severity, hemoptysis is classified as mild, moderate, and severe. Moderate bleeding is attributed to 50&#x02013;100 mL/h bleeding in those without any history of pulmonary disease and 25&#x02013;50 mL/h in those with an underlying pulmonary disease. Severe hemoptysis is attributed to 100&#x02013;150 mL/h bleeding in those without a history of pulmonary disease and 50 mL/h bleeding in those with underlying pulmonary problems. In other words, severe hemoptysis can be life-threatening.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The causes of hemoptysis can be iatrogenic or noniatrogenic.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The most common life-threatening pulmonary bleedings are due to malignancies. According to the previous studies, 5&#x02013;15% of patients with lung tumors have life-threatening hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Other causes of life-threatening hemoptysis include bronchiectasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, mycetoma, necrotizing pneumonia, and bronchogenic carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Bronchoscopy is a technique for observing airways and has 2 applications: 1) diagnostic: evaluating patients with hemoptysis, probable lung cancer, and chronic coughs and observing abnormalities in the airways and bronchoalveolar lavage and 2) therapeutic: removing external objects, blood, and secretions; applying tumor laser therapy; treating bronchial stenosis; and implementing stents for the palliative care of malignancies causing stenosis in the trachea.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> An exact diagnosis of lung tumor requires several endobronchial biopsies. The susceptibility of tumors with a necrotic center and vascular tumors to bleeding after the first sampling is a major problem during bronchoscopy.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In the recent decade, according to the Spanish national guideline, cold saline lavage and adrenaline instillation on the bleeding site has been done as a treatment for hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Nonetheless, not all patients fully respond to this method of treatment.</p><p>The instillation of hemostatic factors such as tranexamic acid on the bleeding site is a new technique that has been investigated recently.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Tranexamic acid is a synthetic antifibrinolytic acid applied for the short-term control of bleeding. It inhibits fibrin degradation and consequently prevents blood loss through binding to plasminogen and plasmin.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In lethal massive hemoptysis, early investigation, including endobronchial adrenaline use, balloon tamponade, and intubation, is necessary for bleeding control. However, rebleeding may start 10&#x02013;15 minutes after adrenaline is absorbed.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Bronchial artery embolization is the treatment of choice for massive hemoptysis not controlled by another procedure.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The local application of tranexamic acid has been approved in several cases. For example, it has been reported that in patients with malignant mesothelioma, intrapleural tranexamic acid and, during oral surgeries, its oral solution can be used for controlling blood loss.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This drug can be used for bleeding control following surgery on the heart, liver, and large veins or surgery necessitated by trauma-related bleedings. Furthermore, it has been reported that tranexamic acid can decrease mortality.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> According to previous studies, oral or intravenous tranexamic acid has been used extensively in the treatment or prevention of mucosal or post-surgical bleedings.</p><p>The endobronchial administration of tranexamic acid is a potential therapeutic agent to treat acute pulmonary bleeding; accordingly, it is a safe and useful method before intervention (balloon occlusion or embolization) in patients with uncontrolled hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The present study was designed to compare the efficacy of endobronchial instillation of tranexamic acid with that of adrenaline in controlling acute endobronchial bleeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (K/92/228) and was conducted in the Research Center of Afzalipour Hospital, Kerman, Iran, from 2012 to 2013.</p><p>Among 276 patients who met the inclusion criteria for participation in the current study, 226 were excluded because of successful bleeding control with cold saline, cardiovascular disease, bleeding tendency, or anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug consumption. Patients who already had hemoptysis or those who started bleeding after biopsy and could not be controlled with cold saline lavage during bronchoscopy were selected.</p><p>First, CBC, PTT, PT, and INR were determined in all the patients. In the bronchoscopy room, after a peripheral venous access was obtained, cardiovascular monitoring, oxygen therapy, local anesthesia of the throat with 2% lidocaine (2 mL in 5 mL of saline), and sedation/anesthesia with an intravenous injection of 2.5 mg of midazolam were performed. During the bronchoscopy procedure, a biopsy specimen was taken through a Pentax bronchoscope (Japan) using type 1 biopsy forceps (size 100&#x02013;18) (Germany). The same size of bronchoscopes and forceps was used for all the patients. Based on the census method and the random allocation method, the process of patient selection was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Fifty patients were divided into 2 equal groups of 25. In cases of persistent bleeding, after 90 seconds of cold saline lavage, adrenaline (1 mg diluted in up to 20 mL of saline) in the first group and tranexamic acid (500 mg diluted in up to 20 mL of saline) in the second group were directly instilled on the bleeding site. If necessary, the medication was repeated 3 times.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Ninety seconds after the last dose, in cases of bleeding control failure, crossover with a second medicine was done in order to save the patient&#x02019;s life.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 flow diagram is depicted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMS-42-129-g001"/></fig><p>Direct observation of clot through the bronchoscope was considered as bleeding control.

Previous studies have emphasized on the oral or intravenous administration of tranexamic acid for bleeding control and preventing bleeding recurrence.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent and is effective against blood loss in patients with increased fibrinolysis activity after surgery and in patients with a normal hemostatic pathway.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The use of local hemostatic agents for bleeding control has been recently under controversy.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The results of the present study suggested that the efficiency of tranexamic acid and adrenaline in controlling iatrogenic and noniatrogenic bleedings was the same. Indeed, in most of our patients treated with tranexamic acid, bleeding was adequately controlled without any need for a second drug. According to the previously published statistics, the rate of bleeding after bronchoscopy is 1&#x02013;20%.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The rate of bleeding following biopsy is the same for the malignant and benign tumors of the airways. Vascular, necrotic endobronchial, and other hypervascular tumors, including carcinoid tumors, often tend to have the highest rate of bleeding during bronchoscopy.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> An endobronchial injection of epinephrine or other vasoactive agents before biopsy may not prove effective.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, due to systemic absorption and side effects such as vasoconstriction, hypertension, and tachyarrhythmia, the dose of epinephrine and other drugs should be limited.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It was recently reported that tranexamic acid was able to reduce transfusion post cardiovascular surgery; however, seizures and thrombotic events remained side effects of this drug.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Generally, tranexamic acid is tolerated well and has only a few side effects, including digestive side effects (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) following oral consumption and hypotension following rapid intravenous injections.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the present study, the patients tolerated the endobronchial instillation of tranexamic acid well and it was efficient in bleeding control without any side effects. According to a case report, the instillation of tranexamic acid and then its oral administration, following relative response to bronchial artery embolization, in a patient with frequent severe pulmonary bleedings due to cystic fibrosis was able to stop hemoptysis successfully.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis is common, and major bleeding aggravates the decline in lung function or may even result in death. Sometimes, embolization fails to stop hemoptysis; therefore, tranexamic acid can assist in stabilizing the patient until lung transplantation.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Another case report highlighted the beneficial effect of oral tranexamic acid in preventing hemoptysis recurrence and, indeed, rendering embolization unnecessary in a patient with cystic fibrosis.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A study on patients with hemoptysis compared the efficacy of oral tranexamic acid and placebo and reported that although the result of 1 week&#x02019;s treatment was not different between the 2 groups, bleeding was controlled sooner in the tranexamic acid group.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a similar study designed as a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial on 46 patients with hemoptysis in 2002, a 1-week treatment with oral tranexamic acid led to no significant difference with the placebo group insofar as the results did not demonstrate that tranexamic acid shortened the duration of hemoptysis after 7 days.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A survey reported the use of oral hemostatic agents such as tranexamic acid as an additional palliative therapy for lung cancer hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> All the aforementioned studies investigated the effects of oral or intravenous tranexamic acid, while we studied the effects of the endobronchial instillation of tranexamic acid on the bleeding site. In a study on 2 patients with bleeding due to a pulmonary tumor, one following bronchoscopic biopsy and the other following endoluminal electrocautery, first cold saline and adrenaline were used for bleeding control and then because of failure in bleeding control, 500&#x02013;1000 mg of endobronchial tranexamic acid was administered. Bleeding was controlled within a few seconds, and the patients were discharged some days later without any side effects or bleeding recurrence.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These results are concordant with those in the current study. Invasive or surgical procedures to control bleeding have more complications.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Not only can antifibrinolytic agents be used as a temporary treatment before surgery or embolization of the pulmonary artery, but also they can reduce mortality.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In one study on patients with hemoptysis treated with endobronchial tranexamic acid for 2 years, malignancies and bronchiectasis were the most common causes of noniatrogenic bleeding and in patients who had responded to tranexamic acid, tumors were the most common cause of bleeding. In that study, almost all the patients with iatrogenic bleeding showed a good response to endobronchial tranexamic acid and the patients who did not respond to the treatment suffered from bronchiectasis.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These findings chime in with our results in as much as tranexamic acid was as efficient as adrenaline in both groups of our patients with iatrogenic and noniatrogenic bleedings. According to a case report on a patient with severe pulmonary bleeding due to vascular malformation, intrabronchial epinephrine and cold saline lavage failed to control bleeding, while the endobronchial instillation of tranexamic acid was successful in bleeding control.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As was previously mentioned, in the current study, tranexamic acid was as beneficial as adrenaline in major hemoptysis; however, a larger sample size might have yielded a different result. In 2009, the effects of the endobronchial administration of tranexamic acid on 6 patients with pulmonary bleeding were investigated. Two patients who had bleeding during biopsy were treated with intrabronchial tranexamic acid and the rest of the patients, who had spontaneous hemoptysis, underwent inhalation of tranexamic acid. All the patients showed good responses to the first dose of tranexamic acid without any side effects and the study showed no difference between the inhalation and endobronchial instillation of tranexamic acid in controlling hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The results of that study were similar to our findings, although we did not investigate the effect of the inhalation of tranexamic acid. Another study used intrabronchial tranexamic acid for bleeding control after taking biopsies from tumors with a high risk of bleeding and reported that the injection of intrabronchial tranexamic acid was safe and useful.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> More recent studies, albeit with small sample sizes, have also confirmed that local tranexamic acid is effective in hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The same results have been observed from the effects of nebulized tranexamic acid in patients with tracheobronchial cancer and massive hemoptysis. In rare cases, seizures and bronchospasm were reported as common adverse effects after nebulized tranexamic acid.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> It is deserving of note that in the present study, only 1 patient needed a second medicine in the group of tranexamic acid, whereas 8 patients in the adrenaline group required a second medicine; the difference, however, did not constitute statistical significance. The absence of discrepancy can be justified by the small sample size, which is the major limitation of the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hemoptysis is a life-threatening complication. The application of local hemostatic agents has recently received a great deal of attention. The present study, with a sample size larger than that in the previous studies, compared the efficacy of the local instillation of tranexamic acid with that of adrenaline in bleeding control during bronchoscopy. Our data showed that tranexamic acid was as efficient as adrenaline in controlling pulmonary bleeding. Tranexamic acid had the same efficacy in controlling iatrogenic and noniatrogenic bleedings. Moreover, in the patients treated with tranexamic acid as the first drug, bleeding was controlled without any need for the use of a second drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The present article was extracted from a thesis written by Rozita Zarshenas and financially supported by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.
