This study examines how an alternate-day fasting (ADF) diet high (HF) or low (LF) in fat affects plasma FFA profiles in the context of weight loss, and changes in body composition and lipid profiles. After a 2-week weight maintenance period, 29 women (BMI 30&#x02013;39.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) 25&#x02013;65 years old were randomized to an 8-week ADF-HF (45% fat) diet or an ADF-LF (25% fat) diet with 25% energy intake on fast days and <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake on feed days. Body weight, BMI and waist circumference were assessed weekly and body composition was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Total and individual FFA and plasma lipid concentrations were measured before and after weight loss. Body weight, BMI, fat mass, total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations decreased (P &#x0003c; 0.05) in both groups. Total FFA concentrations also decreased (P &#x0003c; 0.001). In the ADF-LF group, decreases were found in several more FFAs than in the ADF-HF group. In the ADF-HF group, FFA concentrations were positively correlated with waist circumference. Depending on the macronutrient composition of a diet, weight loss with an ADF diet decreases FFA concentrations through potentially different mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been associated with elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

However, the effects of weight loss on plasma FFA concentrations are unclear.

The varied results of weight loss on FFA concentrations may depend on the dietary protocol and macronutrient distribution.</p><p>Alternate day fasting (ADF) has been shown to be effective for weight loss. ADF regimens include alternating days of food consumption (feed days) with fast days where food intake is restricted to 25% of a person's energy needs in a day. Weight loss via ADF in adults has resulted in several cardioprotective changes in the blood lipid profile including lower LDL cholesterol, and increased average LDL particle size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Whether these ADF-associated changes in weight loss extend to changes in plasma total FFA and FFA composition is unknown. Additionally, we do not know how the macronutrient composition of ADF diets impact the FFA profile. The objective of this study is to examine how ADF diets of different macronutrient compositions affect plasma FFA profiles in the context of weight loss, and changes in body composition and lipid profiles.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Of the 35 women who started the study, 29 completed the trial. One subject was excluded due to scheduling conflicts and five subjects were excluded due to not having lost any weight during the weight loss period or noncompliance to the diet regime (n = 2 in the ADF-HF group and n = 3 in the ADF-LF group). Baseline characteristics of the ADF-HF and ADF-LF groups are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>.

There were no differences in the extent of weight loss, changes in BMI, and WC between groups. There was a trend (P = 0.09) for a group*time interaction in fat mass. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides decreased in both groups (P &#x0003c; 0.05) during the weight loss period, whereas HDL-C did not change over time. There was a trend (P = 0.08) for a group*time interaction in LDL-C whereby a larger decrease in LDL-C was observed in the ADF-LF vs. the ADF-HF group.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>FFA concentrations</title><p>With weight loss, total FFAs decreased (P &#x0003c; 0.001) in the ADF-LF group by an average of 98.62 &#x000b1; 3.66&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L.

During weight loss, diet composition may affect FFA concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Our study examined the effect of weight loss with a high fat ADF diet on total and individual FFA concentrations compared to a low fat ADF diet. We found that after weight loss, both groups had decreases in total FFA concentrations. However, even though weight loss and regional body composition results were similar between the two groups, almost all FFAs in the ADF-LF group decreased whereas changes were only noted in LA and LNA in the ADF-HF group. Despite similar changes in waist circumference, decreases in WC were correlated with decreases in several individual FFAs in the ADF-HF group only.</p><p>In our study, we evaluated circulating concentrations of FFA. Elevated total and individual plasma FFA concentrations observed in obesity have been linked with cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. FFAs has been observed to impair vasodilation in blood vessels through activating apoptosis in the endothelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Furthermore, FFA is the main energy source for the myocardium; high levels of FFA play a role in damaging the myocardium, exacerbating heart failure and leading to myocardial infarction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Thus far, no ADF studies have analysed circulating FFA profiles in order to determine whether any cardio-protective changes occur at the FFA level. The results of our FFA analysis show that weight loss with an ADF diet decreases total FFA concentrations, and that both the ADF-LF and ADF-HF diets could be effective at reducing FFA concentrations. Though no significant group*time interactions were observed, the decrease in total FFA concentrations with an ADF-LF diet was almost 2 times that of the ADF-HF diet. Previously, effects of weight loss on FFA concentrations appear to be variable with some studies showing decreases in FFA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, while others show no change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> or even increases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> in FFA. Some of these studies achieved weight loss using a very low calorie diet, surgery or hypocaloric diets with varying macronutrient composition. Therefore, the dietary regimen used in these studies during the weight loss period may be a source of variability in changes of FFA to weight loss.</p><p>Individual FFA concentrations have been shown to contribute to CVD risk differently. Thrombosis and arrhythmia have been associated with a number of saturated FFA including palmitic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Palmitic, oleic, and myristic acid have been positively associated with lipid risk factors of CVD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Our study also showed that LA, DHA and LNA were associated with lipid risk factors of CVD. Patients post-myocardial infarction were also shown to have greater palmitic and oleic acid and lower linoleic acid compared to age-matched controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. With an ADF-LF diet, we observed a significant reduction in more types of FFAs (LNA, MA, AA, LA, PA and OA) vs. in the ADF-HF group (LNA and LA). This suggests that the low fat ADF diet was more effective at decreasing FFA concentrations vs. the high fat ADF diet. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine changes in individual FFA composition in the context of a weight loss program using ADF with varying macronutrient composition. Normal weight participants who consumed a high fat diet also observed changes in the proportion of LA and LNA compared with a low fat diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. These results suggest that LA and LNA are more sensitive to changes with the consumption of a high fat diet. Therefore, combining a high fat diet with weight loss via an ADF protocol would likely have a greater effect on these FFAs, as observed in this study.</p><p>There were strong correlations in the ADF-HF group where decreases in waist circumference were associated with decreases in several FFAs. In contrast, there were no such correlations between waist circumference and FFAs in the ADF-LF group. Waist circumference is considered a surrogate marker of abdominal adiposity and visceral fat mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We hypothesize that in weight loss, the levels of dietary fat intake and changes in abdominal fat have a collective effect on decreases in FFA concentrations. The relatively larger contribution of a diet low in fat to changes in FFA concentrations may mask the relationship between abdominal fat mass and FFA concentrations. In contrast, weight loss with a high fat diet may have a smaller effect in lowering FFA concentrations in comparison to the greater effect of decreases in abdominal fat. Regardless of the relative contribution of dietary fat content on FFA lowering, changes in abdominal fat mass during weight loss with an ADF diet resulted in cardioprotective changes in FFA concentrations.</p><p>A major strength of the study was that both the ADF-LF and ADF-HF group were matched for body composition. Additionally, body composition changed equally in the ADF-LF and ADF-HF groups. Thus, the effects of a HF and LF diet on FFA concentrations could be examined without the confounding effects of changes in body composition. Additionally, since all the meals were provided and the ratio of SFA:MUFA:PUFA was similar in the high and low fat diets, the effects of overall fat content on FFA concentrations could be isolated.</p><p>Due to a communication error during sample processing, hormonal regulators of lipolysis were not measured. While insulin inhibits FFA release, other hormones such as epinephrine stimulate FFA release over a wide range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, we are not able to determine the mechanisms that underlie the changes we saw in FFA composition as a result of a ADF-HF or ADF-LF diet. Another limitation of this study was that both intervention groups lost weight during the weight maintenance period. However, there were no between group differences in weight changes. It is conceivable that decreases in weight during the weight maintenance period diluted observable decreases in FFA concentrations during the weight loss that followed. As we observed significant changes in FFA concentrations during the weight loss period, the effect of the initial weight lost during the weight maintenance period on FFA concentrations was likely to be minimal.</p><p>In summary, our findings are the first to demonstrate that a weight loss intervention with ADF-HF or ADF-LF can reduce total and individual plasma FFA concentrations though it appears that a LF diet may be more effective at lowering FFA. Though both diets equally reduced waist circumference, we found several strong correlations between WC and changes in individual FFAs in the ADF-HF group that were not present in the ADF-LF group. Since there were no differences in changes in FFA composition between groups, the correlations between WC and FFAs found only in the ADF-HF group imply that ADF-HF and ADF-LF diets may lower FFA concentrations through different mechanisms. Overall, the decreases in FFA concentrations after ADF weight loss may be cardio-protective. Future studies might include individual FFA profiles when evaluating macronutrient composition, as the effects of specific FFAs in this context are not well known.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Chicago area and were randomized by stratified random sampling based on BMI and age.
