In the maltose-inducible system, maltose plays two roles as an inductor: on one hand, it positively regulates the transcription of the P<italic><sub>glv </sub></italic>promoter; on the other hand, as a fermentation carbon source, its metabolism production-glucose repressed the activity of promoter. There is a dynamic balance between the two carbon sources during the fermentation. Maltose was a positive regulation factor and, meanwhile degraded as one of carbon sources during this process; in the later stage of fermentation, both the total carbon sources and glucose are at relatively low level. When induced by 5% maltose, the production of &#x003b2;-Gal reached the maximum at 24 h and then decreased. In the glucose repression experiment, expression strength of both the mutated and wildtype promoter had a drastic increase after cultured for 24 h. This may be the utilization of glucose, as an easy ferment carbon source, was prior to maltose and the amount of glucose in total carbon source declines to a relatively low level in the later stage of fermentation. As a result, the repression caused by glucose was relatively alleviated after 24 h.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we obtained a mutated promoter Pglv-M1 through site-directed mutagenesis, which demonstrated high expression strength and alleviated the repression caused by glucose.

After digested with <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI, these amplified fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluskm, resulting in pJR1, pJR2, pJR3 and pJR4. A ribosome binding site (RBS) fragment INSD generated by annealing two artificially synthesized oligonucleotides INSID-1 and INSID-2, was cloned into the pJR1-4 digested by <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sac</italic>I, respectively.

Then the GAb fragment, digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Sac</italic>I, was cloned into the corresponding sites in pB43, resulting in pCYL17. Finally, with primers P43-2-up and GlvA-bac-down, the P43 promoter and the GAb were amplified as a single product from pCYL17 and ligated with pYG34 after digestion with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sac</italic>I, resulting in pCYL25. The <italic>B. subtilis </italic>1A747 was transformed with the linear fragment of pCYL25 obtained with <italic>Sca</italic>I to replace promoter P<italic>glv </italic>with P43 via a double crossover event between the linearized pCYL25 and <italic>B. subtilis </italic>1A747 chromosome. The spectinomycin resistance (Spec<sup>R</sup>) colonies were selected. And the resultant strain was named as BCYL.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of total RNA and Real-time PCR</title><p>The cultures was harvested at 24 h.

Absorbance was recorded at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-3010). One unit of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to release 1 &#x003bc;mol 2-nitrophenol from o-nitrophenylgalactopyranoside per minute at 55&#x000b0;C. &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity is expressed as units per mL sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Southern blot analysis</title><p>Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA digested with <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
