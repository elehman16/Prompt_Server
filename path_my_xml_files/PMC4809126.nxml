A study has displayed that achieving 10,000 steps/day is associated with important health outcomes and have been used to promote PA. Pedometers are a popular tool for PA interventions in different setting. This study investigated the effects on pedometer-based and self-reported PA among Tabriz University employees.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This experimental study assessed the effects of 16 weeks pedometer-based workplace intervention. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 154) were employees of two worksites. Pedometer-based and self-reported PA from one intervention worksite was compared with the data of a comparison workplace.

The pedometer-based program was originally designed for sedentary individuals.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Individuals holding relatively sedentary jobs may be at greater risk of becoming inactivity. Physical inactivity is an increasing problem at the worksite.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Self-reports displayed that the &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; individuals not reaching 10,000 steps/day at baseline, increased their PA mostly at work, which suggests that the worksite might be a suitable location to reach this inactive group.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The worksite has been recognized as a key setting to promote PA due in part to the fact that an intervention can coincide at a venue where individuals spend a significant amount of time on a consistent basis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although the worksite has been identified as a suitable setting to promote PA and the pedometer is found to be an effective tool for promoting PA, there are limited number documented studies on the effectiveness of using pedometer at the worksite.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, these studies carried out in the Belgian,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Canada,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Australia,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Japan,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the United States.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] No study, if any, examined the effects of a pedometer-based program in Iran. However, no research could be found studying the effects of a supportive workplace intervention in Iran, continent with different socioeconomic, environmental and cultural characteristics compared with other parts of world. The present intervention study aimed to improve levels of PA in Iranian workplace. However, the increasingly inactivity nature of many jobs and work tasks is characteristic of the contemporary workplace. A need to counteract the changing nature of work and to support PA promotion at workplace is evident.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Previous study found that women are less active than men.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence in this study, women were selected as a target group of the research. The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of pedometer-based walking program could motivate sedentary employees to promote their PA at work as well as improve their lifestyle behavior at life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study used an experimental pretest-posttest design, which evaluated the effects on pedometer-based (workday and nonworkday step counts) and self-reported PA. Following university ethics clearance, a convenience sample of 77 women from medical sciences employees as control worksite and 77 women from nonmedical sciences employees as intervention worksite from one Tabriz University located in Azerbaijan province at North-West of Iran, where most job were sedentary, volunteered for the study. The sample size in this study was taken from De Cocker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] study that the intervention's effect size was very strong (0.5&#x02013;0.8) based on F index. Taking account of power and error according to software G-Power (SPSS Inc. IL Chicago, USA) the sample size was 51 also with 50% attrition rate, the sample size was estimated about 75 in each group. Participants were informed through mass E-mails and posters about the study purpose to evaluate PA through a questionnaire and a pedometer registration) those willing to participate were instructed to wear a pedometer to collect objective PA and a guide on how to use the pedometer and the activity log. Furthermore, participants were given information about International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ) to collect subjective PA. Participants submitted weekly logs that recorded number of the step taken per day using their pedometer through study. This study from one intervention worksite (60 participants at posttest) compared with the data of a comparison worksite (60 participants at posttest). Information on response rates is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

The increase of the leisure time PA in intervention worksite may be using at the lunch times to walk. Encouragement to promote PA and worksite step competition may be due to increasing PA at leisure time. In our study, the absence of group differences except walking activity on self-reported IPAQ was seen; also we found the increased number of steps based on the pedometer. The study showed walking is most encouraged of all types of PA[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] also Rzewnicki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that more than two-thirds of the participants over reported walking on the IPAQ. Based on the guidelines pedometer &#x02013; determined PA recommendations,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] all employees in both worksites were categorized into sedentary &#x02013; low active &#x0003c;7499 steps/day at baseline, the intervention group recorded on average of 8279 &#x000b1; 2759 steps/day at post-test in workday and categorized into moderately active (7500&#x02013;9900 steps/day). All employees in both groups were categorized into moderate active (600 &#x0003c; MET &#x0003c;3000) based on the guidelines for data processing and analysis of IPAQ. However, self-reported measurement of behavior, is identified to significant measurement error[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and this difference findings from pedometer and IPAQ data may be explained by a bias self-reported. Rzewnicki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] concluded that 40% of the participants over reported vigorous and moderate intensity PA. Other studies[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] &#x02013; revealed that women tend to report participating in low to moderate activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</title><p>The substantial limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size.

The workday step count findings should be interpreted with caution because we do not know whether the workday step counts were actually taken at work or elsewhere. However, this study has strengths. First, this is the first study was evaluated PA with objective pedometer data in Iran. Pedometers identify a subtle change in PA, which may not be found through a questionnaire, in addition, this pedometer-based study had a control group. Other strength is the comparison objective data (step counter) and subjective data (IPAQ).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Data on the impact of pedometer-based workplace intervention on employees are scarce. The use of pedometer-based intervention improved PA among our study participants. This means that pedometer-based program is appropriate for this type of group.
