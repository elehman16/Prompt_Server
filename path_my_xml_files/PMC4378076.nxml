Nor-epinephrine was used as appropriate. Haemodynamic and transoesophageal Doppler parameters (intraoperative), renal function, peak portal vein blood flow velocity (PPV), hepatic artery resistive index (HARI), urine output (UOP), liver enzymes, catecholamine support were compared intra-operatively and 4 days post-operatively.

This was a prospective randomised controlled trial and after obtaining written informed consent, 50 recipients were allocated to two groups, control group (C; <italic>n</italic> = 25) and terlipressin groups (T; <italic>n</italic> = 25) by simple randomisation technique (sealed opaque envelopes). The study was also registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials registry of South African Cochrane Registry as a RCT (PACTR201402000752252). Inclusion criteria were male and female patients aged 18&#x02013;55 years with model of end stage liver disease score between 12 and 20, portal vein after transplantation of adequate length for the Doppler beam to allow for high-quality signals. Exclusion criteria included SVR index (SVRI) &#x02265;1700 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup> /m<sup>2</sup>, history of myocardial infarction, renal dysfunction, severe oesophageal varices and irregular heart rhythm.</p><p>General anaesthesia was induced with propofol titrated (approximately 20 mg every 10 s, 1-1.5 mg/kg) with Entropy<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GE Healthcare Finland, Helsinki, Finland) and clinical signs. Rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg was used to facilitate endotracheal intubation under neuromuscular monitoring. Anaesthesia was maintained with desflurane (Baxter, Erlangen, Germany) in O<sub>2</sub> /air mixture (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.4), fentanyl, and rocuronium to keep the entropy between 40 and 60.</p><p>An arterial line was placed in the non-dependent hand radial artery, and an ultrasound guided central line was inserted in the right internal jugular vein.</p><p>Peri-operative fluid regimens consisted of Ringer's acetate solutions (6 ml/kg/h). Albumin 5% was administered in the presence of hypoalbuminemia related to ascites. Packed red blood cells were transfused to keep haematocrit concentration above 25%. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) guided intraoperative blood transfusion protocol was undertaken.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Transoesophageal Doppler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Cardio QP; Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK) was placed at mid-oesophagus level till aortic blood flow signals were identified. The time measured by TOD for blood to flow within the aorta was the systolic flow time, and when corrected for the heart rate, the corrected flow time (FTc). Boluses of colloids were guided by an algorithm depending on stroke volume (SV) and FTc, similar to that used by Sinclair <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] 200-ml of 6% hydroxyethyl starch in saline (6% HES 130/0.4 Voluven<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Fresenius-Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) was given when FTc reached &#x0003c;0.35 ms.</p><p>In the terlipressin treated group, the infusion (Glypressin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was started at the beginning of surgery at a dose of 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and later titrated (1.0&#x02013;4.0 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x0003e;65 mmHg and SVRI &#x0003c;2600 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup> /m<sup>2</sup> calculated by the TOD. Post-operatively the Doppler probe was removed, and the terlipressin infusion was guided only by the MAP. Controls received a placebo of crystalloids in place of terlipressin. In both groups, noradrenaline was infused when MAP fell to &#x0003c;65 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation, particularly post-reperfusion. Same surgeons and piggyback technique was used in all cases. Portal vein anastomosis was performed first, and then followed by hepatic artery anastomosis and bile duct reconstruction in all cases. No veno-venous bypass or temporary portocaval shunt were used. All patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.</p><p>Continuous intraoperative data collection included heart rate (beat/min), arterial blood pressure (BP) (mmHg), central venous pressure (CVP) (mmHg) and Doppler parameters (FTc (330&#x02013;360 ms), SV (50&#x02013;100 cc/beat), cardiac output [COP] [4&#x02013;8 L/min] and SVR (1900&#x02013;2400 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup>)), at 15 min after induction of anaesthesia (T1), 60 min after T1 (T2), 30 min after clamping of the portal vein (T3), 10 min after reperfusion (T4) and T5, 60 min after reperfusion. The mean daily post-operative haemodynamic data [heart rate, arterial BP and CVP (mmHg)] were calculated from the averaged 24 h measurements of each day (for 4 days).</p><p>Only intraoperative Doppler values were assessed as the probes were removed during the weaning process in haemodynamically stable recipients. TOD probe were continued in place if the recipient was not successfully weaned. Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography monitoring was only applied after transplanting the liver with portal vein and hepatic artery anastomosis completed. Ultrasonography indices included portal venous blood flow (PVBF) ml/s, hepatic artery resistive index (HARI). Urine output (UOP) (ml/kg/h), conventional renal and liver function laboratory and blood concentration of lactate were also reported.</p><p>Sample size was calculated as 25 per group based on anticipated 25% change in the SVRI. The SVRI at 60 min after the terlipressin infusion was estimated to be 1472 &#x000b1; 284 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup> /m<sup>2</sup> to detect a mean difference of 20% in a previous study[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (&#x003b1; at 0.05, and maximum &#x003b2; =20% with a power of 80%). IBM SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Lenth Java applets were used for power and sample size calculation. Kolmogorov-Smirnova test revealed that the variables were normally distributed, and parametric statistics were carried out.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Data were described using mean and standard deviation. Comparisons were based on the independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Within the group, comparisons were carried out using repeated measures ANOVA. Box and whiskers graphs were done. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test measured association between qualitative variables. After the end of the study, a correction of <italic>P</italic> value for multiple testing was set to 0.01 for significance (Bonforroni correction of multiple comparisons).

Of the 50, 47 were weaned successfully in the immediate post-operative period.

This was reflected in a better mean arterial BP without any significant reduction in COP and heart rate during the immediate post-operative period as seen in a study by Mukhtar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Fayed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in a similar study demonstrated significant improvement in MAP but with an associated decrease in COP and heart rate. Kalambokis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the effects of terlipressin on haemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and observed increases in SVR. Normalising low SVR in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension helps to return the hepatosplanchnic blood to the central compartment and improves perfusion into major organs. Compromised COP during clamping of the inferior vena cava without veno-venous bypass must be supported by an increase in the SVR, since excessive compensation by fluids might lead to a right heart dysfunction after reperfusion.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, the requirements for norepinephrine support were significantly lower among patients treated with terlipressin, as evidenced in other studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Terlipressin administration can also improve renal functions by decreasing plasma concentrations of rennin, aldosterone and nor epinephrine. This reduction in the vasoconstrictors leads to an increase renal blood flow.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In our study, patients treated with terlipressin not only showed improvement in renal function tests but also demonstrated a significant increase in UOP compared with controls without any sign of splanchnic hypoperfusion. Terlipressin increases UOP not only due to improvement in renal function, but also by stimulating V1a receptors.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the present study, terlipressin was associated with a decrease in PVBF velocity. Portal hyperflow carries risk of increasing vascular injury to the graft, contributing to the dysfunction. Portal decompression after blood flow restoration plays an important role for survival in experimental models.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The decrease in portal flow was not accompanied by changes in HARI; this suggests that terlipressin does not cause hepatic arterial vasoconstriction and maintains the flow in the face of falling portal perfusion. Narahara <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also observed that terlipressin infusion dose did not decrease HARI in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Fayed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that decrease in portal blood flow was associated with a decreased hepatic arterial resistance. Hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) is an intrinsic regulatory mechanism to maintain total hepatic blood flow (when PVBF decreases, hepatic arterial blood flow increases, and vice versa). HABR can be blunted in some cirrhotic patients, and this may be due to a hyposensitivity of adenosine receptors of the artery.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Post-operative liver enzymes were significantly lower in terlipressin group as compared to control, possibly because of the reduction in portal venous pressure. Yagi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied the impact of portal venous pressure on graft function after LDLT and demonstrated that peak serum AST, bilirubin levels and international normalised ratio after LDLT were significantly higher with increased portal venous pressures. Reduced blood flow in the splanchnic region with terlipressin was not accompanied with signs of splanchnic hypo perfusion as lactate blood levels, which were comparable between both groups; this was also observed by Wagener <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Reducing portal vein pressure is expected to decrease the amount of bleeding and transfusion. Blood transfusion requirements were not significantly different between two groups in the present study as in other studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The refinement of surgical techniques and the use of piggy back technique during transplantation together with ROTEM may have all contributed to the reduction in transfusion requirements. TOD data can also help guide the clinician in fluid administration and titration of vasopressors and inotropes,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which was evident in the results of our study where terlipressin use was associated with reduced nor epinephrine usage.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Transoesophageal Doppler was used in the current study intraoperatively; several studies have demonstrated good overall correlation between CO determined by TOD and thermo dilution.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is often a misleading measurement of left ventricular preload. Many disorders can alter the relationship between PCWP and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and there is often no direct relationship between LVEDP and left ventricular end-diastolic volume due to factors affecting left ventricular compliance, particularly in critically ill patients. In comparison, the FTc has been shown to correlate well with preload.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Kincaid <italic>et al</italic>. study concluded that FTc was a better indicator of preload than PCWP when resuscitating hypovolaemic trauma patients.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In contrast to pulmonary arterial catheterisation, TOD provides an estimation of contractility by the measurement of peak velocity. Alterations of waveform shapes in both patients and normal subjects can be assessed using TOD when inotropes are used.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was the frequent repositioning of the Doppler probe due to the surgical manoeuvres, together with the diathermy interference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Terlipressin infusion significantly improved the low SVR and BP with reduced need for catecholamine support and with less renal dysfunction in LDLT as assessed by TOD. Peak portal blood flow was reduced with terlipressin without hepatic artery vasoconstriction or signs of splanchnic hypo perfusion. TOD monitoring during the terlipressin infusion helped to frequently guide the dose in order to maintain an adequate SVR and avoid significant elevations. Further studies involving more patients is recommended to study the interrelationship of corrected flow time (FTc of the TOD) and CVP, in order to decide, which one reflects best the patient's fluid requirements. This could lead to the establishment of new TOD guided protocols for fluid replacement in this category of hepatic patients during their peri-operative period.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
