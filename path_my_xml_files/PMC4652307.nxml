Anemia is one of the main complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which is linked closely with other complications of the disease. The primary therapy for anemia in these patients is erythropoietin (EPO). The goal of this study was to find the effect of Vitamin D administration in addition to the appropriate dose of EPO in ESRD patients with Vitamin D deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was a double-blind clinical trial on 64 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis in Amin and Noor Hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. The patients were divided into two groups of control and intervention. The intervention group was given Vitamin D supplements and the control group received placebo. The required dose of EPO to reach the target hemoglobin (Hb) was measured and statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>A total number of 32 females and 32 males were included in this study. All the patients in the treatment group were aged between 18 and 76 and the patients in the control group were aged between 21 and 76 years old. There was a significant statistical relationship between Vitamin D administration and the required dose of EPO in both groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013). However, there was no correlation between the concentration of Hb and serum Vitamin D levels.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Based on the main finding of this study, the relationship between Vitamin D administration and required dose of EPO seems that the predicted dose of Vitamin D prescribing strategy in Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines is not adequate to achieve normal serum Vitamin D in ESRD patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anemia</kwd><kwd>chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>end stage renal disease</kwd><kwd>erythropoietin</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D deficiency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Anemia is one of the most important complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially in patients on regular hemodialysis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In these patients, anemia can lead to other morbidities such as a decrease in the quality of life and increased cardiovascular complications and also increased mortality rate. This is why an understanding of the mechanisms and factors involved in anemia and its treatment on ESRD patients is crucial.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The main cause of anemia in these patients is lowered erythropoietin (EPO) secretion from kidneys but there are also other suggested factors involved in the development and severity of it such as Vitamin D deficiency. The primary treatment of anemia in ESRD patients are EPO stimulating agents (ESA) including injectable EPO.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although a gradual hyporesponsiveness might develop in 10% of these patients so that they may need an increased dosage of EPO to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in the aimed range.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Even though there are several different mechanisms suggested for EPO hyporesponsiveness such as Iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, chronic inflammation, and malignancies; but none of these can thoroughly explain this phenomenon in ESRD patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] On the other hand, it has been proved that an increased hyporesponsiveness to EPO is associated with increased rate of mortality.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, a growing number of studies have suggested that Vitamin D deficiency could be one of the risk factors involved in this hyporesponsiveness.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency (serum concentration smaller than 30 ng/dl) in ESRD patients is a lot higher than in the other populations, so that 75% of these patients are estimated to suffer from Vitamin D deficiency. This could be due to lowered renal hydroxylase enzyme, decreased sun exposure, and malnutrition.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It is also known that Vitamin D along with EPO has a synergic effect, the stimulation of bone marrow precursor cells, and red blood cell formation. Furthermore, several tissues express the Vitamin D receptor and are hence able to transform it into the active form, so the level of Vitamin D could be effective on the function of these tissues.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Although previous studies have worked on the correlation between Vitamin D administration in ESRD patients and required doses of EPO; there is no available double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effect of Vitamin D deficiency on the required dose of EPO in ESRD patients on hemodialysis yet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study is a double-blind, randomized, control clinical trial (placebo control) on ESRD patients on hemodialysis in Amin and Noor and Hospitals (Isfahan, Iran) between the years 2013 and 2014.

All of them were tested for Hb concentration and those with a measured amount lower than 11 g/dl were accepted for the study as anemic cases. Considering other causes of anemia, serum ferritin, iron, and total iron-binding capacity were checked. All of these anemic patients were tested for Vitamin D level and the levels smaller than 30 ng/dl were considered as Vitamin D deficient patients. The patients with anemia (Hb con. &#x0003c;11 g/dl) and Vitamin D deficiency[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were assigned to two groups using random sampling method. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blockers prescribed patients were compared in two groups and sex- and age-matching was done. The minimum volume of each group was calculated to be 32 patients. The intervention group were administered a 50,000 IU Vitamin D pear weekly for 12 weeks and then every three weeks until each patient had taken 650,000 IU Vitamin D in the course of the study. The treatment was performed in a 4-month period and the control group was given placebo pearls in exactly the same pattern. The Vitamin D and placebo pearls were both prepared by Zahravi Pharmaceutical Co. (Tabriz, Iran). The Vitamin D level was measured for both groups at the beginning of the study and after 4 months, though the study and the Hb concentration was tested monthly. The weekly and cumulative EPO dosage was also recorded for each patient. The treatment approach for anemia was decided using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for both groups.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Criteria for entering the study</title><p>

The correlation between BMI and EPO dosages is because of this fact that in patients with more weight, the need for almost all drugs is more than the patients with lower weight. After the administration of Vitamin D, the treatment group showed a significant decrease in the required dose of EPO while this same parameter had a slight but not statistically significant increase in the control group. Since several different factors are considered to be involved in hyporesponsiveness of ESRD patients to ESA treatments, such as inflammation, secondary hyperparathyroidism, etc., here the effect of Vitamin D administration in the treatment and control group was predictable.</p><p>In a study by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] a group of ESRD patients were administered by 200,000-350,000 IU of Vitamin D and during the course of the study, 44% of the patients had reached a Vitamin D level of over 30 ng\ml, while in the study by Saab <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] the administration of 350,000 IU throughout 6 months could help at least 95% of the patients to achieve the target level of over 30 ng/ml. The difference between these two results is suggested to be due to the different seasons of study and the effect of sunlight on Vitamin D level. Nevertheless, we decided to give Vitamin D to the patients as suggested by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.; and this seemed to be a sufficient amount for all the patients to surpass the target level of Vitamin D. In addition, the Vitamin D elevation response to this administration was the same in male and female patients. The Hb level in both groups was maintained at 10-11 in both groups throughout the study.</p><p>Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. found that the required dose of EPO in hemodialysed ESRD patients decreases with the administration of Vitamin D. Furthermore, Kiss <italic>et al</italic>. discovered correlations between Vitamin D level and Hb concentration and the required dose of EPO in ESRD patients, while Porter <italic>et al</italic>. found no such relationship which is in contrast to the findings of the current study.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism involved in the effect of Vitamin D on the required EPO dosage in ESRD patients is unknown but a number of possible mechanisms could be suggested. First, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown the effect of Vitamin D on bone marrow precursor cells and their efficacy in the formation of red blood cells. In conjunction with that, this vitamin is known to decrease inflammation in the tissues which might decrease the hyporesponsiveness to ESAs to some extent. And at last, the fact that many types of tissues express the Vitamin D receptors such as parathyroid and erythroid precursor cells, both of which are known as the tissues involved in ESA hyporesponsiveness, suggests that the modulation of these tissues with Vitamin D might increase the response to EPO treatment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The strong point of this study is its methodology which makes it the first, double-blind, case-control clinical trial on this matter.</p><p>Several downsides could also be mentioned such as the study having been done in a hemodialysis center which means that there were no patients on peritoneal dialysis in the study. In addition, the number of cases was small and we suggest that studies with larger sample populations of ESRD patients might be helpful to further clear the matter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We state that the administration of Vitamin D in ESRD patients could help reduce the required dose of EPO during the courses of hemodialysis. Also, the administration of this vitamin-based supplements on the current guideline helps almost all patients to achieve its sufficient level. Basically, the treatment with Vitamin D in ESRD patients could be helpful due to its very small side effects and its probable efficacy in reducing other complications such as anemia.</p><sec
