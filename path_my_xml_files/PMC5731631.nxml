TM differs from multiple sclerosis (MS) as it results from a monophasic-disease pattern, but many patients with TM experience long-lasting neurological symptoms that include weakness and gait disturbance. The incidence is approximately 1.34&#x02013;4.6 per million per year, with a prevalence of approximately 7500 Americans living with disability from their TM today.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There is a bimodal age distribution with a peak in the teenage years and one in the fourth decade of life, with men and women being equally affected.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The etiology of TM is presumed to be an immune-mediated attack two to three weeks following a systemic infection possibly due to molecular mimicry or other presumed immune mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> TM is conventionally viewed as a sporadic disease, with no strong familial risk factors and no recognized genetic contribution to risk. Treatment is focused on suppressing acute inflammatory process and outcomes are generally favorable with the majority of patients at least recovering the ability to walk with assistance; however, most maintain a long-term impairment in gait function.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Although the pathology of TM has not been adequately characterized as demyelinating, the outcomes of the immune-mediated injury may involve damage of myelinated axons as well as other cord structures. In our clinical experience, many of the gait disturbance and weakness patterns in TM patients resemble those of MS, an observation that suggested using dalfampridine may improve gait in this population. Dalfampridine (also known as fampridine or 4-aminopyridine) is a potassium channel blocker that has been studied since the 1970s for its effects on the nervous system, particularly on amplifying conductivity in demyelinated peripheral nerves fibers, potentiating neurotransmitter release in muscles and increasing post-synaptic action potentials in the spinal cord.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The goal of using dalfampridine in demyelinating diseases is to amplify axonal conductance across the demyelinated lesion, which would manifest in improved neurologic function including gait.</p><p>In 2010, an extended-release formulation of dalfampridine (D-ER, Ampyra&#x000ae;) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve walking in patients with MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. The ER formulation of Ampyra was developed to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drug and avoid higher peak plasma levels that can lead to seizures.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> FDA approval for use in MS is based on a prospectively defined responder cohort analysis, rather than the entire study sample. Between 35% and 42.9% of study participants were classified as responders and on average, this group improved their walking speed by approximately 39%.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Our interest in D-ER is focused more narrowly on a subset of patients with TM. In contrast to MS, which affects the multiple central nervous system structures, TM patients have pathological changes restricted to a single lesion in the spinal cord, largely sparing the brain&#x02014;a factor that may decrease the risk of seizures. In addition to being a potentially safer cohort of patients for D-ER, TM is also a more homogenous disease model in which to test the clinical effects and potentially the mechanism of action of D-ER. This represents the first clinical trial to evaluate the effects of D-ER on TM.</p><p>We conducted a clinical trial in idiopathic TM to evaluate the efficacy of D-ER with a primary neurologic outcome of the 25-foot timed walk, a measure of gait impairment, along with several secondary functional and neurophysiological outcome measures. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the proposed functional effects, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as our neurophysiologic measure to identify changes in corticomotor excitability in the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-2055217317740145"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study.

If required, the participant was permitted to use an appropriate assistive device to walk as quickly as he or she could from one end to the other end of a clearly marked, unobstructed, 25-foot course. The task was administered twice, with a standard 1-minute rest period in between, by having the patient walk back the same distance.

An unstructured covariance matrix was allowed with regards to visit but the matrix was constrained to be the same across the treatment arms. The numbers of responders to each treatment were compared via Gart test (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test comparing the number of individuals responding to only D-ER to those responding to only placebo while controlling for treatment arm). The treatments were compared for the EDSS changes from baseline using repeated-measures proportional odds logistic regression appropriate for a crossover study; an independent working correlation matrix was used. The rest of the secondary clinical outcome measures, including lower extremity muscle strength assessments, Four-square step test, and the 2-minute walk test, were compared in a similar fashion as the Timed 25-foot walk above, except that there was only one post-treatment visit within each of the treatment arms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec7-2055217317740145"><title>Results</title><p>Sixteen individuals enrolled in the study, of whom three withdrew for logistical reasons and 13 completed.

The rationale for this trial was based on experiential evidence that D-ER may improve gait function in a subset of patients with TM. The rationale was further bolstered by our initial baseline TMS interrogation of the motor tracts, which suggested the pathology involved myelinated pathways and may therefore respond favorably to D-ER therapy (Wymbs et&#x000a0;al., in preparation). Despite an average duration of disease of 10 years since the TM attack initially occurred, we found that the drug showed a trend in improving walking speeds in 85% of individuals while receiving D-ER versus 69% while receiving placebo, and met the higher threshold for responder in 33% while receiving D-ER versus only 8% while receiving placebo, although, given the small numbers of participants, this percentage did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.33).</p><p>The efficacy trends in this trial of TM participants are similar to two early small trials in MS. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of D-ER with MS patients in 1997 enrolled 10&#x000a0;patients and found that nine of them had improvements in walking speeds by an average of 22%.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The second randomized, placebo-controlled study in MS did not meet its pre-defined endpoint, but a post-hoc responder analysis identified 38% of patients on D-ER (and 8% on placebo) who met the threshold for responder.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2055217317740145" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These results in MS are similar to our findings in the TM patient population and likely suggest that larger studies might have yielded similar positive outcomes with increased statistical power.

Each visit involved several physically demanding tests that are fatiguing to different degrees for each patient. Some of these limitations were accounted for in the crossover design of the trial, but because of the length of the study, recruitment was somewhat difficult and a number of screen failures and withdrawals occurred. Future trials of D-ER in TM might be expanded to include related TM disorders such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec9-2055217317740145"><title>Conclusions</title><p>D-ER showed trends for improvement in patients with TM in a number of measures, including gait speed and balance, with no new safety signals.
