Patients were taught to self detect the anastomotic murmur of the fistula and the associated &#x02018;trill&#x02019; sound each day. Fistula smoothness was also recorded using touch or a stethoscope. If the vascular trill disappeared and a throb was not found at the anastomosis site, patients were advised that their internal fistula was blocked and were told to attend the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec16-0300060515604980"><title>Medication use</title><p>Patients received close instruction in how to take their prescribed medications at the times indicated.

In addition, once patients begin MHD, they rely on such treatment for their survival.</p><p>The objective of the self-management model applied in this study was to provide MHD patients with the ability to cope with, and hopefully resolve, common problems associated with control of ESRD symptoms, compliance with a treatment programme and somatic discomfort. Health education is an important external factor that influences self-management behaviour,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> although a further study<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found that self-management education that simply provided information only produced a slight improvement in self-management behaviour in patients. The present study showed that, despite receiving health education, behaviours associated with poor self management continued to be observed in patients. A strong motivation to maintain good health was key to patients realizing the benefits and necessity of treatment, thereby improving overall self-management.</p><p>The knowledge-attitude-behaviour model considers that knowledge is essential for effecting changes in behaviour, and that individuals can obtain knowledge and skills through learning. Accordingly, patients and their families need to actively receive knowledge, which can lead to a gradual development of healthy beliefs and attitudes that are reinforced with the adoption of healthy behaviours. Ren, <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and Zhao, <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that application of the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model effectively established a healthy belief in patients and led to the conversion of bad living habits to healthy behaviours. In the present study, knowledge was provided to the intervention group at health lectures and through the distribution of educational materials. The accessibility of this knowledge was intended to improve the recognition of health-related behaviours. Both the examiner and the patient analysed the patient&#x02019;s condition and self-evaluation in order to establish healthcare and rehabilitation objectives. Bad habits associated with self care were highlighted so that they could be eliminated; patients were encouraged to adopt a regular medication regimen that effectively controlled ESRD progression and promoted an improvement in self-management behaviour. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency of the patients we studied was found to be enhanced when patient cases were analysed and discussed, and when mutual help groups were established. Ideally, the goal for each patient should be to maximize their self-confidence, thereby encouraging them to participate in decisions regarding their health and self-management.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the extent of disease-related knowledge between the intervention group and the control group prior to intervention, indicating that patients in these groups were comparable. Patients could acquire disease-related knowledge from each intervention programme; however, a greater level of disease-related knowledge was obtained by the intervention group than the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These results suggest that patients can acquire effective self-management knowledge and skills following systematic guidance and training according to education levels. Moreover, a higher level of disease education can be gained by both patients and their families with effective application of a knowledge-attitude-behaviour initiative. Family members were encouraged to participate in study activities including attending informative lectures on haemodialysis, answering relative knowledge inquiries, studying dialysis educational materials and discussing effective communication with patients. In the present study, this led to a correction of lifestyle habits, enhanced self-monitoring, improvement in mood and good levels of patient participation in their individual self-management regimen.</p><p>Self-management intervention not only aims to provide patients with information, but more importantly, helps patients to master self-management skills. In this way, behaviour changes are enhanced, which is key to attaining and sustaining management objectives for patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Patients on MHD experience the pressures of the disease and its treatment, but also may exhibit psychosocial traits, and have poor compliance with recommended diets, liquid intake restrictions and medication regimens.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, when self-management behaviour compliance is compromised, there are severe consequences, including a decrease in HRQoL and an increased potential for MHD to become less effective. Patients who monitor their physical state using effective self-management methods and skills can eventually attain a satisfactory HRQoL.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>While receiving MHD, patients need to maintain adequate self-management behaviours.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Self-management behaviour was previously defined as the acquisition of MHD knowledge, such that health objectives are actively achieved and HRQoL improves.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Health knowledge is available from lectures, consultants, individualized instruction and participation in discussion groups. In comparison, traditional health education includes a process of disease recognition and requires subsequent changes in behaviour to improve clinical outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Patients&#x02019; perception of their health, self-management attitude and ways of coping with disease are important factors that affect patient compliance and self-management behaviour. Therefore, it is hypothesized that effective health education will increase compliance, thereby controlling disease recurrence and HRQoL.</p><p>Knowledge-attitude-behaviour theory is an extension of cognitive theory application in health education. Knowledge-attitude-behaviour theory proposes that health knowledge and information are the foundation for establishing active and correct beliefs and attitudes towards disease; such attitudes are the driving forces for modifying patient behaviour.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Research has demonstrated that important correlations exist between the occurrence, development and prognosis of diseases.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Psychological, dietary, exercise and lifestyle interventions can positively or negatively contribute to disease recurrence. Improvements in health knowledge and the development of good health skills are important for enhancing patient health.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Self management needs to emphasize the patient&#x02019;s recognition of their own problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Ideally, both the health care professional and the patient should recognize the health problems that exist and the issues of most concern to the patient. With this recognition, relevant issues can be addressed using self-management skills. Overall, the objective of the self-management model is not to cure diseases, but rather to ensure that the patient&#x02019;s state of health and function are satisfactorily maintained so that they can achieve an independent and healthy lifestyle. When self-management models have been applied to the prevention and control of chronic diseases, significant and positive effects on the patient&#x02019;s HRQoL, disease management and treatment compliance have been observed.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In combination, these measures resulted in improvements in patient survival.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0300060515604980" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, self-management behaviour scores for the intervention group were significantly higher than those recorded prior to intervention and than those of the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0300060515604980">Table 3</xref>). These data indicate that self-management knowledge was instilled into patients, and that behaviour guidance was achieved following an understanding of the dynamic changes that occur with application of the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model of nursing intervention. Moreover, this approach increased patients&#x02019; health awareness, and led to corrections in unhealthy lifestyles and behaviours. These patients also followed their doctor&#x02019;s advice better, sustained a reasonable diet and strictly controlled both water and salt intake, compared with those in the control group. Such changes led to a decrease in the complications reported, an improvement in self-management behaviour, and a reduction in the obstacles to self-management encountered by the patient. Thus, disease control and alleviation of disease was achieved. Furthermore, these positive effects support the widespread application of the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model.</p><p>To conclude, application of the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model in health education has the potential to facilitate changes in bad habits, to enhance healthy behaviour and to improve self-management behaviour in patients undergoing MHD. Our preliminary findings need to be confirmed in larger studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec29-0300060515604980"><title>Declaration of conflicting interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec30-0300060515604980"><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency either public or commercial.</p></sec><notes><title>Note</title><fn-group><fn id="fn1-0300060515604980"><label>1</label><p>Chinese Clinical Trial Register: OOQ-14005560.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300060515604980"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bettinghaus</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name></person-group>
