depression in frail people aged 70&#x02005;years and above. [Subjects] Twenty frail elderly
individuals &#x02265;70&#x02005;years old were assigned to either a Nordic walking group (n=8) or general
exercise group (n=10). [Methods] The duration of intervention was equal in both groups (3
sessions/week for 12 weeks, 60&#x02005;min/session). Physical function (balance, upper extremity
strength, lower extremity strength, weakness) and depression were examined before and
after the interventions. [Results] With the exception of upper extremity muscle strength,
lower extremity strength, weakness, balance, and depression after Nordic walking
demonstrated statistically significant improvement. However, in the general exercise
group, only balance demonstrated a statistically significant improvement after the
intervention. There were significant differences in the changes in lower extremity muscle
strength, weakness and depression between the groups. [Conclusion] In conclusion, Nordic
walking was more effective than general exercise. Therefore, we suggest that Nordic
walking may be an attractive option for significant functional improvement in frail people
over 70&#x02005;years old.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nordic walking</kwd><kwd>General exercise</kwd><kwd>Frail people</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>There are many possible causes of frailty including physical, social, and emotional factors
arising from decreased physical activity, sensational hypofunction, physical symptoms or
illness, and social isolation. As frailty increases the risk of accidents, frail older
adults require greater levels of supervision during exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most programs for frail older adults are performed at homes or facilities to ensure
safety<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, such programs will
not yield positive emotional results if the participants are kept in a smaller space for
exercise, although they are safe. This is because as the elderly advance further in age,
they tend to live in smaller areas. Therefore, giving participants a chance to escape their
routine and perform exercise in a larger space may provide positive emotional results.</p><p>Despite the positive effects of exercise, the rate of regular practical exercise performed
by Korean adults including frail older adults is as low as 9.9&#x02013;22.6%<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to increase the rate of practical exercise,
programs must be constructed with no limitation of facilities, space, or economic
constraints<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nordic walking is an
appropriate exercise activity that can be done easily anywhere and anytime. It can not only
increase the rate of exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> but also
provide physical and psychological benefits to elderly people who live in small spaces by
allowing them to exercise outdoors. Nordic walking is performed using poles intended to be
swung forward and backward with the upper body, which may improve elderly individuals&#x02019;
upper-body muscle strength<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and exercise
the lower body while placing less force on the knee<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, outdoor activities improve not only physical activity
but also depression<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Almost all studies on Nordic walking have focused on the cardiovascular system and involved
participants with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease or healthy adults; studies on frail older adults with
various underlying health issues are lacking. Furthermore, no studies have involved subjects
over the age of 70, a time when activity levels sharply decrease.</p><p>Accordingly, we undertook the present study with the aim of assessing whether Nordic
walking is an appropriate exercise for elderly subjects aged &#x02265;70&#x02005;years and its effect on
physical improvement and depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study targeted frail older adults living in city S and was carried out over 12 weeks
from August to December 2014. The 20 elderly individuals &#x02265;70&#x02005;years old selected to
participate in this study lived in city S, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, visited the S Senior
Welfare Center, and were randomly assigned to the Nordic walking group or general exercise
group. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ability to understand and agree with the
purpose of this study, ability to communicate and demonstrated normal cognition (MMSEK [Mini
Mental State Examination-Korea]: a score &#x0003e;24), and more than 2 points based on the
criteria for frailty in older adults. Prior to participation, all participants were informed
about the study&#x02019;s aims and procedures and signed informed consent forms. This study
conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The general
characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

exercise groups. The assessments included measurements of state of weakness, physical
function, and depression. The Korean Health Compliance Frailty Assessment Tool for the
Elderly, developed by Yoon<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, was used to
assess frailty. It includes a total of 8 items. Scores below 2 are normal; a score &#x02265;2
indicates weakness, and a score &#x02265;5 indicates severe weakness.</p><p>The physical function assessment tool was used to measure physical function in the
elderly<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The items consisted of
balance, lower extremity muscle strength, and upper extremity muscle strength. The balance
test involved standing on one leg with the eyes open. The time that a single-leg stance
could be maintained was measured, with the time determined by when the raised leg touched
the ground or when the foot moved from the origin. Lower extremity muscle strength was
assessed by measuring the number of times the subject could stand up from a 46-cm-high
chair, which had no armrests, with their arms crossed and hands on their shoulders before
their hands fell from their positions. Upper arm muscle strength was assessed by measuring
the number of times the subject was able to lift a 2-kg dumbbell above elbow level in 30
seconds.</p><p>The Korean version of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale developed in the research of
Bae<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to assess depression. It
includes a total of 15 items, each requiring a &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; response. Scores of 0&#x02013;7 points
are considered normal, and scores of 8&#x02013;15 are indicative of depression.</p><p>For the Nordic walking group, Nordic walking was conducted three times per week for 12
weeks. Considering the characteristics of frail older adults, walking practice was performed
twice per week using a treadmill indoors and once per week outdoors. During the first 4
weeks, subjects walked at a medium tempo with medium strength in a flat park, and during the
next 4 weeks, they walked at the same tempo and strength but in a hilly park. During the
final 4 weeks, they walked around a mountain with broad, low hills at a medium tempo and
medium strength. The control group was asked to perform a selected general exercise program
indoors for 1 hour three times per week. The general exercise program consisted of
whole-body stretching and simple muscle strength exercises, and it was an exercise program
used for the purpose of improving flexibility and muscle strength in the elderly.</p><p>The general characteristics of the test and control groups were analyzed by using their
means and standard deviations, and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to confirm that values of
dependent variables were normally distributed. According to the results of the Shapiro-Wilk
test, the Mann-Whitney U test and independent t-test were used for comparisons of weakness
and all other variables, respectively, between the two groups. In order to determine the
effect of the program, the paired t-test was used to compare pre-intervention and
post-intervention values. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 18.0, and
significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The scores for balance, lower extremity muscle strength, weakness, and depression all

over 70&#x02005;years old is increasing. Exercises for such adults must be easy to follow and simple
and should have a limited economic burden if the goal is to maintain continued participation
in the exercises. Nordic walking is one exercise that may be recommended on the basis of
satisfying these criteria. As there is limited research on Nordic walking in frail older
adults, this study investigated whether a Nordic walking program could improve physical
function and depression in frail adults over 70&#x02005;years old.</p><p>Nordic walking has been reported to result in increased walking distance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, rectus femoris activity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle strength<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> compared with a
standard home exercise group. In other words, the improvement in lower extremity muscle
strength was very good. Lower extremity muscle strength improved, and compared with the
general exercise group, the level of improvement was also very high in the present study.
This increase in muscle strength may have been the result of using the walking poles,
allowing adults with possible degeneration of the knees to place less of a burden on them
while performing the walking exercise naturally.</p><p>However, Kukkonen-Harjula et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
claimed that walking with a pole resulted in less improvement in fitness and one-leg squat
strength than fast walking. Differences in subjects&#x02019; ages and the intensity of the exercise
are likely reasons for such conflicting findings. The study by Kukkonen-Harjula et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> targeted obese women in their 50s and 60s,
while the present study focused on frail adults aged &#x02265;70&#x02005;years. Furthermore, as the purpose
of the previous study was to reduce obesity, strenuous exercises such as brisk walking were
chosen, which have been proved superior to Nordic walking in improving obesity and muscle
strength. As the present study was not directed at reducing obesity but rather was directed
at improving the physical function of frail older adults, the intensity of the exercises was
lower than in the previous study.</p><p>As the elderly are at greater risk of falls, exercises aimed at strengthening muscles, Tai
chi, and general walking have been recommended to increase balance. However, there is a
difference in the effect of balance programs conducted in the elderly due to the structure
of exercises. Howe et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
strength exercise increased the balance of older people but that general walking activity
did not significantly increase the scores for the Timed Up and Go test, single-leg stance
with eyes open, or single-leg stance with eyes closed or the self-paced gait speed among
older people. Gin&#x000e9;-Garriga et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> found
that exercise has some benefits in frail older people, although uncertainty remains with
regard to which exercise characteristics (type, frequency, intensity, duration, setting,
combinations) are most effective. Furthermore, no consistent effect was observed on balance
or functional mobility.</p><p>The findings of a meta-analysis by Chou et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, which involved various types of exercise interventions, also
demonstrated the beneficial effects of exercise on frail older adults. However, the most
appropriate exercise program for balance (reflected by Timed Up and Go test performance) has
yet to be determined, because no difference was found between various types of exercise
interventions. Although balance improved in both the Nordic walking and general exercise
group, as seen in previous research, the present study detected no difference in balance
improvement between the two exercise groups. Therefore, we cannot recommend Nordic walking
as a superior exercise for balance improvement in frail adults over 70&#x02005;years old. Balance
improvement can be affected by various factors such as the nervous system, musculoskeletal
system, and the environment, and therefore it may be difficult for one exercise program to
demonstrate significant improvement over other forms of exercise.</p><p>Additionally, in the present study, exercise was performed only once outdoors and twice
indoors each week, which could be a factor reducing the degree of improvement shown in
balance. Consequently, performance of Nordic walking outdoors more than once per week is
needed to assess its maximal effects on balance and other variables.</p><p>According to studies by Song et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
and Shim et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, Nordic walking was
more effective than general walking for improving upper extremity muscle strength in the
elderly. However, in the present study, the improvement in upper extremity muscle strength
was not statistically significant. This conflicting result may be the result of the
different ages of subjects between the studies, since the previous study assessed elderly
subjects or healthy subjects in their twenties but not specifically frail individuals aged
over 70&#x02005;years. In the case of frail adults aged over 70&#x02005;years, once their muscle strength
has declined substantially with age, the actions of holding the Nordic walking poles and
upper extremity rotation may be insufficient to improve upper extremity muscle strength.
Therefore, additional research is needed to identify positions in Nordic walking that can
improve upper extremity muscle strength and add them to programs targeting people over
70.</p><p>Suija et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that regular
Nordic walking improved the mood and physical fitness of depressed patients. Consistent with
that study, the present results indicated an improvement in depression. This finding
indicates that outdoor exercise has a greater effect on psychological stability than indoor
exercise. The formation of vitamin D during outdoor exercise may be involved in improving
depression, and conversations with other participants in a natural setting, in combination
with the exercise, may help to maximize the psychological effect. Therefore, outdoor
exercise programs involving group activity are more effective for improving depression.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was the small sample size available for analysis, owing
to the number of patients who withdrew. The most common reason for high withdrawal rates in
elderly subjects is their preference not to participate in community programs. Another
limitation was the frequency of outdoor Nordic walking, which was once per week. We decided
on this frequency of outdoor Nordic walking out of consideration for the conditions of the
paricipants, since it was their first time participating in the activity. Future studies
should ideally have a larger sample size and increased frequency of outdoor Nordic
walking.</p><p>As a result of participating in a Nordic walking program for 12 weeks, frail adults over
the age of 70&#x02005;years demonstrated improvements in balance, lower extremity muscle strength,
weakness, and depression. Overall, Nordic walking was more effective than general exercise.
Therefore, we suggest that Nordic walking may be an attractive option for significant
functional improvement in frail people over 70&#x02005;years old.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bergman</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrucci</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Guralnik</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Frailty: an emerging research and clinical paradigm&#x02014;issues
