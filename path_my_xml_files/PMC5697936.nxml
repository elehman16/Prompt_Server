Previous trials of the multinutrient Fortasyn Connect showed benefits in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. LipiDiDiet investigated the effects of Fortasyn Connect on cognition and related measures in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the 24-month results of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>LipiDiDiet was a 24-month randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial (11 sites in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden), with optional 12-month double-blind extensions. The trial enrolled individuals with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, defined according to the International Working Group (IWG)-1 criteria. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to active product (125 mL once-a-day drink containing Fortasyn Connect) or control product. Randomisation was computer-generated centrally in blocks of four, stratified by site. All study personnel and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included all participants who consumed at least one study product dose. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register, number NTR1705.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between April 20, 2009, and July 3, 2013, 311 of 382 participants screened were randomly assigned to the active group (n=153) or control group (n=158).

The decline in the control group was less than the prestudy estimate of &#x02212;0&#x000b7;4 during 24 months. 66 (21%) participants dropped out of the study. Serious adverse events occurred in 34 (22%) participants in the active group and 30 (19%) in control group (p=0&#x000b7;487), none of which were regarded as related to the study intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The intervention had no significant effect on the NTB primary endpoint over 2 years in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. However, cognitive decline in this population was much lower than expected, rendering the primary endpoint inadequately powered. Group differences on secondary endpoints of disease progression measuring cognition and function and hippocampal atrophy were observed. Further study of nutritional approaches with larger sample sizes, longer duration, or a primary endpoint more sensitive in this pre-dementia population, is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>European Commission 7th Framework Programme.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">The course of Alzheimer's disease is characterised by progressive accumulation of neuropathology over decades.

The three randomised controlled trials reported that the intervention was well tolerated and had a good safety profile, both alone and in combination with Alzheimer's disease medications.

To monitor product compliance, we asked participants to record the amount of study product taken in a daily diary, which was collected at each visit. Study product compliance was defined as the percentage of study product used throughout the study period compared with the prescribed dosage. Compliance was calculated only for participants who completed the study product diary for at least 75% of their actual study time. An additional sensitivity calculation was done to include all available data up to the start of rescue medication (defined as use of active product or approved Alzheimer's disease medication after progression to dementia). In both calculations, missing diary intake entries were assumed to be 0. We coded adverse events with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 18.0).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="para140">Based on a <italic>t</italic> test and 5% significance level, we calculated that a sample size of 300 randomly assigned participants would be sufficient to provide 90% power to detect a 40% difference in NTB score change between groups at the end of the study. Based on results from a study in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> we expected the NTB <italic>Z</italic> score in the control group to decrease by &#x02212;0&#x000b7;4 (SD 0&#x000b7;4) during 24 months. The sample size allowed for 20% dropout. We did a prespecified, blinded re-estimation of the SD to assess the adequacy of the calculated sample size. Representatives of the LipiDiDiet Consortium reviewed the SDs calculated from the interim dataset and concluded that they matched the estimated SDs in the protocol. Additionally, we amended the protocol to do an interim analysis for safety (occurrence of adverse events) and efficacy after approximately a third of participants completed the study. Between-group analyses on partially unmasked data were done by the trial-independent statistician and results were reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee, which recommended continuation of the study without modification.</p><p id="para150">We obtained NTB composite <italic>Z</italic> scores by averaging the individual NTB items' <italic>Z</italic> scores and weighting according to the number of NTB items available. The minimum number of NTB items required was set to four of five for NTB primary endpoint, three of three for NTB memory domain, three of four for NTB executive function domain, and 12 of 16 for NTB total. Analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population of all participants randomly assigned, excluding data after the start of rescue medication. We did per-protocol analyses on all participants from the mITT population, excluding the respective visits of participants with major protocol deviations defined during a data review of masked data. The most common reason for exclusion from the per-protocol analysis was substantial irregular study product intake (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). All randomised participants who consumed at least one dose of study product were included in safety analyses. To allow for separate evaluation of safety data collected before and after a switch to active study product after progression to dementia, analyses were done in two safety phases: the double-blind treatment phase and active treatment phase.</p><p id="para160">We analysed the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints of a continuous type as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, using a linear mixed model for longitudinal data with change from baseline as the response variable and linear time (days since baseline), baseline score, randomised treatment, and time&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;treatment as fixed effects. This is a multi-level model with three levels: measurements, participants, and sites. We used a random intercept with a variance components covariance structure within sites (small sites were pooled within country) and a random intercept and slope for time with an unstructured covariance structure within participants. Other covariance structures could be applied in case of converging issues. This model's estimated difference between the active and control groups in terms of mean change from baseline at month 24 was used as the primary indication of treatment effect during the 24-month intervention period. A baseline measurement or characteristic that showed an imbalance between the groups and was found to be a significant predictor for outcome parameters was considered a prognostic factor and included in the statistical models. We did a planned sensitivity analysis using a mixed model for repeated measures with change from baseline as the response variable and time as categorical (planned visit), baseline score, randomised treatment, and time&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;treatment as fixed effects. In this analysis, treatment effects were evaluated for each timepoint separately without assuming a treatment effect that increases linearly over time. We did an additional sensitivity analysis on participants who completed the 24-month study by using an analysis of covariance completer analysis with change from baseline as outcome, treatment as fixed factor, and baseline score as a covariate. We did an additional sensitivity analysis taking into account missing data due to dropout using a joint model. The joint model combined a mixed model comparable to our original model (mixed model) with a Cox proportional hazards model for time to dropout (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We did a predefined subgroup analysis in participants with MMSE score 26 or higher at baseline using the same statistical models as for the primary and secondary endpoints. We aligned rules for visit windows between the statistical models to allow a visit window of 3 months (before and after scheduled visit date) for all visits.</p><p id="para170">p values of less than 0&#x000b7;05 were deemed statistically significant in comparisons of efficacy and safety data.

LipiDiDiet is the first randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre, international trial of a non-pharmacological intervention in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. No significant difference was found between groups for the NTB primary endpoint in the mITT analysis or on conversion to dementia. However, there was some evidence of a beneficial effect of the multinutrient intervention at the cognitive-functional level (detected by CDR-SB) and ameliorated structural brain changes (hippocampal and ventricular volume) shown on MRI scans.</p><p id="para280">The LipiDiDiet study was initiated shortly after the first criteria for prodromal Alzheimer's disease were published.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> It has since become clear that changes in cognitive performance with currently used tests are not very pronounced in early Alzheimer's disease during time intervals close to 2 years.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The study design was based on a previous 12-month trial in Alzheimer's disease dementia;<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> however, in our study, the control group had only a quarter of the projected 24-month decline on the NTB primary endpoint, possibly because of the earlier disease stage of the pre-dementia participants than those with Alzheimer's disease dementia. The lower than expected decline is in agreement with the previous observations of limited cognitive changes over 2 years. The small cognitive decline on the NTB primary endpoint in the control group was mainly due to stable performance during the first year of intervention, followed by a steeper decline in the second year. Conversely, CDR-SB scores had already significantly declined at month 12 in the control group. Therefore, in mITT analyses, the significant benefit on CDR-SB was combined with an absence of clear effects on NTB cognition endpoints, although benefits on the NTB primary endpoint and the NTB memory domain were suggested in the per-protocol analyses. Notably, the main reason for exclusion from the per-protocol analysis was no or irregular intake of study product, which emphasises the importance of sustained intake, as observed previously.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p id="para290">The effect on CDR-SB in the LipiDiDiet trial differs from previous mild Alzheimer's disease dementia trials by adding a benefit at the cognitive-functional level.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The longer treatment duration and intervention at an earlier disease stage than in the previous dementia trials might be important reasons for this observation. The apparently more pronounced stabilisation of CDR-SB scores with increasing baseline MMSE observed in the active group indicates that early rather than late treatment within the prodromal stage might support better outcome with this cognitive-functional measure, in line with previous results from Fortasyn Connect trials,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which showed that earlier intervention might increase the benefit. Within the disease continuum, early intervention might also be an important contributory factor to the similarity in progression to dementia in both treatment groups, because participants at baseline were only 2 years or less from advancing to dementia and therefore treatment efficacy might not have been sufficient to translate into less conversion to dementia. Moreover, dementia diagnosis was clustered at major study visits. Dementia diagnosis is a dichotomisation of the decline continuum, whereas CDR-SB is a sensitive measure of decline across a continuous scale. Therefore, CDR-SB might better reflect disease progression along our entire prodromal population.</p><p id="para300">No cognitive test is generally accepted as the gold standard for trials in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, although research has highlighted the potential usefulness of composite measures.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Use of compound cognitive test batteries such as NTB combining performance on different validated tests have been suggested to help detection of more subtle changes that occur in pre-dementia disease stages.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> In the meantime, preliminary guidelines from regulatory agencies emphasise the importance of establishing the clinical value of treatment and suggest using a combined cognitive-functional measure such as CDR-SB, which showed reliability and validity in prodromal Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, and proposed CDR-SB as a single primary endpoint for efficacy.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, this information was not available at the time of our trial design.</p><p id="para310">Although it is generally difficult to translate performance on cognitive tests into clinical benefits, the CDR-SB is built on real-life items such as handling household emergencies, handling financial transactions, and forgetting a major event, which facilitates assessment of clinical benefit. For early Alzheimer's disease, a reduction by 0&#x000b7;5 or 1&#x000b7;0 in CDR-SB was proposed to capture both efficacy and clinical relevance.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The current emphasis on using more sensitive cognitive or functional measures in ongoing trials in prodromal Alzheimer's disease is a major shift from the previous focus on progression to dementia used in unsuccessful trials in mild cognitive impairment.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p id="para320">In addition to the CDR-SB cognition-function benefit, we observed benefits on progression of structural changes in the brain.

The main differences between the IWG-1 and IWG-2 criteria are the definition of in-vivo evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI is included in IWG-1, but not in IWG-2) and the clinical Alzheimer's disease phenotypes (IWG-1 focuses on a typical amnestic phenotype, whereas IWG-2 also includes atypical, non-amnestic phenotypes). Thus, we cannot make inferences on intervention effects in prodromal Alzheimer's disease with atypical, non-amnestic phenotypes. This study indicates that populations within prodromal Alzheimer's disease exist who might benefit differently from early intervention. Baseline MMSE scores and decline in cognitive function contributed to different levels of benefit; further currently unknown factors might contribute as well. Identification of those individuals could aid in the ongoing process of refining prodromal Alzheimer's disease definition and prodromal Alzheimer's disease clinical trial design.</p><p id="para340">As expected from previous trials,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> study product compliance was high, and adverse events and serious adverse events were consistent with the studied population and the known safety profile of the active product.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The proportion of participants with at least one serious adverse event (34 [22%] in the active group and 30 [19%] in the control group) and percentage of dropouts due to adverse events (nine [6%] in the active group and six [4%] in the control group) in our study are in the same range as those reported by Coric and colleagues<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> for the control group (31 [23.7%] patients with at least one serious adverse event and 13 [9.9%] dropouts due to adverse events).</p><p id="para350">Our study has some limitations. First, cognitive decline in this prodromal Alzheimer's disease population was much lower than expected, rendering the primary endpoint inadequately powered. Therefore, future trials aiming to implement this NTB endpoint might benefit from larger sample sizes and a longer duration of intervention than used in our study, or a cognitive composite designed for this pre-dementia population. Second, our 24-month trial was not designed with progression to dementia as a primary focus, thereby limiting the ability to draw conclusions on this outcome. Additionally, use of MRI as an alternative to CSF or PET amyloid assessments might have resulted in a somewhat more heterogeneous group of participants, because medial temporal atrophy on MRI can be both amyloid-related and non-amyloid-related.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Finally, we included a demographically restricted population, largely comprising white participants from central European countries and Scandinavia. Participants completing the 24-month intervention were eligible to continue in the double-blind extension studies, which will provide additional data on long-term efficacy.</p><p id="para360">In conclusion, the multinutrient intervention had no significant effect on the NTB primary endpoint over 2 years in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, although potential benefits were seen on the cognitive-functional measure CDR-SB and brain atrophy measures. Further investigation of multinutrient approaches in early Alzheimer's disease stages is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
