However, prespecified subgroup analyses showed that the effect of TXA depends on the time interval between the injury and the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Treatment initiated within 3&#x000a0;hours&#x0feff; of injury significantly reduced death due to bleeding (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.83), whereas initiation after 3&#x000a0;hours increased the risk (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.44, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.84).</p><p>Although we expected that early treatment would be more effective, we did not expect late treatment to increase the risk of death due to bleeding. On biological grounds, we anticipate treatments to have broadly similar effects on a given outcome and should be wary of claims that a treatment is highly beneficial in one subgroup but harmful in another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The strong interaction with time to treatment suggests that patients treated within 3&#x000a0;h of injury are different to those treated after 3&#x000a0;h in ways that are relevant to the mechanism of action of TXA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, if TXA was harmful in patients with head injury and such patients were underrepresented in those treated within 3&#x000a0;h but overrepresented in those treated after 3&#x000a0;h, this might explain the time-dependent treatment effect. We examine how patient characteristics vary by time to treatment in the CRASH-2 trial and explore whether any such variations explain the time-dependent treatment effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>The CRASH-2 trial was a randomised placebo-controlled trial of the effect of TXA on death and vascular occlusive events in adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding within 8&#x000a0;h of their injury.

The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4&#x000a0;weeks of injury. We classified cause of death into the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury and other.

Among patients without head injury, treatment initiated within an hour of injury reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78), as did treatment initiated between 1 and 3&#x000a0;h (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.91), whereas treatment beyond 3&#x000a0;h increased the risk of death due to bleeding (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.41; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.90).</p><p>To explore whether the time to treatment interaction was explained by SBP, we restricted the analyses to patients with a SBP &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mmHg. Strong evidence of an interaction remained (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0001).

As a sensitivity analysis, we tested for confounding of the time to treatment interaction (Appendix). After controlling for confounders, the treatment-time interaction remained in the case of models with SBP and type of injury, although the interaction was less obvious after controlling for GCS. The extent to which the treatment group by time since injury interaction varies by subgroup in illustrated pictorially in the Appendix.</p><p>Because the time to treatment interaction could not be explained by differences in the characteristics of early and late-treated patients, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine separately how the benefits of early TXA treatment and the harms of late TXA treatment vary by SBP (&#x02264;75, 76&#x02013;89, &#x0003e;89&#x000a0;mmHg); GCS score (severe 3&#x02013;8, moderate 9&#x02013;12, mild 13&#x02013;15); and type of injury (penetrating versus blunt).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Patients in the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with TXA within 3&#x000a0;h of injury were less likely to have blunt trauma and head injury and had lower SBPs than those treated after 3&#x000a0;h. However, these differences do not completely explain the strong time to treatment interaction, although the interaction was not as obvious in patients with a low GCS. When given within 3&#x000a0;h of injury, TXA reduces death due to bleeding regardless of injury type, GCS or blood pressure.</p><p>We have previously reported subgroup analyses of the effect of TXA according to SBP, GCS and type of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. All of these analyses were prespecified in the trial protocol. However, because they ignore the time to treatment interaction their value is limited. If TXA is either beneficial or harmful depending on how soon after injury the patient is treated, the overall effect regardless of time to treatment is neither biologically relevant nor generalisable since it depends largely on the proportion of patients treated early or late in the trial. Having identified that the effect of TXA depends on time to treatment, all other subgroup analyses should be conducted separately for early or late-treated patients as we have done here. The most striking observation from these analyses is the absence of heterogeneity. Early treatment appears effective and late treatment appears harmful in all subgroups. These analyses provide no support for the assertion that TXA is only indicated for patients with severe shock (SPB &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;mmHg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Early treatment is effective regardless of SBP.</p><p>Recent results suggest biological explanations for the time to treatment interaction. Early fibrinolysis is common after trauma and is associated with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), the enzyme that converts plasminogen to the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, is stored within the endothelium in Weibel-Palade bodies. Trauma triggers the release of TPA resulting in plasmin activation, fibrinolysis and profuse bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. TPA levels peak 30&#x000a0;min after injury and plasmin levels peak around 1&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. By inhibiting fibrinolysis, TXA prevents early exsanguination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the effects are short lived. Around 2&#x000a0;h after injury plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels start to increase reaching a peak around 3&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PAI-1 inhibits fibrinolysis resulting in &#x02018;fibrinolytic shutdown&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This might explain why the benefits of TXA treatment are limited to the first 3&#x000a0;h. The adverse effects of late TXA administration may be due to PAI-1-induced suppression of fibrinolysis and the onset of thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). By inhibiting fibrinolysis TXA could worsen DIC. Although the pathology is thrombotic, due to the consumption of clotting factors, thrombotic DIC usually manifests clinically as bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The differential effects of TXA on TPA and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA)-mediated plasminogen activation have also been proposed as a potential biological explanation of the &#x02018;TXA paradox&#x02019; of time-dependent effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although TXA inhibits TPA-mediated fibrinolysis, it stimulates fibrinolysis mediated by UPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The binding of TXA to plasminogen results in a conformational change in the plasminogen molecule that makes it more readily cleaved by UPA. The potential clinical importance of this finding is highlighted in animal models of the effect of TXA in closed head injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two hours after injury, TXA treatment reduced intracranial bleeding consistent with the inhibition of TPA-mediated fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, when given 8&#x000a0;h after injury, when UPA levels were highest, TXA increased intracranial bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>All trauma patients with potentially life-threatening bleeding within 3&#x000a0;h of injury should be treated with TXA regardless of blood pressure, GCS or type of injury. Treatment after 3&#x000a0;h appears to increase the risk of death due to bleeding and, therefore, is contraindicated.

The CRASH-2 trial was approved by the relevant ethics committees in all 274 participating hospitals. The trial was approved by the relevant ethics committees in all participating hospitals (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Consent procedures were established by local regulation and the appropriate ethics committees. Informed consent was obtained from patients if physical and mental capacity allowed. If patients could not give consent, proxy consent was obtained from a relative or representative. If a proxy was unavailable, if permitted by local regulation, the consent was deferred or waived. When consent was given by a proxy or deferred, the patient was informed about the trial as soon as possible and consent obtained for the use of the data collected.</p></sec></ack><ref-list
