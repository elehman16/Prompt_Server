Randomization occurs centrally, blockwise and is stratified by center. This study is performed in five pediatric gastroenterology outpatient departments. Observer-blind assessments of outcome variables take place four times: pre-, post-, 3- and 12-months post-treatment. Primary outcome is the course of pain intensity and frequency.

According to the Rome III criteria, functional abdominal pain is specified as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, and functional abdominal pain syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FAP is characterized by recurrent or persistent pain in the abdomen for more than 2&#x000a0;months, with episodes occurring at least once a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FAP represents, besides headache, the most common pain syndrome in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with prevalence rates ranging from 8.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] up to 45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FAP often leads to functional disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], poor school attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and a number of unnecessary, cost-intensive visits in medical care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Children with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain may have a worse quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and experience greater anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Untreated, FAP is highly persistent until adulthood, also leading to increased risk of psychiatric disorders (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]).</p><p>Psychosocial factors in symptom maintenance include inadequate coping styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], poor family functioning and overprotective parental behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Catastrophizing plays an especially important role in mediating the relationship between pain and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and moderating the effectiveness of distraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses underscore the efficacy of psychological interventions, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for managing pain in childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. But only a few treatment studies for pediatric chronic pain consider abdominal pain (3 out of 25; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) and even fewer investigate the emotional functioning of the children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis by Sprenger <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], including ten studies for the psychological treatment of FAP, showed that interventions obtain a medium-sized effect on pain reduction. These interventions mainly comprised CBT, child-centered or family-based, and relaxation techniques. With respect to functional and emotional outcomes, CBT involving the children alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or parents and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] proved to be effective in terms of an increase in emotional functioning or in quality of life. Interpretation of studies is limited due to differing definitions of the condition, inadequate control group designs and a lack of assessment of long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With respect to longer term follow-up and the effectiveness of CBT compared to an active control group, available evidence is limited. Since preparation of this trial, several RCT studies with 12-month follow-up data have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] but with inconsistent results. While Levy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] report a greater decrease in pain symptoms and parental solicitous behavior, as well as greater increase in child&#x02019;s coping skills in the intervention group compared to the active control group, results of the study by van der Veek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] could not confirm these differences. Comparing a cognitive-behavioral, child-centered intervention and intensive medical care, van der Veek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found no group differences in pain reduction at post-treatment and at the 12-month follow-up. All secondary outcomes, for example, quality of life, improved equally in both groups.</p><p>The current trial builds on the insights gained in two previous studies. For example, in an uncontrolled pilot study with 11 children, we were able to show that children attending a cognitive-behavioral program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] not only experienced a reduction in pain frequency and intensity, but also an increase in health-related quality of life. A small RCT-study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29; including a waiting list control group) was able to confirm these results with effect sizes ranging from medium to high for a 3-month follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for pain reduction; however little is known about the differential effects on emotional well-being and individual differences in treatment response.</p><p>This multicenter trial aims to compare the cognitive-behavioral group intervention with an active control group (age-appropriate educational content), both provided by trained therapists, with respect to a reduction of pain symptoms and an increase in children&#x02019;s quality of life. The effects are analyzed 3 and 12&#x000a0;months after the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Stop-FAP is a multicenter, prospective, parallel group, randomized-controlled superiority trial for the evaluation of the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral group intervention compared to an active control group.

Following a stepwise approach, the physician will clarify red flags by a standardized medical history (related symptoms, fever, blood in the urine, waking up during night, bowel habits, nausea <italic>etcetera</italic>), thorough examination and laboratory diagnostics (that is, blood, urine status, and stool), all of which are obligatory and necessary steps to rule out organic causes of pain such as inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The standardized and manualized intervention addresses the following issues: psychoeducation on FAP, change of negative pain-related thoughts and attention bias, relaxation techniques, coping strategies and self-esteem. Each session includes individual tailoring of content, for example, triggers of pain. A central element of the program is the pain diary that children are asked to keep during the whole intervention in order to increase their self-management skills. Each session is accompanied by regular homework (for example, relaxation) that allows implementing and practicing of the newly learned strategies at home. The child&#x02019;s experiences can be tackled in the following session.</p><p>During the parent group sessions, the parents are primarily informed about the major disease characteristics, the etiology and maintenance of FAP, red flags and nutrition. Main focus of the parental sessions is to coach the parents on how to support their child in his pain management efforts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control group - educational program</title><p>The CG comprises a child-centered educational program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The questionnaire includes three subscales of behavior-related coping strategies when the child is in pain: passive pain coping (for example, &#x02018;I go to bed&#x02019; (10 items, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.68)), seek for social support (for example, &#x02018;I have my mother, father or a friend sit with me&#x02019; (8 items, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.80)) and positive self-instruction (for example, &#x02018;I tell myself to be brave&#x02019; (7 items, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.63)).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Self-efficacy</title><p>For assessing child&#x02019;s pain-related self-efficacy, we use the self-efficacy scale by Bursch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Children are asked to rate how sure they are to pursue everyday activities when they are in pain (for example, &#x02018;make it through a school day&#x02019; or &#x02018;be with your friends&#x02019;) on a five-point scale (very sure to very unsure). This seven-item measure showed good internal consistency in the validation study (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.80; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Predictors</title><p>In addition to the confirmatory aspects of this trial, further child- and parent-related variables will be assessed for analyzing predictive or moderating influences on treatment effects. Child and parental strain will be analyzed with respect to their impact on treatment outcome.</p><p>Further, the amount of healthcare utilization and school attendance will be assessed at baseline and during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Points of measurement</title><p>Applying an observer-blind design, data are collected by questionnaires for children and parents at four points of measurement. Pre-intervention (T1) and postintervention (T2) will take place at the study centers. As the primary outcome is assessed by a pain diary over 14&#x000a0;days, T1 and T2 are located 14 to 21&#x000a0;days before and after the intervention phase. Follow-up assessment will take place 3 (T3) and 12 (T4) months after intervention, also including pain diaries and questionnaires for child and parents. Follow-up data will be collected via mail by the University of Potsdam.</p><p>The issue of concomitant care and use of other medical or psychological services is included in patient information prior to study inclusion. The families are not to utilize other therapeutic approaches for FAP such as pain medication or other treatments. Due to ethical reasons, medical or psychological consultations are not prohibited during the follow-up time span. Data on the consultation rate are included in the follow-up survey.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Sample size - power analysis</title><p>The calculations rely on the high effect size of our primary outcome (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.09 for the composite pain score; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) and correlation among repeated measures 0.8 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). Since our recent single-site study included a 3-month follow-up and a waiting list control group (instead of an active control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), power analysis for the primary outcome is based conservatively on a medium effect size (f&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25; d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6). Independent variables are intervention (2), gender (2), age (2) and site of intervention (5), forming a total of 2<sup>3</sup>*5&#x02009;=&#x02009;40 groups.</p><p>In the study centers, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;450 children will be assessed for eligibility and a total number of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;112 children will be allocated to the trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;56 in IG, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;56 in CG). We assume a drop-out rate of 20% [cf. 18], resulting n&#x02009;=&#x02009;112 children to be analyzed in the intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;90 children for the per protocol analysis (PPA).</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Drop-out rate</title><p>In our pilot study we did not observe drop-out of patients. In 9 out of 10 intervention studies, drop-out rates are below 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We assume a loss of 20% due to drop-outs during the follow-up time span (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). To prevent selective drop-out and incomplete outcome data, all participants will be reimbursed for completely filling in the questionnaires and the pain diary in the follow-up period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Randomization</title><p>Allocation sequences are generated centrally at the Institute of Epidemiology at University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (KW). It will be mutually randomized in IG and CG with a 1:1 ratio. Each patient&#x02019;s position on allocation sequence is defined by computer-generated random-numbers and the date of informed consent (chronologically sorted).</p><p>As groups are assigned parallel and the interventions are to be carried out mutually, blocking is dependent on the group sizes. Block sizes range between 6 and 16 patients. The total number of each block is dependent on the total number of groups to be trained. As in this trial, a maximum of 25 groups are to be trained; the number of blocks of 6 and 8 patients is restricted to five each.</p><p>The randomization procedure, in order to prevent selection bias, occurs centrally at the University of Potsdam by a person not involved in the intervention process and data analysis. We realize a stratified (according to center) block randomization. Randomization and allocation to interventions occur after assessment of pre-data and before the interventions start. Results of randomization will be provided directly only to the trainers via email (allocation concealment). Each center has to realize four different groups; at the first block of interventions, the trainer may choose the trial arm (IG versus CG); in the second block, the trainers have to change the trial arm.</p><p>The effectiveness of the randomization is evaluated post-hoc by descriptive statistical comparisons between IG and CG in known and presumed baseline predictors of treatment success (for example, pain history of the parents and socio-economic status) and relevant sociodemographic data (age and sex).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Blinding</title><p>The medical and psychological assessments are blinded as these precede randomization. After assignment to interventions, the outcome assessors (study nurse and site investigators) and principle investigator will be blinded. While patients and parents will be blinded, blinding of trainers in the treatment is not possible. However, trainers are not involved in the assessment process.</p><p>Group allocation will be coded by different letters; only the trainers and the administrator of randomization results will be informed about the corresponding intervention.</p><p>The primary outcome will be reported by the children themselves, who are not aware of their respective treatment allocation. Assessment of data is blinded on all points of measurement. Follow-up data will be assessed by telephone interviews (blinded interviewer) with the younger children and questionnaires for older children and the parents. Information material and questionnaires in the follow-up phase will be sent out directly to the participating families. Data collection and data analysis are independent. Data entry is operated by computer scanning and is therefore blinded.</p><p>Early unblinding is not intended. Regular unblinding occurs after complete data collection, that is, after the last data of T4 is collected and entered into data set. Process data of the intervention-specific pain diaries will be added to the data set after all other data are entered and therefore constitutes the first step of unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Stopping rules</title><p>For the individual patient, it is stated that children can discontinue treatment in case of observed unusual, continued and increased, severe bodily complaints or in case of red flags. Then, the study physician will be consulted, and diagnostics and treatment are advised. The whole intervention will be stopped in case of occurrence of severe adverse effects in association with the intervention in more than 5% of the children. A study center will be closed when it fails to meet or adhere to the study protocol in more than three cases in a row, or if for two consecutive time spans, fewer than three children could be included in the study over the course of 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam and the responsible ethics committees/state chambers of physicians of the five study centers.

The respondents&#x02019; privacy and anonymity is safe-guarded as personal patient data will be stored in a restricted room separately from the questionnaires. The latter are coded in an anonymous way before their transfer to the central study office where data entry and analysis will take place. All personalized data (addresses) are destroyed after the termination of follow-up. The participating treatment facilities will only receive aggregated statistical data as feedback. All potential study participants receive adequate written information about the aims and implications of the study before consent is given. Informed consent will be obtained from children and their parents by the site investigators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Data analytic plan</title><p>Missing values will be replaced by unbiased substitution (EM-algorithm).

Length of pain episodes will be analyzed analogously. Frequencies will be analyzed using a Poisson regression model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Confirmatory analysis</title><p>In terms of clinical relevance, the composite pain score is the most prominent outcome: a substantial pain reduction is mandatory for treatment efficacy. We therefore apply a hierarchical testing procedure; the number and length of pain episodes will be tested only if there is a significant difference between the treatment groups in the log area under the curve (auc) of pain intensity. These endpoints will be tested to an alpha level of 2.5%; therefore, under this hierarchical design the overall alpha level of the trial will not exceed 5%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Analysis of secondary outcomes</title><p>Further, we will analyze primary and secondary outcome measures using a mixed model, adjusting for the therapist (random effect) and baseline measures (including age, gender, duration of illness, age at onset and the baseline measure of the outcome of interest).</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Exploratory analyses</title><p>We will also explore subscales of the outcome measures to see if there are indicators of treatment effects within these subscales.</p><p>In further exploratory analyses, we will include other baseline predictors in the model and explore their potential effect modification; moreover the effect of time-varying predictors will also be investigated.

For assuring the quality of treatment, the therapist and evaluator will be in contact via conference calls as well.</p><p>Follow-up assessment is monitored by the principle investigator.

The study will be reported according to the CONSORT criteria for non-pharmacological trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and will be supplemented according to the TIDieR guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For all patients, the informed consent documents will be checked. Data entry will be conducted by electronic scanning of questionnaires, which includes double checking of data. Additionally, 20% of the data will be double checked by staff. The primary outcome measures will be verified in 100% of cases. In addition, source data verification of the key data will be performed in a random sample of 40.0% of the patients. Data management has the opportunity to conduct queries regarding data quality and integrity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Assessment of safety</title><p>Since we do not expect adverse effects of the psychological intervention, we decided to form a multidisciplinary scientific advisory board (Trial Steering Committee, TSC) to oversee and monitor the whole trial. The members are experts in the field of chronic pain and will supervise the trial to ensure data safety. The TSC will receive recruitment and retention updates on a regular basis. According to the nature of the study, those persons monitor the progress of the study (for example, achievement of milestones, percent of recruited patients and adverse events) as well as adherence to the study protocol. There will be two meetings between the investigator and the advisory board at enrollment start and at last recruitment. The committee itself has the right to actively address any study issues with the principle investigator.</p><p>On all relevant stages of the trial, safety aspects are considered and monitored by psychological and medical screening and ongoing monitoring with regard to adverse effects and adherence.</p><p>In general, we do not expect any severe adverse effects of the interventional approach since the intervention consists of well-established pain management strategies (IG) or information delivery (CG). So far, neither adverse side effects nor such negative experiences are reported in previous studies implementing the respective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p><bold>Adverse events</bold> (AEs), including chronic or recurrent physical and psychiatric illness, as well as all reports and results have to be documented in patient&#x02019;s health records and case report forms.

The ethics committee at the site, the principle investigator and the TSC will be informed immediately.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>FAP represents a considerable strain on children and their families and causes increased healthcare utilization. In our previous study, children suffered for more than two years from FAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Current evidence suggests that psychological treatments can lead to a clinically significant reduction of pain and, almost certainly, of psychological strain too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As increased health care utilization, especially the repeated diagnostic procedures, causes high health care costs ($6104.30 US per child; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]) appropriate management of FAP is urgently needed and will reduce these costs substantially. Thus demonstrating efficacy and feasibility in a multicenter study, psychological treatments for FAP will be available for affected children and their families and could be easily implemented in clinical practice. Furthermore, psychological support is not part of the standard medical care for patients with FAP in Germany; therefore, participation in this multicenter study may improve the quality of patient care. Furthermore, the group setting offers an economically and emotionally advantageous approach.</p><sec id="Sec43"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Participants are recruited from five pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinics throughout Germany using consecutive and active recruitment strategies. This broad strategy and the specified sample characteristics with respect to age, gender and psychological strain allow recruiting of a representative sample of FAP patients. This will enhance external validity and enable generalization of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Beyond regular publication, the results of the trial will be used for dissemination of the intervention as well as for the establishment of international collaboration with related study groups to further disseminate the evidence-based treatment program and improvement of care for children with FAP. Collaborations with self-help organizations will enhance the dissemination of the results and the implementation of the treatment approach in clinical practice as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Strengths of the trial</title><p>This trial will add to our current knowledge in several ways. First, the inclusion of an active control group instead of a waiting list control group is able to ensure that effects are due to treatment content, rather than to nonspecific patient-therapist factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, a 3- and 12-month follow-up will enhance our knowledge on the maintenance of treatment effects. Third, the implementation of the program in several centers will increase the generalizability of treatment effects. Fourth, including a broad range of psychosocial variables for children as well as their parents allows the detailed analysis of psychosocial treatment effects as well as the analysis of predictors and mediators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently recruiting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec47"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13063_2014_2228_MOESM1_ESM.doc"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
