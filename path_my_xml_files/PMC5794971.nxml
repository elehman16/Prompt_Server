A total of 40 patients with stroke completed the study. They received P-IMT, D-IMT, or control treatment (CT) for 20 training sessions. Primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Secondary outcomes were the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and wrist-worn accelerometers. The differences on the distal FMA, total MRC, distal MRC, and MAL quality of movement scores among the 3 groups were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 to 0.05). Post hoc comparisons revealed that the D-IMT group significantly improved more than the P-IMT group on the total MRC and distal MRC. Furthermore, the distal FMA and distal MRC improved more in the D-IMT group than in the CT group. Our findings suggest that distal upper-limb robotic rehabilitation using the InMotion WRIST system had superior effects on distal muscle strength. Further research based on a larger sample is needed to confirm long-term treatment effects of proximal versus distal upper-limb robotic rehabilitation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Most stroke survivors are burdened with significant physical dysfunction, and approximately 60% to 80% continue to have upper-limb (UL) motor deficits into the chronic phase of stroke that have a large effect on their daily life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Developing effective rehabilitation interventions to maxmize UL motor recovery and functional independence of patients with stroke is therefore one of the top priorities in clinical practice and research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Robot-assisted therapy (RT) has emerged during the last decade as a novel rehabilitation approach to intensify UL motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Although positive results of RT on motor outcomes have been noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, there are disparate effects and heterogeneities between trials depending on the robotic types (eg, exoskeleton versus end-effector, or proximal versus distal approach), protocols, dosages, and problems of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Very few studies have directly compared the relative effects of different robotic devices. A recent systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> investigated the effect of robotic types and reported a trend favoring end-effector rather than exoskeleton robotic devices on motor function. However, the superiority of treatment effect on the UL joints targeted by robotics remains unknown, especially for distal robotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, comparative trials of different robotic types (eg, proximal versus distal robots) are warranted to tailor robot-aided UL rehabilitation to patient&#x02019;s needs.</p><p id="Par5">This study mainly compared the treatment effects of the InMotion ARM versus the InMotion WRIST robotic systems. The major difference between the 2 robotic devices is that the InMotion ARM focuses on training shoulder and elbow movements (ie, proximal UL), and the InMotion WRIST targets wrist and forearm movements (ie, distal UL). The proximal UL segments are critical for stability and transport of the arm, and the distal UL joints are mainly responsible for object manipulation and are important for performing daily activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Motor control of the proximal UL and distal UL might be driven by different descending pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The dorsolateral pathways (eg, corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts) are important for control of distal UL movements, and the ventromedial pathways (eg, reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, and tectospinal tracts) act more on the axial and proximal UL muscles and movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although the neural bases act on proximal and distal UL segments and their functional roles appear to be different, direct comparisons of the clinical efficacy of proximal versus distal UL training in stroke patients are lacking.</p><p id="Par7">Mazzeloni <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> used the same robotic systems to evaluate the treatment effects of proximal RT versus distal RT and proximal RT combined in 2 groups. However, the study goals of Mazzeloni <italic>et al</italic>. and this work are different. The effects of RT directly related to the UL segments specifically treated could not be drawn from the study findings of Mazzeloni <italic>et al</italic>. The 2 RT systems, InMotion ARM and InMotion WRIST, allow us to directly compare the outcomes affected by the proximal versus distal UL training.</p><p id="Par8">In addition, recent reviews of RT have shown non-significant improvements or small effects on daily function after UL robotic rehabilitation in patients with stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Major goals of stroke rehabilitation are to improve not only motor function but also functional performance on daily activities. Moreover, many patients were unable to translate the improvements of motor function and muscle strength to daily activity performance, which led to persistent functional dependence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, this study provided functional task practice after RT to enhance the gains from proximal and distal UL robotic rehabilitation on motor function and muscle strength transfer into the patients&#x02019; daily functional performance.</p><p id="Par9">The study purposes were to investigate the treatment effects of proximal-emphasized RT by using the InMotion ARM (P-IMT) versus distal-emphasized RT by using the InMotion WRIST (D-IMT) compared with a control treatment (CT) in patients with stroke. We designed a conventional rehabilitation program as the CT to provide a higher-level of clinical evidence, which decreased the influence of nondirective research environment and participant factors on treatment efficacy (eg, the Hawthorne effect), and to pose a more ethical approach instead of no treatment or placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par10">The inclusion criteria were (1) first-ever unilateral stroke; (2) at least 6 months after stroke onset; (3) a baseline score on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of 18 to 56; (4) able to follow the study instructions (&#x02265;24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; and (5) no excessive spasticity in UL joints (modified Ashworth scale&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3).

Randomization was thus conducted at the cluster level rather than at the individual patient level. A cluster was defined as a hospital. This trial had at least 2 clusters for each group to avoid the treatment effects largely confounded with the cluster effect. Six hospitals participated in this study.

The D-IMT group showed better outcomes in distal UL motor function and distal muscle strength compared with the CT intervention. In addition, the amount of improvement on the total FMA score (ie, 5 points) in both the D-IMT and P-IMT groups was similar to the gains reported in several previous RT studies using the same robotic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

In addition, the P-IMT group did not show advantages over the D-IMP and CT interventions on the assessments of proximal UL motor function and muscle strength, indicating that the 3 groups demonstrated similar benefits on the proximal outcomes.</p><p id="Par34">The D-IMT group gained the most improvements in the distal part of UL motor function and muscle strength and in quality of movement while using the affected UL in daily activities among the 3 groups. The change scores for 9 (69.2%), 6 (46.2%), 8 (61.5%), and 7 (53.8%) participants in the D-IMT group exceeded the minimal clinically important difference values (ie, 10% of total score)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> of the FMA-distal, MRC-total, MRC-distal, and MAL-QOM, respectively. The results support that these improvements after distal-emphasized RT were not only statistically significant but also clinically important. The movements of distal UL segments are crucial for executing functional tasks. The benefits of distal-emphasized RT using the InMotion WRIST seems directly related to the distal UL segments treated, implying the effects of training specificity. The more distal UL training led to greater gains in distal motor function, muscle strength, and quality of movement during functional activities.</p><p id="Par35">No significant advantages of the proximal-emphasized RT using the InMotion ARM were highlighted on proximal motor function and muscle strength outcomes compared with the other 2 groups. One possible reason is that regardless of the intervention groups, the participants still used their proximal UL segments or exerted strength during treatment, albeit the upper arm was supported or restrained in the D-IMP group. The proximal and distal UL segments were also both used in some treatment programs in the CT group, including reaching, grasping, and object manipulation. The standard clinical scales used in this study could not capture the changes of motor control or movement strategies after proximal-emphasized RT. Further studies that include kinematic measures along with clinical scales to help clarify the observed changes after robotic rehabilitation are suggested. Furthermore, 2 previous studies reported that the improvement scores of the FMA were 7.7 and 11 points after RT using the same InMotion ARM plus functional task training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The improvements on the FMA were higher than in this study (5 points). However, the disparity may have resulted from the larger treatment dosage provided in these 2 studies (5&#x02009;hours a day, 5 days per week for 12 weeks) and patients with different severities of stroke recruited in the studies (moderate to severe versus mild to moderate impairment).</p><p id="Par36">A previous prelimary study investigated the efficacy of the RT training sequence to different UL segments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The authors examined the effects of proximal UL training, followed by distal UL and vice versa, by using the same InMotion ARM and WRIST robot systems. Their initial results showed that there were local effects on the treated UL segments but that the generalization of gains to the untreated UL segments was limited. The gains of training on the distal UL segment appeared to have a greater transfer to the proximal UL segment than vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Another study reported the effects of additionally adding distal RT to proximal RT, suggesting that there were no advantages on the proximal UL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, 2 recent review articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> found that proximal RT studies have a positive trend to improve UL motor function, whereas the effects of distal RT remain unclear due to low numbers of distal RT studies. Except for comparing the relative effects of proximal and distal UL training by robotic rehabilitation technology, the degrees of generalization effects to the untreated limb segments or which training order is better to achieve more recovery warrant further investigation.</p><p id="Par37">Moreover, the accelerometry ratios of the affected arm to the nonaffected arm were approximately 0.3 in both RT groups. This finding was similar to previous studies that provided different UL therapies in stroke patients and also reported accelerometry ratios of 0.31 to 0.58<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the amount of activity in the affected arm is one-third to one-half that of the nonaffected arm. However, these studies have shown significant and nonsignificant changes in the ratios or the activity counts of the affected arm after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The accelerometry data are affected by the type of monitor that is used, the patients&#x02019; lifestyles or regular activities, the duration of data collection, and the duration of data processing. The wearable monitors provide an objective and quantitative measure of patients&#x02019; activity in real-life environments, but their clinical usefulness as an outcome measure needs to be further evaluated.</p><p id="Par38">This study has some limitations. First, long-term follow-up evaluations were not performed, and thus, carry-over beneficial effects could not be determined. Second, this study was a cluster-controlled trial with a modest sample size. Further larger-scale studies are suggested to include more clusters (eg, 4 clusters per intervention arm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and participants (eg, 30 patients per arm) to validate the study findings. Third, although the between-group differences in baseline variables were not significant, the D-IMT group had shorter onset time and higher baseline FMA and MMSE scores, which may have biased the outcomes. The differential effects of proximal versus distal UL robotic rehabilitation in the patients with more severe motor deficits (eg, FMA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18) warrant further investigations. In addition to the wrist robotic device applied in this study, further research that includes hand/digit robotic devices (eg, InMotion Hand Robot) is suggested to provide a more comprehensive efficacy of distal UL robotic rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, we found that the distal-emphasized RT had superior outcomes compared with the proximal-emphasized RT on muscle strength and quality of movement during functional activities after the 4-week intervention. The distal-emphasized RT showed better improvements than CT on distal upper-limb motor function and distal muscle strength. In addition, the improvements of the D-IMT and P-IMT groups on overall upper-limb motor function both reached the minimal clinically important difference. Further larger-scale research is suggested to investigate the long-term differential effects between proximal- and distal-emphasized robotic rehabilitation after stroke.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="Par40">The data sets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
