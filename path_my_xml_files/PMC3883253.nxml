So, there is a need to continue research on the effectiveness of physical activity interventions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of group-based (GB) and home-based (HB) physical activity on mental health in people aged 60 and more.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this quasi-experimental study, among the 35 health centers located in Shahr-e-kord district, 10 urban ones, which were randomly selected, provided us the list of subjects. Twenty people were randomly selected from the list in each of the health centers (making a total of 200 females and males aged 60-89 years). In order to rule out the study exclusion criteria, participants had been visited by a general practitioner. Those who were prohibited from exercising due to medical reasons and those who had been absent for more than three uninterrupted sessions were excluded. All participants were mentally and physically able to participate in the study, and all of them gave written consent. Due to low level of education, all the participants were interviewed orally. One trained personnel in each health center educated the participants about the goals of study, the questionnaires, and the interviewing method, and conducted interviews with the study subjects individually. Interviews were performed within 2 weeks at the beginning and were repeated 3 months after the trial. Participants completed surveys including demographic characteristics and measures of mental health [28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28)]. At the end (of recruiting 200 participants), 181 satisfactorily completed the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow and follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-4-1282-g001"/></fig><p>After the baseline mental health assessment, members were divided into two groups of physical activity, GB and HB, according to participants&#x02019; tendencies. Because of the nature of the intervention, participants were not blinded to group membership. Because of the condition of the elderly people due to which they could not participate in the classes regularly, we were not able to choose the members of the groups randomly.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Physical activity programs</title><p>Two kinds of interventions were conducted in this study, GB and HB. In the first group, the participants exercised in 10 groups of 10 persons in each with the exercise instructors, and the participants in the other group exercised at home with one of their family members. Exercise instructors and one of the family members of each of the participants were educated to supervise the intervention in the first and second study groups, respectively. After that, in the first session, an exercise instructor provided information about maintaining a good health on topics like healthy aging, exercise and health, physical and mental resistance and endurance, mental health in elderly, and symptoms related to aging for all of the participants. Then, another exercise instructor delivered exercise program based on instructions prepared by Iran Ministry of Health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>This exercise includes three important stages: Warm-up (10 min), exercises (whole muscles should be included) for 30 min, and cool-down (5 min), which overall takes 45 min.</p><p>This program had been delivered in 16 sessions twice a week for 2 months. The exercise sessions were accompanied by tape recorded music and were graded in terms of difficulty and the number of repetitions. The activities could be practiced both seated and in standing position.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measures</title><p>Demographic variables were calculated with a questionnaire containing 10 questions. Mental health was assessed by GHQ-28, which is widely used in screening minor psychiatric disorders in community samples. The GHQ offers a continuous measure of psychological distress or current mental health status. The 28-item version describes individual health status in terms of four dimensions of psychological morbidity and social functioning: Somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression. These are rated on 4-point rating scales.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Seven items of this questionnaire are formulated in a positive manner and the other 21 items are formulated in a negative manner. In the case of the positive items, the scale is: 1 = more than usual, 2 = as usual, 3 = less than usual, and 4 = much less than usual. In the negative items, the scale is: 1 = not at all, 2 = not more than usual, 3 = a little more than usual, and 4 = much more than usual.</p><p>Traditional/binary, the system used in this research to calculated the score is [0-0-1-1] for positive items (a score of 0 was used for response choices 1 and 2 and a score of 1 was used for response choices 3 and 4) and [0-1-1-1] for negative items (a score of 0 was used for response choice 1 and a score of 1 was used for the remaining three response choices 2-4).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] This questionnaire was translated into Persian and its validity and reliability were acceptable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Reliability and validity of this questionnaire have also been indicated for the Iranian elderly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In this study, a score of 6 was calculated as the best cut-off point. This means those who got 6 or more out of 28 (full score of the questionnaire) were suspected as mental disorder cases. In addition, score 2 was considered as the best cut-off point for each dimension.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were conducted using the SPSS for Windows software, version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the statistical significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

Our data are consistent with previous studies showing that physical exercise is associated with good mental health and negatively associated with symptoms of anxiety or depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] But some studies have not found similar results because of several reasons such as: The relationship was assessed in a specific sub-population and the analyses were adjusted for different sets of confounders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, this study demonstrated that physical activity improved the total mean score of GHQ-28 and all its subscales, especially somatization. ten Have <italic>et al</italic>., in their study, found comparable results to our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Rezaeeshirazi <italic>et al</italic>. showed the group that performed aerobic exercises experienced improvement in all the psychological disorders present in the general health questionnaire.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Abbas <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a significant decrease in the mean GHQ-12 scores in their study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Moreover, Salmon emphasized on the positive role of sports in general health,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] and the present research added information to previous researches as the sample in our study included elderly people who have a special condition in comparison with young people.</p><p>Also, the data of pre-test and post-test analysis of the two groups in this study showed that GB physical activity in the stage of post-test resulted in lesser mental health disorder than the second one, HB physical activity, and this result was not confounded by baseline characteristics. Major differences were found between the two groups in somatization, followed by anxiety.</p><p>Ashworth <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the effectiveness of home-based versus group-based physical activity programs on the health of older adults. They showed that different kinds of physical activity can potentially have various effects on the people based on the various medical conditions that they have (e.g., cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] In another study, McCarthy <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that the supplementation of a home-based exercise program with a group-based exercise program led to clinically significant superior improvement in participants&#x02019; health status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]</p><p>Blumenthal <italic>et al</italic>. showed that group exercise training in older patients with major depression was as effective as antidepressant treatment. Most remarkable is the finding that the 10-month relapse rate was significantly lower in the exercise group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>]</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. Our participants may not be representative of the general population because they were selected from urban health center's registry, therefore the coverage was not complete and it would be a potential source of selection bias.</p><p>As mentioned before, due to participants&#x02019; special condition, they were not randomly divided. However, this limitation did not affect the results because of the nonsignificant difference between the two study groups&#x02019; baseline characteristics.</p><p>Selection bias might also have occurred because of missing those who were not included in the beginning of study or miss to follow up during the survey due to any undiagnosed mental health disorders. Moreover, we could not blind the interviewers and participants to the type of study intervention, which might be a source of information bias. The other important limitation is that we cannot separate the effects of physical activity and environmental factors, such as peer groups&#x02019; meeting, on mental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Physical activity can improve the mental health in the elderly. Furthermore, group-based programs are more effective than home-based ones. Therefore, designing and implementation of group-based physical activity program is acknowledged as an important and effective strategy to promote old people's health status.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the participants and are grateful to Shahr-e-kord primary care practitioners and their staff in assisting with recruitment.
