impose specific therapeutic measures for each illness, reaching the necessity to
know how to anticipate severity, mortality and possible aggravations any disease
might carry. Knowing how to make such predictions capacitates us in a way that our
intervention becomes more individualized and more efficient for each patient. This
is why prognostic scores are widely used tools in the day-to-day practice of many
medical specialties, as much in the scope of preoperative care as postoperative care
in the intensive care units.</p><p>The postoperative period (PO) of cardiac surgery is characterized by a great
instability of the hemodynamic conditions of the patients, mainly of those submitted
to extracorporeal circulation. This procedure contributes for the highest risk of
aggravations and complications in several organ systems, deriving from a systemic
inflammatory reaction<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, which
consequently may lead to a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as
the highest mortality able to be predicted in mortality scores in the ICU, such as
Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation Score II (Apache II), Simplified
Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA).
Simultaneously, these scores do not contemplate the conditions of the cardiac
patients submitted to surgeries with extracorporeal circulation, aside from being
less accurate in predicting postoperative mortality, when compared to Logistic
Cardiac Surgery Score (CASUS) -Log-CASUS<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Log-CASUS is a daily mortality score specifically related to patients in
extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery postoperative care; it is a method
of easy stratification and implementation at a patient's bedside<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, which can be done on the internet<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The objective of this cohort retrospective study is to investigate the correlation
between the Log-CASUS score on the second postoperative day (LOG2PO) and the total
serum bilirubin dosage in the same period (BLR2PO), associated to the extracorporeal
circulation time (ECT) as possible predictive factors of extended stay in the
ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study has been submitted to and approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of

Paulo, Brazil, under number 054254/2016, on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 2016. The patients
were randomly selected, among those were operated in last 6 months in this service.
Eight-two patients, whose full clinical and laboratorial data was available during
the research period, were included in the study, clinical and laboratorial data
regarding the postoperative care of adult patients submitted to cardiac surgeries
with extracorporeal circulation was collected, carried out in the teaching hospital
of S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto Medical School - Hospital de Base da
Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Faculdade de Medicina de S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio
Preto-FURNFARME. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A - those who were
discharged up to the second day of postoperative care; Group B - those who were
discharged after the second day of postoperative care. The assessed surgeries were
myocardial revascularization with extracorporeal circulation, valve replacement and
plastic surgery, as well as aorta and congenital surgery. The surgeries which
consider two or more types, among those above mentioned, were classified as combined
surgeries.</p><p>All surgeries were performed with the Braile<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> extracorporeal
circulation, under mild hypothermia with perfusion of the ascending aorta and
bicaval venous drainage, excepting in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG)
- where an atrial venous drainage with two-stage cannula was performed. The combined
antegrade and retrograde low-volume continuous isothermic blood cardioplegia with a
Braile Biomedica<sup>&#x000ae;[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>
preservation solution was the chosen myocardial protection technique for these
surgeries. The BLR2PO was used, and the LOG2PO for the same period was calculated.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Being able to anticipate results in cardiac surgical procedures is a great challenge.
To find means that can equate all the complexities related to cardiac surgeries and
sum the levels of severity of illness for each patient is a feat far too distant
from our current capacity. Meanwhile, we try to adjust those answers by means of
specific tools that aid the universe of cardiovascular surgery. For this, LOG2PO,
BLR2PO and ECT were tested as possible predictive factors of length of stay in the
ICU during postoperative care.</p><p>In this article, correlations among three distinguishable variables were conducted,
with the goal to assess their relevance either in early discharge from the ICU (up
to the second day of postoperative care) or in late discharge (after the second day
of postoperative care). Clear differences amongst the samples of variables collected
from each group were registered, with the mean values of all the variables studied
higher in Group B, namely ECT, BLR2PO and LOG2PO. The higher mean occurred in the
group of patients with longer length of stay in the ICU.</p><p>The Log-CASUS assesses six organ systems accrued with the variable "day of admission
in the ICU" and, contrary to the remaining scores, it punctuates the presence of
circulatory assistance devices and the use of an intra-aortic balloon<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. As a mortality predictive factor,
the Log-CASUS has proved to be quite a straightforward tool, reliable and superior
to SOFA<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Hence, the possibility
of the LOG2PO to predict beyond the risk of daily mortality was tested, along the
lines of extended length of stay in postoperative care.</p><p>The measure of total serum bilirubin on the second day of postoperative care (BLR2PO)
was tested as variable of longer length of stay in the ICU, from observation, within
clinical practice, of a considerable increase in the length of hospitalization both
in the worst cases and those with longer ECT; such occurrence was also established
by other authors<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. To be also
considered is the fact that the isolated total serum bilirubin dosage in the second
day of postoperative care is an identifying factor of patients with greater risk of
mortality within this period<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.
The results indicated that BLR2PO could predict a longer permanence in ICU. However,
the calculation of the LOG2PO, which is obtained through other variables, among them
the BLR2PO itself, was more expressive in predicting the long stay in the ICU as
well as two days, than the simple measure of serum bilirubin.</p><p>The ECT was clearly higher in Group B. Indubitably, we understand this was due to the
fact that the number of combined surgeries and Group B's aorta surgeries (16.8% of
cases) were greater than those in Group A (2.5% of cases); these are known complex
procedures which normally demand more extracorporeal circulation time. Meanwhile,
the ECT did not have sufficient discriminative power in predicting an extended
length of stay.</p><p>On the other hand, the definition of extended length of stay for patients in cardiac
procedure postoperative care is quite controversial in the literature. Silberman et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> determined a
prolonged hospitalization that which registers a period longer than 48h, and noted
that 73% of their patients were in this group. Lagercrantz et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> construed an extended length of
stay in the ICU to be superior to 10 days, and observed that only 3.5% of their
patients were in this group. When following protocol in the routine of our
institution, we consider an ideal postoperative recovery, not aggravated, to be one
which occurs within the 48h period after surgery. Thus, our group of extended length
of stay (Group B), following Silberman et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> criteria, comprised 51% of the cases studied.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>This study was carried out with a small number of patients, and the severity of
the included cases was not quantified, nor organized per group. The only factor
quantified was the length of stay in the intensive care unit for both
groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The distinguishable analysis of the influence of each variable in anticipating the
discharge from the ICU up to or after the second day of PO has shown the most
relevant variable to be LOG2PO, as the area under the respective ROC curve found
from the Log-CASUS parameter was 0.723, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the greatest among
those analyzed. Hence, proving the viability of using such variable to estimate
whether the postoperative length of stay in the ICU of these patients will be a
tough task. On the other hand, the ECT has not proved to be a good predictive factor
for longterm stay in the ICU.</p><p>For future works, there is an intention to, beyond the enlargement of the database,
establish the correlation of the three parameters studied, by means of distinct
numericalstatistical techniques, in order to obtain more relevant and comprehensive
results for the referred prediction.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;
