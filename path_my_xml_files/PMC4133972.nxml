Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a secondary endpoint of MM-015, was also improved with MPR-R. This sub-analysis evaluated the impact of individual predictive factors on HRQoL. Patients completed HRQoL questionnaires at baseline, every third cycle and at progressive disease (PD)/treatment discontinuation. In a mixed-effects model female gender, advanced age and PD negatively affected HRQoL while better treatment responses showed positive effects. Compared to PD, HRQoL during MPR-R treatment was statistically significantly better in two of six preselected domains both of which were also clinically meaningful. HRQoL scores at end of treatment were all either improved or not statistically significantly different versus baseline. In conclusion, continuous treatment with MPR-R, which delays PD, appears to be associated with clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</kwd><kwd>lenalidomide</kwd><kwd>multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>minimal important difference (MID)</kwd><kwd>QLQ-C30</kwd><kwd>QLQ-MY20</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="ss1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the pivotal phase III MM-015 trial, the melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide regimen, followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy (MPR-R) significantly increased median progression-free survival (PFS; 31 months) compared with MPR followed by placebo maintenance (14 months; hazard ratio, 0.49; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) or melphalan and prednisone (MP) followed by placebo maintenance (13 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) aged &#x02265; 65 years [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was a predefined secondary endpoint of the MM-015 trial, and the analysis included determination of the minimal important difference (MID), which can identify clinically meaningful changes in HRQoL scores [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The results indicated that clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL scores were more common in the MPR-R group than in the MPR and MP groups [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The present analysis expands on these findings. The objectives were to identify factors that predict differences in HRQoL score levels, and compare HRQoL status at baseline and during treatment with HRQoL status at time of treatment discontinuation due to progressive disease (PD) or discontinuation (DC) for other reasons. HRQoL determinants were derived for the overall patient group (aged &#x02265; 65 years) and the subset of patients aged 65&#x02013;75 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="ss2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicenter phase III randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MPR-R in transplant- ineligible patients with NDMM aged &#x02265; 65 years. Study details have been previously published [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Briefly, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to MPR-R (nine 4-week cycles of melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide, followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy); MPR (nine 4-week cycles of melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide, followed by placebo maintenance therapy); or MP (nine 4-week cycles of melphalan, prednisone and placebo, followed by placebo maintenance therapy) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>(A)]. The primary objective was to compare PFS in the MPR-R and MP groups. Patients were stratified according to age (65&#x02013;75 vs. &#x0003e; 75 years) and International Staging System (ISS) stage (I/II vs. III). Treating physicians and patients were unaware of the treatment assignment. Patients received maintenance therapy until PD or DC. All patients were followed for &#x02265; 5 years from randomization or until death. The study was conducted in compliance with the Independent Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee procedures, the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practices guidelines and local regulations governing the conduct of clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00405756).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Design overview of trial MM-015.

The HRQoL assessments were undertaken using two European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) validated questionnaires: the generic 30-item EORTC QLQ-C30 [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the 20-item EORTC QLQ-MY20 [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] specifically designed for patients with multiple myeloma. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 questionnaires were available in paper form in the primary languages spoken at MM-015 study sites. The 30 items are scored in five functional domains (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, Social Functioning and Role Functioning) where a higher score indicates better function. Eight domains assess symptoms (Fatigue, Nausea/Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation and Diarrhea) and one assesses Financial Difficulties, where a lower score indicates fewer symptoms or financial difficulties. The EORTC QLQ-C30 also contains an item on overall Global Health Status/QoL (subsequently referred to as Global QoL), where a higher score indicates better overall QoL. The QLQ-MY20 is a 20-item questionnaire that includes two functional domains (Future Perspective and Body Image) and two symptom domains (Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment), each scored similarly to the QLQ-C30. Each instrument takes approximately 10&#x02013;15 min to complete [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The HRQoL questionnaires were completed at baseline, after every third treatment cycle (i.e. at the start of cycles 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16, etc.) and at PD or DC. Follow-up included HRQoL assessment every 6 months (168 days) during the open-label extension phase. Results are presented for six prespecified HRQoL domains, selected for up-front analysis based on their perceived clinical relevance: Global QoL, Physical Functioning, Fatigue and Pain from the EORTC QLQ-C30; and Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment from the EORTC QLQ-MY20 [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Scores were calculated if &#x02265; 50% of boxes for the items in that particular domain were filled according to standard handling of missing or incomplete data [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Compliance of the HRQoL was assessed and previously described for patients enrolled in this study [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A patient was considered compliant when at least 50% of the questionnaire items were completed. The overall compliance during treatment until cycle 16 was high: &#x0003e; 76% for each instrument and at least 65% at PD or DC, and were consistent across treatment arms. The patient and disease characteristics of patients who dropped out or were not compliant were similar between treatment arms [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Identification of MID</title><p>Clinically meaningful changes in HRQoL were defined as MIDs and were assessed by calculating the standard error of measurement (SEM), an error estimate for a single use of the questionnaire at baseline [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The SEM is directly related to the variability of the data through its standard deviation, and the reliability of the scale, as indicated by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha (i.e. SEM = standard deviation &#x000d7; &#x0221a;1 &#x02212; Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha). The SEM is considered a good estimate of the MID, being the smallest amount of change from baseline that indicates a clinically meaningful change in HRQoL [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. MIDs for the six prespecified HRQoL domains have been identified [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Positive values indicate improvements for Global QoL and Physical Functioning. Negative values indicate improvements for Pain, Fatigue, Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment. MIDs were identified as + 7 points for Global QoL, + 9 for Physical Functioning, &#x02212; 10 for Fatigue, &#x02212; 12 for Pain, &#x02212; 10 for Disease Symptoms and &#x02212; 6 for Side Effects of Treatment [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using data collected until the time of un-blinding of the first study site (May 2010), which occurred after the first planned interim analysis [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Measurements included baseline and five subsequent time points (cycles 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16). Patients with valid data at each assessment were included in the analysis. Analyses were conducted on data up to the cycle at which each study arm had &#x02265; 30 participants (cycle 16). All analyses were performed using SAS<sup><sup>&#x000ae;</sup></sup> version 9.22 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p><p>A mixed-effects model was developed for predicting HRQoL scores (EORTC QLQ-C30: Global QoL, Physical Functioning, Fatigue and Pain; and EORTC QLQ-MY20: Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment) at cycles 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16, where the patient was the random effect. The following variables were included: cycle number (4, 7, 10, 13,and 16 [reference cell]), treatment arm (MPR-R, MPR and MP [reference cell]), age at baseline (years), gender (female, male [reference cell]), baseline HRQoL score, clinical response (very good partial response or better [&#x02265; VGPR], partial response [PR] and stable disease [SD] [reference cell]), PD (1 = yes, 0 = no), DC (1 = yes, 0 = no), neutropenia grade 3&#x02013;4 (1 = yes, 0 = no) and anemia grade 3&#x02013;4 (1 = yes, 0 = no). Clinical response, PD, DC, neutropenia grade 3&#x02013;4 and anemia grade 3&#x02013;4 variables were defined at each cycle for each patient. The modeling cohort was limited to patients in the ITT population who met the following conditions: randomized to MPR-R, MPR or MP, had HRQoL data available at baseline and had at least one post-baseline cycle.</p><p>Regression &#x003b2;-coefficients, <italic>p</italic>-values (based on a <italic>t</italic>-test statistic that examines whether or not the &#x003b2;-coefficient is statistically different from zero) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated from these models. The &#x003b2;-coefficients for continuous variables represented the effect on HRQoL score for each unit change (i.e. each additional year for age, and each additional score point for baseline HRQoL). Based on an alpha level of 0.05, these results determined statistically significant &#x003b2;-coefficients for each of the variables (i.e. determinants of HRQoL). For each of the six preselected HRQoL scores, clinically meaningful effects of each variable were assessed by examining whether the &#x003b2;-coefficient exceeded the MID [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>A separate analysis was conducted based on the subset of patients who had PD or DC prior to cycle 16, which included the following comparisons: (i) HRQoL at end of treatment versus baseline; and (ii) HRQoL during treatment versus end of treatment. For the end of treatment versus baseline comparison, patients were included if they belonged to the ITT population, were randomized to MPR-R, MPR or MP treatment, had PD or DC prior to cycle 16, and had non-missing scores at baseline and end of treatment.

A mixed model was developed where the patient was specified as the random effect and cycle as a fixed effect. From this model, mean HRQoL was calculated across all during-treatment HRQoL scores and at PD or DC for each treatment group. Statistical significance for the difference between mean HRQoL scores at end of treatment and during treatment within treatment group was assessed with a <italic>t</italic>-test statistic produced from the model.</p><p>To minimize the effects of multiple testing associated with baseline, during treatment and end of treatment analyses in patients who had PD or DC, statistical significance was assessed after a Bonferroni adjustment was applied to <italic>p</italic>-values.

Choice of treatment (MPR-R vs. MP and MPR vs. MP) had no statistical or clinical significant effect on the six HRQoL domains, indicating that the addition of lenalidomide to MP with lenalidomide maintenance therapy did not adversely affect HRQoL. Achieving &#x02265; VGPR (vs. SD) was associated with statistically significant improvement for all six domain scores and the MID was exceeded in the Global QoL score. With the exception of a slight improvement in Side Effect of Treatment, achieving PR (vs. SD) had no effect on HRQoL scores. Having PD was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful deterioration in Global QoL and a statistically significant (but not clinically meaningful) worsening of Physical Functioning, Fatigue, Pain and Disease Symptoms. Deterioration in Global QoL and Physical Functioning due to DC was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful.

All three treatment groups deteriorated in Physical Functioning at the time of PD.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Mean HRQoL scores during treatment versus end of treatment (PD) by treatment group.

The results suggest that female gender, advanced age and development of PD negatively affect HRQoL, whereas better HRQoL scores at baseline and better response to treatment (&#x02265; VGPR) were associated with improvements in HRQoL. Better response (&#x02265; VGPR) was more frequently observed with MPR-R than with MP (33% vs. 12%), whereas PD was observed less often with MPR-R than with MP (PFS hazard ratio 0.40; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DC, which was more commonly observed in the MPR-R group than in the MP group (43% vs. 23%) [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], had a statistically significant but no clinically meaningful effect on HRQoL. Neutropenia grade 3&#x02013;4 was found to not exert any significant influence on HRQoL. Anemia grade 3&#x02013;4, which occurred at a similar incidence in the MPR-R and MP groups (24% vs. 14%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = 0.091), negatively affected some HRQoL domains. Findings in the subset of patients aged 65&#x02013;75 years were generally consistent with the overall findings in patients aged &#x02265; 65 years. Taken together, these data show that the addition of lenalidomide to MP with subsequent lenalidomide maintenance therapy had no adverse effect on HRQoL, and that MPR-R may positively affect HRQoL through achievement of better response and delay in PD.</p><p>Patients experienced on average better HRQoL during treatment than at the time of PD, and the difference in HRQoL was particularly pronounced in the MPR-R treatment group. However, in no instances were mean HRQoL scores at the time of PD significantly worse than scores at baseline. These findings confirm the negative impact of PD on HRQoL and underscore the importance of delaying PD in patients with NDMM.</p><p>Positive effects of MPR-R on HRQoL found in this analysis contrast with recently published data from the VISTA trial, which indicate that use of melphalan, prednisone and bortezomib was associated with a temporary worsening in HRQoL, especially between cycles 3 and 6 [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it is not possible to directly compare results from MM-015 and VISTA due to differences in study design (MM-015 is double-blind and VISTA is open-label), treatment regimens, study populations and follow-up duration. The findings highlight the potential effects of treatment on HRQoL and suggest that further studies are needed to directly compare the impact of bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens on HRQoL.</p><p>One limitation of this analysis is that it is based on interim data; therefore, an updated analysis using final MM-015 data is recommended. A second limitation could be the preselection of six HRQoL domains. This focus was considered justifiable, however, as longitudinal results of these six HRQoL domains have been found to be mostly comparable to the remaining group of HRQoL domains [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This study has shown a clear negative association between HRQoL and PD, whereby PD was defined as a laboratory progression in accordance with the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In clinical practice it is conceivable that patients would be treated until symptom relapse according to CRAB criteria ([elevated] calcium, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions); these associations were not tested here due to heightened levels of complexity. However, this reinforces the importance of the findings in this publication and indicates that there may be an even stronger negative correlation between HRQoL and symptom progression.</p><p>Lastly, although the inclusion of neutropenia and anemia in our mixed-effects model provides interesting observations, a more detailed analysis of the relationship between adverse events and HRQoL may provide further insights into this area of research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="ss14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the MM-015 NDMM population, several factors were identified that predicted HRQoL, including achievement of VGPR (which was associated with improved HRQoL) and PD (which negatively affected HRQoL). The MPR-R regimen, which has been shown to prolong PFS compared with MP, was associated with several statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements of HRQoL. This suggests that MPR-R is an important treatment option for transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM. HRQoL may be especially relevant in circumstances where a survival advantage is difficult to demonstrate, such as in frontline treatment for multiple myeloma, where there is an increasing use of novel agents as salvage therapy. The marked deterioration in HRQoL observed at PD in this analysis emphasizes the clinical importance of delaying PD, even in situations where an overall survival advantage has not yet been demonstrated due to a limited number of events.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Assistance in manuscript preparation was provided by Debra Brocksmith, Medical Writing department, ICON Clinical Research.
