Despite extensive research, to date no effective treatment of vasospasm exists. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In vitro models have shown a relaxing effect of prostacyclin after induced contraction in cerebral arteries, and a recent pilot trial showed a positive effect on cerebral vasospasm in a clinical setting. No randomised, clinical trials have been conducted, investigating the possible pharmacodynamic effects of prostacyclin on the human brain following SAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This trial is a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, blinded, clinical, pilot trial. A total of 90 patients with SAH will be randomised to one of three intervention arms: epoprostenol 1&#x02009;ng/kg/min, epoprostenol 2&#x02009;ng/kg/min or placebo in addition to standard treatment. Trial medication will start day 5 after SAH and continue to day 10. The primary outcome measure is changes in regional cerebral blood flow from baseline in the arterial territories of the anterior cerebral artery, medial cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery, measured by CT perfusion scan. The secondary outcomes will be vasospasm measured by CT angiography, ischaemic parameters measured by brain microdialysis, flow velocities in the medial cerebral artery, clinical parameters and outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale) at 3&#x02009;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01447095.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</kwd><kwd>Prostacyclin</kwd><kwd>Epoprostenol</kwd><kwd>Vasospasm</kwd><kwd>Delayed ischaemic neurological deficit</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) accounts for only 5% of strokes, but due to the poor prognosis and lower patient age than for patients with ischaemic stroke, the loss of productive life years due to SAH approaches that for ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>One of the main causes of mortality and morbidity following SAH is the development of delayed ischaemic neurological deficit (DIND)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. DIND occurs in approximately 30% of all patients and often develops within the first 2&#x02009;weeks after the haemorrhage, with maximum onset between days 4 and 10
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The presumed cause of DIND is the development of cerebral vasospasm (CV), which can be demonstrated by angiography in 70% of patients following SAH
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, not all patients with angiographic vasospasm suffer DIND and DIND can occur without evidence of arterial narrowing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several mechanisms have been suggested as additional causes of DIND, e.g. microthrombosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; however angiographic vasospasm is still regarded as the most important factor.</p><p>The pathophysiology behind the development of CV is complex and remains poorly understood, but factors related to the vascular endothelium and the smooth muscle cell play a crucial role
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several intervention options, including HHH (hypertension, hypervolemia, hemodilution), calcium antagonists, angioplasty, endothelin-receptor antagonists and statins have been used to prevent or treat vasospasm, but to date treatments with convincing effects are lacking.</p><p>Prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) is an endogenous substance released from the vascular endothelium. It is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation and leukocyte-endothelial interactions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A reduced amount of prostacyclin has been found in cerebral vessels in monkeys following SAH, and an imbalance in the prostacyclin-prostaglandin ratio has been proposed as a cause of vasospasm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In vitro studies have demonstrated a relaxing effect of low-dose prostacyclin on cerebral vessels after induced contraction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and animal studies have demonstrated a positive effect of PGI2 on cerebral blood flow in rats with traumatic brain injury
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A limited number of studies exist investigating the possible effects of prostacyclin on cerebral vessels in a clinical setting. A case report has described significant recovery from segmental vasoconstriction in the brain after administration of prostacyclin 0.9&#x02009;ng/kg/min
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In a study of five patients with traumatic brain injury, normalization of ischaemic parameters measured by cerebral microdialysis was seen after administration of low-dose prostacyclin (0.5-1&#x02009;ng/kg/min)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, a randomized, blinded trial of 48 patients with traumatic brain injury was not able to reproduce this effect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>A recent pilot trial from 2009 investigated the effect of low-dose prostacyclin on vasospasm following SAH. In five patients with documented cerebral vasospasm, prostacyclin 0.5&#x02009;ng/kg/min was administered and flow velocities in the medial cerebral artery were subsequently monitored by transcranial Doppler. In all patients, flow velocities decreased markedly as an expression of the resolution of vasospasm

Trial medication is given in addition to standard treatment and is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Epoprostenol 500&#x02009;mg (Flolan R, GlaxoSmithKline) will be obtained and diluted only with original solvent. Solutions of 5,000&#x02009;ng/ml, 10,000&#x02009;ng/ml and 0&#x02009;ng/ml (pure solvent) will be prepared. All solutions are colourless. Trial medications are prepared in syringes, ready for infusion. The syringes are marked with the patient ID, the same infusion rate for all three solutions and date, and are then transported to the neuro-intensive care unit. The infusion rate is determined by patient weight, according to the treatment schedule. Only specially assigned nurses will handle the trial medications until the transport to the neuro-intensive care unit. Thereafter, the trial medication is administered by the nursing staff on duty. Syringes will be kept refrigerated and will be changed every 8&#x02009;h.

Ordinal logistic regression will be performed for the effect on GOS pending the intervention group using the proportional odds approach; the model considers every possible way in which an ordinal scale can be dichotomized, assuming that the odds ratio for a better outcome versus a worse outcome is identical wherever the scale is dichotomized. Each patient contributes to the underlying analyses and we obtain an overall estimate of the shift in outcome across the GOS called a &#x0201c;shift analysis

Mortality and morbidity are not suitable as primary endpoints of a pilot trial due to the required sample size. Clinical parameters, transcranial Doppler, CT angiography, digital subtraction angiography, invasive monitoring and CT perfusion all have their strengths and weaknesses. The ideal parameter would be continuous, non-invasive, specific and easily quantified, but such a parameter does not exist because of the complex nature of vasospasm. Radiographic vasospasm without clinical symptoms is frequent and clinical symptoms (DIND) can be seen without evidence of arterial narrowing. In this trial we have chosen cerebral perfusion as the primary outcome measure as this seems to be a possible surrogate outcome measure with high biological relevance. However, the secondary outcome measures in this explorative trial are also considered important.</p><p>One could argue that in order to attempt to prevent the development of vasospasm, intervention during the entire period at risk (i.e. days 1&#x02013;21) would be reasonable. However, the logistics at our institution do not allow for all patients to be monitored sufficiently for the entire 3-week period. Furthermore, CT perfusion scans must be performed in the day time (and not on weekends) for logistical reasons, and baseline values must be obtained before the intervention is initiated. Consequently, we have chosen to test the interventions in the period with the maximum risk of vasospasm (days 5&#x02013;10).</p><p>The maximum dose of 2&#x02009;ng/kg/min in the present trial is relatively low compared to some other clinical indications for the use of prostacyclin such as pulmonary hypertension, where doses of 20&#x02009;ng/kg/min or more are used. In animal experiments it has been shown, however, that doses in the range of 0.5-2&#x02009;ng/kg/min have physiological effects by improving microcirculation and reducing microvascular permeability in the brain, skeletal muscle and intestines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This has also been shown in the human brain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A previous study suggesting beneficial effects on vasospasm with prostacyclin used doses in the range of 0.5-1&#x02009;ng/kg/min
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These doses also fulfil the theoretical rationale behind the administration of prostacyclin to patients with SAH, to compensate for the decreased endogenous production. A dose of 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;ng/kg/min may therefore be effective and at the same time avoid the well-known adverse effects due to higher doses, such as hypotension, bleeding, abdominal pain and headache, some of which are unacceptable for our trial patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Currently including patients</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RR contributed to the conception and design of the trial, and data acquisition, and drafted the manuscript.
