Previous studies have suggested that fear of a cancer recurrence is clinically relevant in this group of patients and, if not addressed, can lead to distress. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression among various groups of cancer patients. Online mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to reach people unable to attend face-to-face interventions due to limitations such as cancer-related illness, transportation or time constraints. This study aims to (1) examine whether individuals with a melanoma diagnosis are willing to participate and adhere to a 6-week online mindfulness-based intervention and (2) explore potential benefits of the program on fear of cancer recurrence, worries, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness to inform the design of a clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This is a single-site randomised controlled trial of a feasibility study. Seventy-five participants with stage 2c or 3 melanoma will be recruited from a melanoma outpatient clinic and randomised (2:1) either to an online mindfulness-based program (intervention) or to usual care (control). The intervention is a 6-week program specifically developed for this study. It consists of videos describing the concept of mindfulness, short daily guided meditation practices (5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min), automated meditation reminders and instructions for applying mindfulness in daily life to enhance wellbeing. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and at 6-week post-randomisation. Participants in the control group will be given access to the online program at the end of the study. Primary outcomes are overall recruitment; retention; extent of questionnaire completion; and usability and acceptability of, and adherence to, the program. The secondary outcomes are fear of cancer recurrence, worries, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness measured using validated instruments.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This feasibility study will evaluate participants&#x02019; satisfaction with the program and identify barriers to recruitment and adherence. The recruitment and data collection process will highlight methodological aspects to address in the planning of a larger scale study assessing the impact of an online mindfulness-based intervention on fear of cancer recurrence and wellbeing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372103">ACTRN12617000081314</ext-link>.

People who have received treatment for melanoma are up to nine times more likely to develop a new melanoma, and this risk remains elevated for more than 20&#x000a0;years after the initial diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk that the melanoma comes back locally or in another part of the body after it has been treated (i.e. recurrence) is related to the clinical characteristics of the tumour (i.e. thickness, ulceration and spread) and is estimated overall to be 9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thick primaries, ulcerated lesions or regional lymph node metastases, corresponding to stages 2b, 2c, 3 or 4 according to the melanoma TNM staging system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], have a high risk of relapse with 5-year mortality rates of 20&#x02013;80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Fears and concerns about a melanoma recurrence are common among melanoma survivors. In a large multicentre study examining the supportive care needs, anxiety, depression and quality of life among patients diagnosed with melanoma, the main concerns were the risk of recurrence (17%), fear of metastatic disease (17%) and uncertainty regarding outcomes if metastatic disease is detected (16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, a high proportion (72%) of melanoma survivors with a history of at least one diagnosis of melanoma reported clinically relevant fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">FCR is a rational and normal response to a stressful event, but if the fear persists and is not resolved through coping or adaptation, it may lead to psychological distress such as anxiety or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In patients with melanoma, psychological distress is associated with delay in seeking medical advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and poor psychological adjustment, which is related to disease progression through immunological response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">FCR is often viewed as a multidimensional phenomenon, with an emotional component of anxiety and cognitive aspects of worry, preoccupation and intrusive thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Maladaptive information processing styles, such as worrying or ruminating uncontrollably over cancer-related information, were positively correlated with FCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A theoretical formulation of FCR, proposed by Fardell and colleagues, suggests that attentional bias towards worrisome and unhelpful thoughts underlies the association between maladaptive information processing and FCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to this formulation, teaching skills to cultivate attentional flexibility and mindful awareness of thoughts could have therapeutic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These skills are at the core of mindfulness-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Mindfulness is a state of mind in which one pays attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental, curious, accepting and decentred way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this state, thoughts and feelings are observed as temporary events in the mind, instead of a reflection of oneself or reality. Through detached self-observation, individuals learn to reflect on situations and are able to respond in more adaptive ways instead of reacting in an automatic, habitual pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, the practice of observing one&#x02019;s thoughts, emotions and body sensations, with discernment rather than judgment, is believed to be a starting point linking mindfulness practice and psychological wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Supporting this idea, a meta-analysis exploring the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on psychological outcomes demonstrated that mindfulness positively mediates the effects of the interventions on mental health outcomes, such as depression, stress and anxiety, while rumination and worry negatively mediate these same outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In MBIs, the cultivation of mindfulness is practised in two distinct and concurrent ways, namely formal and informal practices. The formal practice of mindfulness meditation can be done in different ways (e.g. walking, movement, sitting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These practices strengthen attention regulation and allow observation of mental habits such as rumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As the practice evolves, the meditator gains clarity of mind and greater awareness of his or her mental and emotional fluctuations, enabling them to alter reactive cognitive and emotional habits related to mental distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Through informal practice, the individual is encouraged to bring a similar approach of awareness to daily activities. Paying attention to the sensory experience of each moment keeps the attention more in the present moment and reduces worry and rumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regular meditation builds the attention foundation for informal practice, and together they lead to increased mindfulness in everyday life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">In oncology settings, a meta-analysis of 22 studies on patients with different cancer types and stages reported moderate benefits of MBIs in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A recent trial demonstrated the efficacy of a MBI in assisting breast cancer survivors to cope with their fear of recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with participants randomly assigned to a 6-week MBI showing significant improvements in FCR.</p><p id="Par20">Besides the growing body of evidence on the benefits of MBI for individuals living with cancer, practical barriers exist that may diminish access to, and participation in, face-to-face programs. Generally, online interventions are more easily accessible, are available at any time to people in their own environment, and enable people to work at their own pace and to remain anonymous. In addition, online MBIs are less costly because they do not necessarily require the involvement of a trained therapist educated in mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a cross-sectional survey of 291 individuals attending a melanoma clinic, 44% of the participants reported interest in participating in an online meditation-based program, indicating that this type of intervention might be acceptable in a similar cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. An online Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery program initially tested for feasibility with distressed participants completing treatment for different types of cancer showed positive effects on mood disturbance, stress symptoms, spirituality and mindfully acting with awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The current study will assess the feasibility of delivering an online mindfulness-based program to patients affected by melanoma. It will examine patterns of usage and content relevance to inform the design of a larger randomised control trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par22">The overall aim of the study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online mindfulness-based program among people who have completed treatment for melanoma.</p><p id="Par23">The primary objective of the study will be to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger scale randomised control trial by evaluating:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">Overall recruitment, retention and questionnaire completion rates</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Adherence to, and usability and acceptability of, the online program</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par26">The secondary objectives will be to assess the potential benefit of the intervention on fear of cancer recurrence, worry, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness compared to a usual-care group and to provide effect size and variance estimates for these outcomes to inform the design of a larger clinical trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par27">The development of the study protocol followed the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The email for the intervention group will also comprise a URL address including the unique study identification number to access the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par36">Participants are randomised (2:1) to the intervention or control group stratified by sex, time since treatment completion (&#x02264;12&#x000a0;months, &#x0003e;12&#x000a0;months), and meditation experience (yes/no). A random sequence will be generated for each one of the eight strata using block randomisation. For every three participants enrolled in each stratum, two will be allocated to the intervention group and one to the control group. Random sequences will be embedded in the online system, ensuring allocation concealment. Study personnel will not have access to the sequences and will be blind to group assignment. After randomisation, participants will be unblinded to group assignment, as the intervention does not allow for blinding. All questionnaires will be completed online, which will reduce the influence of researcher bias. Given the nature of the intervention and the context in which participants are recruited, i.e. outpatient clinic, we cannot rule out the usual risks of bias due to participants not being blinded to treatment allocation. However, in this study, all surveys will be completed online; health practitioners have no involvement in the collection or assessment of any of the trial outcomes. Unequal randomisation, where the number of participants allocated to the intervention group exceeds that in the control group, has been identified as a suitable approach in early-phase studies where the aim is to explore various dimensions of the intervention, such as patterns and frequencies of usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention group&#x02014;online mindfulness-based program</title><p id="Par37">The intervention was developed for the purpose of this study by the authors, including a clinical psychologist (RC) with expertise in delivering mindfulness-based programs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), cancer nurses and researchers (AU, LO, DM, MK and PL) with expertise in developing and evaluating cancer supportive care interventions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]), and a psychology researcher (DA) and website developer (EO) with expertise in developing and evaluating online interventions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]).
