Hence, the use of B cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies as therapy for autoimmune diseases, including MS, has increased in recent years. Previous results with rituximab, the first therapeutic B cell-depleting chimeric monoclonal antibody that showed efficacy in MS clinical trials, encouraged researchers to evaluate the efficacy of a humanized anti-CD20 antibody, ocrelizumab, in MS. A large phase II clinical trial in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) designed to explore the effects of two doses of ocrelizumab (600 mg and 2000 mg) compared with placebo showed a pronounced effect on radiological and relapse-related outcomes. These results were confirmed in two phase III trials (OPERA I and II) that compared the efficacies of ocrelizumab with interferon beta-1a in patients with relapsing MS, and showed decreased annualized relapse rates (46% in OPERA I and 47% in OPERA II), as well as fewer numbers of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (94% in OPERA I and 95% in OPERA II). Notably, ocrelizumab is the first drug to lower rates of clinical and MRI-evidenced progression in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS). The phase III trial (ORATORIO) in patients with PPMS met its primary efficacy endpoint: the percentage of patients with 12-week confirmed disability progression was significantly lower in the active treatment group (32.9%) than in patients receiving placebo (39.3%). In March 2017, this evidence led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve the licence for ocrelizumab (Ocrevus&#x000ae;) as a treatment for MS, as the first treatment approved for PPMS and as the first monoclonal antibody for secondary progressive MS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-CD20 antibodies</kwd><kwd>B-cell therapies</kwd><kwd>ocrelizumab</kwd><kwd>progressive multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1756286418773025"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although multiple sclerosis (MS) was previously considered a T cell-mediated disorder, the evidence that has accumulated over the past couple of decades has implicated B cells in MS pathophysiology.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The increased understanding of the disease process has resulted in the development of B cell-targeting antibodies as potential drugs for both relapsing and progressive forms of MS.

Based on accumulating evidence, B cells participate in the pathogenesis of the disease through this multifunctional mechanism. First, the long-standing recognition of abnormal oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the cerebrospinal fluid are detected in more than 95% of patients with MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The presence of OCBs is associated with an increased risk of MS conversion in patients with clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Antibodies have also been detected within MS lesions, along with B-cell populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>With progression of the disease, a compartmentalization of the pathogenic process within the central nervous system is observed.

In patients with MS, PML is an infection mainly related to the use of natalizumab, although cases associated with other drugs have been described. Regarding monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies, the association between PML and rituximab in the context of rheumatological or lymphoproliferative disorders is well known,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> although no cases of PML have been observed in the MS population treated with this drug. In these other scenarios, the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive drugs, in the case of rheumatological diseases or the state of immunosuppression secondary to lymphoproliferative diseases, has been suggested as a factor related to the appearance of PML under rituximab. No cases of PML were reported in patients treated with ocrelizumab across all clinical studies of the drug; however, 2 months after the approval of ocrelizumab in March 2017 by the FDA, the first case of PML was reported in a patient who had received the first dose of ocrelizumab in April 2017 and developed PML 1 month later. The patient was JC virus-antibody positive and had been treated with natalizumab for 3 years, receiving the last natalizumab infusion in February 2017. Although alarming, this case was thought to be due most likely to the natalizumab-associated carry-over risk of PML.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section11-1756286418773025"><title>Infusion-related reactions</title><p>Infusion-related reactions were more prevalent in ocrelizumab-treated patients (34% [<italic>versus</italic> 10% with interferon beta-1a treatment or placebo] in OPERA I and II; 40% [<italic>versus</italic> 26% with placebo] in ORATORIO).

The potential placement of this drug in the MS therapeutic algorithm could be as a first-line treatment in patients with highly active disease, or in patients with suboptimal responses to other drugs. Regarding the progressive forms, the potential benefits probably could be clearer in patients with early disease and some degree of inflammatory activity, although this is purely speculative.</p><p>Ocrelizumab has already been approved by several medical agencies and currently is under review in countries worldwide. Ocrelizumab received its first global approval on the 28 March 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with RMS or PPMS in the USA.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The EMA has recently also approved ocrelizumab for the treatment of RMS with active disease and early PPMS.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1756286418773025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Anti-CD20 antibody treatment constitutes a distinct, convenient and highly efficacious strategy for treating MS.
