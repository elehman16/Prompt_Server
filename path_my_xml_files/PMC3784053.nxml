Particularly favorable outcomes have been associated with certain population subgroups based on multidimensional assessments and multiple follow-up home visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The positive effects of preventive home visits have been documented with regard to functional and psychosocial parameters and health care utilization. However, the results have been inconsistent. Some studies have not conclusively found that home visit programs are cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of home visit programs in terms of a reduction in the utilization of emergency health services among elderly individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or a delay in their first emergency admission to a hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested that the hospital and institutional costs for subjects receiving home visits were less than those for subjects who were not receiving home visits; however, among subjects receiving home visits, the home care, adult day care, and meals-on-wheels costs were increased, which offset much of the savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most of these trials were conducted in European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the results have varied across national settings and systems.</p><p>Thus, there is no simple answer regarding the effects of home visits or their cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and more evidence is required in various countries and health care settings.</p><p>Japan provides a particularly fertile ground for such studies. First, Japan has become the most aged society worldwide, with a low birth rate and high longevity, and the proportion of elderly individuals aged 65&#x000a0;years or older in the population reached 23.1&#x000a0;% in 2010 and is projected to reach 40.5&#x000a0;% in 2055 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Second, since 2000, the Japanese government has operated a unique system of mandatory public long-term care insurance (LTCI) that is based on social insurance principles that mandate benefits regardless of income or family situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Formal facility-based care (including nursing homes, group homes, and respite care) and community-based care (including adult day care, home aid, home modifications, and partial visiting nursing care) are reimbursed by the LTCI program.</p><p>Finally, Japan provides universal health coverage through employee-based or community-based social health insurance programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In 2010, the proportion of individuals aged 60&#x000a0;years or older who utilized health care services more than once per week was 61.6&#x000a0;%. This proportion is higher than those reported in other countries, such as the United States (24.6&#x000a0;%), Germany (32.9&#x000a0;%), and Sweden (14.6&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Japan faces a challenge inherent in social health insurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or LTCI. Although improving health care by preventing geriatric syndromes and elderly functional decline has been one of the highest priorities, the increasingly aging society ultimately raises the cost of care. In the past decade, several RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] have examined the effects of preventive home visit programs for frail elderly Japanese people, but these studies have not presented outcomes related to health care costs.</p><p>Based on our multidimensional assessment model of preventive home visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we previously reported a RCT that demonstrated that these home visits were effective for improving the functional status and depression among ambulatory frail elderly people with dependency in activities of daily living (ADLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We hypothesized that the preventive home visit program may also be able to reduce health care costs, which is the subject of the present analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a preventive home visit program on health care costs for hospitalizations and outpatient clinic utilization in ambulatory frail elderly people over a 2-year follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Procedure</title><p>A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed in 3 suburban municipalities in Osaka, Japan, and the subjects were followed for 2&#x000a0;years.

The eligibility criteria included the following: (1) age of 65&#x000a0;years or older, (2) certified as Support Level 1 or 2 in the LTCI system, (3) living at home at the time of the baseline survey, and (4) not having utilized formal long-term care services that are reimbursed by the LTCI system in the previous 3&#x000a0;months.

The visits included structured multidimensional interview-based assessments of five key elements: locomotion, daily activities, social contacts or relationships with other people, health conditions, and signs of abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Home visitors documented 40 potential health or psychosocial problems or difficulties and provided recommendations to each individual elder or caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Moreover, hospitalizations that cost more than &#x000a5;500,000 JPY per month were less likely to occur among participants in the home visit group than among participants in the control group.</p><p>The present analysis has shown that the preventive home visit program, which consists of structured multidimensional assessments and recommendations from community health nurses and care managers, may reduce monthly health care costs for ambulatory frail elderly individuals who are certified as needing long-term care services, particularly avoiding costly hospitalizations.</p><p>We previously reported that the current preventive home visit program facilitates the earlier use of public long-term care services among ambulatory frail elderly individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These findings are similar to those of another report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that found lower hospital and institutionalization costs but higher home care and adult day care costs associated with a preventive home visit program. Our interpretation of these results is that the recommendations of home visitors increased the focus on the use of long-term care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which tends to prevent costly hospitalizations. Community health nurses or care managers who visited the study participants were likely able to assess the risks of serious health conditions and provide preventive recommendations, including the use of long-term care services. The use of long-term care services, especially home-based long-term care services, may be effective in preventing serious health conditions because long-term service providers can detect health changes early.</p><p>Moreover, the long-term care costs over the study period, which were &#x000a5;378,010 JPY (approximately $3,780 USD) in the visit group and &#x000a5;273,231 JPY (approximately $2,732 USD) in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], only amounted to approximately 10&#x000a0;% of the total health care costs over the same 2-year period (visit group: &#x000a5;2,016,606 JPY, approximately $20,166 USD; control group: &#x000a5;2,287,450 JPY, approximately $22,875 USD). Since remaining independent in the home is valuable for older people, even if it requires the use of in-home long-term care services, cost-containment approaches should focus on reducing the total health care costs that are incurred by illness or disability (e.g., through the preventive home visit approach) rather than simply reducing the long-term care costs alone.</p><p>The Statistical Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication reported that the average annual per-person health care expenditures for the Japanese population aged 75&#x000a0;years and older were &#x000a5;865,146 JPY (approximately $8,651 USD) in 2008 and &#x000a5;882,118 JPY (approximately $8,821 USD) in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, the total national average health care expenditure over our 2-year study period for each Japanese elder (2008&#x02013;2009) was approximately &#x000a5;1,747,264 JPY (approximately $17,472 USD). This amount is lower than the expenditures for both groups in our analysis (visit group: &#x000a5;2,016,606 JPY, approximately $20,166 USD; control group: 2,287,450 JPY, approximately $22,875 USD), which is consistent with our study participants being frailer and older and requiring more medical care than the general elderly population. In Japan, the 2009 life expectancy at birth was 83&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which is the longest life expectancy in the world; in 2009, health care expenditures comprised 9.5&#x000a0;% of the nation&#x02019;s gross domestic product, which is lower than that in many other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the Japanese health care system seems to work well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, as mentioned previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the proportion of elders in the Japanese population will soon reach more than 40&#x000a0;%, and the number of frail elderly individuals is increasing. These changes are associated with rising health care expenditures for the types of frail elderly people who comprised our study population, which creates a major concern with regard to health care financing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Even though health care costs and those for outpatient clinic utilization in the visit group were lower than those in the control group at most monthly time points of the period, the differences in total health care costs, those for outpatient clinic utilization or those for hospitalization over the period were not statistically significant between groups. This is likely because preventive home visit programs do not show their full effects immediately.</p><p>There are several limitations in the present study. First of all, a limitation of the present study is that we did not have detailed data regarding the exact medical diagnoses and treatments that were reimbursed by health care insurance programs in the outpatient clinics or hospitals for the study participants. In particular, we were unable to evaluate the processes of care or the reasons why the number of costly hospitalizations was reduced in the visit group relative to the control group. Moreover, the average hospital stay in Japanese elders aged 65&#x000a0;years or older is 44&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, some of hospitalizations may have been counted as less than &#x000a5;500,000 JPY in the present study, though they were part of consecutive hospitalizations that actually cost more than &#x000a5;500,000 JPY.</p><p>Second, we were unable to analyze the costs for the small number of participants who had employee-based health insurance or public assistance. The number of older individuals in Japanese metropolitan areas who depend on public assistance is currently increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and they tend to consume a disproportionate amount of medical resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] even though they do not represent the majority of the elderly population.</p><p>Third, our statistical analysis for testing differences of health care costs at each monthly time point may have overestimated statistical significance due to multiple comparisons. In the future, a more rigorous and detailed statistical analysis should be conducted for examining health care costs of preventive home visits.</p><p>A further limitation of our study is that our preventive home visit program is currently adapted to a local government population-based approach rather than a primary care system. Further preventive home visit programs should be tested using elderly medical checkup data assessments or primary care physician assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present second analysis of randomized controlled trial showed that a preventive home visit program can reduce health care costs, primarily from reduced hospitalizations, in addition to providing other major benefits. Further research should be directed toward investigating health care process during preventive home visit. Moreover, we need to develop preventive home visit programs that link better to primary care for ambulatory frail elders living at home.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Japanese elders and their family members for their participation in this study.
