Recent studies indicate that this may pose a risk to pregnant women. Therefore, there is a need to explore screen-and-treat options to minimise iron exposure during pregnancy using an overall lower dosage of iron that would achieve equivalent results as being currently recommended by the WHO. However, there is a lack of agreement on how to best assess iron deficiency when infections are prevalent. Here, we test the use of hepcidin a peptide hormone and key regulator of iron metabolism, as a potential index for &#x02018;safe and ready to receive&#x02019; iron.</p></sec><sec><title>Design/Methods</title><p>This is a 3-arm randomised-controlled proof-of-concept trial. We will test the hypothesis that a screen-and-treat approach to iron supplementation using a pre-determined hepcidin cut-off value of &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;ng/ml will achieve similar efficacy in preventing iron deficiency and anaemia at a lower iron dose and hence will improve safety. A sample of 462 pregnant women in rural Gambia will be randomly assigned to receive: a) UNU/UNICEF/WHO international multiple micronutrient preparation (UNIMMAP) containing 60&#x000a0;mg/d iron (reference arm); b) UNIMMAP containing 60&#x000a0;mg/d iron but based on a weekly hepcidin screening indicating if iron can be given for the next 7&#x000a0;days or not; c) or UNIMMAP containing 30&#x000a0;mg/d iron as in (b) for 12&#x000a0;weeks in rural Gambia. The study will test if the screen-and-treat approach is non-inferior to the reference arm using the primary endpoint of haemoglobin levels at a non-inferiority margin of 0.5&#x000a0;g/dl. Secondary outcomes of adverse effects, compliance and the impact of iron supplementation on susceptibility to infections will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is expected to contribute towards minimising the exposure of pregnant women to iron that may not be needed and therefore potentially harmful. If the evidence in this study shows that the overall lower dosage of iron is non-inferior to 60&#x000a0;mg/day iron, this may help decrease side-effects, improve compliance and increase safety. The potential for the use of hepcidin for a simple point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic for when it is most safe and effective to give iron may improve maternal health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN21955180">ISRCTN21955180</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Hepcidin</kwd><kwd>Anaemia</kwd><kwd>UNIMMAP</kwd><kwd>Lower dose iron</kwd><kwd>Iron deficiency</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UK MRC and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordant agreement</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Anaemia is a global public health problem affecting all population groups, but especially pregnant women and young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For pregnant women, the consequences of anaemia include mortality, poor pregnancy and birth outcomes including premature delivery, low birth weight and increased perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most significant contributor to the onset of anaemia is iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects almost half of the world&#x02019;s pregnant women and pre-school children with a prevalence of over 65&#x000a0;% in Africa and Asia, and that it causes (directly or indirectly) one fourth of all maternal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In The Gambia, iron deficiency anaemia among women and children has been found to be high and of public health significance with 73&#x000a0;% of pregnant women and 56&#x000a0;% of lactating women being anaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although iron deficiency with or without anaemia has important consequences for human health and child development, there has been an absence of international agreement on how best to assess the iron status of populations. Serum ferritin (SF) is one of the few biochemical indices of which low levels reflect depleted iron stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but it is known to be raised by infection and inflammation as it is an acute phase protein and thus has very high false negative rates in least developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar problems also arise with the other commonly used iron status indicators as summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> below.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Limitation of current methods of assessing IDA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Measure</th><th>Limitation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stain bone marrow preparation</td><td>Iron stores</td><td>Expensive, invasive and traumatic</td></tr><tr><td>Haemoglobin (Hb)</td><td>Anaemia</td><td>Does not measure ID per-se</td></tr><tr><td>Serum ferritin (SF)</td><td>Iron stores</td><td>Raised by infection and inflammation</td></tr><tr><td>Zinc protopopherin (ZnPP)</td><td>Iron in new cells</td><td>Affected by infection and inflammation</td></tr><tr><td>Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)</td><td>Severe ID even with inflammation</td><td>Affected by (&#x0003e;) red cell prod.

The potential for hepcidin as a superior marker for iron deficiency has been highlighted in many recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Hepcidin controls iron homeostasis by inhibiting dietary iron absorption, release of iron in the macrophages and reducing iron flow to the erythron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This it does by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin inducing its internalisation and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have noted that over the course of a malaria season, hepcidin integrates signals arising from parasitaemia, inflammation and anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The fact that hepcidin plays a crucial role in the above signals and acts both as a reporter of iron status and a regulator of iron absorption, distribution and metabolism suggests it may be the ideal index for iron deficiency and could form the basis of a PoC diagnostic for iron deficiency in at-risk population groups in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>WHO, originally recommended universal iron supplementation for all pregnant women with a dose of 60&#x000a0;mg iron and 400ug folic acid daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, a recent study has shown that pregnant women who are anaemic and iron deficient may be protected from malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent review also indicate that pregnant women who received daily iron and folic acid supplementation are at a greater risk of haemoconcentration (haemoglobin greater than 130&#x000a0;g/L) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although the effect of the haemoconcentration in the above review was uncertain, Ziaei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of over 700 pregnant women who took 50&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous sulphate daily found that small-for-gestational-age birth rate and the number of women with hypertensive disorders increased significantly. They concluded that routine iron supplementation in non-anaemic women is not rational and may be harmful. Recently, two hazardous complications of pregnancy; gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia have been recognized to be associated with elevated body iron levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>There has been little specific evidence on the relationship between risk of malaria and other infections with iron status and iron supplementation in pregnant women. Yet, the benefits of iron supplementation must be carefully weighed against the risks in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>There is now some evidence that smaller doses of 30&#x000a0;mg iron daily could achieve similar results as the daily 60&#x000a0;mg iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A Cochrane review on the treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] indicated that daily low dose iron supplementation may be effective at treating anaemia in pregnancy with fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared with higher doses. WHO has now recommended the use of doses between 30 and 60&#x000a0;mg for daily supplementation for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Further evidence suggest that the use of multiple micronutrient supplements with three or more micronutrients is associated with a 39&#x000a0;% reduction in maternal anaemia compared with placebo or with two micronutrients or fewer (relative risk 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;61, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;52&#x02014;0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;71). Multiple micronutrient supplementation is also known to result in a decrease in the risk of low-birth weight babies (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;83, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;76&#x02014;0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;91) and small-for-gestational-age babies (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;92, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;86&#x02014;0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;99) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In this proof of concept study we aim to test the hypothesis that a screen-and-treat approach to iron supplementation will achieve similar efficacy in combating ID and IDA at a lower overall dosage of iron. The assumption that lower doses will improve safety and tolerability will also be tested. The design will establish whether using screen-and-treat with UNIMMAP containing either 60&#x000a0;mg or 30&#x000a0;mg iron per day is non-inferior to UNIMMAP containing 60&#x000a0;mg/day as a universal daily supplement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Design/Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is designed as a proof-of-concept, 3-arm, double blind, RCT over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks with a sample of 462 pregnant women randomly assigned to receive: a) UNIMMAP containing 60&#x000a0;mg/day iron; b) UNIMMAP containing 60&#x000a0;mg/day iron but based on a weekly hepcidin screening indicating if iron can be given for the next 7&#x000a0;days or not; c) UNIMMAP containing 30&#x000a0;mg/day iron based on screening as in (b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Determining the hecidin cut-off value</title><p>The hepcidin cut-off of &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;ng/mL as a threshold (to receive iron or not) is based on the analysis of sera from 270 pregnant women participating in the ENID study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] with samples available for 3 time points (12&#x02013;14 weeks, 20&#x000a0;weeks and 30&#x000a0;weeks gestation).

This trial will test the efficacy of employing a screen-and-treat approach to minimise iron exposure whilst achieving a similar therapeutic effect.</p><p>As 50&#x000a0;% of anaemia in pregnancy is assumed to be due to ID, the assessment of iron status (not only anaemia) in supplementation programmes is critical and hepcidin has shown the potential of being an improved bio-marker for iron status and therefore a signal for the safe administration of iron in pregnancy. In this study we will explore this potential of hepcidin with a pre-determined cut-off value of &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;ng/ml to screen for the readiness to receive iron. When iron is needed, we will supplement using oral, tablet form UNIMMAP formulation containing 60&#x000a0;mg iron daily (universal) on one hand or provide 60 or 30&#x000a0;mg iron daily only when hepcidin levels are below the threshold cut-off value mentioned above (screen-and-treat). We hypothesise that a screen-and-treat approach to iron supplementation will achieve similar efficacy in combating ID and IDA at a lower overall dosage of iron as therapy will be targeted to periods when the enterocyte iron absorption channels are open. We assume that lower doses will improve safety and tolerability and these will be tested as secondary outcomes.</p><p>In summary, this trial will contribute towards minimising exposure to excessive iron that may not be needed and may indeed be harmful and allow the pregnant woman to maximise the absorption and utilisation of iron when it is most needed. In addition, the overall lower dosage may help decrease side-effects and increase compliance. The exploration of hepcidin as a potential for a simple PoC diagnostic to screen for the readiness to receive iron will assist health workers to make the right decisions for iron supplementation which will help in improving health care delivery and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality as part of efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goal 5 and the forthcoming Sustainable Health Agenda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AGP, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; CRF, case report form; CRP, C-reactive protein; DSM, Dutch State Mines; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FA, field assistant; FACS, florescence-activated cell sorting; FW, field worker; GMP, good manufacturing practice; Hb, haemoglobin; ID, iron deficiency; IDA, iron deficiency anaemia; LLINs, long lasting insecticide-treated nets; MRC- ING, Medical Research Council International Nutrition Group; MRC, Medical Research Council; represents Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia; PoC, point of care; RCH, reproductive and child health; RCT, andomised control trial; RDT, rapid diagnostic test; SAT, transferrin saturation; SCC, Scientific Coordinating Committee; SF, serum ferritin; sTfR, soluble transferrin receptors; TM, trial monitor; UNIMMAP, UNICEF/WHO/UNU International Multiple Micronutrient Preparation; WHO, World Health Organisation; WIMM, Weatherall Insttitute of Molecular Medicine </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The trial will not be possible without the funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the MRC-ING.
