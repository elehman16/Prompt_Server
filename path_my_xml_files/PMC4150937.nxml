Supplementing women with antioxidants during pregnancy may reduce oxidative stress and thereby prevent or delay the onset pre-eclampsia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementing vitamin C in pregnancy on the incidence of pre-eclampsia, at Mulago hospital, Kampala, Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a (parallel, balanced randomization, 1:1) placebo randomized controlled trial conducted at Mulago hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Participants included in this study were pregnant women aged 15-42 years, who lived 15 km or less from the hospital with gestational ages between 12-22 weeks. The women were randomized to take 1000mg of vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) or a placebo daily until they delivered. The primary outcome was pre-eclamsia. Secondary outcomes were: severe pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, low birth weight and still birth delivery. Participants were 932 pregnant women randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1. The participants, the care providers and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to the study allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 932 women recruited; 466 were randomized to the vitamin and 466 to the placebo group. Recruitment of participants was from November 2011 to June 2012 and follow up was up to January 2013. Outcome data was available 415 women in the vitamin group and 418 women in the placebo group.</p><p>There were no differences in vitamin and placebo groups in the incidence of pre-eclampsia (3.1% versus 4.1%; RR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.37-1.56), severe pre-eclampsia (1.2% versus 1.0%; RR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.34-4.65), gestational hypertension(7.7% versus 11.5%; RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.43-1.03), preterm delivery (11.3% versus 12.2%; RR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.63-1.34), low birth weight (11.1% versus 10.3%; RR 1.07; 95% CI: 0.72-1.59) and still birth delivery (4.6% versus 4.5%; RR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.54-1.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Supplementation with vitamin C did not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia nor did it reduce the adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. We do not recommend the use of vitamin C in pregnancy to prevent pre-eclampsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201210000418271 on 25<sup>th</sup> October 2012.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] especially in low resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pre-eclampsia, defined by hypertension and proteinuria, is a multisystem disorder which is associated with, neurological disturbances, haematological disturbances, liver disease, and abnormal renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pre-eclampsia affects 2-10% of all pregnancies and may be higher in low resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Severe pre-eclampsia may result in serious complications like eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome although these complications are rare. In a study conducted in Mulago hospital, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia contributed to 12% maternal deaths among women admitted with severe maternal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pre-eclampsia contributes to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia contributed to 5.4% perinatal deaths and 24% of intrauterine growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and is associated with 25.8% of preterm births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].Small-for-gestational age babies are associated with health risks later in life like obesity and insulin resistance, which may manifest as hypertension and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Preterm delivery is associated with neonatal and infant mortality. Preterm infants are more prone to respiratory complications like respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the new born and persistent pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Antioxidants are essential in maintaining cellular integrity in normal pregnancy by reducing lipid peroxidation reactions. Thus they protect proteins, enzymes, and cells from destruction by peroxides. Antioxidant defense mechanisms include intracellular and extracellular enzymes (viz. catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), free radical scavengers (vitamin C &#x00026; E, caretenoids, glutathione and serum albumin) and metabolites (bilirubin and uric acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology of pre-eclampsia is unknown. There is incomplete trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which lead to abnormal placental development and, placental hypo perfusion and ischemia. Women with pre-eclampsia have increased oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], increased markers of oxidative stress like, 8-iso-prostaglandinF<sub>2&#x003b1;,</sub> lipid peroxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and, have low plasma and placental concentration of antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This has led to the hypothesis that placental hypo perfusion may promote a state of oxidative stress in which there is a release of factors to the maternal circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The factors include, lipid peroxides, cytokines and syncitiotrophoblast microvillus fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] which are highly reactive molecules that consume the antioxidants.</p><p>Oxidative stress combined with an exaggerated inflammatory response may result in the release the maternal factors that cause endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Endothelial cell dysfunction is responsible for the clinical signs of pre-eclampsia like hypertension and protienuria. Response to oxidative stress depends on availability of low density lipoproteins, genetic predisposition, immune mal-adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and dietary deficiency of antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Supplementation with antioxidants may modify the women&#x02019;s response to oxidative stress and therefore limit the systemic and utero-placental endothelial damage observed in pre-eclampsia.</p><p>Vitamin C scavenges free radicals in aqueous solution and may have a role in the management of pre-eclampsia. Studies show that vitamin C may be protective against development of pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Supplementation with vitamin C and E reduces oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and, pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, subsequent studies have not confirmed this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Most of these studies were conducted in high resource settings where the nutritional status of the women is high.</p><p>The purpose of this study therefore was to evaluate the effects of vitamin C supplementation on the occurrence of pre-eclampsia in a low resource setting where the nutritional status of the women is low and most pregnant women are deficient in vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a (parallel, balanced randomization, 1:1,) placebo controlled trial conducted from November 2011 to January 2013, in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants included in this study were pregnant women aged 15-42 years, lived 15 km or less from the hospital with gestational ages between 12-22 weeks. Women were excluded if they had hypertension, renal diseases or diabetes mellitus, were taking vitamin C supplements of &#x0003e;200 mg/day or had contraindications to vitamin C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>This study was conducted at Mulago Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Mulago Hospital is a National Referral Hospital for Uganda and a Teaching Hospital for Makerere University College of Health Sciences. In Uganda about 90% of the women attend antenatal clinic at least once during pregnancy. Mulago hospital delivers about 22,000 women annually and about 50,000 women attend antenatal clinic in 1 year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p>The women were randomized in one of the two treatment arms using computer generated random numbers in a ratio of 1:1. The women allocated to the vitamin arm were advised to take a tablet of 1000 mg of vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) daily until they delivered. The women allocated to the placebo arm were advised to take a placebo tablet (micro-crystalline cellulose) daily which was identical to the vitamin tablets in shape, color and size. They were to swallow the tablets daily and leave the unused tablets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Eligible women were identified from the antenatal clinic by research assistants who were trained midwives. The women were conducted through an informed consent procedure and gave a written informed consent. The women were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics, medical and family history, and their present and past obstetric performances. A thorough clinical and obstetrical examination was done, weight was taken and height measured. A mid upper arm circumference was measured by a trained assistant. Blood was drawn for complete blood counts, renal and liver function tests and HIV screening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Follow up</title><p>All the women were followed until they delivered. The study participants received care according the Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines. Routine visits were done by the research team every four weeks until the women delivered. If a woman missed the scheduled visit she was contacted by telephone and visited at her home and, if necessary was transported to hospital for evaluation by the study physicians. During the routine assessments the women were asked about compliance with the study medication, condition of their health, and if they had visited other heath facilities and the medications they had taken. In addition they had a focused history and, obstetric examination using a standard clinical record form. At each visit the blood pressure of the women was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Two blood pressure measurements were taken and an average was obtained. If a woman had a high blood pressure a mid-stream urine sample was collected for protein estimation using a dipstick. All the women received oral iron and folic acid supplements which they took daily and, de-worming tablets and intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria according to the Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines.</p><p>The women who developed hypertension were managed according to the protocol of the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end point was development of pre-eclampsia in the mother. The secondary outcomes were development of severe pre-eclamsia and gestational hypertension in the mother and, in the infant were low birth weight, still birth delivery and preterm delivery.</p><p>Pre-eclampsia was defined as described by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Under this classification, hypertension was defined as a blood pressure of &#x02265;140/90 mmHg measured with a woman in a sitting position using a mercury sphygmomanometer. The blood pressure was repeated after 4 hrs. Significant proteinuria was taken as &#x02265;2+ protein on dipstick of mid stream urine or catheter specimen urine if membranes were ruptured on two urine specimens 4 hrs or more apart. Pre-eclampsia was taken as hypertension with significant proteinuria, after 20 weeks gestation.</p><p>A woman was taken to have severe pre-eclampsia if she developed one or more of the following: a blood pressure of &#x02265;160 mmHg systolic or &#x02265;110 mmHg diastolic, &#x02265;3+ protein by dipstick on two urine samples taken four hours or more apart, visual disturbances, frontal or any type of headache, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, pulmonary oedema or cyanosis, abnormal liver function, low platelets, oliguria of less than 500 ml in 24 hours and fetal growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Gestational hypertension was defined as hypertension which developed after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman who previously had a normal blood pressure and the blood pressure reverted to normal after delivery.</p><p>Low birth weight was defined as delivery of a baby whose birth weight was less than 2500 gm. A still birth was defined as delivery of a baby which died in uterus after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm delivery was taken as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p>We assumed that supplementation with vitamin C would lower the risk of pre-eclampsia by 50% compared to a placebo. We estimated the risk of pre-eclampsia to be 10% in the placebo arm based on the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and Mulago Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology annual reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Supplementation with high doses of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. This is in contrast with an earlier study by Chappell and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] which investigated the effect of 1000&#x02009;mg of vitamin C and 400&#x02009;IU of vitamin E on 239 women from 18-22 weeks gestation until delivery on the risk of pre-clamspia. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was 8% in the supplemented group versus 17% in the placebo group. However, in this study pre-eclampsia was a secondary outcome and the study was stopped early because the interim analysis indicated that there was significant improvement in the markers of endothelial activation which was the primary outcome and thus there were only 79 women in the vitamin group who completed the study versus 142 in the placebo arm. There could have been type I error since the sample size was small.</p><p>The other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in which vitamin C was shown to be of benefit were epidemiological studies. Zhang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] conducted a case-control study in which women with a low intake of vitamin C were at an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. There could have been a recall bias by the women and the study design could not establish a cause-effect relationship. Similarly, Klemmensen and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] conducted a prospective population based cohort study in which women with a low dietary intake of vitamin C were found to have an increased risk of severe forms of pre-eclampsia. There could have been a misclassification of pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive diseases in pregnancy since the case ascertainment were a self report by the women. There could have also been a recall bias by the women on the food consumption and hence the evaluations of the vitamin C intake may not have been accurate.</p><p>However, the finding in our study is in agreement with what found by other researchers about use of antioxidants to prevent pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Beazley and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] studied the use of antioxidants among women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. They did not find a difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia among women who received antioxidants and placebo group. However, this study was terminated early because of lack of funding and the required sample size was not realized. Rumbold and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] studied low risk women with a high nutritional status in which high dose vitamin C and vitamin E were given from second trimester until delivery. There was no reduction in pre-eclampsia between the two groups. In this study, the women&#x02019;s baseline intake of vitamin supplements was above the recommended daily intake. In a study by Poston and collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], women who were at an increased risk of pre-eclampsia were supplemented with high doses of vitamin C and vitamin E from the second trimester until they delivered. There was no reduction in the incidence of pre-eclampsia between the two groups.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been shown to play a role in the aetiology of pre-eclapmsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and women with pre-eclampsia have increased markers of oxidative stress in the plasma and in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, results from this study and others indicate that use of high doses of antioxidants during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. The explanation for this finding may be that while oxidative stress is present in women with pre-eclampsia, it may not play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disorder. It may also be possible that oxidative stress plays a role only in a subgroup of women with no appreciable effect on the general population. It also is possible that the women in our study had sufficient concentrations of vitamin C at trial entry. We based our assumptions on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] in which most women were deficient of vitamin C. However, doses of vitamin C of 400 mg per day or higher result in plasma and tissue saturation and produces a steady-plasma concentration. When vitamin C doses of 500 mg per day or higher are given, the extra absorbed vitamin C is excreted to produce a steady plasma and tissue concretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Even in women who were at high risk of pre-eclampsia and nutritionally deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the antioxidants did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.</p><p>In this paper the rate of severe pre-eclampsia was similar in intervention and placebo groups. This is similar to what was found in other studies among high risk women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and women at low risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Similarly the rate of gestational hypertension did not differ between the intervention and placebo group. This is in agreement with was found by Villar and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in high risk women but is in contrast to what was found by Poston and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in high risk women and Roberts and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] in low risk women in which women who took antioxidants were more likely to develop gestational hypertension than the controls. In addition, Poston and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Rumbold and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found that women who took antioxidants were more likely to use antihypertensive therapy than controls. This was probably due to chance, but antioxidants may promote DNA oxidation through an interaction between vitamin C and metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] leading lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress and, may produce mutagenic lesions in DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>In our study the low birth weight delivery rate was similar in the both the vitamin and placebo groups. This is in agreement with a study by Roberts and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] in low risk women and Spinnato and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and, Villar and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in high risk women, in which the rates of low birth weight delivery was similar in the antioxidant and placebo group. But it differs from what was found by Poston and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in high risk women in which women who were supplemented with antioxidants were more likely to deliver low birth weight babies than the controls. This could be because the women who took supplements developed pre-eclampsia earlier and hence delivered at an earlier gestational age. An earlier study showed that vitamin C supplements given during pregnancy were associated with preterm delivery than controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] although this did not translate in poorer neonatal outcomes. However, this was more likely to be a chance finding as more women in this group had a previous history of miscarriage and ante partum haemorrhage.</p><p>In our study preterm delivery was similar between the intervention and control groups. This is similar to what was found in another study of intervention with antioxidants in high risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and low risk women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The rate of still birth delivery was similar in intervention and control group. This similar to what was found by Roberts and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and Rumbold and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in low risk women and by Spinnato and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and by Villar and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in high risk women. However, post hoc analyses in the Rumbold and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] study showed more still birth delivery in women who took antioxidants than the controls. However, the still birth rate was extremely high among women in this study. This could have been be due to delay of the women to reach the hospital after labour had started and institutional delay especially for women who needed caesarean section as the waiting time on average was 4-6 hours.</p><p>The other maternal outcomes (viz. ante partum haemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, abruption placentae, mode of delivery) and neonatal outcomes (viz., apgar score, admission to the baby neonatal unit, early neonatal death) did not differ between the intervention and placebo groups.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was conducted in the national referral hospital and some findings may not be generalized to all pregnant women in Uganda. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was lower than was initially anticipated. This could have led to estimation of a smaller sample size. Therefore the results should be interpreted with caution as they may not be generalized to all pregnant women because of type II error. However, this study has enabled us to establish the effects of vitamin C supplementation on other pregnancy outcomes in Uganda.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Supplementation with high dose vitamin C did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia nor did it reduce the risk of low birth weight delivery, still birth delivery and preterm delivery in low risk women with poor nutritional status in our institution.
