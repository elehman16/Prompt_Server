<italic>Background</italic>. It is currently recommended that diet of pregnant mothers contain 200&#x02013;300&#x02009;mg&#x02009;DHA/day. <italic>Aim</italic>. To determine whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy and lactation affects infants' immune response. <italic>Methods</italic>. 60 women in &#x02265;3rd pregnancy studied; 30 randomly assigned to receive DHA 400&#x02009;mg/day from 12th week gestation until 4 months postpartum. From breast-fed infants, blood obtained for anti-HBs antibodies, immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subset phenotyping, and intracellular cytokine production. <italic>Results</italic>. CD4+ lymphocytes did not differ between groups, but CD4CD45RA/CD4 (na&#x000ef;ve cells) significantly higher in infants in DHA+ group. Proportion of CD4 and CD8 cells producing IFN<sub><italic>&#x003b3;</italic></sub> significantly lower in DHA+ group, with no differences in proportion of IL4-producing cells. Immunoglobulins and anti-HBs levels did not differ between groups. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. In infants of mothers receiving DHA supplementation, a higher percentage of CD4 na&#x000ef;ve cells and decreased CD4 and CD8 IFN<sub><italic>&#x003b3;</italic></sub> production is compatible with attenuation of a proinflammatory response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Breast feeding is believed to confer protection against infections during infancy. Breast-fed infants have an enhanced local humoral immune response, resulting in a lower prevalence of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections than in formula-fed infants [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Exclusive breast feeding for the first few months has also been suggested to be protective against the development of atopic disease [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Immunoglobulins, lymphocytes, proteins like lactoferrin, and lysozyme, which are present in breast milk, play a specific immunologic role. Another component, which may be of pivotal importance to maturation and function of the immune system, is the fatty acid pattern of the milk. Human milk contains long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) (20&#x02013;22 carbons) of both w-3 and w-6 classes which constitute ~2% of total fatty acids and which are undetectable in unsupplemented formulas prepared from vegetable oils. RBC membrane phospholipids of breast-fed infants have a significantly higher percentage of w-3 fatty acids (FA) and specifically a twofold higher level of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 w-3) than infants fed by nonsupplemented formula, with similar membrane levels of arachidonic acid (AA) (C 20:4 w-6) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The balanced ratio of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids and those derived from w3 fatty acids has been suggested to play a crucial role in immune modulation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In infants who are breast fed, supply of these fatty acids is dependent on the maternal diet [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Western diet contains large amounts of w-6 FA but is relatively low in w-3 FA. Maternal DHA status depends mainly on intake of DHA itself as conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 w-3), present in nuts and other vegetable oils, into DHA is low. Levels of maternal DHA decline during pregnancy and decrease even further when the lactation period is extended [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Maternal DHA levels decline with multiple pregnancies; levels have been shown to be significantly lower in multiparous compared with primiparous mothers and when pregnancies are closely spaced. Furthermore, levels of DHA in breast milk correlate with DHA blood levels [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>The high demand for DHA has prompted current recommendations that during pregnancy and lactation the average dietary intake of DHA should be 200&#x02013;300&#x02009;mg per day [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, recent studies have established that the diet of Western pregnant and lactating women contains only 20%&#x02013;60% of the w-3 FA recommended daily intake. In 90% of the women surveyed, DHA intake was far below the recommended requirement [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies relating to the immune system in infants have compared infants fed human milk with infants fed either LCPUFA-supplemented or nonsupplemented formulas [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In pregnant women receiving a DHA&#x02009;+&#x02009;EPA preparation, from the 22nd gestational week, maternal blood mRNA levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and IL1) were decreased, whereas, in cord blood, levels of Th2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) were decreased [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. No studies have examined the effect of maternal DHA supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the infants' immune system.</p><p>We therefore questioned whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy and lactation, in a population with a high percentage of multiparous mothers with closely spaced pregnancies, may affect the humoral and cellular immune response in infants solely breast-fed up to the age of 4 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

DHA supplementation was taken daily from the 12th week of gestation and continued until the end of the 4th postpartum month. Mothers who were not assigned to the DHA supplementation group declined intake of placebo capsules on religious grounds, as the gelatin capsules are not &#x0201c;kosher&#x0201d;, but since the DHA was regarded by the religious leaders of the community as a medication, intake of DHA capsules was permitted. In the DHA-supplementation group, 18 mothers were in their 3rd-4th pregnancy, 11 were in their 5th&#x02013;7th pregnancy, and 1 was in her 8th. In the control group, 17 mothers were in their 3rd-4th pregnancy, 11 in the 5th&#x02013;7th, and 2 in the &#x02265;8th pregnancy. </p><p>A nutritional intake questionnaire, with an emphasis on type of cooking oil used, amount and type of fish, and/or nuts consumed, was filled out by all mothers. </p><p>Infants were exclusively breast-fed for 4 months.

Of CD4 cells the fraction of CD45RA+ cells, representing na&#x000ef;ve helper cells, was significantly higher in the DHA-supplemented group than in the nonsupplemented group. Although total population of CD8 cells was lower in DHA-supplemented infants, the proportion of CD8+CD45RO+ activated cells was significantly higher, constituting 35% of CD8 cells as compared with 16% in the nonsupplemented group. In both CD4 and CD8 cells, the production of IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> was found to be markedly lower in lymphocytes of the infants in the DHA-supplemented group. </p><p>Infants of both groups resided in the same neighborhood and were likely exposed to similar environmental antigens and infectious hazards. The differences in the level of lymphocyte subsets between the two groups of babies can therefore not be attributed to a different degree of bacterial or viral exposure. </p><p>Field et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have previously studied the immune consequences of adding arachidonic acid (ARA) and DHA to preterm formula-fed infants as compared with human milk-fed preterm infants. At 42 days of age, the lymphocyte subset population in infants receiving an LCPUFA-fortified formula showed an increase in the proportion of CD4CD45RO+ cells and CD8CD45RO+ cells over that present in peripheral blood of formula-fed infants, a lymphocyte subset pattern more consistent with that observed in infants fed human milk. Activation of IL2, a major proinflammatory cytokine, measured indirectly based on the amount of SIL-2R produced by peripheral mononuclear cells, was noted to be lower in LCP-fed infants with levels comparable to those in human-milk-fed infants. This observed decrease in IL2 activation is in agreement with other studies both in vitro and in vivo (animals and adults) that have demonstrated that LCPUFA reduce IL2 production [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Production of TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, another proinflammatory cytokine, from mononuclear cells, has also been shown to decrease in adults receiving LCPUFA [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A recent study has demonstrated decreased release of IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-induced protein from airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus, when incubated with DHA [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p> In a study conducted in children aged 5&#x02013;7 years consuming a diet with low DHA intake, adding ARA and DHA (14&#x02013;21&#x02009;mg/day) for a 7-month period did not lead to any changes in relative proportion of CD4 and CD8 cells, in non-stimulated whole blood.</p><p>Furthermore, IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, following exposure to various stimulants/mitogens, did not differ in the LCPUFA-supplemented group [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study, in older children aged 8&#x02013;12 years, reached different conclusions regarding the effect of w-3 FA on cytokine production. In children receiving 300&#x02009;mg fish oil (+700&#x02009;mg canola oil) per day for 12 weeks, peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated in absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide stimulation exhibited a nonspecific enhancement of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory down regulatory cytokine production [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Notably, while some in vitro and in vivo studies, in animal models and adults, have also noted that LCPUFA induce an increase of TNF, IL1, and IL2 production, others have failed to show any effect of different doses of fish oil on production of these cytokines [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. </p><p>Most studies have assayed the level of cytokines present in supernatants of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymphocyte cultures. In our study, utilization of a technique for the intracellular staining of cytokines enabled us to determine the selective origin of cytokines, whether from CD4 or CD8 cells. </p><p>DHA supplementation did not exert an effect on the humoral immune response. Infants in both groups did not differ in levels of immunoglobulins of IgG, IgM, and IgA class.</p><p>Specific antibody response as reflected by measuring the titer of antibodies to HBsAg after 2 doses of vaccine (at 2 days and at 1 month of age) was similar in both groups. </p><p>All infants in our study were exclusively breast fed for the first 4 months of age. As for the diet of the mothers taking part in the study, they all ate at least 2 servings of fish per week, cooked with canola oil, which is rich in w-3 FA, and added olive oil as salad dressing. A recent consensus statement regarding dietary fat intake for pregnant and lactating women has concluded that &#x0201c; the desired average intake of at least 200&#x02009;mg DHA/day can be reached with the consumption of one to two portions of sea fish per week&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, their dietary intake of DHA may be considered as adequate.</p><p>Our study is unique in that it questioned whether additional DHA supplementation to breast-feeding mothers who are consuming a diet supposedly sufficient in DHA content would affect the immune response of their infants. </p><p>DHA supplementation during pregnancy and lactation did not result in changes in the infants' humoral immune response, as assessed by levels of anti-HBs antibodies and total immunoglobulins, but did affect lymphocyte subset profile and cytokine production.</p><p>A lymphocyte profile with a higher percentage of CD4 na&#x000ef;ve cells and decreased IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> production in both CD4 and CD8 cells is likely compatible with attenuation of a proinflammatory response.</p><p>Local expression of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and TNF, has been shown, in animal models, to worsen damage as incurred, for example, during ischemic strokes [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Dampening of the proinflammatory response may thus serve to limit tissue damage during infectious and noninfectious inflammatory situations. Yet it is noteworthy that although interferon-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is considered to be an important proinflammatory cytokine produced by Th1 lymphocytes and by natural killer cells, mediating both innate and adaptive immune response, recent observations indicate that IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> may exert suppression of the immune response and may play a role in the induction of tolerance.</p><p>IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> has been shown to modulate T-cell activation by reducing T-cell proliferation and survival and by increasing the number of regulatory T cells (Foxp3+ Treg cells) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> also stimulates the expression of inhibitory B7 family molecules, which in turn may abate the production of Th1 T cells [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, the immunological consequences of the striking decrease in IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> production in both CD4 and CD8 cells cannot be simply predicted. As for the observed higher percentage of cytotoxic activated CD8 cells, these may play a facilitatory role in encountering of viral infections. </p><p>The clinical implications of the changes observed are as yet speculative, and whether supplementation of DHA to breast-feeding mothers confers an advantage to their infants remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title> Authors' Contribution</title><p>E.
