However, only a few patients are considered cured so far, most likely due to the nature of the disease.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Recent data have indicated that the myeloma cell hierarchy includes resistant circulating clonal memory B cells, which differ considerably from the classical end stage plasma cells, infiltrating the bone marrow. The pathophysiological significance of these cells is unknown, but hypothetically they may serve as &#x0201c;sleeping&#x0201d; myeloma stem cells responsible for and &#x0201c;feeding&#x0201d; post-treatment relapse and disease progression.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The clinical impact of these cells needs to be evaluated by <italic>in vivo</italic> targeted therapy. Therefore, we initiated a randomized phase II multicenter trial comparing induction therapy by cyclophosphamide plus dexamethasone with and without fludarabine, a DNA repair inhibitor. Fludarabine, 9-&#x003b2;-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine, is an analog to adenosine cytotoxic against dividing and resting cells.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> <italic>In vivo</italic>, the combination of a DNA damaging agent, e.g. adriamycine or cyclophosphamide combined with fludarabine is clinically active against B cells in CLL and low-grade follicular lymphomas.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although it has been documented active against leukemia and lymphoma, only recent data has suggested efficacy in MM. In a previous open phase II pilot study, we have documented that addition of fludarabine to induction therapy is clinically feasible with only minor toxicity. A beneficial clinical outcome was suggested including a reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) following the addition of fludarabine.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, one concern during the trial design discussion was the adverse impact of fludarabine on stem cell harvest experienced in advanced CLL,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which, however, was not considered in untreated patient treatment.</p><p>The main objective of the subsequent NMSG n.13/03 phase II trial was to generate data on toxicity, safety and efficacy by adding fludarabine to standard induction therapy.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the close follow-up of the patient cohort it was decided to perform an interim analysis, which concluded that fludarabine in the experimental arm inhibits stem cell mobilization capacity and reduced the number of patients reaching high-dose therapy and the trial was stopped. Consequently, fludarabine in combination with alkylating agents should not be administrated as up-front therapy, if high-dose therapy supported by autologous transplantation is standard care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Approval and patient eligibility</title><p>The scientific protocols were reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committees in Denmark and the Danish Drug Agency (Sagsnr.

However, in the experimental arm this was only the case for 11/17 patients as 6 patients were stopped before or following the first cycle of therapy (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Three of these patients did not start therapy, suggesting bias from the clinician, for whom the therapy arm was not blinded. Such a bias may be the result from the relative intensive dosage of fludarabine administrated in this trial of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> PO for three days in each of two cycles, compared to our previous trial<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> where we administered a dose of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for five days. Following discussions within NMSG the protocol group selected oral administration over three days attempting to reach an equivalent total dose of fludarabine as used previously. Our previous experience<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> administrating a total dosage of 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> fludarabine over five days was moderate neutropenia, no thrombocytopenia or severe infectious episodes. We observed all 9 of the fludarabine-treated patients responding to treatment with 2 complete remissions and 7 partial remissions, compared to 5 responders (all PR) in the control-arm. Furthermore, the effect on the blood circulating myeloma compartments identified a significant reduction of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and myeloma plasma cells in the fludarabine-arm, concluding that fludarabine therapy in MM was feasible with a potential clinical efficacy. However, in the current trial, unexpected side effects were initially observed which may explain the drop-out of the 6 patients (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) before the end of induction therapy.</p><p>

Successful mobilization to reach the level of &#x0003e;10 CD34<sup>+</sup> cells per microliter blood triggered leukapheresis and was obtained in 11/17 patients in arm A but only in 4/17 patients in arm B (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This difference was significant at the interim analysis performed by an independent group of experts and the decision was taken to stop the trial. Comparison of the total and average number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells harvested did not reveal differences in patients actually undergoing apheresis. The situation concerning published data about the adverse impact of fludarabine on stem cell harvest is now clearer. In a survey of advanced CLL from 122 centers of the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), it was concluded that attention should be given to the timing of mobilization with respect to the last dose of fludarabine.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This has been further supported by a study of B-CLL after front-line treatment with fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day) both given orally for five consecutive days in six monthly courses. After evaluation performed two months after the last course, responding patients were considered for PBPC collection.
