We contaminated the potential temporal cues from natural accommodative microfluctuations by presenting uncorrelated external (screen) temporal defocus noise that combined with the retinal image effects of natural microfluctuations. A polychromatic Maltese spoke pattern thus either modulated defocus at a combination of two temporal frequencies (on-screen noise condition) or was static (control condition). The on-screen conditions were combined with step changes in optical vergence that were randomized in direction and magnitude. Five subjects monocularly viewed stimuli through a Badal optical system in a Maxwellian view. An artificial 4-mm aperture was imaged at the entrance pupil of the eye. Wavefront aberrations were measured dynamically at 50 Hz using a custom Shack&#x02013;Hartmann aberrometer. Dynamic changes in the Zernike defocus term with step changes in optical vergence were analyzed. We calculated the percentage of correct directional responses for 1, 2, and 3 D accommodative and disaccommodative step stimuli using preset criteria for latency, velocity, and persistence of the response. The on-screen noise condition reduced the percent-correct responses compared to the static stimulus, suggesting that this manipulation affected the detectability of the sign of the accommodative stimulus. Several possible reasons and implications of this result are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>accommodation</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>microfluctuations</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>accommodation control</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>aberration</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Young prepresbyopic eyes can accommodate or disaccommodate to focus on objects at various distances within the far point. Autofocusing on targets that step nearer or further than the baseline, based only on the signals from retinal blur due to optical vergence, has generally been referred to as reflex accommodation. In the natural environment, combinations of several binocular, monocular, and other spatial cues like size, disparity, and chromatic and monochromatic aberrations might contribute to estimates of the sign of defocus of the object of interest.</p><p>Accommodative microfluctuations, commonly seen in prepresbyopes, have been hypothesized to play a potential role in extracting directional (or odd-error) information by acting as a temporal cue (Alpern, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Alpern1" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>; Charman &#x00026; Heron, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Crane, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Crane1" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Kotulak &#x00026; Schor, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kotulak1" ref-type="bibr">1986a</xref>); however, that hypothesis is untested. Microfluctuations have also been proposed to maintain an optimal mean level of focus during accommodation (Charman &#x00026; Heron, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Winn, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Winn1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The suggested mechanism for both these potential roles for microfluctuations is to assess the contrast of the retinal image over time, and perform contrast discrimination between the peak and the trough of the micro-contrast fluctuations to direct the focus behavior of the system (Alpern, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Alpern1" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>; Kotulak &#x00026; Schor, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kotulak1" ref-type="bibr">1986a</xref>).</p><p>The nature and characteristics of microfluctuations have been studied for many decades (for detailed reviews, see Charman &#x00026; Heron, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

He considered a role for microfluctuations in the detection of stimulus direction by trial and error, but rejected it. Arguments for the even-error (or unsigned) nature of the accommodation system have come from Stark and Takahashi (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>), who found that their subjects responded at chance level to step stimuli in conditions with minimal binocular and monocular spatial cues. Additional support for the even-error theory comes from the work of Troelstra, Zuber, Miller, and Stark (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Troelstra1" ref-type="bibr">1964</xref>) and Phillips and Stark (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). The odd-error (or signed) theory has been discussed by others (Smithline, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Smithline1" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>), and the origin and role for high-temporal frequency (Campbell, Westheimer, &#x00026; Robson, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Campbell4" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>) versus low-temporal frequency (Charman &#x00026; Heron, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Charman2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Denieul &#x00026; Corno-Martin, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Denieul2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Winn, Charman, Pugh, Heron, &#x00026; Eadie, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Winn2" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) components of microfluctuations have been investigated, discussed, and debated, but little has emerged in terms of their role in detection of direction.</p><p>The subject of this paper was thus the longstanding broad question of whether the accommodation system derives a temporal directional cue from accommodative microfluctuations in young prepresbyopic subjects. The practicality of the possibility that the system might be sampling focus state to direct focusing behavior is attractive. However, it is interwoven with the difficulty of controlling factors that control either microfluctuations (see above) or accommodation, while studying the influence of one over the other. Earlier studies on accommodative microfluctuations in the detection of accommodation direction or control generally eliminated feedback using an empty field or opened the accommodative control loop using a pinhole (Campbell &#x00026; Westheimer, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Campbell3" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Phillips &#x00026; Stark, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Westheimer, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Westheimer1" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>), or through cycloplegia while external fluctuations were introduced (Walsh &#x00026; Charman, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>) or electro-optical open loop systems (Kruger, Mathews, Katz, Aggarwala, &#x00026; Nowbotsing, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Phillips &#x00026; Stark, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Kruger et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) suggested that feedback from microfluctuations was not required for tracking a monochromatic sine target, but indicated that feedback may not have been fully eliminated at the higher frequencies, and it was unclear whether other residual monochromatic cues were present.</p><p>Considering these issues, we chose the less complicated approach of introducing uncorrelated extrinsic defocus noise, by way of screen-rendered temporally varying retinal image blur that exaggerated blur fluctuations caused by natural microfluctuations. Accommodation responds to on-screen defocus just as it responds to optical defocus stimuli (Phillips &#x00026; Stark, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Smithline, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Smithline1" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). This assured us that our on-screen defocus movie would be akin to delivering defocused images over time on the retina much like microfluctuations, except exaggerated. Our hypothesis was that if the eye were using the sign information extracted from natural accommodative microfluctuations, then external uncorrelated defocus noise would obscure the temporal signal, reducing the percentage correct responses to unpredictable step stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>The inclusion criteria for subjects and some of the general procedures and apparatus were similar to Metlapally et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and are described briefly here. We screened prepresbyopic subjects with normal general and ocular health, low refractive errors, and astigmatism correctable to within 0.5 D, in the age range 18&#x02013;25 years (average: 23 years). Only those who showed accommodation responses when viewing the stimulus through a Badal imaging system were recruited. Our experience was similar to observations by other groups regarding intersubject variability in accommodative responses (Fincham, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Fincham1" ref-type="bibr">1951</xref>; Kruger, Mathews, Aggarwala, &#x00026; Sanchez, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger2" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Kruger, Stark, &#x00026; Nguyen, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lee, Stark, Cohen, &#x00026; Kruger, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Metlapally et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schaeffel, Wilhelm, &#x00026; Zrenner, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Schaeffel1" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; L.

Stark &#x00026; Atchison, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Stark2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), where a number of subjects had sluggish or no reflex accommodation responses through the Badal imaging system, possibly due to the potential lack of the size or binocular disparity cues that normally accompany changes in viewing conditions. Twenty-five subjects were screened to obtain the final sample (<italic>n</italic> = 5) for the study. The study procedures followed the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>General methods</title><p>The stimulus was a polychromatic (black and white), spatially broadband, high-contrast Maltese spoke pattern shown on a high resolution LCD screen (Totoku Electric Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in a dimly lit room (4.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). Subjects were stabilized with a headrest and chin cup to minimize head movements and viewed visual stimuli through a Maxwellian view system (Westheimer, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Westheimer2" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-f01">Figure 1A</xref>). The Badal system ensured that there were no size changes with the step changes in optical vergence. The steps were produced by translating a collimating lens that imaged the stimulus screen at or within the anterior focal point of the Badal lens. The collimating lens was mounted on an <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> plotter that was driven with analog signals controlled by a computer. A 4-mm artificial pupil was imaged at the entrance pupil of the eye to eliminate variations in pupil size. We also minimized the convergence cue by having subjects view monocularly, and ensured the best alignment of the apparatus possible to minimize lateral movement of the stimulus with step changes. Chromatic cues were available with the polychromatic target. Pharmacological agents were not used to dilate the pupil. Subjects were instructed to pay active attention to the stimulus to keep it as clear as possible.</p><fig id="i1534-7362-16-6-19-f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representations of the set up and time sequence used in the study.

</p><p>Refractive errors were corrected so that all the spokes of our stimulus were focused at the beginning of the trial. The accommodative stimulus consisted of two step stimuli. The first step stimulus was introduced 1 s after trial initiation, and changed the baseline from far (infinity) to 33 cm, (a 3 D accommodative step stimulus) and stayed for 4 s. We then presented either accommodative or disaccommodative step stimuli of magnitudes 1, 2, and 3 D lasting 2 s before returning to the original far position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-f01">Figure 1B</xref>). The trial time sequence and step magnitudes were under computer control, and were completed 125 ms after the trigger.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Visual stimuli used in experiments</title><p>Experimental procedures were divided into two sets, based on the on-screen condition. In the first set of experiments, the Maltese spoke target was static. In this control condition, the eye had information available from chromatic aberration, monochromatic higher order aberrations (HOAs) for a 4-mm pupil, and from natural accommodative microfluctuations representing the most number of uncontaminated cues available to subjects in our experiments overall. The natural micro-contrast fluctuations reduced contrast in one direction and increased contrast in the other direction from the mean response level.</p><p>In the second set of experiments, we presented a screen-generated defocus noise stimulus that was temporally independent of the natural accommodative fluctuations, and that had contrast fluctuations consistent with a well-focused eye. This noise was presented in the form of an on-screen polychromatic Maltese spoke movie (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="jovi-16-06-08-movie01">Movie 1</xref> for a demonstration). Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and PsychToolBox 3 (Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Brainard1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Kleiner, Brainard, &#x00026; Pelli, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kleiner1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Pelli, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Pelli1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) were used to generate the individual frames of the movie by convolving the Maltese spoke pattern with a temporal defocus noise sequence. Cycling through the frames resulted in simulating defocus blur magnitudes that exaggerated the changes in retinal image quality produced by natural accommodative microfluctuations. The timing in the final movie represented a combination of two component temporal frequencies. The first component had a simulated defocus blur magnitude of 0.5 D and a temporal frequency of 0.5 Hz, and the second component, a simulated defocus blur magnitude of 0.25 D at a temporal frequency 2 Hz. The choices of defocus blur magnitudes and temporal frequencies in the individual components were based on the amplitudes at the respective dominant temporal frequencies of accommodative microfluctuations from power spectrum analyses (Campbell et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Campbell2" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Kotulak &#x00026; Schor, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kotulak2" ref-type="bibr">1986b</xref>). The screen rendered contrast changes for the noise stimulus fluctuated at twice the frequency of the dioptric fluctuations of the same stimulus. In this condition, over- and underaccommodation from the mean response level caused uncorrelated changes in the contrast of the stimulus. The images simulated 0&#x02013;0.75 D defocus due to constructive and destructive interference between the two noise frequencies.</p><fig id="jovi-16-06-08-movie01" position="anchor"><label>Movie 1.</label><caption><p>Demonstration of the on-screen defocus fluctuation movie stimulus.

In the control condition, the Maltese spoke remained unchanged and static throughout the 8-s trial. In the noise condition, the fluctuating stimulus was introduced 2 s after the 3 D step to ensure that accommodation to that step was completed (see time sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-f01">Figure 1B</xref>). Data was collected over several experimental sessions, each lasting no more than 1&#x02013;1.5 hours to minimize subject fatigue. Seven to nine unique sets comprising 20 eight-second trials (10 accommodation and 10 disaccommodation) were performed twice for each of the two on-screen stimulus types (i.e., static and defocus blur fluctuations). All experimental sets were randomized for sign and magnitudes by intermixing two step magnitudes for accommodation and disaccommodation in each set to minimize predictability.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analyses</title><p>We used a custom Matlab program to visualize the recorded change in the Zernike defocus term over an 8-s trial and to compute the first derivative, the accommodative velocity in D/s.

A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine any interactions between the effects of the on-screen conditions (static and defocus fluctuations), the direction of the step stimuli (accommodation and disaccommodation), and magnitude of the step sizes (1, 2, and 3 D) on percentage of correct directional responses.

Overall, the group results did not show a fall in the percentage of correct responses with increasing step sizes up to 3 D (i.e., the existence of an &#x0201c;upper defocus limit&#x0201d; in this subject population as proposed by Fincham, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Fincham1" ref-type="bibr">1951</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we tested if the percent-correct responses were significantly different from chance level, in either direction (above or below chance level). If responses were above chance levels, then the signal (for accommodation or disaccommodation) was perceived and the response was in the intended direction.

The static stimulus caused responses above chance level in all the tested conditions (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05), while the defocus noise condition caused responses not to differ significantly from chance level, except where it was below chance level for the 1 D disaccommodation condition (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). We propose that this may have been due to a random variation due to the small sample size, and would expect this to converge to &#x0223c;50% with additional subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the question of whether the addition of on-screen noise that was exaggerated, but uncorrelated with natural accommodative microfluctuations, would reduce correct responses for accommodative and disaccommodative step stimuli. Our hypothesis was that if the eye were indeed using the temporal directional information contained in natural microfluctuations, uncorrelated noise would reduce correct performance.</p><p>We established that the static on-screen condition caused the responses to be significantly better than chance level for accommodative and disaccommodative step stimuli of 1, 2, and 3 D, implying that the system was able to compute the sign and respond correctly most of the time with the available cues. Stark and Takahashi (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>) suggested several interpretations for the occurrence of greater than chance responses to accommodative stimuli (static on-screen condition in this instance)&#x02014;first, that accommodative microfluctuations were used to decipher direction, that some other cue such as lateral movement was available (caused by stage translation of the <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> plotter in this instance), that the sequence was learned, or that chromatic aberration was used. Accommodative microfluctuations were naturally available uncontaminated to potentially decipher direction. We ensured that lateral movement was minimized, and the presentation sequence of the step stimuli was randomized to avoid learning. Our pilot experiments with monochromatic stimuli (data not shown) largely reduced the percent-correct to chance levels for the static condition, and results were inconsistent among three subjects. Several others have shown that chromaticity of stimuli affect accommodative responses (Kruger, Aggarwala et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Kruger et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger2" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Kruger &#x00026; Pola, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger4" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). While some subjects respond or learn to respond in the correct direction for monochromatic signals (e.g., Fincham, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Fincham1" ref-type="bibr">1951</xref>), we did not pursue this further. Our design relied on adding defocus noise to investigate any reduction in percent-correct responses, and it would not enable this pursuit if responses were inconsistent or already at chance levels. We also did not attempt to negate native HOAs, which have more recently been investigated as potential cues (Chen et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chin et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Chin2" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>; Fernandez &#x00026; Artal, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Fernandez1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Hampson et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Hampson1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Metlapally et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wilson et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In particular, spherical aberration, a HOA which generally changes sign from a positive (at far) to a negative value (at near) with accommodation, has been examined for its role in discerning the sign of defocus (Campbell &#x00026; Westheimer, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Campbell3" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Fincham, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Fincham1" ref-type="bibr">1951</xref>; Thibos, Bradley, Liu, &#x00026; Lopez-Gil, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Thibos1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thibos et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Thibos1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) have shown that with reducing pupil diameters from 6 to 3 mm, the <italic>effective</italic> spherical aberration changes so that the contrast cue of high contrast for hyperopic blur and low contrast for myopic blur vanishes, as does the strength of the sign of defocus contrast cue. We used 4-mm pupils, and step stimuli were presented at the 3 D baseline where spherical aberration was minimal, largely reducing its effectiveness as a cue. The contribution of spherical aberration to the strength of contrast increments due to microfluctuations is also negligible at this baseline level (Metlapally et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The eye may thus have used signals largely from accommodative microfluctuations and/or chromatic aberration to decipher direction with the static stimulus.</p><p>Of more relevance is our finding that extrinsic uncorrelated on-screen defocus noise reduced performance for accommodative and disaccommodative step stimuli of 1, 2, and 3 D. Reduced performance with on-screen noise that was designed to contaminate the signal from microfluctuations suggests that microfluctuations were likely used to extract directional information. Based simply on the nature of on-screen defocus fluctuations, it is conceivable that one spatial cue from natural microfluctuations could be microcontrast variations at certain mid-to-high spatial frequencies, detectable within the upper defocus limit (Metlapally et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These micro-contrast signals are unavailable or unreliable during presentation of the on-screen defocus noise. Further, computation of the variations in contrast between low versus high spatial frequencies is likely to occur at edges of the spokes and their spacing of the Maltese spoke pattern. This is because it has the profile of a square-wave grating, whose fundamental frequency gradually decreases radially from the center to the periphery of the pattern, with the highest contrast gradient at the edge of the spokes against the background. This computation may have been hampered by the on-screen defocus noise. Additionally, contrast gradients contained within small visual angles are crucial for the perception of low-frequency components of stimuli (Campbell, Johnstone, &#x00026; Ross, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). We speculate that defocus from the second step stimulus, in addition to natural and on-screen microfluctuations, might not have produced sufficient contrast gradients for detection of low-frequency information immediately following its presentation.</p><p>A second spatial cue that could be misleading the system in this condition is phase alignment. Simulated defocus together with the eye's natural HOAs cause lateral phase shifts (Walsh &#x00026; Charman, <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) that cannot be corrected by refocusing in the noise condition. Information from chromatic and monochromatic aberrations is a third spatial cue regarding the sign of defocus of the step stimulus that may have been obscured during presentation of the on-screen noise, whose chromatic aberration did not vary with changes in rendered blur. This could have reduced the response rates. Our results do not distinguish whether the noise hampered the signal contained in microfluctuations or signals from other spatial cues like chromatic or monochromatic aberrations.</p><p>In addition to spatial attributes, there were clear differences in the temporal characteristics of the retinal image quality changes between the two on-screen conditions. During the presentation of the static step stimulus, micro-contrast fluctuations produced by natural accommodative microfluctuations were the same temporal frequency as the natural dioptric fluctuations. Over- or underaccommodation in this condition reduced or improved the contrast in one direction as opposed to the other. In contrast, the competing noise created by the on-screen defocus blur fluctuation was temporally independent of natural accommodation fluctuations. Over- and underaccommodation always blurred the stimulus independent of the simulated sign of defocus, impairing responses to the step stimuli in this condition. Also, the on-screen contrast fluctuations were at twice the temporal frequency as the dioptric fluctuations of the same stimulus, at the frequency that would signal an in-focus image. This temporal frequency characteristic would have minimized any interactions between the on-screen and natural accommodative microfluctuations and prevented any spurious signals that increased or decreased the rate of correct directional responses to our step stimulus. Concurrently, this attribute of the noise stimulus could have been responsible for the reduced response rate in this condition. While we did not examine this in detail, if the power spectrum characteristics of natural microfluctuations were altered due to the on-screen noise as seen in two subjects, or were a phase-lagged mimicry of the on-screen noise as shown by Mathews and Kruger (<xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Mathews1" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), we might have contaminated a potential signal from microfluctuations by altering its innate temporal characteristics.</p><p>It is not clear whether or how the eye distinguished between screen-rendered blur fluctuations (extrinsic) from natural microfluctuations (intrinsic noise from the eye's motor apparatus). We know that temporal changes in defocus during natural microfluctuations would be accompanied by changes in axial (longitudinal) chromatic aberration, but temporal changes in rendered defocus would not change chromatic aberration. It is possible that the system perceived the subtle changes in chromatic aberration with natural microfluctuations, which was obscured by or in conflict with screen-rendered fluctuations. Our premise was that if accommodation used intrinsic blur fluctuations, the extrinsic noise would make it especially hard, suggesting a potential role for them. On the other hand, due to the combined spatial and temporal attributes of the on-screen stimulus, or the exaggerated blur magnitude in the noise condition (extrinsic + intrinsic noise), the task might simply have been difficult. Thus reduced performance might have occurred even when natural microfluctuations potentially had no role in detection of direction. If the addition of extrinsic noise had not changed performance, we could have perhaps concluded more definitively that natural microfluctuations were not used. Our result thus leaves the possibility open that microfluctuations could be used to determine accommodation direction, but not conclusively.</p><p>In summary, our experiments took a novel, uncomplicated approach for studying the role of accommodative microfluctuations in determining the direction of responses, and since our subjects responded at consistently low rates to screen-rendered defocus fluctuations, it is possible that this condition affected one or more cues our subjects used in their natural environment. This is despite different internal (optical and neural) profiles, criteria, preferences, or weights for different directional cues, which could all potentially vary their accommodative responses in impoverished conditions (Kruger, Mathews et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Kruger3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Metlapally et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-16-6-19-Metlapally1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We conclude that a role for microfluctuations in determining accommodation direction is still worthy of consideration while the field awaits other controlled approaches to tease out the specific contributions of each of the related and confounding factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="i1534-7362-16-6-19-icon"><media xlink:href="i1534-7362-16-6-19-icon.gif" orientation="portrait" id="d36e88" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 EY01678 to CMS and the National Eye Institute (NEI) K12 EY017269 via the Berkeley Clinical Scientist Development Program (BCSDP) and NEI K23 EY024691 to SM.
