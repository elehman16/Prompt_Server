Although there is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria that differentiates these lesions it has been considered that erosion is the largest contributing factor to the tooth wear in childhood and adolescence<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The term erosive tooth wear refers to chemical-mechanical processes in which abrasive forces removes the softened layer attacked by nonbacterial acids, causing tooth hard substance loss<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, tooth hard tissue loss can also occur without significant involvement of abrasion, in cases of prolonged repeated erosive challenges<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Adequate preventive measures will often decrease the erosion progression and reduce the need for immediate restorations<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The control of dental erosion requires a combination of strategies that includes the reduction on the frequency of erosive challenges and the enhancement of salivary defenses<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The latter can be achieved, among other ways, by the use of chewing gum<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In addition, therapies including fluoride applications, in high-concentration, acidic formulations and polyvalent sources like as stannous fluoride have been described to yield positive results in erosive treatment<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Based on CPP-ACP promising results for subsurface carious lesions treatment<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, some studies have been conducted to test this agent against dental erosion when added to pastes or mousses<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, sports drinks<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or soft drinks<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and contained in chewing gum<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. However, there is no consensus regarding the effectiveness of CPP-ACP on dental erosion and its mechanism of action in relation to erosion is not fully understood<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>At an acidic pH, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) will separate from casein phosphopeptide (CPP), thereby increasing salivary calcium and phosphate levels. The localized increase of calcium and phosphate degree of saturation will promote carious lesion remineralization by the diffusion of the higher concentration gradient to the lowest<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Confirming this effect, in previous studies of erosion, the <italic>in situ</italic> use of chewing gum with CPP-ACP was able to enhance the rehardening of erosion lesions<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, the increase of salivary calcium and phosphate levels by CPP-ACP at acidic pH might also inhibit demineralization<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Recently, an <italic>in situ</italic> study showed that the use of chewing gum immediately before a short erosive demineralization was able to diminish enamel hardness loss, however, the presence of CPP-ACP in the chewing gum could not enhance this protective effect<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It is important to point out that <italic>in situ</italic> models simulating initial erosion can give the first insights regarding preventive measures, but the interplay of erosive challenges and the protective mechanisms of the oral cavity along time are important to confirm the treatment effect. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP chewing gum, considering the role process of erosion, trying to clarify the impact of remineralization and demineralization on the final degree of enamel loss. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the ability of CPP-ACP chewing gum in preventing enamel loss by erosive challenges. The null hypothesis tested was that there would be no difference between the CPP-ACP chewing gum and a conventional sugar free chewing gum in reducing erosive enamel loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical standards</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the local Institutional Ethics Committee (protocol no. 169). This study was conducted in full accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Eight healthy adult subjects (six female and two males) with an average age of 27.2 years (range 23-38 years) took part of this study after giving informed consent form. Volunteers fulfilled the inclusion criteria: residing in the same fluoridated area (0.70 mg F/l), physiological stimulated salivary flow rate (&#x0003e;1ml/min), and adequate oral health (with no caries or erosion lesions). They also did not violate the exclusion criteria: systemic illness, pregnancy or breastfeeding, under orthodontic intervention, and use of fluoride compounds in the last two months.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experimental design is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>. The study was conducted with a single-blind and randomized protocol of three-way crossover phases of seven days with an interval of one week between them.

</p></sec><sec><title>Enamel samples preparation</title><p>Enamel blocks (4x4x3 mm) were obtained from unerupted human third molars recently extracted and kept in 0.1% thymol solution at pH 7.0. The blocks were cut using a ISOMET low speed saw cutting machine (Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with two diamond disks (Extec Corp., Enfield, CT, USA), which were separated by a 4 mm thickness spacer. The surfaces of the blocks were ground flat with water-cooled silicon carbide discs (320, 600, and 1200 grade papers; Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and polished with felt paper wet by diamond spray (1 &#x000b5;m polishing particle size; Buehler, Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA). Blocks were cleaned using an ultrasonic device for 10 minutes and checked regarding the presence of white spots and cracks using a microscope (x40).</p><p>The surface hardness (SH) was determined using the average values of five indentations performed at distances of 100 &#x000b5;m from each other (Knoop diamond, 25 g, 10 s, Hardness tester from Buehler, US). Seventy-two enamel blocks with mean SH of 343.9 (&#x000b1; 15.5 KHN) were selected and sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide gas.</p></sec><sec><title>First profile evaluation</title><p>Enamel blocks were marked with a scalpel blade No. 11 (Embramac, Itapira, SP, Brazil) for standardization of two control areas with width of 1.0 mm (edges) and one test area with 2.0 mm (center). The baseline profile of enamel blocks was evaluated by a contact profilometer (Marh, MarSurf GD 25, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany) using a contour software (MarSurf XCR 20). Blocks were fixed in a device to standardize their position and to allow the record of the location of each profile. In each block, five readings were made at predetermined distances of 2.25, 2.0, 1.75, 1.5, and 1.25 &#x000b5;m. The graphics (profile) of each read were individually saved. Then, control areas located on the two-thirds in the edges of the blocks were protected with cosmetic nail varnish (Maybelline Colorama, Cosbra Cosmetics Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) to maintain their integrity during the <italic>in situ</italic> phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample size calculation was based on a pilot <italic>in situ</italic> study with three volunteers.

During the following seven days, erosive challenges were extraorally performed four times a day (8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and 20 h). In each challenge, the palatal device was immersed in a cup containing 150 mL of a freshly opened bottle of a cola soft drink (Coca Cola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, Brazil, pH 2.4, 0.32 ppm F) for 5 minutes.</p><p>After the erosive challenge, intraoral devices were washed in tap water and reinserted into the oral cavity. Then, for GI (Sugar free chewing gum with CPP-ACP) and GII (Conventional sugar free chewing gum), the volunteers chewed one unit of the respective gum for 30 minutes. After this time, the chewing gum was discarded, and the appliance was worn for at least 2 hours before its removal for another immersion in erosive beverage or for eating.</p><p>Volunteers were instructed to use the intraoral palatal device continuously (20 h/day) except during meals (four meals daily of 1 hour each).

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ideal prevention and control of erosive tooth wear involves the removal of causal factors. However, this approach is difficult and not always practiced. For this reason, different therapies have been proposed and studied<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>One of these therapies is the use of CPP-ACP. Promising results were obtained from studies that evaluated the CPP-ACP remineralizing capacity on eroded lesions<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. On the other hand, other studies have found some limitation in the effect of CPP-ACP when the product was applied before the initial acid attack<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> or in erosive cycling protocols, in which fluoride was used as the positive control<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The knowledge of the effect of chewing gum containing CPP-ACP on erosive lesions is still limited in the literature.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that the use of chewing gum diminished the enamel loss from erosive challenges when compared with no chewing gum. This is in accordance with previous findings reporting a reduction in erosive tooth wear with the use of sugar-free chewing gum for 30 minutes after erosive challenges<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The anti-erosive potential of different agents has been supported by the repair of eroded lesions as a result of mineral precipitation<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Based on this, it was hypothesized that the protective effect of the chewing gum was due to mechanical and gustatory salivary stimulation that elevate calcium concentrations in saliva, promoting mineral deposition on the eroded lesion, thereby reducing enamel loss in subsequent acid attack. However, the magnitude of the protection by mineral precipitation can be questioned when considering overall erosion prevention. The histological features of eroded enamel indicate that part of the tissue is etched away during the erosive attack resulting in limited areas for remineralization to take place<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>There are two studies that showed an improvement on rehardening (remineralization) of eroded enamel after the use of chewing gum containing CPP-ACP in comparison to the salivary stimulus by regular gum<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The effect of casein on enamel remineralization has been associated with a subsequent increase in tissue resistance and reduced solubility of tooth structures to acid attack<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, when considering cycles of demineralization and remineralization, as applied in the present study, the previously found rehardening effect of CPP-ACP on eroded enamel did not reflect in higher enamel resistance against erosive enamel loss when compared with the effect promoted by salivary stimulus using a regular gum. Results did not show differences in the erosion-preventive effect between regular and CPP-ACP containing gums. Therefore, there is no evidence that higher mineral precipitation, as promoted by CPP-ACP gums, will provide a less susceptible enamel surface against subsequent erosive challenges.</p><p>As suggested by Eisenburger, et al.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>(2001), <italic>in vitro</italic> remineralization of the eroded surface after 1, 2, and 4 hours in artificial saliva is extremely fragile and susceptible to removal by mechanical forces. The remineralization process would involve the deposition of minerals in zones of enamel porosity rather than the promotion of regeneration of hydroxyapatite crystals in these short periods of remineralization. However, as erosive lesions are vulnerable to other damage immediately after its formation, the goal of remineralization of erosion lesions would be restore mechanical strength as much as possible in order to avoid subsequent losses; though evidence has shown that it is far from being achieved<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>When considering erosive enamel loss the most important effect of preventive treatments seems to be surface protection rather than mineral precipitation<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The mechanism of enamel protection of CPP-ACP is based on the increase of the degree of saturation of calcium and phosphate when pH drops by erosive challenge, inhibiting demineralization<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In addition, it is hypothesized that CPP-ACP ability of forming micelles on the tooth surface<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> could result in a semi-permeable barrier<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which might restrict the reaction of H<sup>+</sup> ion with the tooth surface and also inhibit the loss of Ca<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> ions. However, Jord&#x000e3;o, et al.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (2016) found that the use of chewing gum immediately before an erosive demineralization can diminish enamel hardness loss and the presence of CPP-ACP in the chewing gum cannot enhance this protective effect. These results were similar to the present study, reinforcing the theses that CPP-ACP is not able to protect enamel against erosion. In contrast, de Oliveira, et al.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (2017), using similar <italic>in situ</italic> protocol, showed that the same commercial CPP-ACP chewing gum resulted in lesser enamel loss compared with regular chewing gum when enamel blocks were subjected to erosion. On the other hand, when erosion was associated to abrasion, the gums showed statistically similar behavior. Therefore, in a more realistic condition, in which erosive enamel wear is enhanced by oral mechanical forces, CPP-ACP shows limited effect. Since in the present study there was no apparatus on the palatal appliance to hinder the forces of the tongue<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, it is speculated that erosion was associated to tongue abrasion and the addition of CPP-ACP was not able to enhance the protection promoted by a conventional chewing gum use, similarly to the results of Oliveira, et al.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (2017).</p><p>Based on the results of the present study, the inclusion of CPP-ACP in a chewing gum was not able to enhance the protective effect of the use of a conventional chewing gum against erosive enamel loss. The null hypothesis was accepted. Therefore, to date, there is no evidence that chewing gum containing CPP-ACP should be used to prevent the development or progression of erosive enamel loss.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge all the volunteers who participated in this study and FAPESP &#x02013; S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation for the financial support (Proc. no. 2011/16326-7).
