Sixty-four participants completed the randomized controlled trial and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a soccer training group (SOC; n=20), a running group (RUN; n=21) or a control group performing no physical training (CON; n=23). Training programmes for SOC and RUN lasted 12-week with 3 training sessions per week. Soccer sessions consisted of 60 min ordinary five-a-side, six-a-side or seven-a-side matches on a 30-45 m wide and 45-60 m long plastic grass pitch. Running sessions consisted of 60 min of continuous moderate intensity running at the same average heart rate as in SOC (~80% HR<sub>max</sub>). All participants, regardless of group assignment, were tested for each of the following dependent variables: body weight, body height, body mass index, percent body fat, body fat mass, fat-free mass and total body water. In the SOC and RUN groups there was a significant decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in body composition parameters from pre- to post-training values for all measures with the exception of fat-free mass and total body water. Body mass index, percent body fat and body fat mass did not differ between groups at baseline, but by week 12 were significantly lower (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in the SOC and RUN groups compared to CON.

Obesity is considered one of the most important public health problems and according to evaluation the second most common cause of mortality that can be successfully prevented [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Regular physical activity has been established as one of the most effective means of obesity prevention [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most studies [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] evaluating the effects of physical activities on body composition have focused on the effects of aerobic exercise training such as walking, jogging, running and cycling. Recently, however, a few studies [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have confirmed positive effects of recreational soccer on body composition in untrained men, including subjects with limited soccer experience and skills. According to the Compendium of Physical Activities, team sports such as soccer, basketball and handball are estimated to represent vigorous intensity exercises (8.0-10.0 Metabolic Equivalent Task) [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Soccer is a popular team sport with &#x0003e;400 million active players worldwide, and due to motivational and social factors it may have great potential as a health-promotion activity for inactive individuals with a passion for soccer [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ottesenet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggested that team sports, such as soccer, may have an advantage over individual sports in the development of social capital. Also, recreational soccer training is as effective as running training in healthy untrained men because training time and mean training intensity are similar [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>After 12 weeks of recreational soccer training, the number of capillaries and maximal oxygen uptake were increased while systolic and diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate were reduced [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the recreational soccer group even showed reduced LDL cholesterol [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and increased lean body mass [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while these beneficial adaptations were not present in the running group. In the study by Krustrupet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], solid evidence was provided that recreational soccer has a marked impact on metabolic fitness for untrained men. One of the characteristics of recreational soccer is high energy expenditure; thus this kind of activity may serve as an appropriate alternative for exercise intervention for body composition improvement. The large number of different training components in soccer (e.g. continuous running, acceleration, rapid decelerations, jumps, sprints, duels) appears to evoke significant adaptive changes in a number of physiological systems as well as body composition [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, Mahdiabadiet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] confirmed that continuous and interval training produce similar effects on cardiovascular function in male non-athletes after an eight-week training programme.</p><p>Recreational soccer in the form of small-sided games has been shown to be an effective performance-enhancing and health-promoting activity for untrained and inexperienced men aged 20-55 [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent studies have confirmed that recreational soccer is very effective in reducing cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], blood pressure [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], agility [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], maximal oxygen uptake [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], some health-related fitness parameters, self-esteem as well as several motor skills [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there is no study of the effects of recreational soccer on body composition in young adult men. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) To determine the effects of a 12-week recreational soccer training programme or continuous endurance running on body composition of young adult men and 2) to determine which of these two programmes was more effective concerning the body composition. We hypothesized that recreational soccer is at least as efficacious as a running exercise programme is in improvement of body composition parameters in young adult males.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-nine healthy untrained males enrolled in this randomised controlled trial. The participants had not been involved in any type of regular physical training for at least two years. In addition, none of the participants were involved in professional or amateur soccer within two years before the training programme. Sixty-four participants completed the study and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a soccer training group (SOC; n=20), a running group (RUN; n=21), or a control group performing no physical training (CON; n=23). Two participants from the SOC group withdrew from the study (one left the study for personal reasons, one due to lack of time), while two participants withdrew from the RUN group (one due to minor injuries occurring during training, one due to lack of time). One soccer player was filtered out due to low compliance (training frequency &#x0003c; 1.2 times per week). For the participants who completed the study no group differences were present in pre-intervention. General descriptive parameters are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>.

The Tanita BC-418 body fat analyser measures impedance across both arms, legs and trunk via multiple frequencies of 50 kHz. The system's eight electrodes are in the form of footpads and each footpad is divided in half so that the anterior and posterior portions form two separate electrodes. Impedance and body mass are automatically measured, and the subject's height and age are manually entered into the system.

Heart rate of participants was measured continuously during all training sessions using heart rate belts (Polar Team System, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). The average heart rate during recreational soccer training was 81&#x000b1;4% of individual maximal heart rate, which is equivalent to 151&#x000b1;6 bpm.

Our results are in accordance with recent reports [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] indicating positive effects with similar training time and mean training intensity. In comparison with our results where body fat mass was reduced by ~5 kg in both SOC and RUN groups, Krustrupet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] obtained a reduction of ~ 2.1-3.0 kg. Nyboet al. [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found in both recreational soccer and a comparable running group a significant decline in body fat percentage, which was not the case with intensive interval training and a short-term strength training group. This may be related to the fact that the total energy expenditure is limited during interval and strength training compared to continuous running and recreational soccer, where high energy consumption has a direct impact on body fat reduction [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, recreational soccer leads to changes in parameters of metabolic fitness, such as fat oxidation during exercise, lipid profile, capillarization and enzyme activation [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], especially in men who are not involved in any kind of recreation. Moreover, recreational soccer affects the fat mass oxidation during activities with low and moderate intensity along with the reduction of lactate level [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These changes occur as a result of peripheral muscle adaptation with an increase in the number of muscle capillaries by 23% and the training-induced conversion of IIX fibres into IIA fibres [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Unlike body fat percentage, fat-free mass was not significantly increased following the 12-week training programme of recreational soccer, continuous running or in the control group. Krustrupet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found a significant increase in lean body mass for recreational soccer and strength training groups compared to interval and continuous training groups, which contrasts with our results. These results suggest that recreational soccer as a kind of aerobic interval training is an activity that affects body system functions leading to significant changes that have an impact on health status and body composition. Furthermore, even short-term soccer studies have shown significant changes in fitness components as well as favourable effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as maximal oxygen uptake, heart function, body fat mass and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in healthy untrained young men and women [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This study showed that recreational soccer is an equally effective training method as moderate continuous running in improving fitness parameters, especially body composition. Both training programmes lead to great energy expenditure which reduces body composition parameters, especially those associated with body fat, but soccer training seems to be more time-efficient. This is in agreement with a previous study, suggesting that high-intensity interval training is a time-efficient strategy for gaining health effects from exercise [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and could provide greater improvements in somatic features and health-related physical fitness than continuous moderate exercise training [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All the groups showed increases in total body water, but these changes were not statistically significant. This finding suggests that type of training (SOC or RUN) does not influence the body water responses to various types of exercises.</p><p>One reason for the improvements in the soccer group is the marked and frequent change in exercise intensity when playing soccer, despite the fact that average heart rate was the same in the soccer and running groups. During this experimental programme recreational soccer players spend ~20% of the total training time in activities with intensity above 90% HR<sub>max</sub>, compared to only 1% for the continuous running group. Similar results were obtained by Krustrupet et al. [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], who concluded that higher intensity produces superior changes in the soccer group than other comparable groups. Thus, it is likely that high-intensity periods make recreational soccer training superior in terms of producing improvements in performance [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Unfortunately, no studies to date have directly compared recreational soccer and high-intensity interval training with the same training volume, so future investigations are warranted to compare the magnitude of improvements with these training methods for better understanding of the mechanism.</p><p>To our knowledge, this was the first study specifically designed to examine the parallel effects of recreational soccer and continuous running on all body composition parameters. Apart from many advantages of this study, there were several study limitations. First and foremost, the sample of participants consisted only of male subjects, as women were not included in the study. Also, this study determines only body composition of the subject without any additional information regarding maximal oxygen uptake, strength, motor ability or flexibility. Further studies should provide an insight into the effects of recreational soccer in different groups of participants, such as children, adults or elderly people, as well as obese people or people with different social backgrounds. A similar study should be conducted to determine the effects of recreational soccer on health-related fitness components. Also, the effects of recreational soccer should be compared with different types of training such as strength, high-intensity intermittent or concurrent training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0011"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To conclude, recreational soccer training provides at least the same changes in body composition parameters as continuous running of the same training volume and relative intensity in young adult men. Furthermore, recreational soccer has established superior changes in fat mass compared to continuous running but these changes were not significant. This may be related to the findings of many intense actions and significant stimulation of the anaerobic system during recreational soccer. Also greater improvement observed in the soccer group is related to training intensity, whereas 20% of total training activity during recreational soccer was with intensity above 90% HR<sub>max</sub>.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0012"><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>The authors declared no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this manuscript.</p></sec><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ebbeling</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Pawlak</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Childhood obesity: public-health crisis, common sense cure</article-title><source>The lancet.</source><year>2002</year><volume>360</volume><fpage>473</fpage><lpage>82</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Milanovi&#x00107;</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Spori&#x00161;</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Panteli&#x00107;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Trajkovi&#x00107;</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Aleksandrovi&#x00107;</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Effects of Physical Exercise on Reducing Body Weight and Body Composition of Obese Middle Aged People.
