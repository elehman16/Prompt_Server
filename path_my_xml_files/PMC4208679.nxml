The core trial was a 52-week randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial in which 1030 insulin-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled with oral anti-diabetic drugs, were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to treatment with once-daily insulin degludec or once-daily insulin glargine, respectively. The insulin was administered subcutaneously in combination with metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor (use of the latter was dependent on country-specific approved labelling that allowed combining the DPP-4 inhibitor with insulin). Subjects who completed the 52-week core trial and provided informed consent entered the 52-week extension trial maintaining prior randomization. The extension trial was conducted between 9 September 2010 and 20 December 2011 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and Good Clinical Practice <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

In the core trial, the starting dose for both insulins was 10 Units. Basal insulin was titrated to target pre-breakfast plasma glucose of 3.9&#x02013;4.9 mmol/l based on the mean of pre-breakfast self-monitored blood glucose values of the preceding two or three consecutive days. The initial insulin dose in the extension trial was to be the same as the dose at end of treatment of the core trial, but could be adjusted at investigator discretion.</p><p>To assess the immunogenicity of degludec and to minimize interference with antibody measurements, a 1-week basal insulin washout period was scheduled at end of treatment of both the 52-week core trial and the extension period, during which participants in both arms were switched to twice-daily neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin (with a 20% reduction in total basal dose).</p><p>Safety and efficacy assessments in the extension trial were as described previously for the core trial <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. As the primary objective of the extension trial was to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of insulin degludec, the following safety variables were the primary endpoints in the extension trial: adverse events (including injection-site reactions), hypoglycaemia episodes, insulin dose, body weight, clinical evaluations (including physical examination, vital signs, fundoscopy, electrocardiogram) and central laboratory tests (including insulin antibodies). Safety endpoints were summarized and analysed using the safety analysis set (comprising all subjects exposed to treatment). The statistical analysis of hypoglycaemia episodes and weight change observed in the safety analysis set was based on the full analysis set (comprising all randomized subjects). Hypoglycaemia was also analysed in the extension trial set (comprising completers of the core trial that continued into the extension trial) for the entire trial period and (post hoc) in the maintenance period (when the average insulin dose had stabilized, i.e. from week 16 to the end of 104 weeks of treatment). The number of hypoglycaemic episodes per patient-year were analysed by use of a negative binomial regression model that included treatment category, antecedent anti-diabetic therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors and age as covariate. However, severe hypoglycaemia was analysed using a Poisson regression model, as the negative binomial regression model could not be fitted to the sparse data for severe hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Efficacy variables assessed in the core and extension trial included HbA<sub>1c</sub>, central laboratory-measured fasting plasma glucose, 9-point self-monitored blood glucose profile and a questionnaire based on patient-reported outcomes. Treatment differences in the efficacy variables and in body weight were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment, anti-diabetic therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors, and age and baseline value as covariates. In addition to analysing glycaemic efficacy in the full analysis set, the extension trial set was analysed for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and post hoc for fasting plasma glucose and self-monitored blood glucose. Baseline was defined as the time of randomization in the core trial. Post-baseline missing values were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Statistical analysis results include estimated mean treatment differences (or ratios) with their two-sided 95% confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic>-values (post hoc) for two-sided testing with an &#x003b1; (type I error probability) of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 773 participants randomized to degludec, 607 (79%) completed the core (52-week) trial; of these, 551 (71%) continued into the extension period and 505 (65%) completed the second year of study. Of 257 participants initially randomized to glargine, 197 (77%) completed the core trial; 174 (68%) of these continued into the extension period and 154 (60%) completed the 104-week trial. Participants were withdrawn in the extension period from the degludec and glargine groups because of adverse events [12 (1.6%) and five (1.9%)], ineffective therapy [three and one (0.4% each)], non-compliance [two (0.3%) and four (1.6%)], for meeting withdrawal criteria [six (0.8%) and three (1.2%), see also Supporting Information, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1</xref>] and &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons [23 (3.0%) and seven (2.7%)], with loss to follow-up being the most common &#x02018;other&#x02019; reason.

The most frequently reported adverse events in both treatment groups were nasopharyngitis, headache and diarrhoea. Serious adverse events were reported by 15.1 and 16.0% of subjects in the degludec and glargine treatment groups, respectively. The rate of serious adverse events was low; 0.15 (degludec) and 0.17 (glargine) events per patient-year. The most frequently reported serious adverse events were cardiac disorders (0.05 events per patient-year in each group).

Observed mean weight gain at end of treatment was similar with degludec (2.7 kg) and glargine (2.4 kg); estimated treatment difference of 0.37 kg (95% CI &#x02212;0.35 to 1.10), <italic>P</italic> = 0.31.</p><p>One death in each group, both considered unrelated to treatment, was reported during the main trial <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Seven additional deaths were reported in the extension trial: four in the degludec group (small-cell lung cancer, pseudomembranous colitis/large intestine perforation/multiple organ failure, rectal cancer and death as the result of an unknown cause) and three in the glargine group (motor vehicle accident, myocardial infarction and non-treatment-emergent cardiac arrest). Four of nine deaths were major adverse cardiovascular events: death by unknown cause and sudden cardiac death in the degludec group; cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction in the glargine group. The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was 0.03 (degludec) and 0.01 (glargine) events per patient-year (not significant).

In the extension trial set, laboratory-measured fasting plasma glucose decreased rapidly in the first 12 weeks and did not increase over the remainder of the 52-week core trial (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1d</xref>). The fasting plasma glucose increased abruptly during the 1-week basal insulin washout period (occurring between the core and extension trial), when participants switched to NPH and reduced their total daily insulin dose by 20%. Observed mean (<sc>sd</sc>) fasting plasma glucose decreased from 9.66 &#x000b1; 2.37 mmol/l at baseline to 5.56 &#x000b1; 1.82 mmol/l at end of treatment with degludec, and from 9.53 &#x000b1; 2.36 mmol/l to 5.93 &#x000b1; 1.69 mmol/l with glargine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1d</xref>). These values remained above the target fasting plasma glucose to which insulin was titrated. The observed mean reduction in laboratory-measured fasting plasma glucose was significantly greater with degludec (4.17 mmol/l) than with glargine (3.56 mmol/l) [estimated treatment difference &#x02212;0.36 mmol/l (95% CI &#x02212;0.67 to &#x02212;0.05), <italic>P</italic> = 0.021] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1d</xref>).

The 9-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles were similar at baseline and at end of treatment for both treatments in the extension trial set (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1e</xref>) and the full analysis set (data not shown), with no significant difference in prandial increments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The 2-year exposure to insulin degludec or glargine in previously insulin-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes provided an opportunity to compare overall safety of degludec with that of glargine, while evaluating long-term glycaemic efficacy.</p><p>The principal findings of the 52-week, core trial <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, namely that degludec provides improved glycaemic control similar to glargine (similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction with greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose), using similar insulin doses, with lower rates of nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia and similar weight gain, were sustained for a full 104 weeks of treatment. Although rates of diurnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (confirmed hypoglycaemia occurring between 06:00 and 00:00 h) were similar between treatments, insulin degludec showed a consistently and significantly lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia as compared with glargine, and this difference widened over the course of 2 years (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia can be attributed to the flat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of insulin degludec combined with the reduced variability within subjects between days and also between subjects <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>The degludec phase 3 programme was a global clinical development programme, and the window of time for defining nocturnal hypoglycaemia was chosen, taking into consideration the variability of timing of meals around the world to ensure that the period chosen was truly nocturnal and not confounded by meal ingestion or use of bolus insulin (relevant for trials in the degludec development programme using basal&#x02013;bolus insulin therapy). Thus, all analyses of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in the clinical development programme for insulin degludec were carried out according to the definition set <italic>a priori</italic> for nocturnal hypoglycaemia&#x02014; hypoglycaemic episodes occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 h (both inclusive). The relevance of the (absolute) difference in hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments in this study is apparent when considering the clinical impact. Only five patients with Type 2 diabetes need to be treated for a year with insulin degludec to observe the benefit of avoiding one nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episode compared with glargine as the treatment alternative&#x02014;that is, treating 100 patients for a year with insulin degludec would result in 19 fewer episodes of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia compared with insulin glargine treatment.</p><p>The sustained treatment benefits of degludec are important to the management of diabetes, a chronic disease, and in potentially lowering the risk of diabetic complications. As hypoglycaemia and fear of hypoglycaemia are two of the major barriers to optimizing glycaemic control <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, insulin degludec appears to provide a significantly improved clinical response in patients with Type 2 diabetes.</p><sec><title>Abstract presentation</title><p>An abstract including some of the study results was accepted for presentation in a poster (B.
