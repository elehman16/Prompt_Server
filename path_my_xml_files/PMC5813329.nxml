It accumulates in the body over time and can cause severe damage to kidneys and neural tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent study determined the severity of chronic mercury intoxication in terms of disability weights and found the most severe case of intoxication to be more serious than severe depression and quadriplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Common chronic intoxication symptoms are tremor, ataxia of gait, coordination problems, excessive salivation and sleeping problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The risk of exposure is especially high in gold producing areas, since practices using elemental mercury are still very common in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The global number of people earning their living with ASGM is estimated to be 10 to 16 million in 70 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By mixing the pulverized gold ore with elemental mercury and burning the so formed amalgam without protection, the miners are directly exposed by inhalation of the toxic vapor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This results in increased mercury burden, which is detectable in urine, blood and hair. Moreover, the proximity of the processing to living spaces and lack of awareness for toxic waste disposal affects not only the miners themselves, but also their children and communities by food, air, water and soil pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">There are two common chelating agents in use for treating mercury intoxication at the moment: the British Anti-Lewisite derivates 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). DMSA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug administration to treat patients with increased mercury levels by eliminating lead, but is also used as an off-label medication for Hg intoxication in North America. DMPS is approved in Germany and used across Europe for excreting Hg. However, unfortunately, in many countries where ASGM and the exposure to mercury are widespread, e.g. Ecuador and Indonesia, neither is available. As the Hg exposure mainly affects the poorer parts of the population, e.g. informal miners and their families, there is very little effort from the private sector to improve the situation. Nevertheless, as recognized by the Minamata Convention in 2013, along with prevention, the treatment of Hg intoxication is a paramount task and an efficacious and available medication much needed.</p><p id="Par21">Several studies described the efficacy on mercury intoxication of both agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, a recent report suggests that DMPS and DMSA do not form true chelate complex with mercuric ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Unfavorable stereo-chemical properties allow only one thiol of the chelators to bind to the metal resulting in a weaker bond. Thus, there might be possibilities to further improve the clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. On top, both are charged molecules and, as a result, are not able to pass the blood brain barrier or effectively enter cells. Hence, they are not able to extract the heavy metal directly from brain tissue and within the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], recent reports even postulates redistribution of Hg into neuronal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, novel approaches for metal elimination are highly desirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">N,N&#x02018;bis-(2-mercaptoethyl) isophthalamide (NBMI) is a newly developed, lipophilic chelating agent specifically created for complexing inorganic mercury (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This field study was embedded in an explorative trial to test the feasibility for an upcoming, larger phase-IIb clinical study. These smaller studies are needed to test outcomes, infrastructure, study parameters and local circumstances and to avoid problems in following bigger and more expensive studies. While its cytoprotective, anti-oxidative properties and its impact on acute Hg intoxication in rats are already proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the aim of this pilot study was to gain first knowledge about the efficacy of NBMI on chronic mercury intoxication in humans.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structure and basic facts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12940_2018_358_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par23">The design of this trial was three-armed, randomized, double blinded and placebo controlled, consisting of 14&#x000a0;days of treatment and 1 month of follow-up, totaling to a length of 45&#x000a0;days. It was conceptualized as a pilot study to gain knowledge about dose and efficacy of NBMI in mercury-intoxicated individuals. Furthermore, the feasibility of a future phase-IIb study at the site was examined. The three arms consisted of two treatment groups, treated with 100&#x000a0;mg/d NBMI and 300&#x000a0;mg/d NBMI, respectively, and one placebo group. The subjects were randomized into the treatment arms in equal numbers to obtain a 1:1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par24">The study subjects were recruited from the local gold miner population, since the artisanal miners in the region of Zaruma/Portovelo, Ecuador, were occupationally exposed to mercury by handling it directly to amalgamate the gold dust or smelting amalgam to extract the gold. The miners were approached in collaboration with local mining organizations and through advertising in the local community. An informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all participants. Urine samples of 865 interested miners were collected and analyzed for their mercury content. The purpose of this prescreening was to identify individuals with mercury in urine values &#x0003e;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/l for further screening. Of 90 persons with mercury urine levels exceeding the threshold 44 were examined whether they met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria until the sample size of 36 was reached (see <xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For inclusion in the study, subjects had to fulfil the following criteria: an age between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years, urine-Hg&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/l, a mercury intoxication medical score of &#x02265;&#x02009;5 or &#x02265;&#x02009;3 in combination with at least two of the additional symptoms social nervousness/withdrawal, irritability, memory loss, metallic taste, mental- and physical fatigue.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Subject Disposition</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12940_2018_358_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">All the participants obtained an emergency card with information on the investigational product, the subject&#x02019;s id, the investigator&#x02019;s name, an emergency number as well as the name and address of the sponsor. The whole study was conducted at the Hospital Doctor Humberto Molina, Zaruma, Ecuador, where direct access to medical emergency care could be provided.</p><p id="Par26">There were no formal sample size calculations for this study, since the main goal was to explore the feasibility for a more extensive study. The size of 36 subjects was chosen as a generally accepted number for a pilot study. 12, 11 and 13 subjects in the treatment groups meant that the 95% confidence intervals for the difference between mean values in a NMBI treated group and the placebo treated group resulted in a length of about 1.6 times the standard deviation.</p><p id="Par27">The three treatment arms differ in participant numbers because after randomizing the first 19 individuals, the necessity to relabel some of the boxes with an extended expiry date occurred which caused an interruption of the process. The subjects corresponded to three blocks of six and the remaining subject was allocated as an incomplete block. With the arrival of the relabeled batch, the randomization was continued with new blocks and caused the inequality in group size. However, this way the subjects could be randomized and keeping the blind of the study.</p><p id="Par28">The participants were analyzed according to the treatment arm they were assigned to, regardless of the treatment received. The analysis included all participants who took at least one dose of medication (NBMI or placebo) and at least one post baseline assessment of the MIS. This analysis set corresponds to a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set. The per protocol (PP) analysis set includes only participants without major protocol violations. This set was used as a sensitivity analysis for the efficacy endpoints.</p><p id="Par29">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 36 subjects were selected for the study. 34 (94.4%) participants were administered the assigned daily dose of the study product on site for all 14&#x000a0;days of treatment. Two subjects took only one capsule for the first 2 and 3&#x000a0;days, respectively, based on an administrative error in the hospital. The following 12 and 11&#x000a0;days all doses were taken as planned by both subjects. One of those two subjects had been allocated to the placebo arm and missed no active dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment</title><p id="Par30">For the 14&#x000a0;days of the intervention 100&#x000a0;mg NBMI, 300&#x000a0;mg NBMI or placebo were administered orally to all patients. The medication comprised of three capsules per administration for each group, two containing 50&#x000a0;mg and one containing 200&#x000a0;mg, either of the investigational product, placebo or a combination of both in the following regime:</p><p id="Par31">300 dose arm: two 50&#x000a0;mg NBMI capsules and one 200&#x000a0;mg NBMI capsule,</p><p id="Par32">100&#x000a0;mg dose arm: two 50&#x000a0;mg NBMI capsules and one 200&#x000a0;mg placebo capsule,</p><p id="Par33">Placebo dose arm: two 50&#x000a0;mg placebo capsules and one 200&#x000a0;mg placebo capsule.</p><p id="Par34">The use of placebo filled dummy capsules ensured the blinding of the patients. No restriction on medication intake in relation to meals was set. Other medication necessary for the patients&#x02019; well-being was allowed to be administered at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion, but recorded appropriately. The subjects were asked to abstain from drinking energy drinks containing taurine or glucuronolactone and alcohol equivalent to more than two half-liter bottles per day 72&#x000a0;h prior to the medical assessment visits at day 1, 6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1, 15 and 45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1. Moreover, for the length of treatment, the subjects were to refrain from the intake of herbal medicine, grapefruit or grapefruit juice to avoid possible drug interactions. As the use of mercury in mining is banned in Ecuador no restriction to working in the mines were made.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization and assignment to treatment groups</title><p id="Par35">Upon enrolment, each participant was assigned a consecutive number. The subjects were allocated to the treatment arms (100&#x000a0;mg/d, 300&#x000a0;mg/d or placebo) at a ratio of 1:1:1. For this purpose, a randomization list was created with the subject numbers using the R system and the subjects were allocated to the three arms in blocks of six.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par36">At the start of the treatment, the participants were handed out numbered boxes with the capsules corresponding to their subject number. Each participant received the same number of blisters, either filled with NBMI, placebo capsules or both. The boxes and the blisters containing the investigational product and/or placebo were labelled with a subject number by an external packaging company to ensure the blinding of the investigators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Treatment compliance</title><p id="Par37">The treatment compliance was controlled and documented by the use of investigational product accountability logs. In those logs the date and quantities of study products received, dispensed to and used by each subject and products returned and destroyed at the end was recorded. All administration of the study drug was supervised, and each participant received the daily dose at the clinic. The recorded data was verified by the study monitor during the study&#x02019;s process and at the end of the follow up, all investigational products used or returned were accounted for.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par38">The main aim of this study was to generate explorative and descriptive data as there is no consistent method for efficacy assessment or guideline for treatment of mercury intoxication. No formal primary efficacy endpoint was predetermined, and the outcomes were specified as differences in comparison to baseline values and the placebo treated subjects. As described in previous reports, the following characteristics were examined: the mercury intoxication medical score (MIS) and its individual components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, a panel of neuro-motoric functions (CATSYS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], mental and physical fatigue score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], tremor (finger-to-nose test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and mercury values in plasma and urine were analyzed.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Biomonitoring</title><p id="Par39">The samples for analyzing the mercury concentration in plasma and urine were taken at day 1 (pre-dose), 15 and 45 and sent to the qualified laboratory ALS Scandinavia AB in Lule&#x000e5;, Sweden for analyzing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Medical intoxication score</title><p id="Par40">The medical intoxication score (MIS) is a tool created for identifying mercury intoxication in patients.

The items consist of excessive salivation, tremor at work, sleeping problems, bluish discoloration of gingiva, ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia as much as a heel-to-shin test, a match box test, a pencil tapping test and additionally a dipstick test for Proteinuria. Each one can have an assigned value of 0 or 1, depending on whether the symptom is absent (0) or present (1) or whether the test result is negative (0) or positive (1). The mercury intoxication medical score is the sum of the items&#x02019; values.</p><p id="Par41">In this study, a change in the score and the value of its individual items compared to baseline assessment was used as an efficacy parameter. Accordingly, the change value for the score ranges from &#x02212;&#x02009;10 (maximal improvement of symptoms) to 7 (maximal worsening of symptoms), since the least score for subject inclusion is 3. The change value for the individual items can be &#x02212;&#x02009;1 (for worsened condition), 0 (for unchanged condition) and 1 (for improved condition). The mercury intoxication medical score was assessed at screening, visit day 15 and visit day 45.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Mental and physical fatigue score</title><p id="Par42">This score consists of 13 items of which 8 describe physical fatigue and 5 concern mental fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

This means, the higher the score, the worse the fatigue. The achievable score values were 0&#x02013;15 for mental fatigue and 0&#x02013;24 for physical fatigue. Items are on a relative scale to baseline, which has by definition a value of 1 (&#x0201c;same as usual&#x0201d;) for each item, resulting in a mental fatigue score of 5 and a physical fatigue score of 8. The score was assessed at day 2&#x02013;13, day 15 and 45 of follow up.</p><p id="Par43">For statistical analysis, a fixed model for repeated measures was fitted to the endpoints mental fatigue score and physical fatigue score.

To test for differences between the groups, the ANCOVA method, adjusting for baseline level, was used for parametric distributed characteristics, while the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney test was used for non-parametric results. Using the mixed model repeated measures method, a model was fitted to the daily measures of fatigue scores, mental and physical fatigue, including all results of days 2 to 15 to estimate the mean change from usual of fatigue at each day. The comparison between the groups treated with NBMI and the one treated with placebo is based on the change from usual on day 15. This change was individually calculated as the difference of baseline values and the values on day 15 or day 45 and the groups analyzed for distinctions in the change values. The initial model was fitted using an unstructured covariance between repeated measures. If convergence failed, the following covariance structures were tested in the given order until convergence was reached: Unstructured, Heterogeneous Toeplitz, Heterogeneous autoregressive, Toeplitz, Autoregressive.</p><p id="Par51">All assessed data were included in the statistical summary and missing data were not imputed.

Nevertheless, it chemical properties are different from the two common agents, DMSA and DMPS, as it is lipophilic and able to enter cells. NBMI is postulated to access the Hg in deeper departments, while DMSA and DMPS bind to the free Hg and help to excrete it with urine. Thus, it is difficult to compare these compounds by the same standards. As NBMI is mainly excreted through feces, temporarily raised urine Hg values as well as a very fast excretion could not be expected. NBMI forms a very stable chelating complex with Hg and disables it from reacting within the body. A reduced Hg body burden would result in lowering urine levels and a relieving of symptoms.</p><p id="Par75">This study was designed as a pilot to gather information about various outcomes and their value for measuring efficacy of NBMI. It is the first trial to assess the efficacy of this new compound. Despite the small sample size, a positive effect could be shown.</p><p id="Par76">The most evident effect of NBMI compared to placebo could be seen on the subjects&#x02019; fatigue. In contrast to the 100&#x000a0;mg NBMI dose, the physical fatigue score was improved in the 300&#x000a0;mg NBMI group suggesting a dose-response relationship with a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for the difference to placebo group. As the sample size of 36 was chosen to show a &#x02018;proof of concept&#x02019;, these statistically significant results surpassed the expectations. Some of the fatigue score items improved quickly within the first days and the effects persisted to day 45.</p><p id="Par77">Of the biomonitoring outcomes, mercury levels in urine and plasma, only the change in the unadjusted Hg in urine level for the 300&#x000a0;mg group was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in comparison to placebo. However, this effect was not as distinct after adjusting the values for creatinine (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1). Evaluation of spontaneous urine samples was challenging due to a broad inter-individual variability and an inter-group difference at baseline. Unfortunately, after randomizing the groups, the baseline urine values of the placebo group were lower than in the other groups. The difference occurred probably due to the small sample size and the broad individual variability. Hence further studies will have to include 24-h urine collection in order to underpin the data on Hg excretion as analyzed in this study. Chemical properties as such as lipophilicity of NBMI also suggest fecal analysis being a valuable tool for quantifying Hg excretion.</p><p id="Par78">Plasma Hg levels did not differ between the analyzed groups. With a high quantity of Hg binding to albumin whole blood analysis would be mandatory in further studies. We waived this analysis as the analytic setup needed was not available at the site, and transportation was not feasible due to technical constraints. Whole blood samples might have been more conclusive.</p><p id="Par79">There was also no evidence of a treatment effect on the MIS. The single MIS items proved to be challenging to compare, since differences between the groups were already apparent at screening. For example, in the 300&#x000a0;mg group 7 persons showed excessive salivation at screening, of which 4 showed an improvement, while there were none with this symptom in the placebo group. Additionally, the MIS was designed as a tool for a quick and easy diagnosis of Hg intoxications in the field and might not be ideal for efficacy assessment. Some of the neurological signs assessed in the MIS developed over years of exposure and could be irreversible. Furthermore<italic>,</italic> the binary coding of the items might be not sensitive enough to describe an improving of the symptoms and a different choice of scaling is advisable. For example: There was an improving in the matchbox test and the pencil tapping test throughout all groups and most participants reached results above the threshold levels at the second assessment. This improvement probably occurred due to a learning effect over repeating the test; therefore, narrower categories would be helpful to determine differences in improvement.</p><p id="Par80">In comparison with another study in a similar setting and DMPS treatment by Drasch et al., the here obtained results are in the same order of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In both studies, the greatest effect of the chelators showed in the improved fatigue scores. Additionally, in the Mt.Diwata population was a first improvement in neurological symptoms apparent; however, because of ethical restriction there was no placebo control possible. Assuming a similar effect size as in our study, these neurological improvements might also be attributable to a placebo or, with the pencil tapping test, a learning effect.</p><p id="Par81">There was another coincidental observation made by the principle investigator during the study. Some of the men had problems with erectile dysfunction prior to the medication that seemed to improve with NBMI. This is based on oral reports and was not included in the original design; thus, it was not quantified, it will be, however, considered in the following studies.</p><p id="Par82">Further two basic factors should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of the investigational product. As with DMPS, the treatment period of 14&#x000a0;days might be too short to see the improving of symptoms and it could not be expected, that neurological signs and damages developed over several years can be changed greatly in that period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in future studies the dose could be adapted to body weight. The workers tend to be overweight with a mean BMI of 28 and thus might need a higher dose. The best effect on fatigue in the 300&#x000a0;mg group could be seen in participants who have been screened with a lower Hg urine level (less than 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g creatinine). The phase 1 study for NBMI showed that a daily dose of 600&#x000a0;mg is harmless in humans; therefore, a further dose escalation is possible and might result in a greater effect.</p><p id="Par83">Although the use of mercury is legally prohibited in Ecuador since a couple of month prior to the study, one cannot rule out the possibility, that some of the miners and thus the participants are still using mercury informally, e.g. at their homes. This would result in a difference in ongoing exposure, as some miners are only exposed through old tailings while others handle mercury directly. This could explain the high outliers in urine values at day 45 and the newly occurred ataxia of gait in three participants. A possible solution for this problem would be the hospitalization of the participants for the length of the study to ensure controlled conditions. However, especially in the prospect of a more extensive study, hospital stays for all participants would exceed the local hospitals capacities and the magnify the costs for researching this orphan drug. A different and probably more feasible approach to keep the miners from processing gold ore would be a more restrictive protocol in combination with a payment for the miners&#x02019; participation. This would reduce exposure variance within and between the groups and cover the miners&#x02019; loss of income for that period, as some might depend on it for making a living.</p><p id="Par84">This study is limited by the small sample size of 36, which needs to be increased to exhaustively prove the effects shown here. The reported improvement should be considered indications and need to be reconfirmed in the next study. Another limitation is the possible difference in ongoing exposure to mercury, which could have led to an underestimation of the effects. Additionally, as mentioned before, the study parameters like length of follow-up, the scale of efficacy variables need to be adjusted to describe any effects.</p><p id="Par85">The strength of this study is in the extensive set of possible outcome variables. The task of proving the efficacy is rather difficult, since there are no standards for assessing it and no guidelines for treating Hg intoxications. It is important to test and define a set of parameters, which can show an improving condition through medication resp. Hg removal, e.g. signs of the neurological damage are probably irreversible and not viable for efficacy assessment. The insights of this study will be valuable in upcoming phases.</p><p id="Par86">Moreover, there is a supply gap for treating Hg intoxication in many countries and there seems to be too little effort to close them. As in ASGM, the Hg exposure unfortunately mostly concerns the poorest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], thus, the economic interest in improving this situation is probably too low. A chelating agent which is available in ASGM countries could be very helpful. Despite all difficulties, the goal of reducing the health effects of mercury exposure with prevention and treatment is important and much needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par87">Although this study was designed with a small sample size to test for feasibility, the gained results with 300&#x000a0;mg NBMI already showed an effect on physical fatigue with statistical significance and there were indications to positive effects on other symptoms, like sleeping problems. Further studies, with a greater sample size, longer follow-up and possibly higher doses or repetitive treatment periods are needed to verify the positive effects and their superiority against placebo. A further approach, including an analysis of feces, is necessary to quantify and prove the mobilization and excretion of mercury by NBMI. Therefore the outcome variables need to be improved to define a more suitable efficacy assessment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec50"><title>Additional file</title><p>
