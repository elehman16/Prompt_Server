through stair gait training where in proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) was
applied. [Subjects and Methods] In total 30 stroke patients participated in this
experiment and were randomly and equally allocated to an experimental group and a control
group. The experimental group received exercise treatment for 30&#x02005;min and stair gait
training where in PNF was applied for 30&#x02005;min and the control group received exercise
treatment for 30&#x02005;min and ground gait training where in PNF was applied for 30&#x02005;min. For the
four weeks of the experiment, each group received training three times per week, for
30&#x02005;min each time. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) values were measured and a time up and go (TUG)
test and a functional reach test (FRT) were performed for a comparison before and after
the experiment. [Results] According to the result of the stroke patients&#x02019; balance
performance through stair gait training, the BBS and FRT results significantly increased
and the TUG test result significantly decreased in the experimental group. On the
contrary, BBS and FRT results did not significantly increase and the TUG test result did
not significantly decrease in the control group. According to the result of comparing
differences between before and after training in each group, there was a significant
change in the BBS result of the experimental group only. [Conclusions] In conclusion, the
gait training group to which PNF was applied saw improvements in their balance ability,
and a good result is expected when neurological disease patients receive stair gait
training applying PNF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As post- injury symptoms, stroke patients have difficulty with balance and postural
adjustments, and due to an asymmetric posture and decreases in body balance and the ability
to move weight, their postural sway increases and the center of gravity is moved to the
non-paretic lower limb<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance ability
in patients with hemiplegia resulting from a stroke is the most important element in their
family members and in themselves, as well as the most important long-term goal in
rehabilitation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As an active treatment program for stroke patients&#x02019; functional recovery, stair gait
training is applied. Differing from a horizontal gait on the ground, in stair gait training
one foot moves the center of gravity in the forward and vertical directions at the same
time; therefore, stair gait training requires more lower limb muscle strength and adjustment
ability than ground gait training<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
Christina and Cavanah<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned, physical
ability is required more during stair gait than during ground gait training, because balance
ability of the trunk and muscle strength of the lower limbs are needed. Stair gait training
is an essential element for independent activities of daily living and performing stair gait
training may achieve qualitative improvements in independent and social life activities, and
is the most important movement training program among treatment processes for hemiplegic
patients who are recovering their lower limb functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, stair gait training in the clinical field is an
essential exercise process applied to stroke patients who will be discharged from the
hospital<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a method to improve stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability, there is proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this
technique stimulates proprioceptors within the muscles and tendons, thereby improving their
functions and increasing muscle strength, flexibility, balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and coordination, effectively maximizing responses of the motor
units. Based on such theoretical grounds, this study intends to examine the effects of stair
gait training, to which a PNF technique effective for improving muscle strength necessary
for independent gait and retraining muscles was applied, on the balance ability of
hemiplegic patients, as well as to provide objective data on stroke patients&#x02019; balance
ability through training them in the clinical field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in K Hospital located in Daegu Metropolitan City from April 25 to
May 22, 2014. The criteria for inclusion were: chronic stroke patients whose onset of a
stroke occurred six months or longer before and who had been diagnosed with a stroke caused
by cerebral hemorrhage using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography; who were
able to maintain an independent standing posture for 30s or longer; who were able to walk
for 30&#x02005;m or longer alone indoors; who were able to cognitively communicate to understand a
therapist&#x02019;s oral directions; and who did not use assisting devices or receive drug therapy
through internal medicine to alleviate spasticity. They voluntarily consented to the content
and purpose of this study, which was approved by the University institutional review board
and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The total number of subjects was 30 and they were randomly and equally assigned to a control
group and a stair gait group. The general characteristics of the subjects are summarized in

Prior to the
experiment, a physical therapist whose clinical experience was one year or longer applied
exercise treatments such as a muscle strengthening exercise, a range of motion (ROM)
exercise, and an extension exercise, to all the subjects. Then, the control group traveled
back and forth 10&#x02005;m on the ground and received gait pattern training through PNF by the
physical therapist. The experimenters flexed the subjects&#x02019; paretic-side knee joints, and at
the same time, they adducted and externally rotated the subjects&#x02019; hip joints while holding
the ankles of the subjects and instructing them to &#x0201c;raise your ankle; raise. And flex your
knee and leg diagonally&#x0201d;. When the lower limb of the paretic side reached the end of the
ROM, the experimenters placed one hand on the lateral surface of the knee joint and the
other hand on the medial part of the foot top and provided resistance to the opposite side
of the subjects&#x02019; ROM provide proper resistance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the training, when a patient had
acute fatigue, respiratory problems, or dizziness, the training was stopped immediately. To
respond to a safety accident like a fall, careful observations and assistance were
allowed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The experimental group received training on wooden stairs with a width of 0.8 m, a stepping
plane of 28&#x02005;cm, and a height of 10&#x02005;cm. Before the experiment, the researcher sufficiently
explained this study to the subjects and obtained consent from them. The experimental group
stood in front of stairs for training in a laboratory and received lower limb pattern
training for 30&#x02005;min and stair gait-training. Standing in front of a gait training device,
the subjects received gait pattern training of PNF from the therapist. During the training,
when a patient had acute fatigue, respiratory problems, or dizziness, the training was
stopped immediately. To respond to a safety accident like a fall, careful observation and
assistance were allowed.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is largely used to evaluate the balance of elderly people with
a high rate of falls and patients with a neurological disease, and it is composed of applied
activities of daily living. It is a functional test considering three aspects; postural
maintenance, postural adjustments by voluntary movement, and responses to external
agitation, and it may simply evaluate balance within a short time<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This measurement tool&#x02019;s intrarater reliability and
interrater reliability are r=0.99 and r=0.9, respectively, and they have high reliability
and internal validity to evaluate balance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS test items were divided into sitting, standing, and
postural changes. The item of sitting included sitting without support. Second, the item of
standing included standing without support, standing with eyes closed, standing putting feet
together, standing with one leg, looking back, grabbing an object from the floor, standing
with one foot in front of the other foot, and extending the arms while flexing the body,
Finally the item of postural changes included standing after sitting, sitting after
standing, movement, rotating 360 degrees, and putting one foot one after another on a
foothold (a total of 14 sub-items). The score of each sub-item ranges from zero to four
points with the total score at 56 points. When a subject performed a sub-item independently
or within a determined time, four points were given<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A timed up and go (TUG) test is used to evaluate functional motions including balance and
gait abilities. It can swiftly evaluate functional movements composed of standing, walking 3
m, and sitting again after coming back. The measuring method is used to record the time
required for a subject to sit on a chair whose height is 50&#x02005;cm, standing, walking 3&#x02005;m and
coming back and sitting down in the chair again at least twice, as well as to record average
values. When the time taken was longer than 30s, the subject was reported to be unable to
move outdoors alone because the subject was dependent in basic movement capabilities. The
measurement method is not complicated and may be appropriately applied to hemiplegic
patients with lower limb disability such as spasticity. The intrarater reliability and
interrater reliability of this test were r = 0.99 and r = 0.98, respectively, with a high
reliability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The functional reach test (FRT) is used to measure dynamic balance ability and to evaluate
the limit of stability. This method was used to measure a subject to instructed to stand a
flat floor at a 10&#x02005;cm distance from a wall, spread the legs shoulder width apart, stand
comfortably, clench the fists, extend the elbows, flex the shoulder at 90 degrees, move the
body forward as maximally as possible using only the ankle joint, and extend the body
parallel as maximally as possible. Then the distance to the tip of the middle finger was
measured. Test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability are high at r = 0.89 and r =
0.98, respectively<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For an analysis of the data of this study, SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used and a paired
t-test was conducted to verify each group&#x02019;s significance before and after the experiment. An
independent t-test was carried out to compare differences between before and after the
experiment. A statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the result of examining stroke patients&#x02019; balance performance ability through

gait due to abnormal muscle contraction timing, the weakening of muscle tension, and
unstable standing balance maintenance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Among exercise treatment methods to complement such functional problems, a facilitation
method can activate the mechanism of neuroplasticity, and; it was proven as a treatment
intervention through diverse research. Westerholt<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> noted facilitation occurred when pressure was applied against the
direction of muscle contraction and when stimulation was applied to the skin and pressure
sensations. Horst<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that an
improvement in independent activities of daily living is the most important goal of
treatment and to achieve this goal, all usable information should be mobilized in
combination, as well as visual and auditory information. Dietz<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that appropriate resistance with a gross muscle
exercise of three-dimensional motions by a PNF pattern combination strengthened static and
dynamic contractions. Based on such research, given that a PNF pattern aimed at inducing
positive movements in hemiplegic patients will provide them with functional recovery in
terms of gait and kinematics, the present study applied stair gait training with PNF to
stroke patients for four weeks and intended to examine changes in balance ability after the
exercise.</p><p>According to the result of examining balance performance ability through gait training, the
BBS test result significantly increased in both groups and the TUG test result significantly
decreased in both groups. Nonetheless, the FRT result significantly increased only in the
experimental group. In the test, regarding differences between the two groups after the
intervention, only BBS significantly differed. This is considered because movements were
triggered more greatly during stair gait than during ground gait training, stimulating
proprioceptive functions of the ankle joints. In addition, when the lower limb joints were
flexed for support on the stairs, vertical movements of the body in the forward and upward
directions occurred, maintaining the force generated in the rear lower limb and requiring
more balance ability for body alignment.</p><p>In an experiment on chronic hemiplegic patients who were divided into a proprioceptive
group and a visual feedback group, the BBS score of the proprioceptive group increased from
45.69 points to 51.54 points<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bohannon
and Lusardi<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the BBS score was
54.6&#x000b1;0.5 points in those aged between 60 and 69&#x02005;years and 51.6&#x000b1;2.6 points in those aged
between 70 and 79&#x02005;years, as well as acknowledged those with 41 to 56 points have a low risk
of a fall while those whose score was 20 points or lower had a very high risk of a fall.
Hwang<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> studied gaits of chronic
hemiplegic patients and divided the subjects into a proprioceptive group and a visual
feedback group, as well as reported the BBS and TUG tests result significantly differed in
the proprioceptive group after the intervention. Geiger et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> divided chronic hemiplegic patients into a proprioceptive
group and a control group and observed the TUG test result decreased from 23.08s to 14.62s
in the proprioceptive group. Lee et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>
noted an experiment was conducted for four weeks, with the elastic band group based on a PNF
lower limb pattern and a control group as the subjects, and the FRT value of the PNF group
was statistically significantly changed, which is consistent with the present study
result.</p><p>In the present study, hemiplegic patients who received stair gait training with a PNF
technique saw effective improvements in balance, and the present study result will provide
important data that a PNF technique may provide balance recovery through rehabilitation
training owing to manual therapeutic effect based on Dietz&#x02019;s<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> grounds. In the future, if gait training through diverse double
tasks is conducted as well as mere stair training, lower limb gait training using PNF
pattern will result in a better functional recovery for patients&#x02019; balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This Research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Eng</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Reliability and comparison of weight-bearing ability
