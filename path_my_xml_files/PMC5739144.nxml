However, conditioning regimen-related toxicities, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), life-threatening infections, and relapse determine HSCT success.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> T-cell adaptive immunity and innate immunity mediated by natural killer (NK) cells are crucial elements for guaranteeing a successful posttransplantation outcome. Early immune reconstitution after HSCT is led by NK cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These cells play an important role in the host defense against tumors and are also able to lyse some virus-infected target cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Human NK cells can be subdivided into 2 major subsets based on the relative expression of the surface markers CD16 and CD56. These subsets are CD56<sup>bright</sup> (CD56<sup>bright</sup> CD16<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and CD56<sup>dim</sup> (CD56<sup>dim</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup>). The CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset might be an immediate precursor of CD56<sup>dim</sup>, which is the most cytotoxic NK cell subtype.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In peripheral blood, approximately 90% of human NK cells are CD56<sup>dim</sup>, with the remainder characterized as CD56<sup>bright</sup>. The CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells express high levels of CD16, produce low levels of cytokines, and are the dominant subset in mediating natural cytotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells have limited cytotoxic ability but they produce high levels of immunoregulatory cytokines.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Early immune NK cell reconstitution after HSCT is dominated by the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The increment in the CD56<sup>bright</sup> population has been associated with a decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC), which is one of the primary functional measures of NK cell activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Brief bouts of aerobic exercise can lead to large (4- to 5-fold) increases in the numbers of NK cells in human circulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A moderate-intensity exercise program (EP) has been associated with increased survival rates and a reduced risk of cancer due to several factors, such as its potential beneficial effects on immunostimulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, this association depends on the type of EP and its duration. Specifically, the &#x0201c;inverted J hypothesis&#x0201d; suggests a moderate-intensity EP enhances immune function, whereas sedentary behavior and exhaustive EP suppress immune function and raise susceptibility to infection.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> During the recovery from acute high-intensity EP, the ratio of CD56<sup>bright</sup> to CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells favors the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset, and NKCC is thus reduced.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, a moderate-intensity EP has been associated with an increase in NKCC in healthy and adult cancer populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In populations with pediatric cancer, 3 studies to date have investigated the effect of EP on the immune system.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr18-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Of these, only one assessed NKCC after a moderate- to high-intensity EP. The sensitivity of NK cells to physiological stress, combined with their important role in early immune reconstitution after HSCT, suggest that a regular EP could be a beneficial strategy free of any detrimental effect on NK cell recovery and NKCC after HSCT.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Based on these data, it was hypothesized that a moderate-intensity EP could enhance NKCC and promote positive HSCT outcomes. The primary purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effects of a moderate-intensity EP on the NK cell phenotype, NKCC, and cytokine environment during the early phase after HSCT and the feasibility of this intervention.

The core portion of the training session was divided into strength and aerobic exercises. Strength training included 11 exercises engaging the major muscle groups (bench press, shoulder press, leg extension, leg press, leg curl, abdominal crunch, low-back extension, arm curl, elbow extension, seated row, and lateral pull-down). For each exercise, the children performed one set of 8 to 12 maximal repetitions at moderate velocity. Rest periods of 1 to 2 minutes separated the exercises. Stretching of the muscles involved in the previous exercise was performed during the rest periods between exercises. The load was gradually increased as the strength of each child improved. When children were able to perform more than 12 repetitions, the load was increased approximately 5% in upper body and 10% in lower body exercises. The aerobic exercises consisted of pedaling on a cycle-ergometer, walking, and &#x0201c;aerobic games&#x0201d; involving large muscle groups, for example, jumping exercises, ball games, and group games to maintain the children&#x02019;s adherence to the training program. The intensity of the aerobic exercise was set at 50% to 70% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (HRmax, estimated as 220 minus age), with children wearing a portable HR monitor (Xtrainer plus, Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland).<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The home-based EP program included 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercises and 30 minutes of strengthening and stretching exercises using Nintendo&#x02019;s Wii console with Wii Fit/Wii Sports games. Nintendo supported the consoles and the games during the study. The children&#x02019;s parents supervised these sessions. The exercises were organized as circuit training, alternating between 10 minutes of aerobic exercises and 10 minutes of strengthening/stretching exercises engaging the major muscle groups. The intensity of aerobic exercises was set at 50% to 70% of HRmax, using the aforementioned HR monitor. The strength training was performed using mainly body weight and following Wii fit strength training instructions. The Wii fit provided clear technique instructions to perform the exercises. Once patients mastered the exercise technique they were instructed to skip the exercise explanation in order to shorten rest periods. Rest periods of 1 to 2 minutes separated the exercises. The intensity of these exercises was moderate (between 70% and 80% of 1 RM). A progressive variation in exercise selection was performed in order to maintain the moderate intensity of training. Advanced exercises were selected when children reported they easily performed strength training.</p><p>Training adherence was reported in a training diary in which children reported training days and if they omitted any exercise.

Also, nonsignificant differences were found between the EP and CT groups in the cytokine profile in the plasma of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and GM-CSF.</p><p>Altogether, these findings could support the hypothesis that a moderate-intensity EP might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic intervention during early recovery after HSCT, taking into account the benefits incurred, including an increment in the CD56<sup>dim</sup> mean ratio and NKCC, and the improvement in HRF, quality of life, and motor performance previously shown. Besides, no significant detrimental effects due to a moderate-intensity EP were described.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Keeping in mind the small sample size, the safety of an EP intervention in this population has yet to be completely determined, and future studies with larger sample sizes will more adequately address this issue.</p><p>As a secondary outcome, we assessed HRF in the EP group. The TUG test, TUDS test, and strength test improved over time, but the change was statistically nonsignificant. Clinically, however, patients noted an improvement in their strength and functional mobility, 2 factors that are usually negatively affected in the early stages of treatment due to adverse effects of antineoplastic treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> We did not assess aerobic capacity in this intervention. However, we observed that children at the end of the intervention were able to increase the cadence (from 45 to 70) and complete 30 minutes of aerobic training with fewer pauses, staying within the target HR zone (50% to 70% HRmax). Regarding strength training, every 4 weeks we had to changes some strength exercise prescribed to do at home by the Wii because children reported that were so easy. Despite this, we did not prescribe advanced Wii exercise because we could not check for proper execution at home. In the supervised EP we also increased the loads every 4 weeks because patients were able to execute 12 repetitions with ease. When comparing the pre-post strength test results, participants in the EP group increased 15.5% in the chest press, 16.7% in the leg press test, and 49% in the rowing test. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology position paper for children and adolescents states that an increase of between 13% and 20% in strength should be expected after 8 to 20 weeks of training,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> consistent with our results. Thus, even though the improvement was not statistically significant it was clinically significant and within what is expected for strength improvement in children. Children gain strength through neural adaptations, not muscle hypertrophy. Strength training in children likely improves the number and coordination of activated motor neurons, as well as the firing rate and pattern. Also, the percentage of improvement in the strength test and TUG test was similar to a previous study performed by our team in which the improvements were significant.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-1534735416679515" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The limitations include the small population sample size, mixed types of disease, lack of follow-up after the training period, and the lack of evaluation of HRF in the control group. In particular, the small sample size hindered our ability to find statistical significance, providing further support for conducting larger, multi-site trials in this population in the future.</p><p>The authors recognize that, due to these limitations and the small sample size, conclusions should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, considering the difficulty of conducting clinical trials in this population, the findings of this exploratory study would contribute to the existing literature and could guide future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-1534735416679515"><title>Conclusions</title><p>According to our preliminary data, a moderate-intensity combined EP (supervised and home-based) performed early after HSCT does not appear to impair immune system reconstitution and function, and therefore could be feasible even in this immunocompromised population. Moreover, the redistribution of CD56<sup>dim</sup> and CD56<sup>bright</sup> and the improvement in NKCC in response to a moderate-intensity EP might have an adjuvant therapeutic effect in children with cancer. However, the results are still preliminary and must be interpreted as such. Future research with larger patient samples will better elucidate these effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Jaime Valent&#x000ed;n for helpful assistance during the conduct of the study and Mar&#x000ed;a de Miguel Gallo for writing assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Health Service of Spain, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII; FIS, Grant # PI15/00973), Cofinanciaci&#x000f3;n con FONDOS FEDER, the Fundaci&#x000f3;n Mutua Madrile&#x000f1;a, and the CRIS Cancer Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://criscancer.org/en">http://criscancer.org/en</ext-link>).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1534735416679515"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
