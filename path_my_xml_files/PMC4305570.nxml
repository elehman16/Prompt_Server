complex exercise in shift work employees working in industry. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty shift work employees were randomly assigned to either a complex exercise group
(control group) or a complex exercise and ultrasound treatment group (experimental group).
The control group carried out complex exercise five times per week for 4 weeks, while the
experimental group performed complex exercise twice per week and received deep ultrasound
three times per week for 4 weeks. [Results] The results showed that there were no
significant differences in body composition between the two groups. There were significant
changes in weight, lean body mass, body fat mass, and body mass index in the control
group; meanwhile, significant changes in weight and body fat mass were observed in the
experimental group. There were no significant differences in blood lipids between the two
groups. There was a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
in the control group; furthermore, a significant decrease in total cholesterol was
observed in the experimental group, along with significant increases in HDL-C and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. [Conclusion] According to the results of this study
concerning short-term obesity management programs, complex exercise was effective for
improving of body composition and weight loss, while complex exercise combined with
abdominal ultrasound had a good effect on blood lipids and secondary complication
prevention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Abdominal ultrasound therapy</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recently, shift work employees working in industry have been faced with the new problem of
obesity resulting from insufficient sleep, instability, and an irregular sleep cycle, in
addition to musculoskeletal system diseases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity was a symbol of wealth in the past, but at present, it is
treated as a life-threatening illness. Obesity arises from diverse causes throughout
society. Cardiac and circulatory system diseases caused by being overweight of obese rank
first in terms of world death rates<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Obesity accelerates with age and increases the prevalence of secondary metabolic diseases
resulting from lack of exercise and decreased physical activity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is estimated that over 50% of deaths will occur with
obesity as a primary or secondary cause within a decade; thus, obesity has emerged as a
global problem<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methods to treat obesity
are divided into an invasive method, namely surgery, and noninvasive methods such as
exercise, dietary control, behavioral correction, and drug therapy. In general, surgery may
be effective for losing weight within a short time period, but it is expensive and may
trigger side effects from the operation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>;
therefore, it is restrictively applied to patients with morbid obesity. On the other hand,
dietary control and exercise therapies require continuous efforts, and those who use such
methods face difficulties midway into them. Recently, obesity management using abdominal
ultrasound has been recommended in order to overcome such difficulties<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity management using abdominal ultrasound is a method
of reducing subcutaneous fat by decomposing it effectively into fatty acid and discharging
it out of the body; recently, many relevant treatment instruments have been developed and
popularized<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the aim of
the present study was to compare ordinary complex exercise and abdominal ultrasound
accompanied by complex exercise, and to present a method by which employees working in
industry exposed to risk factors related to obesity can effectively overcome this
disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 30 employees in S company with a body mass index (BMI) was 25
(kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or greater. The participants had not dieted over the past sixth months
and were not performing regular exercise or exercising dietary control at the beginning of
the study. All the subjects were given sufficient information about the experimental method
based on the Helsinki Declaration, fully understood the content and purpose of this
experiment, and voluntarily consented to participate. Fifteen participants were randomly
assigned to a complex exercise group (control group), and 15 participants were randomly
assigned to an abdominal ultrasound treatment group (experimental group). A test was
conducted on blood components, BMI, body composition, neutral fat, and cholesterol.
Measurements were taken prior to and after the 4 weeks of the experiment. They were taken
twice each time and averaged values were used for analysis. The control group followed a
complex exercise program composed of aerobic exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and resistance exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. They conducted aerobic exercise for 30 minutes, resistance exercise
for 20 minutes, and cool-down exercise for 10 minutes five times per week for 4 weeks. The
experimental group followed the same complex exercise program as that of the control group
twice per week and underwent deep ultrasound using Lipoderm Lipo-X deep abdominal ultrasound
equipment (HSC CO., Ltd., Seongnam, Republic of Korea), 30 minutes each time, three times
per week for 4 weeks. A body composition analyzer (InBody 720, Biospace Co., Ltd., Seoul,
Republic of Korea) was used to measure body composition and components via the direct
segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (DSM-BIA) method in each area.
Using the body composition analyzer, BMI, body fat mass, body fat percentage, lean body
mass, and muscle mass were measured. For analysis of blood composition, the subjects fasted
for 12 hours. Then, 15 ml of blood was collected from the brachial vein, and the total
cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were analyzed using the enzymatic method with an automated
analyzer. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 18.0. A paired t-test was
conducted in order to test effects prior to and after the intervention, and an independent
t-test was performed to compare changes between the two groups. The significance level was
set at &#x003b1;=0.05</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In terms of the general characteristics of the subjects, there were no significant
differences between the two groups in age (experimental group, 35.7&#x000b1;6.6; control group,
35.8&#x000b1;4.2), height (experimental group, 172.8&#x000b1;6.9; control group, 175.4&#x000b1;5.8), weight
(experimental group, 87.3&#x000b1;15.2; control group, 90.3&#x000b1;11.2), or BMI (experimental group,
29.3&#x000b1;2.2; control group, 29.0&#x000b1;3.1). In order to examine the effects of complex exercise and
abdominal ultrasound treatment for obesity management on body composition, the changes in
lean body mass, body fat mass, and BMI were compared. The results of the independent t-test,
showed that there were no differences between the two groups after the intervention. The
results of the paired t-test showed that there was a significant decrease in body fat mass
in the two groups. In order to look at the effects of complex exercise and abdominal
ultrasound intervention for obesity management on changes in body composition, the changes
in TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C were compared. The results of the independent t-test showed that
there were no significant differences between the two groups after the intervention. The
results of the paired-t test showed that HDL-C increased significantly in the experimental
group but not in the control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

considered to involve merely eating less food and exercising more. Mild obesity has been
largely prevented and managed through regular exercise and self-management<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, as obesity progresses into morbid obesity, it results in
secondary problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, and triggers
many social problems. Obesity is recognized as a very dangerous factor that has increased
the rate of mortality from cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and cancer<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The methods of
treating obesity can be divided into an invasive method, namely surgery, and noninvasive
methods such as exercise, dietary control, behavioral correction, and drug therapy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As advancements in science and technologies
have been made and the physiology of obesity has been clarified to some extent, efforts to
effectively enhance and prevent obesity are being made using noninvasive methods<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Beyond weight loss goals such as personal weight loss, body shape
management, and health training, a need to minimize the secondary side effects of obesity
has emerged; thus, this study intended to compare the effects of complex exercise and
abdominal ultrasound exercise for safer, more scientific, and more convenient obesity
management. Currently, the most effective and common management method to resolve obesity is
complex exercise, which is very effective in changing body composition. Moreover, Kim et
al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that a 12-week aerobic
exercise program decreased subjects&#x02019; BMI and body fat percentage. Therefore, exercise is
recommended as a program to resolve obesity. In their research, Saris et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that exercise for 45 to 60
minutes was needed, while Lee<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted
that exercise of moderate intensity at least five days a week was effective. In contrast to
previous research, however, the intervention in the present study was effective for
decreasing body fat only; it is considered that this was because the intervention period was
relatively shorter than those of previous studies. If the intervention period were longer,
this study would probably obtain the same results as those in previous studies.
Steinert<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that ultrasound
therapy was an effective, painless fat decomposition method and stated that it had a good
effect on abdominal obesity in particular. Most secondary complications brought about by
obesity are due to abdominal obesity, and ultrasound therapy is considered to positively
affect obese patients who are suffering from secondary complications resulting from
abdominal obesity. In a study of female adults, Kim et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that ultrasound therapy was effective in reducing body fat
percentage and body fat mass. According to the results of the present study, ultrasound
therapy combined with exercise effectively increased HDL-C in terms of blood lipids, which
was a similar result to those reported in previous studies. Given the above results, it is
considered that ultrasound therapy in combination with complex exercise can be used as a
method to reduce secondary complications resulting from obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Short sleep duration and weight gain: a systematic
