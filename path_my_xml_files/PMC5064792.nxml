Acute exacerbations of asthma are unpredictable, disruptive and frightening. They cause considerable morbidity and account for a large component of the health service costs of asthma. The widespread use of an asthma self-management plan, designed to encourage disease monitoring and timely intervention, can reduce exacerbations and is, therefore, recommended for all patients with asthma. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are not provided with such a plan. There are a variety of reasons for this but uncertainty about what to include in the plan when asthma control is deteriorating, but before the need for orally administered corticosteroids, is a contributing factor.</p><p>The aim of this trial is to determine whether an asthma self-management plan, which includes a temporary quadrupling of the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate, reduces asthma exacerbations requiring orally administered corticosteroids or unscheduled health care consultation for asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A multicentre, pragmatic, randomised trial in adults aged over 16&#x000a0;years with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, treated with a licensed dose of inhaled corticosteroid and at least one exacerbation in the previous 12&#x000a0;months requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Participants will be randomised to either a self-management plan, which includes a temporary (maximum of 14&#x000a0;days) fourfold increase in inhaled corticosteroid or the same plan without an increase in inhaled corticosteroid. Participants will be followed up at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months and will attend the clinic for an additional visit if their asthma control deteriorates. The primary outcome is time to first asthma exacerbation, defined as the need for systemic corticosteroids and/or unscheduled health care consultation for asthma. The estimated sample size is 1800 participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The FAST trial is an independent study that has been prioritised and commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the United Kingdom. It will provide high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision-making on the role of an asthma self-management plan, which includes a temporary fourfold increase of inhaled corticosteroid, when asthma control starts to deteriorate.</p><p>The first participant was randomised on 17th May 2013 and recruitment will close on 31 January 2016 with the last patient last visit taking place in January 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

We envisage that the majority of participants (approximately 80&#x000a0;%) will be recruited within primary care.</p><p>For primary care we plan to recruit from general practitioner (GP) practices across England and Scotland in conjunction with the Primary Care Research Network (PCRN/SPCRN). The model of recruitment will depend on the models of delivery within the differing PCRN areas. The lead PCRN based within the chief investigator&#x02019;s region (East Midlands and South Yorkshire PCRN) will be responsible for facilitating the set-up of the study within primary care and will liaise with the relevant local PCRNs based within the collaborating centres&#x02019; region. Local PCRNs will liaise directly with GP practices who will act as Participant Identification Centres (PICs).</p><p>At secondary care sites participants will be identified from patients attending respiratory outpatient appointments at the individual NHS Trust recruiting centres. The first contact will be made by the patient&#x02019;s clinician or a member of their immediate care team within the clinic. They will be given a brief overview of the study and a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) will be provided. Sites were chosen on the basis of a proven track record of recruiting into previous asthma trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

If asthma control deteriorates and zone 2 of the asthma plan is activated, an additional post-activation visit is required after the 14-day Asthma Diary Card has been completed. Adherence rating to the allocated asthma self-management plan (via research nurse review of completed Asthma Diary Card), exacerbation history and MiniAQLQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] data are also being collected at this visit.</p><p>A monthly text message reminder for follow-up visits is sent to the participants if they have a mobile phone and consent to receive this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Participant withdrawal and stopping criteria</title><p>For individual participants, discontinuation of the treatment plan will be decided on an individual basis that will include, but not be limited to, people who have more than six asthma exacerbations in the 12-month trial period.</p><p>Adherence with the self-management plans will be reviewed at 12&#x000a0;months (and at 18&#x000a0;months if insufficient data is available). If the self-reported adherence is reliable, the futility analysis will be based on the entire study population. The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will determine whether the overall adherence with the self-management plans makes the study futile and, therefore, should be stopped.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>The randomisation schedule is based on a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (Nottingham CTU) in accordance with their standard operating procedure (SOP) and held on a secure University of Nottingham server. Randomisation is stratified by recruiting site (regional centre), smoking status (yes/no) and maintenance of inhaled corticosteroid dose (<xref rid="Sec40" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>&#x000a0;5).</p><p>Investigators and research nurses access the randomisation website by means of a remote, Internet-based randomisation system developed and maintained by the Nottingham CTU. The sequence of treatment allocations will be concealed until interventions have all been assigned and recruitment, data collection and all other trial-related assessments are complete.</p><p>This is an open-label clinical trial, so the participant and the study team will be aware of the self-management plan allocation. The chief investigator and trial statisticians are blinded to participant treatment arms throughout the study. Participants will be enrolled and randomised by a member of the site study team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data collection, management and analysis</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Data management</title><p>Clinic data are entered directly into a web-based trial database at the investigator sites by site users with unique login details. Patient questionnaires and Asthma Diary Cards completed at clinic visits are entered by the site nurses directly into the trial database.</p><p>Data quality is ensured by database validation checks which include missing data, out of range values, illogical entries and invalid responses. Data entered by sites into the trial database are subject to review by coordinating centre staff, and data queries are raised as necessary.</p><p>Detailed data management processes and procedures are documented in the FAST Data Management Plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>A detailed statistical analysis plan has been agreed with the TSC. In summary, baseline characteristics will be described for both treatment groups. For the primary outcome variables, a log-rank test on Kaplan-Meier survival graphs for time to asthma exacerbation will be calculated. Multivariate analyses will also be investigated, using Cox regression to adjust for the effect of any potential differences between the groups at baseline. All analysis will be done as intention-to-treat. Subgroup analyses for smoking status at trial entry and high/low inhaled corticosteroid use at trial entry will also be performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Monitoring</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Integrity of trial conduct is overseen by the TSC, which meets at least once a year and provides overall supervision of the trial on behalf of the trial sponsor (University of Nottingham).</p><p>The Trial Management Group (TMG) meets more frequently and is responsible for the day-to-day management of the trial.
