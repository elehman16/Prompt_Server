exercise capacity, anaerobic power, and knee isokinetic muscular function in high school
soccer players. [Subjects and Methods] The study assessed U High School soccer players
(n=40) in S area, South Korea, divided into 2 groups: a lower extremity injury group
(n=16) comprising those with knee and ankle injuries and a control group (n=24) without
injury. Aerobic exercise capacity, anaerobic power, and knee isokinetic muscular function
were compared and analyzed. [Results] Regarding the aerobic exercise capacity test,
significant differences were observed in maximal oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold
between both groups. For the anaerobic power test, no significant difference was observed
in peak power and average power between the groups; however, a significant difference in
fatigue index was noted. Regarding the knee isokinetic muscular test, no significant
difference was noted in knee flexion, extension, and flexion/extension ratio between both
groups. [Conclusion] Lower extremity injury was associated with reduced aerobic exercise
capacity and a higher fatigue index with respect to anaerobic exercise capacity.
Therefore, it seems necessary to establish post-injury training programs that improve
aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity for soccer players who experience lower extremity
injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lower extremity injuries</kwd><kwd>Aerobic exercise capacity</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic power</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Success or failure in a soccer game is determined by various factors including physical,
psychological, technical, and tactical factors. In terms of physical fitness, a soccer
player runs 10&#x02013;11&#x02005;km on average and a maximum of 13.5&#x02005;km during a 90-minute soccer match,
although the distance covered by players varies depending on the playing position<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, it is important for soccer players to increase cardiorespiratory endurance.
Aerobic exercise capacity, which enables them to continue play for a long time. In addition,
because soccer players must frequently perform technical movements such as kicking, passing,
dribbling tackling, heading, jumping, and turning, anaerobic power, and muscular function
are substantially required<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, with increased physical fitness, the risk of
exercise-related injury decreases and there is a high probability of successfully performing
soccer skills and tactics<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently,
aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity and muscular function are essential factors for
performing individual skills and adhering to team tactics during matches.</p><p>Soccer, however, is often associated with musculoskeletal injuries due to contact with an
opponent or non-contact at the time of turning and muscle stress during a match or exercise.
In particular, since the quadriceps and hamstring are the main active muscles in soccer
players, the rate of knee and ankle injuries in the lower extremities is high<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The common types of soccer injuries in the lower extremities include knee and ankle
sprainsor ruptures<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such soccer injuries
in the lower extremities have negative effects on aerobic exercise capacity, anaerobic
power, and muscular function, which are essential for soccer games. Moreover, as team play
is important in soccer, the physical fitness and sports injuries of team players deteriorate
their training and soccer performance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although a number of studies on the physical characteristics of soccer players and their
injuries have been conducted<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, there is a lack of basic data analyzing and comparing the
effects of lower extremity injuries on aerobic exercise capacity, anaerobic power, and
isokinetic muscular strength which are important for soccer performance.</p><p>Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of lower extremity injuries
on aerobic exercise capacity, anaerobic power, and knee isokinetic muscular strength in high
school soccer players and to provide data for designing training programs that are effective
in improving athletic performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 40 soccer players at U High School who visited and
underwent medical examination at the National Fitness Center in Seoul, South Korea in
December 2016. The subjects were divided into a lower extremity injury group (n=16) and a
control group without injury (n=24). The subjects in the lower extremity injury group
included those with medial and lateral collateral knee ligament injuries, patellar
tendonitis, knee contusion, ankle sprain, or ankle contusion, who did not require surgical
treatment but were restricted in soccer games or training within the past 1&#x02005;year. In
addition, the subjects in the lower extremity showed normal findings without any pain or
functional limitation after receiving physical therapy and rehabilitation exercise program
for more than 1 month, and thus, returned to training or competition.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee involving human beings of the
institution. All the subjects gave their written informed consent before participating in
the study.</p><p>Height and weight in the anthropometric test were measured in 0.1&#x02005;cm increments using an
automatic extensometer (Jenix DS-102, Korea). Body fat percentage was measured using a
bioelectrical impedance analyzer (X-Scanplus II, Korea).</p><p>The aerobic exercise capacity test was performed using exercise stress test equipment
(Quiton, USA) and an automatic breath gas analysis system (Jaeger, Germany). In the exercise
stress test, the maximal oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold were measured using the KISS
protocol, which was set up to increase the speed of 20 m/min per 2 minutes starting at a
speed of 80 m/min at a slope of 6%. The end of exercise test was performed according to the
detailed guidelines of the ACSM<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Anaerobic power test was performed using an electromagnetic ergometer (Ergomedic894Ea,
Germany). The measurement method was to adjust and set the saddle height so that the knee of
each subject could have a flexion of about 5&#x000b0;, and thus, 0.075 kp per unit weight was
supposed to be applied when reaching one&#x02019;s maximum speed. Afterward, a tester in
synchronization with the computer verbally counted a 5-second count down following warm-up
and then verbally gave a &#x0201c;Start&#x0201d; signal, after which peak anaerobic power, average power,
and fatigue index were measured while encouraging subjects to perform the exercise as much
as possible for 30 seconds.</p><p>The knee isokinetic function test was performed using Biodex system-3 (Biodex Co., USA), an
isokinetic dynamometer. The loading speed was set at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec and
three repeated measurements for the left and right knees were taken. Knee extensor and
flexor muscle strength were measured after adjusting for gravity to limit the influence of
gravity.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical program (Version, 18.0). An independent
t-test was performed to determine significant differences in aerobic exercise capacity,
anaerobic power, and knee isokinetic muscular function. Statistical significance (&#x003b1;) was set
at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference in the physical characteristics of the subjects between

and knee isokinetic muscular function between the lower extremity injury group and the
control group among high school soccer players. The results of the present study revealed
significant differences in aerobic exercise capacity regardingVO<sub>2</sub>max, anaerobic
threshold, and anaerobic power with respect to fatigue index between the lower extremity
injury group and the control group. However, no significant difference was found in knee
isokinetic muscular function between the lower extremity injury group and the control
group.</p><p>Soccer is a high-intensity, intermittent, and non-continuous exercise, in which team play
is important and where there may be rapid switching between offense and defense. In
particular, as pivoting on the axis of rotation, turning in a slow-down situation, or
landing movements after jumps are repeatedly required in soccer, there is a high risk of
lower extremity injuries among soccer players<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, soccer players generally return to play after the
effectiveness of any post-injury rehabilitation program is evaluated<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
when returning to play, it is important for players to have sufficient aerobic exercise
capacity for continuous movement during a 90-minute soccer game. In other words, the
exercise intensity when running during a soccer match should reach about 80% of
VO<sub>2</sub>max, similar to the anaerobic threshold<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
VO<sub>2</sub>max and anaerobic threshold levels were found to be lower in the lower
extremity injury group than in the control group. Some studies have suggested that decreased
aerobic exercise capacity in athletes can lead to early fatigue and sports injuries<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is thought that soccer players with injuries in the
lower extremities need to be followed up with VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, and measures
must be put in place to reduce the risk of re-injury and improve aerobic exercise capacity
when designing physical fitness training programs after lower extremity injury.</p><p>In addition, soccer is a 90-minute game with first and second halves, but soccer players
need anaerobic exercise capacity to perform instantaneously or repeated movements within a
short time<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study showed no significant difference
in peak power and average power regarding anaerobic power between the lower extremity injury
group and the control group. However, fatigue index was found to be higher in the lower
extremity injury group. The fatigue index is used to analyze the tendency to reduce from
peak anaerobic power to minimum power. Therefore, reinforced training programs for soccer
players are needed to increase fatigue resistance and maintain peak power after lower
extremity injuries.</p><p>Soccer is associated with a high incidence of injuries in the lower extremities. Since
joint instability, reduced muscle strength, and muscular unbalance between agonist and
antagonist muscles have been suggested as the main risk factors for injuries in the lower
extremities, lower extremity muscular function is important<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> and the return of muscle strength to pre-injury level is a
criterion for ending rehabilitation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the results of the present study, there was no significant difference in knee extension,
flexion, and knee extension/flexion ratio between both groups. Frisch et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that there was no difference
in muscle strength before and after injury in soccer players, which was similar to the
results of the present study. This is thought to be because the main active muscles during a
soccer game are the quadriceps muscles and hamstring, and thus, emphasis was placed on lower
extremity muscle strengthening exercise to prevent re-injury.</p><p>The present study has limitations. Only one high school soccer team was analyzed in the
present study. Moreover, player position, severity of injuries, duration of rehabilitation,
return period after rehabilitation treatment in the lower extremity injury group, and
standard values for aerobic exercise capacity, anaerobic power, and knee isokinetic muscular
function among high school soccer players were not considered. However, the present study
should provide basic data for creating post-injury training programs for high school soccer
players with lower extremity injuries.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed differences in aerobic exercise
capacity with respect to cardiorespiratory function and anaerobic threshold and anaerobic
power in terms of fatigue index between high school soccer players with lower extremity
injury and a control group. However, there was no difference in knee isokinetic muscular
function between the groups. Therefore, it seems necessary to establish training programs
that can maximize aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity for soccer players with lower
extremity injuries.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Byun</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Training effects of soccer players in the physiological
