Approximately 15% of all cases of spontaneous ICH occur in the thalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The thalamus is a deep brain structure and is an important center for the transmission of neural signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Due to its anatomical location and the vital functions that it performs, the decision of conservative or surgical management for TH remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Management is influenced mainly by the clinical experience of the treating surgeon and the volume of the hematoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients with minor TH, especially volumes less than 10&#x000a0;cc, usually obtain favorable outcomes when treated with conservative measures. However, patients with major TH, greater than 30&#x000a0;cc, have mortality rates of more than 80%, no matter what treatment is selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moderate TH (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;mL) constitutes more than half of all cases of TH, and these patients have a mortality rate of more than 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As moderate TH is the most common form of TH, its prognosis carries the greatest weight in calculating the prognosis of all forms of TH. In patients with moderate TH, conservative treatment alone versus surgical treatment is naturally a difficult decision to make. Because surgical treatment is invasive, adjacent structures may be damaged and neural pathways may be disrupted during surgical evacuation of a hematoma, thereby aggravating the degree of neurologic deficits or creating new ones. Meanwhile, conservative treatment alone does not offer the involved thalamic tissue the same type of relief that evacuation offers and is therefore felt to be a limited strategy in improving neurologic function. The limitations of both therapeutic strategies provide considerable room for better approaches or combinations of approaches.</p><p>Two recognized mechanisms of brain injury from ICH have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Primary injury happens at the time of initial hemorrhage when direct damage to brain tissue occurs either secondary to the hematoma itself or to its mass effect on surrounding brain tissue. Secondary injury happens at some time following initial hemorrhage and includes neuronal death from either the inflammatory response to the hematoma, the release of toxic materials and other cytokines, the breakdown of the brain blood barrier, apoptosis, or the development of edema. While the pathophysiology of ICH provides many potential approaches for its treatment, enlargement of the hematoma and the development of surrounding edema have been identified as major contributors to the high morbidity and mortality of ICH and have thus been the major focus of potential treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture, one of the major branches of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has long been used to treat acute stroke, including hemorrhagic stroke, in China as well as in many other East Asian countries. Acupuncture&#x02019;s utility in the treatment of non-hemorrhagic stroke, which is now documented by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2002), has been widely researched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In recent years, a number of studies using modern technologies have shown that acupuncture may have neuroprotective effects following hemorrhagic stroke as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One preclinical systematic review of 19 animal studies showed that GV20 (Baihui) based acupuncture can improve neurologic outcome by regulating the inflammatory response to a hematoma, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, reducing cerebral edema, maintaining ATP supply, promoting nerve regeneration, maintaining neuronal membrane integrity, and promoting hematoma resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In another animal study, acupuncture at the DU20 acupoint was reported to have a neuroprotective effect on cerebral hemorrhage by inhibiting Notch-Hes signaling in rat basal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It has also been reported that electro-acupuncture treatment at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint may accelerate ICH-induced angiogenesis via the up-regulation of the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein and therefore may enhance recovery following hemorrhagic cerebral injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A separate study confirmed that treatment at the ST36 acupoint may aid recovery following central nervous system intracerebral hemorrhage in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although animal studies have led to progress in determining how acupuncture exerts its benefits in the treatment of acute hemorrhagic stroke, the determination of its clinical value remains incompletely assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, no organized study has reported on the effects of acupuncture in patients with acute moderate TH. Specifically, no prior study has examined whether or not the use of acupuncture combined with conventional treatments improves the prognosis of moderate TH patients compared to conventional treatments alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>We hypothesize that the addition of acupuncture to conventional treatments will improve neurological prognosis in TH patients.

NIHSS is used to describe neurological deficits in stroke patients, and it strongly predicts the likelihood of a patient&#x02019;s recovery after stroke. The NIHSS is comprised of 11 test items including level of consciousness, gaze, visual field defects, facial palsy, upper extremity motor, lower extremity motor, limb ataxia, sensory ability, language, dysphagia, and neglect.

In a previous study, NIHSS scores in each subject group exhibited a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 4.2 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This assumes a difference of 2.3 points between the groups, as shown in a previous study on moderate TH. A sample size of 488 provides 80% power (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) to detect a beneficial effect of early acupuncture therapy on the primary outcome, assuming a 10% non-adherence to treatment and a 3% loss to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results will be presented as mean score plus or minus standard deviation and as percentages. Categorical data will be analyzed with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate. Continuous data will be analyzed with the Student&#x02019;s t test or Pearson&#x02019;s test where appropriate. Multi-ranked data will be analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences will be considered statistically significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (two-tailed). All statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 13.0; SPSS; Chicago, Illinois, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, we will observe the effect of acupuncture therapy on patients with acute TH. The findings of this project are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in improving the prognosis of patients with moderate TH. To minimize bias, stratified block randomization will be used according to sex and age, and the outcomes reviewer will be blinded. Subjects will be treated alone in a treatment room in order to avoid any communication with other subjects.</p><p>Generally speaking, no ideal placebo-controlled acupuncture trials have been performed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Because recent acupuncture trials have examined so-called sham acupuncture techniques, including: needling of acupuncture points through non-penetrating needles, needling of non-acupuncture points, and needling of acupuncture points that are not indicated for that specific condition, these prior trials have not accurately reflected TCM theory and therefore have not properly assessed it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Further complicating things is that sham acupuncture has been shown to have some efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In China, many patients and their families have had acupuncture at some time in their lives or are at least familiar with the acupuncture process. Therefore, it would be difficult to design a trial assessing the utility of sham acupuncture versus real acupuncture while keeping the patient blinded.</p><p>The decision was made to examine patients with left sided TH separately from patients with right sided TH. In the majority of patients, Broca&#x02019;s cortical area and Wernicke&#x02019;s cortical area are located in the left hemisphere. Therefore, patients with left hemisphere stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) are at risk for language deficits. Similarly, patients with right sided insults are at risk for symptoms of visual neglect. Both language deficits and visual neglect can have a profound impact on the way a patient responds to treatment and rehabilitation of other neurologic deficits. Therefore, to account for the potentially confounding effects of language deficits and visual neglect respectively, patients were subdivided into right and left TH subgroups.</p><p>Along the same lines, not all patients have their language centers located in their left hemisphere. While the majority of left handed patients have their language centers in the left hemisphere, some do have them in the right hemisphere. Therefore, in this study, we have only included right handed patients.</p><p>Another potentially confounding factor is the involvement of adjacent brain tissue as a secondary result of the initial thalamic insult. Adjacent brain tissue can necrose either directly via extension of the thalamic bleed or indirectly via mass effect from the thalamic bleed and/or edema related to the thalamic bleed. Areas at specifically high risk include the genu of the internal capsule which lies lateral to the thalamus, the posterior limb of the internal capsule which lies posterolateral to the thalamus, the anterior limb of the internal capsule which lies anterolateral to the thalamus, and the peri-thalamic/peri-ventricular white matter which lies superior to the thalamus. Involvement of the genu of the internal capsule, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and adjacent white matter could result in paralysis. Involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule could also result in sensory loss or impaired comprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Finally, involvement of the anterior limb of the internal capsule could result in cognitive issues. Involvement of any of these areas could potentially impact how a patient recovers and/or sway the post-stroke assessment scores in one direction or another depending on how many of the affected patients ended up in the control group or the intervention group. To combat this, we utilized two mechanisms. First, we excluded patients from the study whose TH on admission CT demonstrated extension of the insult beyond the thalamus. However, admission CT often does not disclose the true area affected by the insult. CT performed 90&#x000a0;days later is much more sensitive in demonstrating the insult&#x02019;s true encompassment. We therefore further subdivided the groups by size. While all subjects in the study have moderate thalamic hemorrhage, groups were further subdivided into subjects with 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;cc of TH and 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;cc of TH. Patients with 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;cc of TH are much less likely to experience insults to brain tissue external to the thalamus than patients with 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;cc of TH as a result of the smaller size of the initial bleed. We also plan to retrospectively analyze the results of CT scans performed 90&#x000a0;days following the insult to determine what percent of patients in each group experienced extension of their primary insult to tissue beyond the thalamus and how this may have affected the results in that group. After dividing patients by side of hemorrhage and size of hemorrhage four intervention groups were established, and along with the corresponding four control groups, this totaled eight distinct subject groups.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that patients with hand paresis only following stroke may not only be the most likely to benefit from acupuncture therapy but also the most likely to experience complete resolution of their neurologic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As a result, it is important, if able, to determine the results of our intervention in patients with hand paresis only. As only patients with moderate thalamic hemorrhage will be enrolled in this trial, it is unlikely that our study will include many, if any, subjects with hand paresis only. However, if there are subjects with hand paresis, the results of our intervention will be analyzed retrospectively following conclusion of the trial.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is NIHSS result. While the NIHSS is a fine test, its comprehensiveness is somewhat lacking. In fact, previous studies examining interventions in stroke patients may have failed due to their sole reliance on the NIHSS as an outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, additional tests measuring paralysis, language, visual neglect, and stroke outcome were also included in this study.</p><p>Under strict quality control, this trial will attempt to answer the question of whether or not acupuncture can improve neurologic outcome following moderate TH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment commenced in January 2017, and it is anticipated that the trial will be completed by March 2021.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computer tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOS</term><def><p>Glasgow outcome scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>Intracranial hemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICP</term><def><p>Intracranial pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STRICTA</term><def><p>Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TH</term><def><p>Thalamic hemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Individual participant data (IPD) will be shared through Research Manager (Resman) over internet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medresman.org/">http://www.medresman.org</ext-link>) after March 2021.
