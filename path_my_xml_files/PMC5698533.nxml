The current standard of care is to perform thyroidectomy by an open technique.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This is generally well tolerated and has proven an effective and efficient way of removing thyroid tissue. Even though well tolerated, open thyroidectomy leaves the patient with an approximately eight centimeter scar &#x02013; a non-cosmetic result. This fact has generated investigation into a number of cosmetically favorable approaches in performing thyroid surgery. Endoscopically assisted open thyroid surgery with reduced incision size and endoscopic thyroid surgery through the axilla or anterior chest wall are the most common surgical innovations. Although promising, thyroid surgery utilizing endoscopy has so far had limited application, and the majority of thyroidectomy must still be performed openly.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, there is need for a method to improve healing and reduce scar formation.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Much research has gone into topical agents applied to incision sites.

This study obtained University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board approval. Patients undergoing a hemi- or total thyroidectomy were included in this study. All patients had to accept an incision site of 8&#x000a0;cm. Any incision made to be longer than 8&#x000a0;cm were removed from the study. All patients were 19 years of age or older. Patients were excluded if they were allergic to pollen, honey or bees.</p><p id="p0025">Consecutive patients fitting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were approached to participate in the study by the research coordinator. If patients were agreeable to the study, the research coordinator used a closed envelope system to randomize each patient to either the treatment or control arm. The primary surgeon who performed all the surgeries was not aware of the study arm throughout the study. The treatment arm consisted of patients using a honey gel paste (MediHoney<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) containing 95% active <italic>Leptospermum</italic> honey. The paste was applied by hand to the incision site once per day during the 4 weeks after surgery and left in place to dry. Patients were instructed to clean the incision site daily with mild soap and water. If patients anticipated extended sun exposure, they were to place sunscreen on the incision site. In similar fashion, the control arm cleaned the incision site daily with mild soap and water and applied sunscreen on the incision site if they anticipated sun exposure; however, they did not use any form a scar reducing agent or antibacterial cream.</p><p id="p0030">Patients underwent formal objective and subjective analysis at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. At the scar analysis visit, patient's sex, age, and Fitzpatrick skin classification was recorded. The scar was then assessed subjectively and then objectively using a validated scar assessment scale used known as the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Objective scoring was performed by the senior resident, who was also unaware of the treatment arm of each patient.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>Patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS)</bold>.

Thirty-seven patients consented to partake in the study, 18 of whom never completed the long-term scar analysis assessment. The cohort that completed the study was analyzed, which consisted of 12 control arm patients and 9 treatment arm patients. There were 4 males in the control arm and 2 males in the treatment arm. The average age was 49 years old and 53 years old for the control and treatment arm, respectively. With respect to the Fitzpatrick skin classification, the control group had 1 individual with type 1 skin, 3 with type 2 skin, 4 with type 3 skin and 4 with type 4 skin. The treatment arm had 2 with type 2 skin, 3 with type 3 skin, 2 with type 4 skin and 2 with type 5 skin. Given the limited number of patients in this study and the varying Fitzpatrick skin classification observed in these 21 participants, statistical comparison based on skin classification was not performed.

Honeybees, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, gather nectar from flowering plants for its production. Honey is composed of approximately 40% fructose, 30% glucose, 5% sucrose, and 20% water, as well as vitamins, minerals, enzymes and amino acids in combinations unique to each variety.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Honey has long been used in medicine, but its use in modern medicine has been limited until recently. Looking back, Discords and Hippocrates advocated for the use of honey as a vehicle for carrying therapeutic agents.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> One of the first recorded uses of honey as a medicinal treatment is from the Edwin Smith papyrus; it describes the Egyptians using honey as treatment to prevent infection in surgical wounds.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p id="p0060">Honey has well-established antibacterial properties. Research has shown the hyperosmotic nature and low pH-value of honey contributes to its antibacterial properties. In addition, its hydrogen peroxide activity acts like a detergent giving it comparable antibacterial activity to phenolic acid.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Manuka honey has additional antibiotic properties, which are not dependent on peroxidase activity. This has been described as unique manuka factor and has recently been linked to methylglyoxal. It is for this reason that Manuka honey has become the most prominently used variety of honey for medical purposes.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="p0065">In terms of healing, honey works in a number of ways. As a result of its hypersaturated nature it is thought to act osmotically drawing fluid and nutrients to the area of application in tandem with keeping the wound moist.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In histological studies, it appears to stimulate growth of developing tissues, leading to faster tissue repair.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Honey has also been observed to attenuate the inflammatory phase of healing.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In addition, animal studies have documented improvement in epitheliazation.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="p0070">Unfortunately, there are a number of downfalls regarding the topical use of honey over the anterior aspect of the neck. The honey arm had trouble maintaining compliancy, and a number of patients dropped out of the study. A major complaint of the &#x0201c;honey arm&#x0201d; involved the sticky and viscous nature of Manuka honey. Participants complained that the Manuka honey got on their clothing and trapped foreign debris in the area of their incision. Participants also found the daily application of the honey excessive. There were no reported complications from patients or the blinded observer. This study illustrated there is essentially no difference between those applying honey and those in the control arm. The only significant benefit with those using honey is the potential improvement in pigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0075">In summary, although animal and histological studies have shown improved epithelial repair with the application of honey, this study demonstrates that no clinical effect can be appreciated when applying honey for scar reduction. The cause of the discordance between this study and prior animal and histological studies is unclear and requires further evaluation.
