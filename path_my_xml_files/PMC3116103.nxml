The exclusion criteria were: 1) new onset diseases that potentially impact on lipid levels, such as diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases, or other endocrinologic diseases, within 3 months, 2) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &#x02265;3-fold the upper normal limit, 3) administration of medications within the last 3 months that might affect lipid levels, and 4) baseline CRP levels &#x02265;10 mg/L. One hundred-twenty (n=120) hypercholesterolemic patients receiving statins required additional reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) to meet the target levels of the National Cholesterol Education Program were divided into two groups, the ezetimibe group (10 mg of ezetimibe, n=60) and the control group (n=60).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref> A patient in the ezetimibe group was excluded in the analysis, because follow-up CRP level was over 10 mg/L. A third group of hypercholesterolemic patients with similar baseline CRP levels and without statin therapy was enrolled and treated with statin (statin group, n=59).</p><p>CRP and lipid levels were measured before and after management for 2 months. After overnight fasting, blood samples were obtained. Concentrations of total cholesterol and trigly-ceride were determined by the enzymatic method using an automatic analyzer (Model 7150, Hitachi, Japan). LDL-C was calculated by the Friedewald equation. The concentration of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured by the direct method using immunoinhibition (Wako, Japan). The concentration of CRP was determined by the nephelometer method using an N High Sensitivity CRP kit (Dade Behring Marburg GmbH, Germany). Interassay coefficients of variation were 7.0% and 5.2% for the controls, with levels of 1.43 mg/dL and 1.74 mg/dL, respectively. The intra-assay co-efficient of variation was 1.5-3.0%.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD. Statistical analysis was performed using the Social Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For CRP, lipoprotein (a) and triglyceride, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare concentrations before and after therapy, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences between groups. For other variables, a paired t-test was used to compare concentrations before and after therapy, and the Student t-test was used to evaluate differences between groups. Relationships between the parameters were analyzed by the Spearman correlation method. The distribution of discrete variables was analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. A two-tailed p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the ezetimibe group and the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), except the number of patients with ischemic heart diseases (p=0.026). There were no differences in baseline lipid profiles and CRP levels between the ezetimibe group and the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). CRP levels were similar between the ezetimibe and the statin groups. However, LDL-C levels were higher in the statin group than in the ezetimibe group, due to different inclusion criteria (138.5&#x000b1;21.2 mg/dL vs. 172.9&#x000b1;28.4 mg/dL, p=0.000) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Ezetimibe decreased cholesterol and LDL-C levels by 20.2% (from 228.1&#x000b1;31.1 mg/dL to 182.1&#x000b1;25.6 mg/dL, p=0.000) and 28.1% (from 138.5&#x000b1;21.2 mg/dL to 99.6&#x000b1;20.0 mg/dL, p=0.000), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). However, ezetimibe did not reduce CRP levels (from 0.83&#x000b1;0.68 mg/L to 1.14&#x000b1;1.21 mg/L, p=0.11). CRP levels did not change in the control group (p=0.42).</p><p>Changes in CRP levels were not associated with changes in LDL-C in the control (r=0.14, p=0.31), the ezetimibe (r=0.03, p=0.85), the control+ezetimibe (r=-0.02, p=0.87), and the statin groups (r=0.09, p=0.50) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Changes in CRP levels were negatively associated with baseline CRP levels in the control+ezetimibe (r=-0.38, p=0.000) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), the control (r=-0.55, p=0.000), and the statin groups (r=-0.60, p=0.000), and in the ezetimibe group with borderline significance (r=-0.22, p=0.09). In the ezetimibe group, changes in CRP levels were negatively related to baseline HDL-C levels (r=-0.35, p=0.007). During the follow-up period, a patient in the ezetimibe group experienced elevation of AST and ALT &#x02265;3-fold the upper normal limit. No patient experienced elevation of creatine kinase &#x02265;10-fold the upper normal limit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case-controlled study demonstrated that ezetimibe, a new cholesterol lowering drug, failed to decrease CRP levels in patients already taking statins, despite marked reduction in cholesterol and LDL-C levels.

In the JUPITER study, rosuvastatin in patients with elevated CRP levels reduced CRP levels from 4.2 mg/L to 2.2 mg/L after 12 months, and reduced further to 1.8 mg/L after 24 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26)</xref> Therefore, difference in the duration of statin therapy may explain the discrepancy between these two studies. It is possible that the addition of ezetimibe to statin simultaneously or sequentially facilitate reduction of CRP levels without further reduction compared with the long-term statin therapy. Lower baseline CRP in the present study may partially be explained by the effects of long-term statin therapy.</p><p>In another study, the addition of ezetimibe to patients taking statins decreased CRP levels in Caucasian patients but not in African and Hispanic patients, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. As such, there is a possibility of ethnic difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref> Recently, pooled data including the above two studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref> showed that addition of ezetimibe to patients taking statins decreased CRP levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28)</xref></p><p>Statins reduce cardiovascular events not only in hypercholesterolemic patients, but also in high-risk patients with normal or low cholesterol levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref> It has been suggested that the cardioprotective effects of statins are mediated both by their potent effects on cholesterol levels and by other pathways, such as the inflammatory, oxidative, and thrombotic processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> Almost all reports have demonstrated that statins reduce CRP levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref></p><p>However, It is not known whether the pleiotropic effects of statins are mediated by cholesterol reduction per se, or by other mechanisms.

In the control group, changes in CRP levels were negatively related to those in HDL-C levels with borderline significance (r=-0.24, p=0.063). This may have occurred as the inflammation processes decrease HDL-C levels.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The number of patients is smaller than that in previous studies. However, baseline CRP levels were well balanced in contrast to previous studies. As described above, lower baseline CRP levels may account for the difference between the outcomes of the present study and that of previous studies. This study was performed in a single hospital in Asia. The effect of ezetimibe may be variable between ethnic populations. Ischemic heart disease was more frequent in the ezetimibe group than in the control group, and this difference may influence the results.</p><p>In summary, ezetimibe failed to decrease CRP levels in patients taking statins in spite of marked reduction of total and LDL-C levels. Changes in CRP levels were not associated with that of LDL-C at all. Therefore, cholesterol reduction itself may not be able to reduce inflammatory processes in patients taking statins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This Research was supported by the Chung-Ang University Research Grants in 2009.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baigent</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Keech</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kearney</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and safety of cholesterol-lowering treatment: prospective meta-analysis of data from 90,056 participants in 14 randomised trials of statins</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>366</volume><fpage>1267</fpage><lpage>1278</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16214597</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>In the shadow of the "Statin Festival"</article-title><source>Korean Circ J</source><year>2006</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>77</fpage><lpage>83</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Forrester</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Libby</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The inflammation hypothesis and its potential relevance to statin therapy</article-title><source>Am J Cardiol</source><year>2007</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>732</fpage><lpage>738</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17317382</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davignon</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Beneficial cardiovascular pleiotropic effects of statins</article-title><source>Circulation</source><year>2004</year><volume>109</volume><issue>23 Suppl 1</issue><fpage>III39</fpage><lpage>III43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15198965</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McFarlane</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>Muniyappa</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Francisco</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sowers</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical review 145: pleiotropic effects of statins: lipid reduction and beyond</article-title><source>J Clin Endocrinol Metab</source><year>2002</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>1451</fpage><lpage>1458</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11932263</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Atherosclerosis: an inflammatory disease</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1999</year><volume>340</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>126</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9887164</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Libby</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current concepts of the pathogenesis of the acute coronary syndromes</article-title><source>Circulation</source><year>2001</year><volume>104</volume><fpage>365</fpage><lpage>372</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11457759</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kuller</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Tracy</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaten</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Meilahn</surname><given-names>EN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relation of C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease in the MRFIT nested case-control study.
