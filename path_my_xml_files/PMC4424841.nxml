The ratio between the individually dominant gamma and theta frequencies is believed to determine an individual&#x02019;s memory capacity. The aim of this study was to establish a causal relationship between the gamma/theta ratio and WM/STM capacity by means of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). To achieve this, tACS was delivered at a frequency below the individual theta frequency. Thereby the individual ratio of gamma to theta frequencies was changed, resulting in an increase of STM capacity. Healthy human participants (<italic>N</italic> = 33) were allocated to two groups, one receiving verum tACS, the other underwent a sham control protocol. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured before stimulation and analyzed with regard to the properties of PAC between theta and gamma frequencies to determine individual stimulation frequencies. After stimulation, EEG was recorded again in order to find after-effects of tACS in the oscillatory features of the EEG. Measures of STM and WM were obtained before, during and after stimulation. Frequency spectra and behavioral data were compared between groups and different measurement phases. The tACS- but not the sham stimulated group showed an increase in STM capacity during stimulation. WM was not affected in either groups. An increase in task-related theta amplitude after stimulation was observed only for the tACS group. These augmented theta amplitudes indicated that the manipulation of individual theta frequencies was successful and caused the increase in STM capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>short-term memory</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>theta-gamma coupling</kwd><kwd>tACS</kwd><kwd>phase-amplitude coupling</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="68"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="8243"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain oscillations, in particular in the theta (3&#x02013;8 Hz) and gamma (&#x0003e;30 Hz) frequency ranges, have been suggested to be key features in cognitive processes (Buzs&#x000e1;ki, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lisman and Buzs&#x000e1;ki, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lisman and Jensen, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), including memory performance (D&#x000fc;zel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hanslmayr and Staudigl, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We will focus on two subcomponents of memory, short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WM). Even though these two concepts are sometimes not clearly differentiated, we will use them to describe two theoretically different concepts: WM is a system that stores information, manipulates it for a short time and has limited capacity (Baddeley, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). STM in turn, does not involve a manipulation but rather refers to a mere storage of information (Conway et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Engle, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Baddeley, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Research over the past decades gathered evidence for the role of theta and gamma rhythms for WM and STM (Klimesch et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Kahana et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). For example, an increase in amplitude of frontal midline theta activity was shown with higher load in WM tasks in both electroencephalogram (EEG; Gevins et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Onton et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and MEG studies (Jensen and Tesche, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Osipova et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It has also been shown that gamma band responses in EEG are stronger with memory items that are later remembered compared to those that are forgotten when memorizing was not instructed (Gruber et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Similar findings are known for MEG (Herrmann et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jokisch and Jensen, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Furthermore, the interplay between multiple frequencies has been shown to be of functional relevance for cognition (e.g., Axmacher et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Jensen and Mazaheri, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; for comprehensive reviews see: Jensen and Colgin, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Canolty and Knight, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Several studies indicate that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma waves may serve as a mechanism to implement STM and WM in the human brain (Lisman and Jensen, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Roux and Uhlhaas, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The theta-gamma coding theory of STM and WM states that each gamma cycle represents one memory item while each theta-cycle represents the rehearsal of the list of all items held in storage (Lisman and Idiart, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Jensen and Lisman, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lisman, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This explains the limited capacity of these systems, which is determined by the number of gamma-cycles that &#x0201c;fit&#x0201d; onto one theta wave (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In support of this theory, it has been shown that the strength of PAC between theta and gamma frequencies as well as the underlying theta frequency depends on WM load (Axmacher et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In a delayed match-to-sample task, increased PAC was found for remembered in relation to forgotten items (K&#x000f6;ster et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Most direct support for this theory was provided in an experiment showing that the theta to gamma cycle-length-ratio in fact correlates with STM capacity at fronto-central EEG electrodes (Kami&#x00144;ski et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of the theta gamma coding theory. (A)</bold> The individual theta wave (blue) carries a gamma wave (black) with phase dependent amplitude. Each gamma cycle within one theta cycle represents one item in short-term memory (STM). The maximal number of items in STM is 6 in this case. <bold>(B)</bold> During transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at a frequency below the individual theta frequency (red), STM capacity is increased to 7 items. At a lower theta frequency more gamma waves fit onto each theta wave.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-09-00257-g0001"/></fig><p>Current evidence for an explanation of STM or WM capacity in terms of cross-frequency-coupling so far is correlative and therefore could be epiphenomenal. Therefore, in order to establish a causal relationship between the interplay of theta and gamma frequencies to STM or WM, we aimed at externally manipulating brain oscillations and thereby inducing changes in STM or WM characteristics. With a stable gamma frequency, down-regulating the ongoing theta frequency is intended to extend the STM capacity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a relatively new method (Antal et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) with growing influence on research in brain oscillations (Antal and Paulus, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Herrmann et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Reato et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). tACS is a noninvasive method that modulates neural oscillations in a frequency-specific fashion by the application of alternating currents at the scalp. It thereby offers the possibility to test causal relationships between neural oscillations and brain functioning. It has been shown that tACS is in fact able to modulate brain oscillations and induce functional effects on both the behavioral and electrophysiological level. An increase of ongoing alpha amplitude was measured after 10 min of tACS at the individual alpha frequency (IAF; Zaehle et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) that can last at least 30 min after tACS offset (Neuling et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Apart from this amplitude effect, modulations regarding a subject&#x02019;s alpha peak frequency have also been reported (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Cecere et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the first concurrent EEG-tACS study (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), stimulation at 10 Hz caused the variance of peak frequencies to decrease during tACS compared to a sham control group. This indicates a shift of the alpha peak frequencies towards the stimulation frequency in those subjects whose peak was not at 10 Hz before stimulation. The study also showed that directly after stimulation, the frequency effect disappears while the amplitude at the alpha peak frequency stays elevated. More behavioral evidence for a change in the endogenous alpha frequency stems from the analysis of timing of the sound induced double flash illusion (Shams et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The timing window of the illusion was enlarged with tACS below the IAF and shortened with tACS above IAF (Cecere et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In previous work, tACS proved capable to alter different cognitive functions for example memory functions in the theta (Polan&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), auditory perception in the alpha (Neuling et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>), voluntary movement in the beta (Pogosyan et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and bistable motion perception in the gamma range (Str&#x000fc;ber et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Few studies used theta tACS to manipulate WM/STM performance so far. Reaction times in response to a delayed match-to-sample STM task were reduced by 6 Hz tACS that was phase-synchronous over parietal and frontal cortices, while desynchronized tACS had the opposite effect (Polan&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). An increase in WM performance was found after tACS at an individual&#x02019;s dominant theta frequency, as defined by the IAF minus 5 Hz, an effect observed in different WM tasks (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This was most prominent when tACS was delivered at left parietal areas. Effects of theta tACS on WM during stimulation were reported recently with prefrontal tACS at 4.5 Hz (Meiron and Lavidor, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) in a 2-back task.</p><p>One well established measure of STM is the forward digit span task (Wechsler, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) in which subjects are presented with lists of digits of increasing length that they need to remember for a short interval and then reproduce in either their chronological (forward) order. Because the forward digit span task does not involve any mental manipulation of the memory items whatsoever, it is a task that measures the mere storage capacity of STM (Engle, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The same task with mentally reversing the list order is called backward digit span task and demands a mental manipulation (i.e., reversal) of the list. Therefore the backward digit span task can be considered a task that rather measures WM. As STM and WM do not seem to be two completely independent processes (Engle et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Cowan, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Aben et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), it is possible that both use the same storage system to memorize the presented items. To find effects of tACS on both WM and STM, forward and backward digit span performance is compared from before to after stimulation as well as in three blocks during stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) for two groups of subjects: one receiving verum, and one a sham stimulation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Design of the experiment.

Stimulation sites along the central line of the head have been shown to be successful in enhancing frequency-specific EEG amplitudes (Neuling et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or manipulating endogenous frequencies (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Cecere et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore stimulation sites for tACS were chosen to stimulate this wide-spread network in this experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-five healthy subjects participated in this experiment after giving informed consent.

Participants were assigned to a tACS (verum, <italic>N</italic> = 17) and a sham (control, <italic>N</italic> = 16) group in a randomized single-blind fashion. Except for the actual stimulation, participants in both the tACS and sham group were treated the same to blind them with regard to the experimental groups. Groups did not differ in age (tACS: 25.72 &#x000b1; 2.54, sham: 25.77 &#x000b1; 2.93, <italic>t</italic><sub>(32)</sub> = &#x02212;0.047, <italic>p</italic> = 0.963) or gender (tACS: 7 female, 10 male, sham: 7 female, 9 male, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.022, <italic>p</italic> = 0.881).

With the forward digit span task we tested the individual STM capacity, while backward digit span measured WM performance in this paradigm. Additionally the three-back task was measured before and after stimulation to have a second estimate of WM capacity. It was not measured during stimulation because the maximal length of tACS of about 20 min (Nitsche and Paulus, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) set time constraints on the design.</p><p>All tasks were controlled using Presentation (Version 14.08, Neurobehavioral Systems Inc, Albany, CA., USA).

Digits were shown one by one for 900 ms with a 600 ms inter stimulus interval. Forward digit span was assessed before backward digit span in all cases.</p><p>The stimulation phase consisted of three repetitions or blocks of the digit span task. During the stimulation phase, the task was changed to have a fixed duration of 3 min each direction in each of the three stimulation blocks. The list length was decreased or increased by one digit and task presentation resumed, depending on whether subjects reproduced three lists of a given length with or without errors, respectively. For example, if one subject reached list length six, and responds correctly to the first, second and third presentation of a list with six digits, the subsequently presented list will be increased to a total of seven digits. In case of three incorrect responses to the same list length, the subsequent list would contain five digits. As these two cases may alternate, it is possible and intended to repeatedly present the same subject with lists of the same length. As a consequence, this algorithms converges at a subject&#x02019;s individual STM capacity limit.</p><p>Each of the three blocks started with a list two digits shorter than the maximal length achieved during the baseline assessment for both forward and backward trials respectively. Thereby an equal amount of backward and forward digit span data was assessed and the subject&#x02019;s performance was kept around their individual limits.</p><p>As a response, the subject was instructed to enter the digits of the respective list via the keyboard and confirm their answer by pressing the space bar.</p><p>For statistical analyses, the mean list length of correctly answered lists was analyzed, as this constitutes a more reliable measure than the maximal correct list length (Wechsler, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), especially during the stimulation phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Three-Back Task</title><p>A randomized sequence of 200 letters was presented one by one on a computer screen for 1000 ms each with an interstimulus interval of 2000 ms (retention).

Recording reference was positioned on the tip of the nose and FCz served as ground. The EEG was digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and band-pass-filtered online between 0.1 and 250 Hz.</p><p>Signals were amplified to a range of &#x000b1; 3.2768 mV at a resolution of 0.1 &#x003bc;V in order to be able to properly record gamma band activity. Note that EEG recorded during tACS at 1 mA produces an electric artifact in the range of several mV (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Therefore, in our experiment most of the EEG channels during stimulation would have saturated and EEG could not have been restored from these data if it were recorded. With recording parameters during tACS on a lower resolution (e.g., 0.5 &#x003bc;V, range, &#x000b1; 16.384 mV) gamma activity cannot reliably be measured, as gamma amplitudes are usually below 0.5 &#x003bc;V (e.g., Naue et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Electrical Stimulation</title><p>Electrical stimulation was applied using a battery-operated stimulator system (Eldith, Neuroconn, Ilmenau, Germany). The stimulator emitted a sinusoidal alternating current to the participant&#x02019;s scalp via two sponge-electrodes (5 &#x000d7; 7 cm, Neuroconn, Ilmenau, Germany). The electrodes were fixed at positions FCz and Pz (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) underneath the elastic EEG cap with impedances below 10 k&#x003a9;.</p><p>Stimulation strength was set individually below the participant&#x02019;s phosphene or perception threshold (min/max/mean/std: 400/1300/843/260 &#x003bc;A) with no difference between tACS and sham control group (<italic>t</italic><sub>(31)</sub> = &#x02212;1.095, <italic>p</italic> = 0.282, two-tailed). Stimulation strength was determined for each subject by administering a staircase procedure, starting at 100 &#x003bc;A. After each upward step of 100 &#x003bc;A, the subject was asked to report any sensations related to tACS. Once the subject reported either phosphenes, skin sensations or the like, the final stimulation strength was adjusted 100 &#x003bc;A below that threshold. Current was build up and reduced for 10 s before and after stimulation (tACS) or without stimulation in between (sham). Over all, subjects in the tACS group received ca. 18 min of tACS over the three blocks.</p><p>An <italic>ad hoc</italic> analysis of task-related EEG during the 3-back task from the pre-stimulation phase was administered to define the individual theta frequency by means of PAC (Bruns and Eckhorn, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Onslow et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> for a typical outcome of two subjects. A frequency area of interest was manually adjusted around the local maximum within the margins of theta and gamma range in order to avoid maxima at the borders of the theta and gamma range (Black rectangles in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The theta frequency that showed maximal coupling to any gamma frequency within the specified frequency range of interest was reduced by tACS such that STM capacity should increase by one item. As an example, one subject may show strongest theta-gamma PAC for 7 and 42 Hz, which would theoretically result in a STM capacity of 42/7 = 6 items (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the first block of tACS, the stimulation frequency would be adapted such that, 42/theta = 7 items, resulting in a 6 Hz stimulation.

The capacity limit of STM was augmented as a result of tACS stimulation and as predicted by the theta-gamma coding theory (Lisman and Idiart, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Jensen and Lisman, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lisman, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The EEG results of this study suggest that theta tACS successfully modulated individual theta oscillations. Thus, tACS proved to be a powerful tool for the investigation of causal relationships between neural oscillations and behavior.</p><p>Taking the conceptual differentiation between the two versions of the digit span task into account, the results of this study can be fully explained by the theta-gamma coding model (Lisman, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Looking at the different performance levels in forward in contrast to backward digit span, it is obvious that less items can be stored in the backward condition than in the forward condition (Rosen and Engle, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). If performances in both the backward and forward digit span tasks depend on the same structures to store information, then the storage capacity of STM is not fully used in the backward digit span task. An extension of this storage would have no effect on the performance regarding the backward digit span task. This in turn means that a performance limit in the backward digit span task is caused by some other process different from the mere storage of items. One likely process to cause this limitation is the additional manipulation of items, sometimes referred to as executive attention (Engle et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>In our study, like in previous studies, the amplitude of a stimulated frequency stays elevated after tACS offset (Zaehle et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Neuling et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We administered tACS below the individual theta frequency, and therefore a shift in theta frequencies should be expected. Behavioral results indicate that the effect of tACS quickly vanishes after stimulation offset. We therefore believe that the induced shift in individual peak frequencies due to tACS also disappears immediately after tACS offset since otherwise an elevated STM performance should have been observed after stimulation as well. Unfortunately, in the current study, we were not able to analyse the EEG measured concurrently with tACS due to the strong tACS artifact which can only be removed if the tACS intervals are an integer multiple of the EEG sampling rate. Due to our inter-individual variation in tACS frequency this was not given. Therefore, the presence of a frequency shift during stimulation cannot be directly demonstrated in this study. Notwithstanding, we found an amplitude increase in the theta band after stimulation which we interpret as indirect evidence for a successful frequency modulation. In the first study that analyzed EEG recorded during tACS and with recording parameters that prevented saturation and fulfilled the afore mentioned criterion for stimulation frequencies, 10 Hz tACS has led to an increase in alpha amplitude and a decrease in variance of alpha peak frequencies, i.e., a frequency shift (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) during stimulation. After stimulation offset, however, the variance of alpha peak frequencies changed back to the pre-stimulation status, but the mean amplitude peak was still elevated (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Vossen et al. (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) recently showed that tACS slightly below the IAF can elevate the amplitude at IAF after stimulation offset. In their article they suggest a model based on spike timing dependent plasticity to explain that effect. These findings lead us to the interpretation that tACS in our study in fact changed individual theta frequencies and STM performance during stimulation. However, only the enhancement of theta amplitudes remained visible after stimulation while the shifted frequency returned to its pre-stimulation value immediately after the end of stimulation.</p><p>Previous studies manipulating WM or STM with theta tACS were heterogeneous in their outcome. Different results have been reported depending on task and electrode position. Also, most of the previously published results find behavioral aftereffects of theta tACS in contrast to our study. A post-tACS effect could be found in the visual array comparison task (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and backward digit span (Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with tACS at left parietal regions. Stimulation of the right parietal cortex led to aftereffects in forward digit span and in the 1 and 2-back task while left frontal stimulation only affected 1-back performance (Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Bilateral frontal tACS had an effect on a 2-stream 2-back task during stimulation, but no offline effect in a corresponding task (Meiron and Lavidor, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The multitude of stimulation protocols and tasks used makes a general interpretation of previous and current findings difficult though, but may well explain heterogeneous outcomes.</p><p>Earlier studies showed substantial diversity of tasks used that could in part explain the varying outcomes. Some researchers used spatial versions of STM tasks (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), or combined this with an auditory letter n-back task with n between 1 and 3 (Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There still is a discussion on the presence of different WM storage systems for auditory and visual items, partially fostered by the observation that visual capacity is usually found to exceed auditory capacity (Saults and Cowan, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fougnie and Marois, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It is therefore problematic to compare WM performance over modalities. Also, verbal and spatial information may be stored in separate brain structures (Baddeley, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Yet, the diversity of findings between the cited studies may not be explained by the variety of tasks alone. It may also be explained by differences in stimulation protocols in at least two ways. In contrast to the previous studies, we first determined the individual theta frequency and stimulated relative to that, not relying on a frequency that was kept constant across subjects (Meiron and Lavidor, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We measured the theta frequency directly by maximal theta-gamma PAC during task performance instead of estimating it on the basis of the individual alpha peak frequency at resting state (IAF&#x02014;5 Hz) (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The current method seems more accurate for our purpose, since we individually search for the theta frequency that is most strongly coupled to a gamma frequency. Another advantage of our procedure is that we estimate the individual theta frequency from EEG recorded during task performance and not during resting state. The stimulation frequencies in our study were also descriptively lower (mean: 4.62, 4.12, 3.73 Hz) than those used in other studies for example 5 Hz (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and 4.5 Hz (Meiron and Lavidor, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) since our goal was to decrease the individual theta frequency and therefore stimulate below the estimated individually dominant theta frequency.</p><p>At last, the stimulation positions may as well explain differences between studies to some extent. With our electrode positions, we intended to stimulate a wide network of parieto-frontal areas in order to modulate inter-areal communication. Another approach would be to aim at a certain part of the parietal (Jau&#x00161;ovec and Jau&#x00161;ovec, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jau&#x00161;ovec et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or frontal cortex (Meiron and Lavidor, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). With different electrode positions, certainly different brain areas are stimulated even though tACS does not focally stimulate the underlying tissue (Neuling et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>) and therefore different behavioral outcomes are to be expected.</p><p>In this experiment we can only provide indirect evidence for a manipulation of theta frequencies by showing the effect of increased theta amplitudes after stimulation. Consequently, further research is needed measuring and analyzing EEG concurrently to tACS. In an alternative scenario, however, our stimulation protocol may have only enhanced theta amplitudes but not changed its frequency. By this enhancement of theta amplitudes, STM capacity could have been modified only indirectly as a side effect of enhanced attention (Gevins et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Jensen and Tesche, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). We strongly argue for our line of argumentation for two reasons: First we find enhanced theta amplitudes after tACS offset without a corresponding behavioral effect. If an increase in theta amplitude is responsible for the observed effects, STM performance should stay elevated after stimulation. Second, converging evidence suggests that tACS can change an endogenous frequency during its application in behaving human subjects (Helfrich et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Cecere et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Ozen et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Schmidt et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Only when directly observing the frequency shift while tACS was turned on Helfrich et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) the alternative explanation that our stimulation protocol only enhanced theta amplitudes can be ruled out.</p><p>A significant change of STM performance by theta tACS has been reported in an experiment modifying the phase of parietofrontal theta oscillations (Polan&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this study, tACS was applied between P3 and Fz, resulting in 180&#x000b0; phase lag between the two positions (desynchronization) in another condition, P3 and F3 were stimulated in phase by using the central electrode as a return electrode (synchronization). The authors report an increase of reaction times to a delayed match to sample task in response to the desynchronized tACS, and a reverse effect for phase-synchronized stimulation. Our finding seems to contradict these reports since our electrode setup resembles the desynchronized stimulation. Although both results are discussed as a change in STM performance, these findings are very different in nature. A delayed match to sample task does not measure STM capacity, thus these results suggest a different interpretation. The application of desynchronized theta oscillations to left parietal and frontal cortices lead to a slower processing, which does not necessarily translate to reduced STM capacity. In conclusion, our results do not contradict Polan&#x000ed;a et al. (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), they only measure different features of STM, i.e., STM capacity instead of processing speed. In addition, the interpretation of reaction times does usually not make sense in a digit span task since subjects are deliberately given the opportunity to reconsider their response and are instructed to respond as correct, as possible.</p><p>In contrast to the previously discussed publications, our aim was to externally modulate the individually dominant theta frequency in order to induce an increase in STM capacity. This hypothesis was derived from the theta-gamma coding theory of STM/WM and directly tests this theory. All previously mentioned studies did not explicitly try to change a frequency but rather modulate theta amplitudes. None of the studies showed a change in the oscillatory response of the brain as manipulated by tACS by analyzing the frequency composition of EEG recorded after or during stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that tACS below the individual theta frequency can be used to augment the individual capacity of STM as measured via the forward digit span task. WM performance in the backward digit span task and the 3-back task is not altered by this treatment, neither during nor after stimulation. As a result of theta tACS, the amplitude of theta frequencies stays elevated beyond stimulation. This outcome adds causal evidence to the theta-gamma coding theory of STM (Lisman and Idiart, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and thereby backs up previous correlational results that supported the theory. This study deepens the knowledge about both STM and the method of tACS. This knowledge can be used first to gain a better understanding of diseases causing symptoms affecting STM performance as well as to eventually develop a tACS based treatment thereof. It also suggests that tACS can in fact modulate the frequency of EEG theta oscillations and thereby provide a useful method to study other frequency specific cognitive functions.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Designed research: JV, RJH, CSH; Performed research: JV, RJH; Contributed to analytic tools: JV, RJH, Analyzed data: JV, RJH; Wrote the paper: JV, RJH, CSH.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Acknowledgments</bold></p><p>This work was partially supported by grants <funding-source id="GS1">HE</funding-source>
