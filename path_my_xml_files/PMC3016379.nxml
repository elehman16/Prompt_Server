The virus is estimated to have infected two billion people around the world, of whom approximately 360 million are chronically infected. These chronically infected individuals are at increased risk of developing serious illness, which may progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that account for an estimated annual 500,000-700,000 deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A number of studies conducted in different countries have confirmed that universal immunisation of infants and/or adolescents is the most efficient method of reducing the disease burden of hepatitis B infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Taking into consideration the morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in 1992 that vaccination against hepatitis B should be included into the national immunisation schedules of all countries worldwide by 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The three-dose schedule of hepatitis B vaccination has been the standard immunisation schedule of choice. In countries with an adolescent hepatitis B immunisation programme, the completion rates, however, for the three-dose schedule appear to be lower than expected in certain target populations, such as adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, when compared to the option of a two-dose schedule, the three-dose schedule puts a heavier burden on the healthcare system in terms of the implementation and organisation of vaccination programmes. Hence, there has been a growing interest among public healthcare authorities and vaccine manufacturers in identifying a suitable two-dose immunisation schedule that is more convenient for use in adolescents to ensure higher completion rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A two-dose schedule (0, 6 months) of a hepatitis B vaccine (<italic>Engerix</italic>-B&#x02122;: <italic>Adult </italic>formulation, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] Biologicals, Belgium) has been approved for use in European adolescents and is also one of the recommended schedules for vaccination of adolescents aged 11-15 years in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], United States and Canada. In addition, a three-dose schedule of the <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation of this vaccine is recommended for use in children and young adults aged &#x0003c;20 years. A previous study in children and adolescents has demonstrated equivalence between a two-dose primary vaccination schedule of the <italic>Adult </italic>formulation and a three-dose schedule of the <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation of this vaccine in terms of seroprotection against hepatitis B infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Considering that the risk of acquiring hepatitis B infections is higher during early adulthood due to various lifestyle-related exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], it is critical to assess the long-term persistence of vaccine-induced immunity in young adults who have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine in their childhood.</p><p>The present study is a long-term follow-up to a primary study that has confirmed the non-inferiority of a two-dose schedule of the <italic>Adult </italic>formulation of this hepatitis B vaccine versus a three-dose schedule of the <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation, when comparing the anti-HBs seroprotection rates and anti-HBs antibody GMCs at Month 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This follow-up study evaluated the five year persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) antigens in adolescents who received the two-dose regimen of this hepatitis vaccine compared to those who received the three-dose regimen, and the ability of these subjects to mount an anamnestic response to a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine given five years after completion of primary immunisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>In 2001, healthy adolescents aged between 11 and 15 years were enrolled into a single-blind, randomised, multi-country study conducted in Belgium, Australia and Ukraine. The subjects (randomisation blocking scheme 2:1) received either two doses of <italic>Engerix</italic>-B&#x02122; <italic>Adult </italic>formulation (20 &#x003bc;g of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], thiomersal-free formulation) following a 0, 6 months schedule [Group HBV_2D] or three doses of <italic>Engerix</italic>-B&#x02122; <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation (10 &#x003bc;g of recombinant HBsAg, preservative-free formulation) following a 0, 1, 6 months schedule [Group HBV_3D]. Group HBV_2D additionally received an injection of physiological saline as placebo at second vaccination time point (Month 1) to maintain the blinding. The vaccines were administered as deep intramuscular injections (needle-length: 25 mm; gauge: 23) in the deltoid region of the arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>These subjects were then followed up for the next five years (until Year 5 time point) with pre-defined annual visits to evaluate the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies induced by the two schedules of the hepatitis B vaccine [NCT00343915]. Subjects who had completed the primary vaccination course of hepatitis B vaccines and met the eligibility criteria for the challenge phase were administered a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine (10 &#x003bc;g of recombinant HBsAg, preservative-free formulation) 72-78 months later, were evaluated one month later for immune memory to the HBs antigen [NCT00524576]. Subjects were excluded from the challenge phase if they had used any investigational product within 30 days preceding the hepatitis B challenge dose or received/planned to receive any vaccines unforeseen by the protocol within 30 days preceding or post-hepatitis B challenge dose or received an additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine between the primary and challenge phases; subjects were also excluded if they had confirmed of suspected diagnosis of immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition. Pregnant or lactating female subjects were also excluded.</p><p>The study was conducted respecting the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and Declaration of Helsinki. Two of the four centres were eliminated from the evaluation of anamnestic response to the challenge dose; the investigator from the study centre was not confident that their team would be able to recruit a sufficient number of subjects and therefore did not participate in this phase of the study; while the subjects at another study centre were excluded from the primary analysis due to GCP non-compliance.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the independent ethics committees of the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Antwerp University Hospital, UZA Wilrijkstraat, HopitaloFacultaire de I'UCL and State Entreprise Centre of Immunobiological Preparation; written informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of adolescent subjects and from subjects who were above 18 years of age before conducting any study-related procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Serological assessment</title><p>Anti-HBs antibody concentrations were measured in the serum samples collected at the first two follow-up visits (at Years 2 and 3 time points) using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (AUSAB EIA/Abbott; cut-off: &#x02265;3.3 mIU/mL). For the subsequent visits (at Years 4 and 5 time points) and the challenge visits, an in-house quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cut-off: &#x02265;3.3 mIU/mL) was used; this assay was equivalent to the previously available commercial assay and was fully validated by calibrating against the first International Reference Preparation for anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

No SAEs were reported following the challenge dose.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary study had established that the immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of the <italic>Adult </italic>formulation of hepatitis B vaccine was non-inferior to that of a three-dose regimen of the <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation. Overall, both regimens had comparable safety profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In order to address concerns regarding the possibility of waning immune memory against the hepatitis B antigen over time, it was essential to evaluate the duration of persistent immunity following the two-dose hepatitis B primary immunisation.</p><p>Studies assessing the immunogenicity of two- and three-dose primary vaccination against hepatitis B in adolescents have reported seroprotection rates between 93.4% and 99.5% and anti-HBs antibody GMCs up to 4155 mIU/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Data on the long-term persistence of anti-HBs antibodies in adolescents following a three-dose schedule as obtained from two published long-term follow-up studies had established that 94.1% of adolescents retained anti-HBs antibody concentrations &#x02265;10 mIU/mL for at least five years, while 91.2% of adolescents retained anti-HBs antibody concentrations &#x02265;10 mIU/mL up to 10 years after completion of the primary vaccination schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The findings from the present study are in line with these previous long-term follow-up studies. In this study, the anti-HBs antibodies persisted for at least five years after primary vaccination, irrespective of whether the subjects received the two- or three-dose schedules. At the end of the long-term follow-up period, 79.5% and 91.4% subjects in the HBV_2D and HBV_3D groups, respectively showed anti-HBs antibody concentrations &#x02265;10 mIU/mL.</p><p>The anti-HBs antibody GMC evolution observed in the present study is similar to observations from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], where the GMCs declined rapidly in the first year after primary vaccination, followed by a more gradual decrease over the subsequent years. The anti-HBs antibody GMC observed in the HBV_3D group was comparatively higher than that observed in the HBV_2D group, at all follow-up time points. However, the evolution of anti-HBs antibody GMC observed throughout the follow-up period was similar in both groups. Of note, the fold increase in anti-HBs antibody GMC following the challenge dose was slightly higher in the HBV_2D group than in the HBV_3D group (108-fold and 95-fold, respectively). Thus, it is evident that the subjects in both groups, irrespective of their anti-HBs antibody levels prior to the challenge dose had sufficient immune memory to mount an effective anamnestic response to the challenge dose administered five years after completion of the primary vaccination course.</p><p>These results are consistent with previous long-term studies with two- and three-dose schedules of the hepatitis B study vaccine which have reported that five to ten years after primary vaccination, between 81.0% and 99% of children and adults had anti-HBs antibody concentrations &#x02265;10 mIU/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, the fact that all subjects in the present study could mount an anamnestic response to the challenge dose indicates strong immune memory against the hepatitis B vaccine antigen.</p><p>A potential weakness of this study is that the sample size calculation was based on the objective of the primary study (to compare the immune response induced by the Adult and Paediatric formulations of the hepatitis B study vaccine following a two-dose or three-dose primary vaccination course) and hence did not account for the attrition of subjects over a period of five years. However, the population at the start of the study and the population followed up were comparable in terms of anti-HBs response to primary vaccination and demographic characteristics, as evident from the post-hoc analysis. Therefore there was no bias in the selection of the final study cohort.</p><p>The observations from this study are in line with previous reports that the decrease in anti-HBs antibody concentrations to even undetectable levels does not necessarily indicate loss of protection in the long-term and that immunological memory can outlast the loss of antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The data from two separate studies in infants and adolescents that evaluated persistence of anti-HBs antibodies five and ten years after primary vaccination have further established these observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The fact that the vaccinees with undetectable levels of anti-HBs antibodies or waning antibody levels responded with an anamnestic response to the challenge dose indicate that there is currently no evidence that booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required after a successful primary vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>A two-dose schedule of GSK Biologicals' <italic>Engerix</italic>-B&#x02122; <italic>Adult </italic>(anti-HBsAg content: 20 &#x003bc;g), which has a good safety and immunogenicity profile and is generally well-tolerated, is therefore a suitable alternative to the standard three-dose schedule of the <italic>Paediatric </italic>formulation (for adolescents aged 11+) and may facilitate higher immunisation completion rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with the reduction in the required number of injections and clinical visits. In addition, a catch-up regimen of a two-dose schedule in older adolescents susceptible to the disease and in whom compliance with a three-dose <italic>Paediatric </italic>dosing schedule is in doubt, may also be used in order to improve population-based immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The two-dose schedule of the <italic>Adult </italic>formulation of hepatitis B vaccine when administered to adolescents induced persistence of detectable anti-HBs antibodies for at least five years after completion of the primary vaccination schedule. The strong anamnestic response following the challenge dose regardless of the priming schedules provides the evidence of strong immunological memory for at least five years following vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; WHO: World Health Organization; GSK: GlaxoSmithKline; anti-HBs: Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigens; CEVAC: Centre for Evaluation of Vaccines; SAE: Serious adverse events; ATP: According to protocol; TVC: Total vaccinated cohort; SAS: Statistical Analysis System.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PVD acts as chief and principal investigator for clinical trials conducted on behalf of the University of Antwerp, for which the University obtains research grants from vaccine manufacturers; speaker's fees for presentations on vaccines are paid directly to an educational fund held by the University of Antwerp.
