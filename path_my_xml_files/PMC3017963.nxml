The important precipitating factors of asthma include occupational factors, viral infections, drugs, cold air, family history, stress, etc. It is a multifactor disease; clinically, it produces symptoms and signs like dyspnea (expiratory difficulty), cough, and wheezing. Pathologically, there is mucosal inflammation, collection of inflammatory mediators, bronchial constriction, air trapping, later on remodeling of airways. Presently, it is difficult to control all the triggers in a single patient. It is better to try to improve lung functions by exercises and to correct the pathology (common result to all the triggers); so stress was given to expiratory exercises[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] and some modification was done.</p><p>Fifty cases were selected with FEV1 &#x0003e; 70%. After confirming diagnosis, they were randomly divided into two groups, group A and group B. Group A performed breathing exercises and group B meditation. After 12 weeks there was significant improvement in symptoms and lung functions in group A.</p><p>This result is similar to other studies of Nagrathna <italic>et al</italic>., Goyeche <italic>et al</italic>., and McFadden[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] where improvement was found after yogic techniques. Reduction in psychosomatic factors was considered as prime factor in these studies, but improvement in our study was not due to any relaxation activity or decrease in psychosomatic factors because meditation group did not show any improvement. The results are also different from a few studies where some other techniques were used. In study of Cooper[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] <italic>et al</italic>. Butekyo breathing technique (a device which mimics <italic>pranayama</italic>) was used. There was minimal improvement in lung functions.</p><p>Study of Slader[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] included shallow nasal breathing with little improvement in lung functions. Similarly, study of Singh[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] used pink city lung exerciser with mild effectiveness.</p><p>Three important things were found in the present study. Firstly, expiratory exercises are helpful. In bronchial asthma expiration is difficult, so exercises that support expiration are beneficial [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">5</xref>]. Secondly, forceful expiratory exercises (expiration) are helpful and this is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. In this figure, air is easily coming in and going out in a normal person, but in an asthmatic patient air is coming ineasily but during expiration there is closing of airways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] and force is required to open the airways; hence, a high pitch/forceful <italic>Omkara</italic> OOOOOOOOOO&#x02026;MMMM was found to be helpful instead of oooo&#x02026;mmm. Thirdly, prolonged expiratory exercises (expiration) are helpful. During normalOmkarathe air comes out only from the upper part of airways [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>], but asthma is a disease that affects whole lower respiratory tract so prolonged exercise which helps to expire maximum trapped air is found beneficial [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>]. Normally, Omkarais stopped after 10&#x02013;15 seconds like oooooo&#x02026;mmm, but the beneficial effect in asthma is found with prolonged OOOOOOOOOOOOO&#x02026;MMMM until further expiration is not possible.</p><fig id="F0004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Forceful exhalation helps to open closed airways in asthma</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-2-22-g004"/></fig><fig id="F0005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Prolonged exhalation helps to expel more trapped air in asthma</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-2-22-g005"/></fig></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McFadden</surname><given-names>ER</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Fauci</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Braunwald</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasper</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>longo</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jameson</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Harrison&#x02019;s principles of Internal medicine</article-title><year>2005</year><publisher-loc>USA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>McGraw Hill</publisher-name><fpage>1511</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nagarathna</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagendra</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Yoga for bronchial asthma: A controlled study</article-title><source>Br Med J</source><year>1985</year><volume>291</volume><fpage>1077</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3931802</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goyeche</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Ikeniy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Yoga Perspective part II: Yoga therapy in treatment of asthma</article-title><source>J Asthma</source><year>1982</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>189</fpage><lpage>201</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7118825</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vedanathan</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kesavalu</surname><given-names>LN</given-names></name><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Durall</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Nagarathna, Clinical study of Yoga Techniques in university students with asthma: A control study</article-title><source>Allergy Asthma Proc</source><year>1998</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9532318</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosener</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Marzetta</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Klemechu</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Decreased blood pressure in pharmacologically treated.
