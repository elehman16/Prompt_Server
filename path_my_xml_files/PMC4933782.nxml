In a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind design, inpatient participants received a single oral dose of 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of WRSS1. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with equal numbers of vaccinees and placebo controls showing mild symptoms. Only 3 of 13 vaccinees (23%) had culture-positive stools, while a total of 9 vaccinees were positive by PCR. Lack of vaccine shedding in volunteers correlated with lack of clinical symptoms and immune responses, just as the duration of fecal shedding correlated directly with stronger immune responses. Two months following immunization, 10 vaccinees and 10 newly recruited naive controls received a challenge dose of 1,670 CFU of virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> strain 53G. This dose had previously demonstrated a 75% attack rate for dysentery in Thai volunteers. However, in this study the attack rate for dysentery in naive controls after challenge was 20%. Based on clinical record summaries, 3 vaccinees and 5 naive controls experienced clinically relevant illness (diarrhea/dysentery/fever/shigellosis), and a 40% vaccine efficacy was calculated. When these data are compared to those for the performance of this vaccine candidate in more naive populations, it is clear that a single oral dose of WRSS1 at 10<sup>4</sup> CFU failed to achieve its full potential in a population in which the organism is endemic. Higher doses and/or repeated immunizations may contribute to improved vaccine shedding and consequent elevation of protective immune responses in a population in which the organism is endemic.

In a recent global enteric multicenter study (GEMS), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content>, rotavirus, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Cryptosporidium</named-content>, and enterotoxigenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> expressing heat-stable toxin were shown to be the 4 main causes of moderate to severe diarrhea in children less than 5 years of age (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The GEMS results indicated that from 12 to 59 months of age, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> was an important bacterial pathogenic cause of moderate to severe diarrhea. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> is a risk factor for mortality, poor physical growth, and impaired cognitive development. The distribution of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> species and serotypes is region specific and changes over time in resource-poor regions of the world (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In Thailand, in the past, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> (79%) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> (15%) have been the most commonly isolated <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> species (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, more recent estimates have reversed this trend and currently <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> predominates (84%), with the rest being serotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This shifting trend in distribution of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> serotypes is similar to what is seen in Vietnam and Malaysia (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The burden of shigellosis is greatest in poor countries. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> is easily transmitted in crowded and unhygienic environments (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); contaminated water supplies and poor sanitation are the primary risk factors for shigellosis worldwide (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Additionally, there is a correlation between socioeconomic status and the risk for shigellosis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The increased risk of exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> was reflected in a high prevalence of antibodies to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> in Israel, where <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> antibodies in young adults were associated with a low socioeconomic background (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In Bangkok, Thailand, the adult population may have had prior exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content>, as demonstrated by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content>-specific serum IgG antibodies. Natural exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> generally produces short-lived serotype-specific protection.</p><p>Control of shigellosis by hygienic measures is often difficult because of the very low infectious dose, and prevention by active vaccination may be optimal, presenting an important measure to reduce rates of morbidity and mortality due to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> infections. Currently there are no commercially licensed <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> vaccines outside China, although several decades of research have resulted in the evaluation of a variety of live, killed, and subunit vaccine candidates. In China, a live, oral, noninvasive, bivalent vaccine expressing O antigens of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> 2a has been used in adults as a licensed product (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>WRSS1, a live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> vaccine candidate, is principally attenuated by the loss of the virulence plasmid-borne <italic>virG</italic> (or <italic>icsA</italic>) function, eliminating the ability of the pathogen to spread intercellularly. In animal and human studies, <italic>virG</italic> (<italic>icsA</italic>) mutants are significantly attenuated. WRSS1 was constructed using the stable <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> strain Moseley as the parental strain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It was manufactured in the mid-1990s as a lyophilized product at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF) in Silver Spring, MD, USA. WRSS1 is invasive in HeLa cells but negative in the plaque assay and the Sereny test. WRSS1 was both immunogenic and protective in the guinea pig model (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Recent genomic sequencing analysis has indicated that an additional chromosomal deletion of 82 kb occurred spontaneously during the construction of WRSS1 (J. R. Ticehurst and M. M. Venkatesan, unpublished). This chromosomal deletion does not affect cellular invasion or intracellular replication. WRSS1 is invasive in HeLa cells and can multiply intracellularly, and complementation of WRSS1 with a <italic>virG</italic> (<italic>icsA</italic>) gene restores its ability to be plaque positive and Sereny positive in guinea pigs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>WRSS1 completed phase I trials in U.S. and Israeli volunteers and was shown to be safe, with high rates of fecal shedding and robust immunogenicity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). No evidence of transmission was observed in participants cohabitating with vaccinees during the trial in Israel. So far, no efficacy studies have been conducted with WRSS1. The objective of this study was to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a single dose of WRSS1 in Thailand, where <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> is endemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was designed as an inpatient trial and was approved by the Human Subjects Research Review Board of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), the Ethical Review Committee for Research in Human Subjects, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, and the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design.</title><p>Healthy male or female Thai adults, between the ages of 20 and 40, were recruited from the Bangkok Metropolitan area and its periphery.

The first phase of the study was carried out as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of WRSS1. The 10<sup>4</sup>-CFU dose was based on the safety dose determined from studies of U.S. and Israeli volunteers (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Fourteen vaccinees and 6 controls (placebo) were enrolled; however, one subject was excluded on study day 0 because of an episode of diarrhea. Volunteers were admitted to the quarantine ward at the Mahidol University Vaccine Trial Centre (VTC), Bangkok, Thailand. After a 90-min fasting period, 13 vaccinees drank 150 ml of a bicarbonate solution (2 g in 150 ml of sterile water) to neutralize gastric acidity prior to receiving a single oral dose of 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of WRSS1 that was suspended in 30 ml of sterile water. Six placebo controls received 1 ml of sterile saline in 30 ml of sterile water. The second phase of the study was an efficacy assessment involving 10 randomly selected immunized volunteers from the first phase of the study who were challenged 60 days after vaccination with a 1,670-CFU dose of wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> strain 53G. In a previous study, this challenge dose had demonstrated a 75% attack rate for dysentery in Thai adults (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Additionally, 10 newly recruited naive volunteers also were recruited as controls and challenged with the 53G strain. Blood and stool samples were collected during both phases of the study, and the volunteers were assessed daily for reactogenicity and adverse events (AE). Based on clinical signs and symptoms associated with the vaccine, any AE were graded as mild (symptoms were present but the subject was able to perform daily activities), moderate (the subject's activities were reduced, but some could still be performed), and severe (the subject's activities were markedly reduced).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Study outline for oral live <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> vaccine candidate WRSS1 immunization and wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> 53G challenge of Thai adults.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zcd9990953650001"/></fig><p>The volunteers were treated with ciprofloxacin on study day 8 after WRSS1 vaccination and on study day 5 after 53G challenge.

Diarrhea was defined as 2 or more grade 3 to 5 stools (total volume of &#x02265;200 ml) or a single grade 3 stool or higher with stool volume of &#x02265;300 ml within 48 h. Dysentery was characterized by grade 3 stools or higher with gross blood (confirmed by study personnel or ward nurse).

The form I phenotype refers to smooth-edged, small, round colonies and is indicative of the presence of the large virulence plasmid (VP) that contains the O-antigen genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content>. Loss of the VP results in larger, flat, and irregular-edged form II colonies that are noninvasive and avirulent. For the trial, frozen vials of WRSS1 on dry ice were sent from WRAIR PBF to the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), Bangkok, Thailand. On the immunization day, a frozen vial of WRSS1 was removed from the &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer and transported on wet ice to prepare the dose at the VTC. The lyophilized vial was rehydrated with 5 ml of sterile water for injection (SWI). While it was sitting on wet ice, the WRSS1 suspension was gently swirled until it was completely dissolved. The suspension was further diluted with sterile normal saline to obtain a WRSS1 dose of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml. Within 15 min before immunization, 1 ml of the WRSS1 suspension was dispensed into a cup. After visual confirmation of the presence of vaccine in each individual cup, 30 ml of chilled SWI was added into 1 ml of the WRSS1 dose (10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml) and then thoroughly mixed. This 31-ml WRSS1 suspension was orally administered to each volunteer. The actual inoculum dose was evaluated by viable-cell counting of the reconstituted vaccine on a Trypticase soy agar (TSA) plate.

Association between postimmunization and postchallenge, clinical signs and symptoms, and excretion and immune responses were assessed by chi-square test (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) and Fisher's exact test. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni adjustment was used to determine the overall significant differences (<italic>P</italic> value of 0.05) of ordinal data among three groups (WRSS1 shedder, WRSS1 nonshedder, and control). If a significant difference was detected, a Mann-Whitney test was performed between any 2 groups; a <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.0167 was considered significant. Spearman rank correlation was performed with baseline antibody titers (on day 0 before immunization) and the number of days of shedding of WRSS1 as predictor variables, and peak IgA and IgG ASCs and fold rise in serum IgA and IgG antibody titers were used as outcome variables.

The vaccine was well tolerated by the 13 volunteers, and none required early antibiotic treatment. Four of 13 vaccinees did not shed the vaccine strain and also did not experience any AE. Nine vaccinees shed the WRSS1 vaccine strain, and 5 of these 9 participants experienced mild AE (characterized by the presence of symptoms but a retained ability to perform daily activities) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Two vaccinees had mild diarrhea for a single day that occurred 7 or 9 days after immunization, and another two had mild fever (&#x02264;38&#x000b0;C) for a single day that occurred 7 or 8 days after immunization. Since these symptoms occurred 7 days after the single-dose immunization, it is unclear whether these symptoms were related to the effect of the vaccine. One vaccinee had nausea, headache, abdominal pain, and myalgia. All AE were mild and transient in nature. Furthermore, 4 of 6 placebo controls also experienced mild AE (diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, and rectal tenesmus). Except for the symptom of mild fever, other AEs were similar in vaccinees and placebo controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, although some vaccinees developed objective criteria of illness (fever and diarrhea), these illnesses were mild, were transient, and did not occur in a manner that could clearly be attributed to vaccine administration. No vaccinee had dysentery or fever (&#x02265;38.9&#x000b0;C [102&#x000b0;F]) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.

The duration of fecal shedding (at least 6 days) also correlated with &#x0003e;40 IgA ASC spots (odds ratio [OR], 27; <italic>P</italic> = 0.009) and a 4-fold increase in IgA antibody titers (OR = 55; <italic>P</italic> = 0.009) by logistic regression.

The fourth vaccinee (volunteer no. 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), a WRSS1 and 53G shedder, had high levels of humoral and mucosal immune responses postimmunization and postchallenge but nonetheless suffered mild dysentery, nausea, insomnia, dizziness (on the 3rd day after challenge), and malaise on the 4th day after challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This is the first efficacy study with WRSS1 and was performed in a population of adults in an area where the organism is endemic and where <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> currently predominates over other serotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content>. Data from U.S. and Israeli trials indicated that WRSS1 was well tolerated at doses of 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> CFU, where mild and transient diarrhea and fever were seen in some volunteers. At higher doses, the rate of diarrheal and febrile reactions increased, suggesting that 10<sup>4</sup> CFU would be a suitable dose for future trials in these populations. Therefore, a single dose of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU was used to immunize Thai adults, which proved to be safe and well tolerated (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, since higher doses and repeated doses were not evaluated in this study, it is uncertain whether 10<sup>4</sup> CFU was the optimal dose for eliciting maximal immunogenicity in this adult population from a region where the organism is endemic. During prescreening, 24% of the volunteers demonstrated &#x0003e;800 LPS-specific serum IgG antibody titers, with a GMT of 382, which is slightly higher than what was found in Israelis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). One reason for preexisting titers may be the prevalence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plesiomonas shigelloides</named-content> in Thailand. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. shigelloides</named-content> has an O-antigen structure identical to that of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Volunteers with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> LPS-specific serum antibody titers of &#x0003e;800 were excluded from the clinical study. However, although the existence of LPS-specific serum antibody responses during prescreening is used as a marker for prior exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content>, 30% of the control volunteers in this study who were challenged with 53G did not elicit a serum antibody response (seroconversion), even though two of these three volunteers suffered from clinical endpoints of disease and one demonstrated a mucosal response in the form of INV-specific ASCs and fecal IgA. Thus, lack of serum antibody titers may not always be reflective of a lack of prior exposure.</p><p>Although the dose of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of WRSS1 was safe and well tolerated in healthy Thai adults, 5 of 13 (38%) vaccinees as well as 4 of 6 (67%) placebo controls reported mild AE, which included mild and transient diarrhea in both groups and mild and transient fever in the vaccinee group. The fever in vaccinees was seen 7 to 9 days after vaccination and therefore may not be related to vaccine administration. One volunteer had to be excluded from the study on day 0 due to diarrhea. Acute diarrhea is a common problem among outpatients in Thailand (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As a result, it is sometimes difficult to assess vaccine-induced symptoms in small groups of adult volunteers from areas in which the pathogen is endemic and among whom diarrheal episodes are frequent.</p><p>Clinical endpoints of disease were defined as shigellosis, diarrhea, dysentery, or fever. In this study, 3 of 10 (30%) vaccinees challenged with 53G met the criteria for the clinical endpoints, although the AEs were mild except for one case of moderate malaise. Among the controls, 5 of 10 participants (50%) met the criteria for clinical endpoints: 4 participants had mild AE, including 1 case of dysentery, 1 case of diarrhea with vomiting, and 2 cases of fever with or without diarrhea, and 1 participant had severe AE (shigellosis). While efficacy against single endpoints of disease was not evident in this study, based on the number of controls and vaccinees who demonstrated clinical endpoints after challenge, a trend in protection could be seen after WRSS1 immunization. In a previous study, administration of 1,680 CFU of 53G resulted in a 75% attack rate of dysentery in control volunteers, with 100% of volunteers having abdominal symptoms and 1 of 12 volunteers having shigellosis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the current study, a low attack rate of dysentery (20%) in the naive controls prevented a statistically significant assessment of vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Data from previous studies with WRSS1 indicated that strong immune responses follow robust colonization of the vaccine strain as monitored by excretion. In this study, vaccinees that did not shed WRSS1 did not elicit immune responses. Similarly, after challenge, naive controls and vaccinees that did not shed 53G had lower immune responses than those that shed the challenge strain. However, lack of shedding appeared to correlate with higher fecal IgA titers, suggesting that local immunity played a part in limiting colonization. In the U.S. trials, there was clear evidence of intestinal vaccine replication, as demonstrated by recovery of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of WRSS1 per g of stool in 82% of the vaccinees compared to only 23% of Thai adults who were culture positive for the vaccine. In the U.S. study, culture-positive fecal shedding occurred over a period of 5 to 7 days up to initiation of antibiotic treatment. Shedding was dose dependent, with 50% of the U.S. and Israeli volunteers shedding the vaccine strain at a lower dose (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU) and 100% of the volunteers shedding at the highest tested dose (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU). In a community-based evaluation of WRSS1 in Israel, more than 70% of the vaccinees excreted the vaccine for a period ranging between 1 and 23 days (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is unclear what factors contribute to the low levels of vaccine shedding in Thai adults. Prior exposure to the organism in an area where it is endemic may lead to serotype-specific immunity in adults and may lead to a low priming effect of the vaccine candidate (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>The level of resistance to colonization of WRSS1 in Thai adults is similar to what was observed with another oral live attenuated Shigella vaccine candidate, SC602 (<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> 2a), in Bangladesh (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Such a resistance to infection has been observed with other oral vaccines, such as polio, cholera, and rotavirus vaccines, leading to the administration of higher doses and repeated vaccine doses (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Perhaps a dose determination study is needed to optimize the dose for colonization in a population where the disease is endemic, and volunteers may have different levels of innate immunity to the particular pathogen. Such an optimal dose determination study, as well as defining the role of repeated doses, could improve the outcome of WRSS1 vaccination in Thai adults. A better understanding of the gut microbiome in different populations before and after vaccination/challenge may be required to determine if the gut microbiome plays a role in determining the uptake of an oral vaccine.</p><p>Currently there are no absolute correlates of protection for assessment of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> vaccines. Natural clinical <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> infections confer &#x0223c;75% protection against a homologous serotype. Protection is thought to be due to local adaptive humoral responses mediated by secretory IgA (sIgA), the main immunoglobulin found at the mucosal surface (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Protection has also been achieved by passively transferred type-specific oral immunoglobulin (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), suggesting that serum (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and mucosal antibodies play a central role in preventing shigellosis. WRSS1 induced strong mucosal and systemic immune responses in U.S. volunteers reminiscent of the responses seen after immunization and challenge with SC602. Vaccinees immunized with a single dose of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of SC602 and challenged 2 months later with a virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> 2a strain demonstrated 100% protection against moderate to severe diarrhea, dysentery, and fever. In the SC602 study, a 3- to 4-fold increase in serum IgA/IgG/IgM titers coupled with &#x0003e;40 IgA ASCs against <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. flexneri</named-content> 2a LPS appeared to correlate with protection, although the study was performed in a limited number of volunteers. Since <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> is a mucosal pathogen, a mucosal immune response is expected to be part of protection, perhaps in combination with an antibody response.</p><p>An important aspect of the immune response that is missing from the earlier studies is the determination of the functionality of serum antibodies as well as the T and B cell phenotypes that are driving the mucosal response (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Bactericidal assays and opsonophagocytosis measurements may provide a correlation between functional serum antibodies and protection and should be carried out in future trials. Furthermore, other factors need to be investigated, such as the role of gamma interferon, interleukin-17 (IL-17), and IL-22 production, as well as production of B memory cells with &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7<sup>+</sup> integrins after <named-content content-type="genus-species">Shigella</named-content> vaccination (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a single oral dose of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> vaccine candidate WRSS1 was safe in Thai adults and generated significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Challenge of immunized volunteers with virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. sonnei</named-content> strain 53G indicated a trend toward protection that could be improved by higher doses and repeated doses of the vaccine candidate. A clear correlation was observed between vaccine shedding as well as shedding of the challenge strain and subsequent elicitation of immune responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>For their significant contributions to the study, we thank the clinical staff at Mahidol University, Wirach Maek-a-Nanthawat, Varunee Desakorn, and Supa Naksrisook; Apichai Srijan and the laboratory staff at the Department of Enteric Diseases, AFRIMS; the study coordinators, Narumon Thanthamnu and Umaporn Suksawad; and the medical monitors, Porntep Chantavanich and Chirasak Kamboonruang.
