This disease was initially called typhoid fever because of its clinical similarity to Typhus. In 1869, the term enteric fever was proposed as an alternative designation on the basis of its association with enlarged Peyer&#x02019;s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. There are a lot of complication of this disease if not treated properly and in time, but the two most dreaded complications related to surgeons are intestinal perforation and bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] These complications result from necrosis at the initial site of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infiltration in the Peyer&#x02019;s patches of the small intestine. This usually occurred in the third or fourth week of infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>Enteric perforation required immediate surgical intervention. Various treatment options are available as advocated by different authors depending on the bowel condition.

A total of 176 patients were included in the study, who were having enteric perforation peritonitis due to typhoid fever and qualified the criteria of primary closure, that is, single perforation with relatively healthy bowel.</p><p>Diagnosis of enteric perforation was made on the basis of prolonged fever followed by acute attack of abdominal pain with signs and symptoms of generalized perforation peritonitis. Widal test and blood culture were done in every patient. X-ray chest including both diaphragms were done as a routine investigation along with hemogram, blood sugar, blood urea, and serum creatinine.</p><p>All the patients were resuscitated with intravenous fluids. Nasogastric aspiration and urethral catheterization was done in every patient. Preoperative antibiotics, ceftriaxone (1 gm) and metronidazole (500 mg), were given. Exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia was carried out within 24 hours of admission. The entire bowel was explored and its findings were noted in relation to amount and nature of fluid, site, size, and number of perforations and condition of the adjacent bowel. Surgical procedure was done according to the following criteria.</p><p>Primary closure&#x02014;Single perforation with relatively healthy bowel</p><p>Ileostomy&#x02014;Single or multiple perforation with unhealthy bowel and poor-risk patients</p><p>Resection and anastomosis&#x02014;Multiple perforation with relatively healthy bowel</p><p>Only those patients who met the criteria of primary closure (single perforation with relatively healthy bowel) were included in the study. These patients were randomly distributed alternatively into two groups.</p><p>Group I - Primary closure with omental patch</p><p>Group II - Primary closure only</p><p>A total of 302 patients of enteric perforation were treated at the hospital during the above mentioned period. Of them, 176 patients underwent exploratory laparotomy with primary closure of perforation; ileostomy was done in 93 patients, resection anastomosis in 30 patients, while drains were put in three patients under local anesthesia. All the three patients with the drain expired and could not undergo definitive surgery. Only those 176 patients who had single perforation with relatively healthy bowel were included in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique</title><p>Primary closure was done in two layers with interrupted sutures. 3-0 vicryl was used for inner layer, while 3-0 silk was used for outer layer.</p><p>In first group, omentum was brought down and fixed at the perforation site with the help of 3-0 vicryl, like a patch after the primary closure.</p><p>Cavity was cleaned with the help of 2.5 l of normal saline before applying the patch. Single drain (30F) was put in the pelvis and abdominal closure was done in single layer. Postoperatively, the patients were given injections ceftriaxone and metronidazole for 5 days.</p><p>The patients were observed with respect to wound infection, wound dehiscence, septicemia, development of fecal fistula, and mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 176 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy with primary closure of perforation were included in the study.

Adensunkanni <italic>et al</italic>. and Swadia <italic>et al</italic>. reported male to female ratio of 4 : 1 and 5.25 : 1, respectively,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] while Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>. showed a ratio of 6.4 : 1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] This higher incidence in young males is because they are more exposed to infections as they eat more outside and have poor hygiene.</p><p>Most of the studies showed delayed presentation after the acute abdominal pain. Mean duration of 5.6 days was reported by Naaya <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] while the range was 1 to 7 days in a series by Mansoor <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Most of our patient presented within 48 hours of abdominal pain, 116 (66%). This early presentation for the majority of the patients may not be the true representation because we have taken only selected patients for our study.</p><p>In most of the series, the patient presented with a history of 1 to 2 weeks of fever followed by pain abdomen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] Of all, 161 (90%) of our patients presented with symptoms of fever followed by pain.</p><p>The diagnosis of enteric perforation was made mainly on the basis of clinical history and examination, X-ray abdomen, and Widal test. Widal test was positive in only 98 (55.6%) of our patients, whereas Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>. showed a positivity of 80.5% in their series. Pneumoperitoneum could be detected in 163 (92.6%) patients, which is consistent with other reports like Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>. reporting a detection rate of 91.7%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>]</p><p>Enteric fever is best managed by early surgical intervention. Various surgical options available are simple primary closure, primary closure with omental patch, resection and anastomosis, and closure with ileotransverse colostomy. All these different procedures were tried, to decrease the incidence of fistula formation and its associated morbidity and mortality. Fecal fistula may occur either because of reperforation or different site of perforation. Simple primary closure is still the procedure of choice as it is simple, quick, and cost-effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] It also avoids stoma care and its complications. Omentum is used to reinforce the simple primary closure by few surgeons. We have compared the results of simple primary closure and primary closure with omental patch technique. Use of omentum is not new in surgery. It has been used almost in every subspecialty of surgery, more commonly in GI surgery. It may be used as Graham&#x02019;s patch in peptic ulcer perforation, wrapping around an anastomosis, esophageal surgery, and others like omentoplasty in hydatid cyst. The omentum fills in small gaps between the sutures and provide good source of vascularity and inflammatory cells for healing. Due to its capacity of localizing infection and sealing microperforations, some of the authors strongly recommended omentoplasty in every case of anastomosis, especially the esophagus and colorectal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>We have compared the results of two groups and found that leak rate is lower in patients with primary closure and omental patch. The occurrence of fistula formation is mainly after the primary closure of perforation. However, some of the studies showed that the development of fecal fistula and mortality is unrelated to the operative procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Mansoor <italic>et al</italic>. showed that maximum incidence of fecal fistula is with resection and anastomosis followed by simple repair closure (7%) and no fistula formation in ileostomy group. Mortality is minimal with simple primary closure, as shown by Mansoor <italic>et al</italic>, Talwar <italic>et al</italic>, and Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>. showed no difference in the mortality among different surgical groups and the mortality depends on number of perforations and development of fecal fistula.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] The reason of low mortality in primary repair groups in the above studies may be because of early presentation and relatively healthy bowel of these patients. The incidence of fecal fistula as shown in different studies is 16.6% according to Olurin <italic>et al</italic>., 10% according to Talwar <italic>et al</italic>., 8.5% according to Adensunkanni <italic>et al</italic>., and 16.5% according to Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>]</p><p>We have compared the incidence of fecal fistula formation in primary closure group in which it was 7 (7.7%), consistent with other studies like that of Karmacharya and Sharma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>], while 1 (1.1%) in primary closure with omental patch group which is very low as compared with other series.</p><p>Incidences of mortality as reported by different studies are Beniwal <italic>et al</italic>., 10.5%; Purohit, 14.6%; Adensunkanni <italic>et al</italic>., 28%; Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 14.2%; and Talwar <italic>et al</italic>.., 16.4%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] Mortality in our study is very low mainly because of the selective group of patients.

Although the use of omentum is not new in surgery, its use in the ileal perforation is not very much stressed. Knowing its usefulness in other surgeries, we have used it in ileal perforation and found that omental patch technique is a reasonable option as compared with only primary closure. We recommend that it should be done in all cases of enteric perforation that fits the criteria of primary closure because of its obvious benefits. It is a very simple procedure and no extra time is required with less complication rates.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
