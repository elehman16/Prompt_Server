Warm-up exercises for postural control are an important factor for normally healthy,
ordinary people as well as athletes. Such postural control refers to automatic responses in
the vestibular system, vision, and proprioception<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Poor postural control is associated with decreased dynamic
balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic balance is the ability
to maintain equilibrium while in motion or to move the body from a static to a dynamic
state<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance impairment is a
significant risk factor for falls in healthy people. Fallings are the leading cause of death
from injury in elderly people<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
athletic population, the loss of dynamic balance is an important factor that may cause
injury in sport activity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Warm-up
exercises are light exercises that are conducted prior to strenuous physical activity, which
aim to reduce damage, such as strains and sprains, during performance. They raise
intramuscular temperatures, thereby improving muscle flexibility and adaptability, and
enhance postural control<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Warm-up exercises conducted before exercises or sports activities include stretching,
treadmill walking, and plyometric exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching is commonly used as a warm-up
exercise to increase people&#x02019;s range of motion and blood flow rates, and prevent
injuries<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle strength and
flexibility is boosted by stretching. The body is further able to move more comfortably
following stretching, which is also helpful for preventing injuries in all kinds of
sports<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill walking is a warm-up
exercise that uses the whole body. It enhances aerobic ability, increases muscle performance
during exercise, and has a positive effect on balance ability, as well<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plyometric
training is a type of resistance training. It can improve body equilibrium, coordination,
agility, and power, and it has recently received considerable attention as a warm-up
exercise that enhances physical ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plyometric exercises use high-speed
eccentric exercises to advance concentric muscle action, reflexive responses, and functional
exercise patterns. It develops lower body muscle strength, muscle control, and dynamic
balance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As warm-up exercises, the above three exercises greatly affect postural stability. However,
research into the effects of each exercise on balance is lacking. Accordingly, this study
aimed to examine how stretching, plyometric, and treadmill exercises influence the dynamic
balance necessary for sports activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study, were 22 healthy undergraduates at D university. Their

The purpose of the study was explained to the subjects who signed consent
forms to participation in the study. Then, the approval of the Ethics Committee of the
Catholic University of Pusan was obtained (CUPIRB-2014-008). None of the subjects had
orthopedic or neurological diseases, dizziness, or problems maintaining balance. This study
utilized BioRescue (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France) to measure the limit of stability (LOS)
into the evaluation of the subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance.</p><p>The subjects conducted stretching, plyometric exercises, and treadmill walking for set
times over a period of three days. The subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance was then measured. The
measurements for each exercise were taken three times: prior to the intervention,
immediately after the intervention, and 20 minutes after the intervention. All the
intervention times were set at 16 minutes, excluding resting times. The subjects rested for
20 minutes after each intervention. The subjects conducted stretching of the bilateral
quadriceps femoris, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus. They extended each muscle for 45
seconds before resting for 15 seconds, repeating the same motion twice. The subjects&#x02019;
treadmill walking was set at 1.2 m/s, the normal gait speed of adults in their 20s<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The plyometric exercise program was
followed by the methods described in previous research<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. At a metronome speed of
100 bpm, the subjects conducted four motions&#x02014;the plyometric squat, plyometric lunge, lateral
jump, and forward jump&#x02014;for 45 seconds before resting for 15 seconds. The subjects repeated
the exercises four times.</p><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance
repeated measure was used to examine the effects of the different kinds of exercise over
time (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of limit of stability before and after intervention for each

There were no
statistical differences among the exercises (F=0.34, p=0.79) and no statistical differences
in changes over time (F=0.33, p=0.71).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Static stretching is generally thought to have a positive effect in since it prevents
injuries during a physical activity. Larsen et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that there were no changes in their study subjects&#x02019;
position sense after quadriceps and hamstring stretching. The proprioceptors, which engage
in position sense, play a crucial role in conducting actions to maintain balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive tissue is thixotropic, and
therefore although the proprioceptive sense may be changed by stretching, the stretching
need to be conducted for a long time<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In this study, stretching was carried out for a short time and therefore was not able to
change the proprioceptors.</p><p>Research verifying that treadmill walking improves balance ability has mostly investigated
patients with neurological system disorders<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we considered that treadmill
walking had no effect on the subjects of the present study because they were healthy people.
In contrast with previous study results that showing that a jumping exercise such as
plyometric exercise, enhances balance ability, in the present study, the subjects&#x02019; LOS
values, an index of dynamic stability, did not increase. Plyometric exercises use abductor
and adductor muscles more than ordinary jumps, and therefore greater loads are imposed by
them, triggering the mobilization of additional muscles. Unlike a previous study in which a
two-minute resting time was given, this study provided a resting time of only 30 seconds,
and therefore the subjects&#x02019; muscle fatigue were not able to completely recover from fatigue
after the exercises<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle fatigue
affects postural control and considerably decreases balance ability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the hip extensor muscles influence balance
in the standing and bending positions. Balance ability decreases as muscle fatigue
accumulates and proprioceptive responses to the joints are inhibited<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, we found that balance ability greatly
decreased immediately after the plyometric exercises but was swiftly recovered thereafter.
It is recommended that future research reduce muscle fatigue by extending the resting time
and examining the subsequent changes over time.</p><p>This study found that warm-up exercises such as plyometric exercises, stretching, and
treadmill walking have no effect on the dynamic of balance in healthy subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hyt&#x000f6;nen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pyykk&#x000f6;</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Aalto</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Postural control and age</article-title>. <source>Acta
