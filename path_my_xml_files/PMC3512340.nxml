The mean age of the patients at surgery was 54.3 years (range, 25&#x02013;70 years), and the median duration of the symptoms was 65.1 months (range, 5&#x02013;180 months). In all the selected cases, the spasm originated in the orbicularis oculi muscle. At surgery, only the orbicularis oculi muscle was found to be involved in three cases, whereas the additional involvement of the orbicularis oris muscle was noted in the others.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>After the administration of a short-acting agent for neuromuscular blockade, neuroanesthesia was maintained by intravenous infusion of propofol and fentanyl. Until the completion of MVD, muscle relaxants were not used. Patients were placed in the lateral oblique position, with the head fixed in a neutral position and rotated slightly toward the surgeon. The glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves were identified after dissecting the arachnoid around the cerebellomedulary cistern. The root exit zone of facial nerve was ascertained close to the brainstem via the infrafloccular route. The offending vessel was shifted off the facial nerve by adhering it to the dura covering the pyramidal bone or by inserting a small piece of shredded Teflon felt between the vessels and the brainstem or the flocculus. None of the patients included in this case series underwent interpositioning of the offending vessel and the facial nerve.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intraoperative monitoring</title><p>A Viking monitoring system (Nicolet Biomedical, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used for intraoperative monitoring. Paired stimulating stainless-steel needle electrodes were subdermally inserted both into the lower edge of the zygomatic bone as the temporal branch being stimulated and into the lower edge of the mandibular bone (about 3 cm apart from the midline) as the marginal mandibular branch being stimulated. AMRs were recorded from the mentalis muscle after electrical stimulation of the temporal branch of the facial nerve and from the orbicularis oculi muscle after stimulation of the marginal mandibular branch. Paired stainless-steel needle electrodes were subdermally inserted into the relevant muscles. AMRs from the orbicularis oculi and mentalis muscles were recorded using amplifiers with a frequency band of 5 Hz to 3 kHz. The muscles were then subjected to supramaximal stimulation.</p><p>FMEPs were recorded from the orbicularis oculi, mentalis, and orbicularis oris muscles. MEPs recorded from the ipsilateral thenar muscle were used as control responses. The bandpass filter was set at a frequency of 200&#x02013;3000 Hz. The FMEP amplitude was defined as the range between the maximum positive and negative peaks of the polyphasic waveform. Corkscrew electrodes were placed at positions C3 or C4 and Cz to stimulate FMEPs. The cathode was always positioned at Cz, while the anode was positioned at the contralateral side. Constant voltage stimuli consisting of five rectangular pulses at intervals of 1 ms were generated using a D185 stimulator (Digitimer Ltd., UK). The stimulation intensity was increased gradually until the FMEP amplitudes obtained from the orbicularis oculi, mentalis, and orbicularis oris muscles reached a plateau before dural opening because the stimulus was adjusted to the supramaximal intensity, which ranged from 152 to 600 V (mean, 321 V).</p><p>Both AMR and FMEP recordings were obtained at each stage of MVD, i.e. upon opening of the dura, retraction of the cerebellum, transposition of the offending vessels, termination of the microsurgical procedure, and dural closure. If the AMR disappeared completely or the amplitude decreased to &#x0003c; 50% compared to the baseline level, the response was judged to be changed by decompression of the facial nerve. In order to determine that disappearance of AMR was not due to technical errors, the direct response amplitude was confirmed to be not changed. Occasionally, the AMR disappeared when the cerebrospinal fluid was drained or when retractors were placed in the cerebellum. AMR monitoring was continued at the same intensity of stimulation until the compression of the facial nerve by the offending arteries was completely eliminated. If the AMR did not change from the response at the baseline (before dural opening) despite decompression, we explored to region for any other possible underlying causes, such as compression by another vessel, in order to achieve the optimal decompression of the facial nerve. When no other offending vessels were identified by the additional investigation, further manipulation was avoided even if the AMRs persisted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Evaluation and statistical analysis</title><p>According to surgical outcomes, all patients were evaluated whether their symptoms disappeared completely or persisted at 1 year after surgery.</p><p>The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of whether the AMRs disappeared (group AMR-A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>) or persisted (group AMR-B, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>) after MVD.

The disappearance of AMRs or a reduction of their amplitude to 50% or less at the final recording was associated with complete relief of symptoms 1 year after surgery in 95% of the patients. A reduction in the FMEP amplitude at the final recordings compared to that at the baseline was also associated with good outcomes in 95% of the patients. Intraoperative AMR findings were related to the postoperative course, i.e. whether HFS disappeared immediately after surgery or subsided gradually over time. The disappearance of AMRs after decompression was associated with the patient being symptom-free immediately after surgery.</p><p>The clinical usefulness of intraoperative AMR monitoring in predicting the postoperative outcomes has been a topic of debate. Many studies have investigated the association between the disappearance or persistence of AMRs after decompression and the outcome of MVD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] A recent meta-analysis revealed that the postoperative failure rate was 39% and 9.5% for patients without and with disappearance of AMRs after decompression, respectively; thus, the chance of a cure if the AMR disappeared after MVD was 4.2 times greater than that if the AMR persisted.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] On the other hand, some studies have investigated whether the amplitude in the persistent AMR decreased from that present before decompression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Among patients with persistent AMRs at the end of the operation, those with a reduction in the AMR amplitude frequently experienced complete resolution after the operation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Consistent with this finding, our results showed that 95% of the patients with abolishment of the AMR or AMR reduction to 50% or less had no symptoms at the final follow-up. However, in two cases wherein AMR had disappeared or decreased at the final recordings, the symptoms relief was only transient and HFSs recurred 3 months after the operation. In both these cases, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the offending arteries recompressed the facial nerve. Thus, we can infer that intraoperative AMR monitoring may not facilitate the prediction of the recurrence of symptoms. Except for these two patients, all others with AMR cessation or decreased AMRs had excellent outcomes. Thus, AMR monitoring is useful for predicting the postoperative symptom-free status of patients, if AMR amplitude reduction is also considered as a significant indicator of the completion of decompression of the facial nerve.</p><p>In the case of two of our patients who did not show any change in the AMRs after the surgery, complete relief of the spasm was attained only in a gradual manner, despite confirmation of the absence of any other vessels compressing the facial nerve. Debate has continued as to whether AMR originates from a central[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] or peripheral site.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In our previous studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] AMR has been shown to originate mainly from the cross-transmission at the compression site. Thus, the disappearance of AMRs probably indicates that the cross-transmission at the compression sites is abolished by shifting the offending vessels away from the facial nerve. Consistently, some patients with persistent AMRs after the surgery possibly have the involvement of the kindling of the facial nucleus in addition to this cross-transmission. Their symptoms of such patients do not disappear immediately after surgery, but decrease in severity along with a gradual decrease in the intensity of the kindling of the facial nucleus. Indeed, in this study, the patients with persistent AMRs more frequently experienced gradual improvement in their HFS after surgery than those with disappearance of AMRs. In the case of two of our patients, AMRs could be mainly related to the hyperexcitability of the facial motor neurons, which is probably rare in HFS patients. Although no data regarding postoperative AMRs were available, their symptoms had become weaker and had probably decreased in amplitude over time. When the kindling of the facial neuron was normalized, HFS subsided completely along with the disappearance of AMR.</p><p>In this study, the AMR findings were significantly correlated with the amplitude of FMEP recorded for the orbicularis oculi muscle. Patients with disappearance of AMRs had a higher frequency of FMEP amplitude ratios of &#x0003c;50% compared to others. Similarly, those with persistence of AMRs had FMEP amplitude ratios of more than 50% more frequently than those without. In three of our patients, the waveforms of both AMR and FMEP remained unchanged at the final recordings. A previous study has also shown that the disappearance or decrease in the amplitude of AMR occurred simultaneously with the decrease in the FMEP amplitude.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Although AMR is assumed to originate mainly because of cross-transmission, it is unclear whether the reduction in FMEP after MVD is caused by the normalization of the hyperexcitability of the facial motor neuron or the disappearance of the cross-transmission at the compression sites. Because anatomical structures related to FMEP include both the facial motor nucleus and the site of compression of the facial nerve,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] FMEP could be equally generated by the central sites or the peripheral sites. Our results showed that the reduction in the FMEP amplitude recorded from the orbicularis oculi muscle after MVD was significantly correlated with the disappearance or decrease in AMRs and favorable outcomes in HFS patients. In addition, two patients for whom no AMRs were recorded showed a decrease in the FMEP amplitude, thereby allowing the surgeons to confirm complete decompression. The postoperative decrease in the FMEP amplitude obtained for the orbicularis oculi muscle is believed to reflect the normalization of the hyperexcitability of the facial nerve at both the compression site and the facial nucleus. Although FMEP may not predict whether HFS disappeared immediately or subsided gradually, its monitoring may be as useful as AMR monitoring in predicting the postoperative outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Disappearance of AMRs or a 50% or more reduction in their amplitude and reduction in the FMEP amplitude of the orbicularis oculi muscle after MVD were predictive of postoperative relief of HFS. HFS patients with cessation of AMRs were more frequently symptom-free immediately after surgery than those with persistence of AMRs. The recording of both AMRs and FMEPs for the orbicularis oculi muscle is useful monitoring for predicting the postoperative outcomes in HFS patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Motohiro Soma and Kiyoe Nonaka for their technical support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Available
