The vertical oscillations generated via the ground based platform induce short and rapid changes in skeletal muscle fiber length[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which stimulate reflexive muscle contractions increasing skeletal muscle activity[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The magnitude of these increases in skeletal muscle activity measured via electromyography (EMG) is dependent on the characteristics of the WBV stimulus (amplitude, size of each deflection; frequency, number of deflections per second) with higher frequencies and amplitude inducing greater muscle activity[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The enhanced skeletal muscle activity increases the metabolic muscle demand as evidenced by increases in oxygen consumption/energy expenditure due to the WBV exposure[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], though the magnitude of this increased demand is much less than traditional resistance training[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the potential for the WBV stimulus to augment different exercises being performed on the WBV platform is intriguing, as many researchers and health professionals have sought methods to further increase the training stimulus using WBV platforms.</p><p>Recently, we have shown the addition of an unstable surface[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] increased lower body muscle EMG suggesting that exercises performed on the WBV platform could be augmented with exposure to the WBV stimulus. The use of battling ropes is a training modality gaining interest in the fitness industry[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Battling rope training has participants vigorously undulate heavy ropes ([<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] m in length and [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] cm in diameter) that encircle a fixed object. This undulation creates a series of waves for a set interval typically ranging from 10-30 s. This type of training is a vigorous upper-body exercise resulting in an intense metabolic workout[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], even greater than several traditional resistance training movements such as squatting, lunges, and deadlifts[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As previous research using WBV has demonstrated the addition of WBV to a static and dynamic squat increases both skeletal muscle activity and metabolism, whether the addition of WBV to battling rope exercise augments these effects is effective unknown. Further, there is much interest in the health and fitness realm in time-efficient training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to combine the upper body effects of battling rope exercise with the lower body effects of WBV exposure to evaluate the skeletal muscle activity of battling rope exercise with and without the addition of WBV. Surface electromyography (EMG) was measured in muscles the lower body (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis oblique, gastrocnemius), trunk (multifidus, rectus abdominus) and upper body (biceps brachii, triceps brachii). We hypothesized that the addition of WBV to battling rope exercise would result in an increase in skeletal muscle EMG for all muscles evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To investigate the difference in muscle activation between different conditions, a randomized, crossover experimental design was used for this study (all conditions placed in a box, and were picked one by one for each participant). Each participant completed three laboratory sessions in this study (2 familiarization and 1 test session). The experimental protocol began with electrode placement, followed by a standardized warm-up consisting of a 2-min slow jog and 5 dynamic warm-up exercises (10 reps of each exercise for butt kicks, knee to chest, squats, lateral lunges, and inch worms). The test session then had each participant complete one 20-s set of battling rope undulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) for 6 separate conditions followed by 5-min of rest. All sets were performed on the WBV platform and in random order where the 6 different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) were: 1) Alternating arm motion no WBV - Alt_NoWBV; 2) Alternating arm motion 30 Hz low amplitude WBV - Alt_30 Hz-L; 3) Alternating arm motion 50 Hz high amplitude - Alt_50 Hz-H; 4) Double arm motion no WBV - Double_NoWBV; 5) Double arm motion 30 Hz low amplitude WBV - Double_30 Hz-L; 6) Double arm motion 50 Hz high amplitude - Double_50 Hz-H).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experiment setup.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMNI-15-240-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-eight undergraduate students (5 female; 23 male) participated in the study (21.7&#x000b1;1.3 y; 176.7&#x000b1;0.3 cm; 74.0&#x000b1;6.4 kg; mean&#x000b1;SD). All participants were recreationally active but none were involved in a systematic training program for at least 2 months prior to data collection. People suffering from epilepsy, gallstones, kidney stones, neuromuscular or neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, serious heart sicknesses or having an implant, bypass or stent were excluded (3 in total, 1 female). Prior to data collection participants were informed of the requirements associated with participation and provided written informed consent. Participants were encouraged to maintain their dietary, sleeping, and drinking habits during participation in the study (both familiarization trials and experimental session). The research project was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the University Review Board for use of Human Subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Battling rope exercise</title><p>All participants used a nylon rope 15 m long, weighing 11.2 kg, and 3.8 cm in diameter (O&#x02019;Live Fitness, Aerobic &#x00026; Fitness SL, Barcelona, Spain). The rope was anchored at the base of a post, resulting in the participant holding 7.5 m of rope in each hand. Participants began in an athletic position on vibration platform; feet shoulder width apart, knees flexed to 30&#x000ba; with their trunk flexed forward to approximately 45&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These angles were measured via goniometer at the beginning of the bout and participants were asked to maintain these angles during the bout. Participants held the ends of the rope with a neutral grip, with the arms straight and relaxed at their side. During the alternating arm motion, participants moved their arms up and down in an asynchronous (alternating) fashion (i.e. right arm first, then as right arm was returning to the starting position the left arm began; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When performing the double arm motion, participants moved both arms up and down synchronously (at the same time) continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants were instructed to move their arms as fast as possible and were coached to use minimal lower body and trunk movement as to generate the waves primarily through shoulder flexion when raising the ropes, and shoulder extension when crashing the ropes to the floor. Participants were instructed to have their entire foot in constant contact with the platform with feet spaced shoulder wide apart. All participants maintained a 30&#x000ba;-knee flexion during the exercise.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Vibration equipment</title><p>The vibration stimulus consisted of commercial platform (Power Plate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Next Generation pro [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Power Plate North America, Northbrook, IL, USA) that produced synchronous (uniform) tri-planar oscillations[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The acceleration of the vertical sinusoidal oscillations (z-axis) was measured using a uni-axial accelerometer in accordance with ISO2954 (Vibration meter VT-6360, Hong Kong, China). Vibration platform settings included a frequency of 50 Hz with the peak-to-peak displacement of 2.51 mm (High) or a frequency of 30 Hz with peak-to-peak displacement of 1.15 mm (Low). Measured accelerations were 100.6&#x000b1;0.24 m&#x000b7;s-2 (at 50 Hz) and 20.44&#x000b1;0.34 m&#x000b7;s-2 (at 30 Hz).

The primary finding is the addition of WBV to battle rope exercise results in an increase in skeletal muscle activity in the lower leg (gastrocnemius), upper leg (vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis), trunk (rectus abdominus and multifidus), and arms (biceps brachii and triceps brachii). These results demonstrate that the exercise stimulus of performing battling rope exercise (undulation training) can be augmented by completing the exercise while being exposed to WBV from a ground-based platform.</p><p>Battle rope exercise using the alternating arm motion resulted in an increased muscle activity response in the GM of the lower leg compared to the double arm motion suggesting more stabilization in the lower leg is necessary when undulating the battle ropes asynchronously. With the addition of WBV, the 50 Hz stimulus increased muscle activity to a greater extent than the 30 Hz and NoWBV stimuli, while 30 Hz was also greater than NoWBV. This increased in skeletal muscle EMG is a result of the increases skeletal muscle reflexive response via the mechanical vibration oscillations[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similar to our previous work, performing different types of exercise on a WBV platform augments the skeletal muscle EMG response[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The combination of battle rope exercise and WBV also increased muscle activity in the upper leg (VMO and VL) and trunk muscles (RA &#x00026; MF). While the double arm motion resulted in greater muscle activity in the upper leg and trunk compared to the alternating arm technique, this response was reversed in the lower leg (GM). These results suggest different muscle activation patterns across the different battle rope undulation protocols. In response to WBV, all muscles had increased skeletal muscle activity in response to WBV compared to NoWBV, while the higher magnitude WBV stimulus (50 Hz, high amplitude) was also higher compared to the lower magnitude WBV condition (30 Hz, low amplitude). These results are inline with previous research demonstrating a WBV-induced increase in skeletal muscle activity[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and these responses being greater with a higher magnitude (acceleration) stimulus. The increased activation in the MF muscle is similar to our previous study using WBV and an unstable surface[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] though our increase in RA is a novel result of the addition of WBV to battle rope exercise.</p><p>In the upper arms (BB and TB), there was no difference between the muscle activity elicited during alternating arm or double arm motions. This is perhaps not surprising as the arms are directly involved in undulating the ropes, whether the movement is asynchronously (alternating) or synchronously (double arm). The addition of WBV still resulted in an increased muscle activity response in the BB with the 50 Hz condition having the greatest EMG. However, the addition of WBV actually resulted in a decrease in TB muscle activity. This suggests that WBV via a ground based platform can alter upper arm muscle activity during upper body exercise (battle rope undulation) which is in line with previous work evaluating upper body EMG during WBV in older adults[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, the increase in BB and decrease TB EMG suggests a decrease in co-activation of the elbow extensor (TB) while activation of the elbow flexor (BB) is increased (which could affect speed of arm movements discussed below).</p><p>While surface EMG has been used quite commonly to measure the muscles response to WBV, it can provide more information than how active the muscle is. The median frequency of the EMG signal divides the frequency spectrum into two equal halves and a shift to lower frequencies are associated with muscle fatigue[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The GM and TB muscles had lower EMGmdf during the double arm motion compared to the alternating arm motion suggesting the synchronous undulation exercise protocol was the most fatiguing for these muscles. However, the MF muscle was lower during the alternating arm motion vs the double arm motion. The current results also demonstrate that the different muscles are differentially affected by the different WBV exposures. In the VMO the 30 Hz condition resulted in lower EMGmdf during both motions compared to the NoWBV condition suggesting the 30 Hz condition may result in the most muscle fatigue in the VMO, perhaps due to less reflexive muscle contractions as compared to the 50 Hz condition. However, in the VL muscle, the 50 Hz condition resulted in a lower median frequency compared to NoWBV suggesting a different activation pattern than the VMO in the upper leg. These EMGmdf results suggest that the condition that results in the greatest muscle activity response generally has decreased EMGmdf suggesting the occurrence of muscle fatigue.</p><p>The frequency of arm movements was more rapid in both the <italic>z</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinates during the double arm motion compared to the alternating arm motion. Further, the frequency of arm movements was further increased with the addition of the 50 Hz WBV condition vs the NoWBV condition. This increase in arm speed movements with the application of WBV could be due to improved coactivation (increase BB and decreased TB EMG) with WBV exposure allowing a less inhibited arm motion. Further, as the 50 Hz WBV condition had the highest muscle activity for all muscles, except the TB, this data could suggest a benefit to performance (faster arm motion) as there is more active muscle to overcome the weight/resistance of the battling rope. While speculative, the increased EMG with WBV suggests increased cross bridge activity and force production to move an object of the same mass (battle ropes). As the force is increased then it seems possible that the movement velocity would also increase as participants are intending to move the ropes as fast as possible.</p><p>There was no difference in average heart rate between alternating arm or double arm motion in the present study. However, maximal heart rate attained during exercise was increased during the 50 Hz condition vs NoWBV in both the alternating arm and double arm motion. Further the maximal heart rates attained during the double arm motion were decreased compared to the alternating arm motion within the same condition. It is presently unclear how peak heart rates attained could be different across conditions without any change in average heart rate, however as peak heart rates were likely attained at the end of each bout, the increase in peak heart rate was likely not attained for a long enough duration to affect average heart rate. Further research exploring these possibilities would be of interest.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to examine the muscle activity response to battle rope exercise performed on a ground-based WBV platform. The current results demonstrate that the muscle activity response while performing battle rope (undulation) exercise can be augmented when the exercise is performed on a ground-based WBV platform. This increase in skeletal muscle activity in the lower leg (gastrocnemius), upper leg (vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis), trunk (rectus abdominus and multifidus), and arms (biceps brachii) is caused by an increased skeletal muscle reflexive response via the mechanical vibration oscillations. These increases in muscle EMG were greater with the increased WBV stimuli (50 Hz-H vs 30 Hz-L). For most muscles measured (VMO, VL, RA, MF) the double arm undulation technique resulted in increased skeletal muscle activity compared to the alternating arm motion. However, the GM muscle had increased muscle activity during the alternating arm motion, and EMG was not different between motions for the upper body (BB and TB). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the exercise stimulus of performing battling rope exercise (undulation training) can be augmented by completing the exercise on a ground-based WBV platform.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic>The authors would like to thank all the participants for their excellent cooperation.
