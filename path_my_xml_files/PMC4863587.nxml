This genomic aberration is found in about 2%&#x02013;8% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Crizotinib was the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor licensed for the treatment of metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC based on a randomized Phase III trial. Despite the initial treatment response of crizotinib, disease progression inevitably develops after approximately 10 months of therapy. Different resistance mechanisms have recently been described. One relevant mechanism of resistance is the development of mutations in ALK. Novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to overcome these mutations. Ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK inhibitor showing clinical activity not only in crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC but also in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve ALK-positive disease. In this paper, preclinical and clinical data of ceritinib are reviewed, and its role in the clinical setting is put into perspective.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>ALK</kwd><kwd>ceritinib</kwd><kwd>crizotinib</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction to the targeted treatment of ALK-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer</title><p>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA and European countries and claims more lives per year than all other major cancer types combined.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Two-third of patients are diagnosed with incurable metastatic disease in which the median overall survival (OS) with standard chemotherapy is approximately 12&#x02013;14 months.

The overall response rate (ORR) of crizotinib was 65% compared to 20% in the chemotherapy group. The primary end point of progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged from 3 months with chemotherapy to 7.7 months for patients treated with crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37&#x02013;0.64). The PROFILE 1014 trial included 343 chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve ALK-positive patients randomized to crizotinib or platinum-based chemotherapy.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> PFS was significantly longer with crizotinib (10.9 vs 7 months, HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.35&#x02013;0.60).

Therefore, the development of ALK-TKIs with clinical activity against ALK-positive NSCLC resistant to crizotinib is crucial.</p><p>However, not all initially ALK-positive NSCLC remain dependent on the ALK signaling pathway in the situation of acquired resistance to crizotinib. Resistance develops through a variety of mechanisms. ALK-dependent mechanisms include secondary mutation of ALK or EML4&#x02013;ALK gene amplification. In a first report on acquired resistance, two de novo point mutations in EML4&#x02013;ALK (L1196M and C1156Y) have been described.<xref rid="b19-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The L1196M mutation added a new bulky residue in the ATP-binding domain, sterically hindering TKI binding, thus, acting as a gatekeeper mutation, similar to the T790M mutation in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Ceritinib is slowly absorbed, with median peak plasma concentration occurring at approximately 4&#x02013;6 hours in patients and at approximately 6&#x02013;8 hours in healthy subjects. Following peak concentration in the plasma (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), ceritinib concentrations declined in a monoexponential manner. The geometric mean, apparent terminal half-life ranged from 31 to 41 hours across the 400&#x02013;750 mg dose groups in patients, and from 36 to 48 hours across the 450&#x02013;750 mg dose groups in healthy subjects. Ceritinib is highly bound to plasma protein (&#x0003e;94%) in all species. CYP3A4/5 is the major hepatic enzyme metabolizing ceritinib in a human in vitro system.

In an ongoing open-label, multicenter, randomized, parallel design Phase I study, the systemic exposure and safety of ceritinib administered at 450 or 600 mg with a daily low-fat meal vs 750 mg daily in the fasted state will be determined following multiple oral daily dosing in patients with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. The primary objective of this study is to assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 450 or 600 mg ceritinib taken with a low-fat meal as compared with that of 750 mg ceritinib taken in the fasted state in patients with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. Secondary objectives will be to assess the safety and efficacy of ceritinib when administered at 450 or 600 mg with a daily low-fat meal or 750 mg daily in the fasted state.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical data</title><p>In the ASCEND-1 trial, 59 patients with solid tumors carrying genetic alterations in ALK were treated with ceritinib.<xref rid="b32-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The dose was escalated from 50 to 750 mg given orally once daily.

About two-third of the study population was pretreated with crizotinib (n=80). In this subset of patients, ORR was almost identical to the whole population, at 56% (95% CI: 45&#x02013;67). However, median PFS was substantially longer in crizotinib-na&#x000ef;ve patients than in crizotinib-pretreated patients (10.4 vs 6.9 months).

Almost all patients (93.9%) had a decrease in tumor burden from baseline. Responses were durable, with a median duration of response of 9.3 months (95% CI: 9.1 to not reached due to ongoing responses at the time of analysis) and a median PFS of 11.1 months (95% CI: 9.3 to not reached). The median OS has not been reached at the time of data cutoff (median duration of follow-up 8.3 months).

The ASCEND-3 trial showed similar findings with GI-related AEs reported most commonly: diarrhea (82.3%), nausea (74.2%), and vomiting (66.9%). SAEs suspected to be study drug related were reported in ten (8.1%) patients. Pericarditis was the only SAE suspected to be study drug related that was reported in three (2.4%) patients. A total of 90 (72.6%) patients required dose adjustment or interruption.</p><p>Based on these data, ceritinib seems to have a higher toxicity than crizotinib, and a substantial number of patients need dose reductions in the course of treatment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-12-735">Table 1</xref> summarizes the most common AEs of ceritinib and crizotinib from the package inserts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion, place in therapy</title><p>The current standard of care for ALK-positive patients in the first-line setting is crizotinib, based on the results of the PROFILE 1014 trial.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Ceritinib is approved for ALK-positive adenocarcinoma patients progressing on crizotinib. Ceritinib shows substantial activity in patients with brain metastases, a frequent site of disease progression in ALK-positive NSCLC.<xref rid="b39-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The occurrence of CNS relapse is one of the main concerns in ALK-positive patients treated with crizotinib. Therefore, ceritinib seems to be an active drug in patients progressing on crizotinib.<xref rid="b34-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Furthermore, ceritinib might be a valuable option in ALK-positive patients with brain metastases irrespective of previous therapies. On the other hand, ceritinib also shows high activity in ALK-TKI-na&#x000ef;ve patients, with a median PFS of 11.1 months.<xref rid="b35-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The question of the optimal sequence of different ALK-TKIs cannot be answered at the moment as there are no head-to-head comparisons. Currently, the only prospective randomized trial comparing two different ALK-TKIs is the ALEX trial investigating crizotinib and alectinib in the first-line setting (NCT02075840). The trial has finished recruitment at the end of 2015, and results are eagerly awaited. A similar trial in a Japanese population (J-ALEX, JapicCTI-132316) was stopped early after a recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee as the study met its primary endpoint. The study showed that patients lived significantly longer when treated with alectinib compared to crizotinib.<xref rid="b40-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Alectinib is a more selective and potent ALK inhibitor than crizotinib. Preclinical studies have demonstrated activity against the crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations L1196M, C1156Y, and F1174L.<xref rid="b41-tcrm-12-735" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Other ALK inhibitors investigated in clinical trials include lorlatinib (PF-06463922), AP26113, ASP3026, TSR-011, and others. Lorlatinib for example is a highly potent, selective inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 with strong activity against all known ALK and ROS1 resistance mutations identified so far, including the highly resistant G1202R. There are several ongoing clinical trials with ceritinib. In two randomized Phase III trials, ceritinib is tested in comparison to platinum and pemetrexed in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve ALK-positive NSCLC (NCT01828099) and in comparison to docetaxel in previously treated patients (NCT01828112). Furthermore, ongoing trials investigate ceritinib in combination with the anti-PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (NCT02393625) and with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (NCT02321501).</p><p>In conclusion, ceritinib is a highly active ALK-TKI that has its place in the treatment landscape of ALK-positive lung cancer patients. However, the optimal treatment sequence for these patients has not yet been defined. As ceritinib exhibits a substantial toxicity with mainly GI-related AEs, the question of optimal dosing and application to improve patients QOL while on treatment has to be critically evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-tcrm-12-735"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>SIR received honoraria from Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche for advisory boards and invited talks.
