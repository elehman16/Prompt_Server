All else being equal, are PowerPoint presentations better than purely oral presentations or those that use alternative software tools? To address this question we recreated a real-world business scenario in which individuals presented to a corporate board. Participants (playing the role of the presenter) were randomly assigned to create PowerPoint, Prezi, or oral presentations, and then actually delivered the presentation live to other participants (playing the role of corporate executives). Across two experiments and on a variety of dimensions, participants evaluated PowerPoint presentations comparably to oral presentations, but evaluated Prezi presentations more favorably than both PowerPoint and oral presentations. There was some evidence that participants who viewed different types of presentations came to different conclusions about the business scenario, but no evidence that they remembered or comprehended the scenario differently. We conclude that the observed effects of presentation format are not merely the result of novelty, bias, experimenter-, or software-specific characteristics, but instead reveal a communication preference for using the panning-and-zooming animations that characterize Prezi presentations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from Prezi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prezi.com">http://www.prezi.com</ext-link>) to SMK. In the sponsored research agreement (which we are happy to provide) and in our conversations with Prezi leadership, they agreed to let us conduct the study as we wished and publish it no matter what the results revealed. Aside from funding the research, the only role that any employees of Prezi played was (as documented in the manuscript) 1) to provide us with a distribution list of Boston-area Prezi customers (8 of whom participated in the first experiment) and 2) as experts in Prezi, review the background questionnaire to ensure that we were accurately describing Prezi&#x02019;s purported benefits and features (just as PowerPoint and oral presentation experts did the same). No employees at Prezi had any role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. None of the authors have any professional or financial connection to Prezi or personal relationships with any Prezi employees. We do not plan to conduct any follow-up research on this topic or obtain future funding from Prezi. As evident in the manuscript, we took special care not to allow bias or demand characteristics to influence this research.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="10"/><page-count count="39"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data files are available from the Open Science Framework <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/fgf7c/">https://osf.io/fgf7c/</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data files are available from the Open Science Framework <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/fgf7c/">https://osf.io/fgf7c/</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>How do the characteristics of a communication medium affect its messages? This question has been the subject of much philosophical and empirical inquiry, with some (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) claiming that the medium determines the message (&#x0201c;the medium is the message&#x0201d;), others (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) claiming that characteristics of a medium affect the message, and others claiming that the medium and message are separable (e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). As psychologists, we ask: What mental mechanisms underlie effective communication and how can presenters leverage these mechanisms to communicate better? These questions&#x02014;at the intersection of psychology and communication practice&#x02014;motivate this research.</p><p>That said, the relative efficacy of different communication media or technologies informs the primary questions of interest. If we can demonstrate that oral presentations are less or more effective than those that rely on presentation software&#x02014;or that presenters who use one type of presentation software tend to be more effective than those who use another&#x02014;then we advance our psychological and practical understanding of effective communication. Thus, in the tradition of use-inspired basic research [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]&#x02014;and as a means to an end, rather than an end unto itself&#x02014;we compare the effectiveness of three commonly-used formats for communication: oral, PowerPoint, and Prezi presentations.</p><p>We focused on presentations because they populate our academic, professional, and even personal lives in the form of public speeches, academic lectures, webinars, class presentations, wedding toasts, courtroom arguments, sermons, product demonstrations, and business presentations [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and because basic questions remain about how to present effectively. Should we present with or without presentation software? If we should present with software, which software? We examined PowerPoint and Prezi because they are popular and psychologically interesting alternatives: Whereas PowerPoint&#x02019;s linear slide format might reduce cognitive load, focus attention, and promote logical analysis, Prezi&#x02019;s map-like canvas format and heavy reliance on animation (see the Background section and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://prezi.com">https://prezi.com</ext-link> for examples) might facilitate visuospatial processing, conceptual understanding, and narrative storytelling.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Background</title><p>To inform the present research, we explore the methodological challenges of media research and review past research on presentation formats.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Methodological challenges of media research</title><p>To research the efficacy of different communication formats fairly and accurately, one must overcome two stubborn methodological challenges. First, because correlation is not causation and the variables that underlie media usage are heavily confounded, such research requires true experimentation. To study whether a blended learning &#x0201c;flipped classroom&#x0201d; is a more effective instructional medium than traditional lecturing, for example, researchers gain little insight by comparing outcomes for students who enroll in one type of course versus the other. To control for audience (in this case, student) self-selection effects, researchers need to 1) randomly assign audience members to different communication conditions (in this case, pedagogies) or 2) manipulate format within participants. Moreover, the same methodological controls need to be applied to presenters (in this case, instructors). Instructors who choose to teach with emerging, innovative methods probably differ in numerous other respects (e.g., motivation) from those who teach with more traditional methods. If students assigned randomly to a flipped classroom format perform better than those assigned randomly to a traditional classroom format, we risk drawing inferences about confounds instead of causes unless instructors are also assigned randomly to instructional media. To make strong, accurate inferences, therefore, researchers interested in communication must control for audience and presenter self-selection effects. Such control introduces new complexities; when randomly assigning presenters to formats, for example, one must ensure that all presenters receive sufficient training in the relevant format. Moreover, such control is often cumbersome, sometimes impractical, and occasionally unethical (e.g., randomly assigning students in actual courses to hypothetically worse instructional conditions). But there are no adequate methodological substitutes for proper experimental control.</p><p>A second thorny methodological challenge inherent in conducting media research concerns how to draw general inferences about formats instead of specific inferences about exemplars of those formats. For example, if one advertising expert is assigned randomly to design a print ad and another expert a television ad&#x02014;and a hundred consumers are assigned randomly to view the television or print ad&#x02014;can we actually infer anything about print versus television ads in general when the two groups of consumers behave differently? Arguably not, because such a finding is just as easily explained by other (confounding) differences between the ads or their creators (e.g., ratio of print to graphics, which sorts of people&#x02014;if any&#x02014;are shown, and so forth). In other words, even with proper random assignment, researchers who intend to study different <italic>forms</italic> of communication risk merely studying different <italic>instances</italic> of communication. Statistically speaking, one should assume a random not fixed effect of the communication objects of interest (e.g., presentations, lectures, advertisements). To overcome this challenge and draw generalizable inferences, one must (at the very least) sample a sufficiently large set of examples within each medium.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Research on presentation software</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Methodological shortcomings</title><p>Considerable research has been conducted on how different presentation formats (particularly PowerPoint) convey information (for review, see [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). However, much of this research is anecdotal or based on case studies. For example, Tufte [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] claims that PowerPoint&#x02019;s default settings lead presenters to create bulleted lists and vacuous graphs that abbreviate arguments and fragment thought. And Kjeldsen [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used Al Gore&#x02019;s TED talk on climate change as a positive example of how visuals can be used to effectively convey evidence and enhance verbal communication.</p><p>Research that goes beyond mere anecdote or case study is plagued by the aforementioned methodological shortcomings: failure to control for audience self-selection effects (71% of studies), failure to control for presenter self-selection effects (100% of studies), and a problematic assumption of fixed effects across content and presenters (91% of studies). As is evident in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178774.t001">Table 1</xref>, no studies overcame two of these shortcomings, let alone all three. For example, in one of the most heavily-cited publications on this topic Szabo and Hasting [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated the efficacy of PowerPoint in undergraduate education. In the first study, they examined whether students who received lectures with PowerPoint performed better on a test than students who received traditional lectures. Students were not assigned randomly to lecture conditions, however; rather, the comparison was across time, between two cohorts of students enrolled in different iterations of the same course. Any observed outcome difference could have been caused by student or instructor variables (e.g., preparedness), not lecture format. The fact that no such differences were found does not obviate this concern: Such differences may in fact have been present, but were overshadowed by confounding characteristics of students or instructors. In the second study, the authors varied presentation format within the same cohort of students, but confounded format with order, time, content, and performance measure: student performance was compared between lectures on different days, on different topics, and using different tests. As the authors themselves note, the observed differences may have had nothing to do with PowerPoint. In the third study, they counterbalanced lecture order and content; some students received a PowerPoint lecture first and others a traditional lecture first, and the same topics were presented in both formats. However, students were assigned to conditions based on their course enrollment, not randomly, but more importantly the study included only four presentations, all by one presenter. Any advantages of the two PowerPoint lectures (none were found) might have been particular to those instances or that presenter and not representative of the format more generally.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0178774.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0178774.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Findings and flaws of research into presentation software.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0178774.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0178774.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>PPT vs Traditional</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Outcome Variable</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>PPT &#x0003e; Trad</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Null</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>PPT &#x0003c; Trad</underline></td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Performance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 of 28 (32%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 of 28 (61%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 of 28 (7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perception</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 of 26 (81%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 of 26 (12%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 of 26 (8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Persuasion</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 of 2 (100%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 2 (100%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 2 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>PPT Only</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Positive</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Neutral</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Negative</underline></td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perception</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 of 7 (100%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 7 (0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 7 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>Prezi vs PPT</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Prezi &#x0003e; PPT</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Null</underline></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Prezi &#x0003c; PPT</underline></td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Performance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 2 (0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 of 2 (100%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 2 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perception</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 of 1 (100%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 1 (0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 of 1 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Methodological Shortcomings</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Did not control for audience self-selection effects</td><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">47 of 66 (71%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Did not control for presenter self-selection effects</td><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">66 of 66 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assumed fixed presenter or presentation effects</td><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">60 of 66 (91%)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Studied researchers' own presentations or students</td><td align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">54 of 66 (82%)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>Note: "PPT Only" studies investigated whether participants had positive, neutral, or negative perceptions of PowerPoint and did not explicitly contrast PowerPoint with other presentation formats.

In one study ([<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: Experiment 1), for example, one of the authors varied the format of his lecture instruction randomly across the semester, using transparences or PowerPoint slides. In another study [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], students who were enrolled in one of the authors&#x02019; courses were assigned randomly to a PowerPoint or Prezi e-lecture that contained identical audio narration and written text. In a third study [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], one of the researchers gave the same lecture over the course of the year to rotating medical students, using PowerPoint on odd months and overhead slides on even months. What reason is there to think that we can make general claims about presentation format based on studies of single lectures or single presenters? That is, how can we reasonably assume fixed as opposed to random effects? If the use of presentation software does meaningfully influence student learning or experience, surely that effect is not constant across all presenters or presentations&#x02014;some instructors use it more effectively than others, and within any format some presentations are more effective than others (see [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). And how can we assume that presenters who select both the content and format of their presentations are not designing them in ways that favor one format over another?</p><p>Research on the efficacy of presentation software has numerous other flaws, most notably the failure to control for experimenter effects or demand characteristics. In 82% of studies we identified, for example, the researchers investigated their own instruction and studied their own students. It is difficult to imagine that one would make these instructional and research efforts (e.g., creating new course material, conducting a field experiment) without a strong belief in the efficacy of one format over the other, and it is plausible (if not likely) that such beliefs would influence students or confound instructional format with instructional effort and enthusiasm.</p><p>Another common issue is the confounding of lecture format with access to study materials&#x02014;in studies that contrast PowerPoint with traditional lecturing (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), students in the PowerPoint condition (but not the control condition) sometimes have access to PowerPoint slides as study material.

The majority of studies examined the use of PowerPoint in higher education and measured both objective and subjective outcomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178774.t001">Table 1</xref>). They typically involved students enrolled in one or more of the researchers&#x02019; courses, and contrasted the efficacy of lectures (or whole lecture courses) that used PowerPoint with those that used a more traditional technology (e.g., blackboards, overhead projectors). In terms of student performance, their findings were notably mixed: Of the 28 studies we identified, 17 found no effect of PowerPoint lectures relative to traditional lectures ([<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]: Experiments 1,3; [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), 9 found a performance benefit of PowerPoint over traditional instruction ([<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]: Experiment 2; [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), and 2 found a performance benefit of traditional over PowerPoint instruction [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>There is near consensus in the literature, however, when it comes student perception: Of the 26 studies we identified, 21 found that students preferred PowerPoint over traditional instruction ([<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]: Experiment 1; [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), 2 found that students preferred traditional over PowerPoint instruction [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and 3 other studies found no preference for one or the other formats [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As one example, Tang and Austin [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] surveyed 215 undergraduates in business courses about their general perceptions of different lecture formats; on measures of enjoyment, learning, motivation, and career relevance, they found that students rated lectures with PowerPoint slides more favorably than lectures with overheads or without visual aids. An additional 7 studies did not contrast student perceptions of PowerPoint with another technology&#x02014;they simply surveyed students about PowerPoint; these studies all found that students had, on average, favorable impressions of PowerPoint-based instruction [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these studies of how presentation software impacts student performance and perception, two studies examined PowerPoint&#x02018;s impact on audience persuasion. Guadagno, Sundie, Hardison, and Cialdini [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] argue that we heuristically use a presentation&#x02019;s format to evaluate its content, particularly when we lack the expertise to evaluate the content on its merits. To test this hypothesis, they presented undergraduates with key statistics about a university football recruit and asked them to evaluate the recruit&#x02019;s career prospects. The same statistics were presented in one of three formats: a written summary, a graphical summary via printed-out PowerPoint slides, or a graphical summary via animated PowerPoint slides (self-advanced by the participant). Participants shown the computer-based PowerPoint presentation tended to rate the recruit more positively than other participants, and there was some evidence that this effect was more pronounced for football novices than for experts. The findings of this study suggest that some presentation formats may be more persuasive than others, perhaps because audience members conflate a sophisticated medium with a sophisticated message.</p><p>In the second study to examine the impact of PowerPoint on persuasion, Park and Feigenson [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] examined the impact of video-recorded presentations on mock juror decision-making. Participants were more persuaded by attorneys on either side of a liability case when the attorney used PowerPoint slides as opposed to merely oral argument. They also remembered more details from PowerPoint than oral presentations, and evaluated both attorneys as more persuasive, competent, credible, and prepared when they presented with PowerPoint. Based on mediation analyses, the researchers argue that the decision-making benefit of PowerPoint results from both deliberative and heuristic processing (&#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; thinking, respectively, see [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]).</p><p>Both of these studies, however, share the methodological limitations of the educational research on PowerPoint. The first study [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] used only one PowerPoint presentation, and the second [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] used only two. The presentations used were not selected at random from a larger stimulus pool but instead were created by researchers who hypothesized that PowerPoint would enhance presentations. But even if the presentations had been sampled randomly, the sample is too small to allow one to generalize to a broader population. In studying performance, perception, or persuasion, one cannot reasonably assume that all presentation effects are equal.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Prezi: A zoomable user interface</title><p>Released in 2009, Prezi has received generally favorable reviews by researchers, educators, and professional critics [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. With a purported 75 million users worldwide, it is increasingly popular but still an order of magnitude less so than PowerPoint (with as many as one billion users; [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]). Like PowerPoint and other slideware, Prezi allows users to arrange images, graphics, text, audio, video and animations, and to present them alongside aural narration to an in-person or remote audience. In contrast to PowerPoint and other slideware in which users create presentations as a deck of slides, Prezi users create presentations on a single visuospatial canvas. In this regard, Prezi is much like a blackboard and chalk. But unlike a physical blackboard, the Prezi canvas is infinite (cf. [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]) and zoomable: in designing presentations, users can infinitely expand the size of their canvas and can zoom in or out. When presenting, users define paths to navigate their audience through the map-like presentation, zooming and panning from a fixed-angle overhead view.</p><p>Like Google Maps or modern touchscreens, Prezi is an example of what scholars of human-computer interaction label a zoomable user interface (ZUI). These interfaces are defined by two features: They present information in a theoretically infinite two-dimensional space (i.e., an infinite canvas) and they enable users to animate this virtual space through panning and zooming. Some of the original ZUIs were used to visualize history, navigate file systems, browse images, and&#x02014;in the Prezi predecessor CounterPoint&#x02014;create presentations [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>As communication and visualization tools, ZUIs in general and Prezi in particular are interesting psychologically for several reasons. First, they may take advantage of our mental and neural architecture, specifically the fact that we process information through dissociable visual and spatial systems. Whereas the so-called &#x0201c;ventral&#x0201d; visual system in the brain processes information such as shape and color, the &#x0201c;dorsal&#x0201d; spatial system processes information such as location and distance [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. When working in concert, these systems result in vastly better memory and comprehension than when they work in isolation. For example, in the classic &#x0201c;method of loci&#x0201d; individuals visualize objects in specific locations; when later trying to recall the objects, they visualize navigating through the space, &#x0201c;seeing&#x0201d; each object in turn. This method typically doubles retention, compared to other ways of trying to memorize objects [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Similarly, in research on note-taking, students learned more when they used spatial methods than when they used linear methods (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]). Mayer&#x02019;s multimedia learning principles and evidence in their favor also highlight the importance of spatial contiguity [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Thus, by encouraging users to visualize and process information spatially, ZUIs such as Prezi may confer an advantage over traditional tools such as PowerPoint that do not encourage such visuospatial integration. As Good and Bederson [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] write: &#x0201c;Because they employ a metaphor based on physical space and navigation, ZUIs offer an additional avenue for exploring the utilization of human spatial abilities during a presentation.&#x0201d;</p><p>Furthermore, ZUIs may encourage a particularly efficacious type of spatial processing, namely graphical processing. In graphical processing, digital objects (or groups of objects) are not just arranged in space, they are arranged or connected in a way makes their interrelationships explicit. Randomly placing animal stickers on a blank page, for example, engages mere spatial processing; drawing connecting lines between animals of the same genus or arranging the animals into a phylogenetic tree, however, engages graphical processing. Because ZUIs force users to &#x0201c;see the big picture,&#x0201d; they may prompt deeper processing than software that segments content into separate spatial canvases. By facilitating such processing, ZUIs may leverage the same learning benefits of concept maps and other graphical organizers, which have been studied extensively. For example, in their meta-analysis of the use of concept maps in education, Nesbit and Adesope [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] found that these graphical representations (especially when animated) were more effective than texts, lists, and outlines. By requiring one to organize the whole presentation on a single canvas instead of a slide deck, therefore, Prezi may prompt presenters (and their audiences) to connect component ideas with each other, contextualize them in a larger narrative, and remember, understand, and appreciate this larger narrative. Slideware, on the other hand, may do just the opposite:</p><disp-quote><p>PowerPoint favours information that can be displayed on a single projected 4:3 rectangle.

Perhaps PowerPoint does confer some of same spatial processing benefits of Prezi&#x02014;after all, slides are spatial canvases, and they must be arranged to form a narrative&#x02014;but in a way that better manages the limited attentional resources of the presenter or audience. Our point here is simply that Prezi, as a ZUI presentation tool, offers a psychologically interesting alternative to standard deck-based slideware, with a range of possible advantages that could be explored empirically to discover the psychological mechanisms of effective communication.</p><p>Like the PowerPoint literature, most of the published literature on Prezi is limited to observational reports or case studies. Brock and Brodahl [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] evaluated Prezi favorably based on their review and students&#x02019; ratings of course presentations. Conboy, Fletcher, Russell, and Wilson [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] interviewed 6 undergraduates and 3 staff members about their experiences with Prezi in lecture instruction and reported generally positive experiences. Masood and Othman [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] measured the eye movements and subjective judgments of ten participants who viewed a single Prezi presentation; participants attended to the presentation&#x02019;s text more than to its other components (e.g., images, headings), and favorably judged the presentation. Ballentine [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] assigned students to use Prezi to design text adventure games and reported benefits of using the medium. Two other studies [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] surveyed college students about their course experiences with Prezi, and both reported similarly positive perceptions.</p><p>All of these studies, however, suffer from major demand characteristics, due to the fact that the researchers observed or asked leading questions of their own students about their own instruction (e.g., &#x0201c;Do you find lectures delivered with Prezi more engaging then[sic] other lectures?&#x0201d;, from [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). Moreover, all suffer from the methodological limitations discussed earlier.</p><p>Other literature that addresses Prezi is purely theoretical and speculative: In discussing the pedagogical implications of various presentation software, Harris [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] mostly just describes Prezi&#x02019;s features, but does suggest that some of these features provide useful visual metaphors (e.g., zooming in to demonstrate otherwise hidden realities). Bean [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] offers a particularly compelling analysis of PowerPoint and Prezi&#x02019;s histories, user interfaces, and visual metaphors, and argues that Prezi is the optimal tool for presenting certain types of information (e.g., wireflow diagrams).</p><p>The experimental literature on Prezi is limited to three published studies. Castelyn, Mottart and Valcke [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] investigated whether a Prezi e-lecture with graphic organizers (e.g., concepts maps) was more effective than a PowerPoint e-lecture without graphic organizers. Claiming that Prezi encourages the use of graphic organizers, they purposefully confounded the type of presentation software with the presence of graphic organizers. Undergraduates randomly assigned to the different e-lectures did not differ in their knowledge or self-efficacy gains, but did prefer the graphically-organized Prezi lecture over the PowerPoint control lecture. In a follow-up study [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], the same researchers assigned undergraduates to create Prezi presentations that did or did not use graphic organizers, and found no effects of this manipulation on students&#x02019; self-reported motivation or self-efficacy. Chou, Chang, and Lu [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] compared the effects of Prezi, PowerPoint and traditional blackboard instruction on 5<sup>th</sup> graders&#x02019; learning of geography. Whereas the Prezi group performed better than the control group (which received blackboard instruction) in formative quizzes and a summative test, the PowerPoint group did not; however, on a delayed summative test, both Prezi and PowerPoint students performed better than those in the control group. In direct comparisons of PowerPoint and Prezi, there were no differences in any of the learning measures. Taken together, the studies are not just limited in number: They present uncompelling findings and suffer from the same methodological shortcomings of the PowerPoint research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>The current study</title><p>In short, the extant literature does not clarify whether presenters should present with or without visual aids&#x02014;and, if the latter, whether they should use standard deck-based slideware such as PowerPoint or a ZUI such as Prezi. One of the reasons why these basic questions remain unanswered is the methodological challenges inherent in comparing different presentation formats. We designed the current study to overcome these challenges.</p><p>To control for individual differences among presenters, we randomly assigned presenters to different presentation conditions. To control for individual differences among audience members, we used a counterbalanced, within-participants design for the first experiment, and between-participants random assignment in the second experiment. And to draw general inferences about the impact of presentation format&#x02014;instead of specific inferences about particular presenters or presentations&#x02014;we sampled from a large number of presentations, each created by a different presenter. Our methods have their own challenges, such as recruiting participants sufficiently trained in all presentation methods, allowing presenters adequate preparation time and context, approximating the psychological conditions of real-world presentations, and measuring the &#x0201c;signal&#x0201d; of presentation format among the added &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; of so many presenters and presentations. In addition, the studies had to be double-blind: Neither presenters nor audience members could be aware of any hypotheses, and had to be free from any sorts of confirmation bias conveyed by the investigators.</p><p>To focus on presentations as a form of presenter-audience communication and limit the number of confounded variables, we purposefully controlled for other possible impacts of presentation software on professional practices or outcomes, including 1) the use of presentation artifacts (e.g., PowerPoint files, printed-out slides, online Prezis), and 2) facilitated collaboration among presentation designers. Unlike other research (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) we did allow for the possibility that presentation format not only affects how audiences perceive presentations, but also how presenters design or deliver them (e.g., by increasing their conceptual understanding of the topic, or decreasing their cognitive load during live narration; cf. [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]). In other words, presentation technologies might affect the cognition of both the audience and the presenter, so we designed the present studies to accommodate both sets of mechanisms.</p><p>To maximize the real-world relevance of this research, we relied on multimedia case materials from Harvard Business School [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]; these materials recreate the actual professional circumstances in which presentations are typically used. Because presentations are designed commonly both to inform and convince audiences, we examine outcome measures of learning as well as persuasion. And to minimize demand characteristics, we avoided the typical flaws of existing research (e.g., researcher-designed presentations, the researchers&#x02019; students as research participants) and adopted several countermeasures (e.g., recruitment language and participant instructions that obscured the research hypotheses, between-participant manipulation).</p><p>We adopted a two-phased approach in this research. In the first phase, participants with sufficient experience in oral, PowerPoint, and Prezi presentation formats were randomly assigned to create a presentation in one of those formats. We provided the necessary context, instruction, and time to create a short but realistic presentation. Participants then presented live to an actual audience, who judged each presentation&#x02019;s efficacy. In the second phase, recorded versions of these presentations were presented to a larger online audience, affording us greater statistical power and allowing us to measure the impact of presentation format on decision-making and learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="sec010" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited presenter participants via online postings (on Craigslist, the Harvard Psychology Study Pool, the Harvard Decision Science Lab Study Pool), email solicitations to the local Prezi community, and campus flyers.

In the online pre-survey, presenters first answered basic demographic questions (gender, age, education level, English fluency, and occupation). Next, they answered questions about their prior experience with, opinions about, and understanding of the different presentation formats (oral, Prezi, and PowerPoint). This section was prefaced with the following note:</p><disp-quote><p>A note on language: When we use the term "presentation," we mean a formal, planned, and oral presentation of any duration, including a public speech, an academic lecture, a webinar, a class presentation, a wedding toast, a sermon, a product demonstration, a business presentation, and so on. Examples of things we do NOT mean are: a theatrical performance, an impromptu toast at dinner, and any presentation with no audience. When we say PowerPoint presentations, we mean presentations that were made using Microsoft PowerPoint, not other software such as Apple's Keynote. When we say Prezi presentations, we mean presentations that were made using Prezi presentation software. Also, when we refer to "oral presentation", we mean a presentation that is only spoken and does not include any visual aids or the use of presentation software.</p></disp-quote><p>Participants were asked the following questions for each type of presentation:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How experienced are you at making the following types of presentations?

[free response]</p></list-item></list><p>As part of the expertise-related measures, we also asked the participants to identify the purported advantages and disadvantages of each presentation format, according to its proponents and critics, respectively. For PowerPoint and Prezi, we asked participants to identify whether or not it had particular functionalities (e.g., the capacity to record narration, create custom backgrounds, print handouts). Finally, participants viewed three sets of four short Prezi presentations and rank-ordered them from best to worst. In each set we manipulated a key dimension of Prezi effectiveness, according to its designers: the use of zooming, the connection of ideas, and the use of visual metaphor.</p><p>Presenter participants were tested in person at the Harvard Decision Science Lab, and randomly assigned to one of the three groups: Prezi, PowerPoint, or oral presentation. A total of 50 data collection sessions were held. In each session, there were typically three presenter participants (one for each presentation format); as a result of participants who failed to arrive or overbooking, there were ten sessions with only two presenters and six sessions with four presenters.</p><p>After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey (in the lab) in which they rank-ordered three sets of recorded example PowerPoint and oral presentations. Identical in form to the example Prezi presentations they judged in the pre-survey, these short presentations were designed to assess their understanding of effective presentation design by manipulating a key aspect specific to each format. For PowerPoint presentations, we manipulated the use of text, use of extraneous &#x0201c;bells and whistles,&#x0201d; and graph design; for oral presentations, the three dimensions were verbal behavior, nonverbal behavior (other than eye contact), and eye contact. In selecting these dimensions (and those for Prezi), we consulted with a variety of experts, including software designers, speaking coaches, and researchers.</p><p>Next, presenters were shown material from a multimedia case created for and used by the Harvard Business School. Specifically, they were told the following (the company featured in the business case will be referred to anonymously here as &#x0201c;Company X&#x0201d; to respect their contractual agreement with the school):</p><disp-quote><p>For the next two hours, you are going to pretend to be the chief marketing officer of i-Mart, a large chain of retail stores. i-Mart recently made an offer to [Company X] to sell their products in i-Mart stores. Your boss, the CEO of i-Mart, has asked you to make a presentation to [Company X]&#x02019;s leadership that persuades them to accept i-Mart&#x02019;s offer. In your presentation, you will need to argue that accepting i-Mart&#x02019;s offer is in [Company X]&#x02019;s strategic interests, and address any concerns they may have about how accepting the offer might affect their corporate identity.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>As a participant in this study, your primary job today is to prepare and then deliver this presentation. The presentation will be very short (less than 5 minutes) and made live (via Skype) to an audience of participants who are playing the part of [Company X] executives. Before you start planning your presentation, you will first learn more about [Company X] and how they&#x02019;re thinking about i-Mart&#x02019;s offer.</p></disp-quote><p>On their own computer workstation, participants studied the multimedia case for 30 minutes and were invited to take notes on blank paper provided for them. The multimedia case material included video and textual descriptions of Company&#x02019;s X&#x02019;s corporate culture, business model, and constituent communities.</p><p>Following this study period, participants were given 45 minutes to create a presentation in one of three randomly assigned presentation formats: PowerPoint, Prezi, or oral. To assist participants in the PowerPoint and Prezi conditions, we provided them with a set of digital artifacts including text, data, and graphics related to the case. Participants were not told that other participants were asked to present in different formats, and the workstations were separated from each other to prevent participants from discovering this manipulation.</p><p>After this preparation period, participants were taken individually (in a counterbalanced order) to another room to present to a live audience via Skype. For PowerPoint and Prezi presentations, we shared each participant&#x02019;s presentation with the audience via screen sharing; thus they viewed both the presenter and the presentation. For those presenters who consented, we also recorded their presentations for future research purposes. After making their presentations, presenters completed a final survey about their presentation (e.g., &#x0201c;How convincing do you think your presentation will be to [Company X&#x02019;s] board members&#x0201d;), the corporate scenario (e.g., What do you think [Company X] should do?&#x0201d;), and their presentation format (e.g., &#x0201c;How likely are you to recommend the presentation tool or presentation format you used to others to make professional presentations?&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Audience procedure</title><p>Audience participants completed the entire experiment remotely and online. Their participation was scheduled for the end of the presenter sessions so that the in-lab presenters could present live to a remote audience via Skype. We recruited between three and six audience participants per session, although participants who failed to arrive or Skype connectivity issues resulted in some sessions with only one or two audience participants: Five sessions had one participant, twelve sessions had two participants, sixteen sessions had three participants, eleven sessions had four participants, four sessions had five participants, and two sessions had six participants.</p><p>Individuals who responded to the recruitment notice completed a consent form and three online surveys prior to their scheduled Skype session. The first survey was a slightly modified form of the presenter pre-survey (demographics, background on presentation formats, rank-ordering of example Prezis) in which they also scheduled their Skype session. In the second survey, audience participants were told that they were &#x0201c;going to play the role of a corporate executive listening to several short business presentations,&#x0201d; and that their task was &#x0201c;to evaluate the quality of these presentations, each made by another participant engaged in a similar role-playing scenario.&#x0201d; They were then shown a brief video and textual description of the fictionalized corporate scenario (an abridged version of what presenter participants studied), and told the following:</p><disp-quote><p>You are a board member for [Company X], an innovative clothing company. Another company, i-Mart, wants to sell [Company Y&#x02019;s products] in its stores. You and your fellow board members must decide whether or not to accept i-Mart's offer.</p></disp-quote><p>And in the third survey they rank-ordered the three sets of recorded example PowerPoint and oral presentations.</p><p>At the time of the scheduled session, the audience participants logged into Skype using a generic account provided by the research team, and were instructed to turn on their webcams and put on headphones. Once the first presenter participant was ready to present, the experimenter initiated the group Skype call, confirmed that the software was functioning properly, invited the presenter into the room to begin, left the room before the start of the presentation, monitored the presentation remotely via a closed-circuit video feed, and re-entered the room at the presentation&#x02019;s conclusion. For Prezi and PowerPoint presentations, Skype&#x02019;s built-in screen-sharing function was used to share the visual component of the presentation; audience participants viewing these presentations were instructed to use the split-screen view, with windows of equal size showing the presenter and the accompanying visuals.</p><p>Immediately after viewing each presentation, participants evaluated it via an online survey. They rated each presentation on how organized, engaging, realistic, persuasive, and effective it was using a five-level scale with response options of <italic>not at all</italic>, <italic>slightly</italic>, <italic>somewhat</italic>, <italic>very</italic>, and <italic>extremely</italic>. They were also invited to offer feedback to the presenter on how the presentation could be improved. After the final presentation, participants rank-ordered the presentations on the same dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, persuasiveness). Halfway through the experiment we added a final question in which we asked participants to rank-order PowerPoint, Prezi, and oral presentation formats &#x0201c;in terms of their general effectiveness, ignoring how well individual presenters (including today's) use that format,&#x0201d; and to explain their rank-ordering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec014" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Prior experience and pre-existing beliefs</title><p>Participants&#x02019; prior experience with and pre-existing beliefs about each presentation format provide a baseline that informs the research findings. If presenter participants had more experience with and more positive beliefs about one format than the others&#x02014;and those assigned to that format induced more positive assessments from the audience members than did those assigned to the other formats&#x02014;then the results are less compelling than if there was no correlation between these baseline measures and the experimental outcomes. The same applies to audience participants: Are they merely judging presentations according to their initial biases? Conversely, the results are most compelling if there is a negative association between the baseline measures and the experimental findings. For this reason&#x02014;and to check that presenters assigned to the different formats did not happen to differ in these baseline measures&#x02014;we analyzed participants&#x02019; prior experience with and pre-existing beliefs about PowerPoint, Prezi, and oral presentation formats.</p><p>Both audience and presenter participants were least experienced with Prezi and most experienced with oral presentations. At the outset, they rated PowerPoint as the most effective and easiest to use to present material and Prezi as the least effective and most difficult to use to present. For watching presentations, audience participants rated PowerPoint most effective and oral presentations least effective, but rated Prezi as more enjoyable than other formats. For watching presentations, presenter participants did not find any format more effective than the others. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178774.t003">Table 3</xref> presents full descriptive and inferential statistics for all self-reported measures of prior experience with and preexisting beliefs about Prezi, PowerPoint, and oral presentations.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0178774.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0178774.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Prior experience and pre-existing beliefs of Experiment 1 participants.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0178774.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0178774.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Means</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prezi</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPT</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oral</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">post hoc</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="7" rowspan="1">Presenter participants</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Presenter experience (rating)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.95</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.13</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.96</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">142</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;.00001</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPT &#x0003e;

They also did not differ in how well they identified the purported advantages and disadvantages of each presentation format, how well they identified the software features of PowerPoint and Prezi, or how accurately they could identify effective presentations of each format.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Audience ratings</title><p>In term of their prior experience with and pre-existing beliefs about presentation formats, both audience and presenter participants were biased in favor of oral and PowerPoint presentations and against Prezi. After presenters were randomly assigned to these different formats, how did the audience evaluate their presentations?</p><p>In examining how presentation format affected the audience&#x02019;s ratings of the presentations, two complications arose. First, sessions with two presentations were missing one presentation format, and sessions with four presentations had two presentations of the same format. To address this complexity we only conducted pairwise comparisons of different formats (e.g., PPT versus oral) instead of omnibus tests, and&#x02014;for those sessions with four presentations&#x02014;we averaged ratings for the two same-format presentations. To be certain that the differing number of presentations per session did not somehow bias the results even after adopting these measures, we also conducted an analysis on the subset of sessions that had exactly three presentations.</p><p>Second, the number of audience participants per session ranged from one to six. In calculating descriptive statistics, some sessions would be weighted more heavily than others unless ratings were first averaged across participants within the same session, then averaged across sessions. In calculating inferential statistics, averaging across ratings from different participants within the same session who received presentations in the same format was necessary to ensure that the sampling units were independent of each other, an assumption of all parametric and most nonparametric tests. In other words, for both descriptive and inferential statistics, we treated session (instead of participant) as the sampling unit.</p><p>As an empirical matter, this multi-step averaging&#x02014;within participants across identical presentation formats, then across participants within the same session&#x02014;had little impact on the condition means (i.e., the average ratings of PowerPoint, Prezi, or oral presentations on each dimension). Compared to the simplest, raw averaging of all ratings in one step, the maximum absolute difference between these two sets of means was .07 (on a 1&#x02013;5 scale) and the mean absolute difference was .04.</p><p>To test whether the presentations&#x02019; format affected their ratings, therefore, we conducted paired <italic>t</italic>-tests for each rating dimension, with presentation format as the repeated measure and mean session rating as the dependent variable. Because we conducted three tests for each dimension&#x02014;pairing each format with every other&#x02014;we controlled for multiple comparisons by dividing our significance threshold by the same factor (i.e., &#x003b1; = .05/3 = .017). Results revealed that presentation format influenced audience ratings. In particular, the audience rated Prezi presentations as significantly more organized, engaging, persuasive, and effective than both PowerPoint and oral presentations; on a five-level scale, the average participant rated Prezi presentations over half a level higher than other presentations. The audience did not rate PowerPoint presentations differently than oral presentations on any dimension. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178774.t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig"

This was true despite the fact that both audience and presenter participants were initially predisposed against Prezi. What might explain these findings?</p><p>One explanation is a novelty effect: Perhaps the audience preferred Prezi simply because it is relatively new to them. It appears that this was not the case, however: Only 8% of participants claimed that they preferred Prezi because it was new or different, and there was no significant relationship between the audiences&#x02019; experience with Prezi and their ratings or rank-orderings.</p><p>Another explanation for these results is that the presenters or audience members were somehow biased towards the Prezi presentations. Again, however, this appears not to be the case. The presenters were least experienced in Prezi, judged themselves least effective presenting with Prezi, and found Prezi presentations hardest to create. We recruited only a small minority (8%) of presenters based on their prior association with Prezi, and used the most conservative exclusion criteria feasible: only individuals without any experience with Prezi or PowerPoint were excluded from participating. All presenters were randomly assigned to their presentation format and were blind to the experimental manipulation. In recruiting audience participants, we did not mention Prezi or PowerPoint, and selected participants only based on their access to Skype and a sufficiently large computer screen. In addition, we minimized contact between the investigator and research participants, and presentations were never identified based on their format; at the end of the experiment, in fact, some participants did not even realize that they had seen a Prezi presentation (as evidenced by their free responses). Data were collected through standardized, online surveys, the investigator was not in the room with the presenter during his or her presentation, and the investigator interacted with the audience only briefly to set up their Skype session. Finally, an analysis of ratings from only the first presentations yielded the same results as the full analysis, making implausible an interpretation based on audience demand characteristics.</p><p>Thus, the most likely explanation is that individuals do, in fact, perceive Prezi presentations more favorably than PowerPoint or oral presentation. Experiment 1 has several limitations, however. First, because each audience participant in Experiment 1 was exposed to multiple presentations, we were unable to evaluate presentations on their ultimate goal: to convince the audience (role-playing Company X board members) to accept i-Mart&#x02019;s business offer. In other words, Experiment 1 demonstrated that Prezi presentations are more effective than other formats in terms of audience perceptions but not decision-making outcomes. Second, we asked the audience about their pre-existing beliefs and prior experiences with PowerPoint, Prezi, and oral presentations at the beginning of the Experiment 1; although it is difficult to imagine how this questioning could have produced the obtained results&#x02014;particularly given the nature of their pre-existing beliefs and prior experiments&#x02014;it is a remote possibility. Third, just like the results from any single experiment, the findings of Experiment 1 should be treated cautiously until replicated. We designed a second experiment to address these limitations and extend the findings from the first experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>In Experiment 2 we showed online participants a single presentation from Experiment 1, and varied randomly which type of presentation (Prezi, PowerPoint, or oral) they viewed. We also randomly assigned some participants to view a presentation on material that was not related to the case material; this control condition served as a baseline that allowed us to estimate the impact of each presentation format. To minimize demand characteristics, we asked participants about their experiences with different presentation formats at the conclusion of the experiment (instead of the beginning), and did not expose participants to multiple presentation formats. Finally, to investigate better the nature of participants&#x02019; perceptions about presentation effectiveness, we distinguished between perceptions about the presentation, the presenter, and the audiovisual component of the presentation.</p><sec id="sec024" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec025"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited native-English speaking participants via Amazon&#x02019;s Mechanical Turk using the following language: &#x0201c;In this study, you will read a business case, watch presentations, assume a role, and make a decision.&#x0201d; They were compensated $4 for approximately one hour of their time.

For Prezi and PowerPoint presentations, these were split-screen videos showing the presenter on one side of the screen and the visuals on the other side. For the oral presentations, these were simply audiovisual recordings of the presenter.</p><p>Of the 146 presenter participants from Experiment 1, 33 either did not consent to being video-recorded or were not recorded due to technical difficulties. We therefore had a pool of 113 presentation videos to use for Experiment 2: 41 from the Prezi condition (out of a possible 50), 40 from the PowerPoint condition (out of possible 49), and 32 from the oral presentation condition (out of a possible 47). The proportion of presentations that were video-recorded did not vary with their format, exact <italic>p</italic> = .61.</p><p>Some of the recorded presentations from Experiment 1 were unusable because of intractable quality issues (e.g., inaudible speech, incomplete video, partially occluded presenter), leaving a total of 89 usable videos (34 Prezi, 28 PowerPoint, 27 oral). The proportion of videos removed because of quality issues did not vary with presentation format, exact <italic>p</italic> = .57.</p><p>We randomly selected 25 videos in each format, resulting in a total pool of 75 videos.

To ensure that our judgments of major audiovisual problems and subsequent exclusion of some videos were not biased, we recruited a separate group of participants to rate the audiovisual quality of the 113 presentation videos.

We conducted the ANOVAs on the three measures of audiovisual quality collected from the independent judges: ratings of audio quality, ratings of video quality, and judgments of major audiovisual problems.</p><p>The results were straightforward: For all three dependent variables, there were no main effects of Presentation Format, <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003e; .13, but we did find a significant main effect of Quality Judgment (with included videos being judged better quality than excluded videos), all <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003c; .002, and did not find any interaction effects, all <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003e; .31.

To examine these relationships, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with the various ratings as the dependent variables, and participants&#x02019; judgments (&#x0201c;not enough,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;about right,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;too much&#x0201d;) about the amount of text, graphs, animations, and images in the PowerPoint and Prezi presentations as the independent variable.

Only 21% of participants thought there was not enough or too much text; for the other dimensions, this percentage ranged from 42&#x02013;51%.

This remained true despite participants&#x02019; preexisting bias against Prezi and the different context of Experiment 2: the audience did not view multiple presentations of different formats and presentations were prerecorded instead of live. Extending the Experiment 1 results, participants also judged Prezi presentations as better in various ways (e.g., more visually compelling, more dynamic) than PowerPoint presentations; participants even rated Prezi presenters more highly (e.g., more knowledgeable, more professional) than PowerPoint presenters.</p><p>In making decisions as corporate executives, participants were persuaded by the presentations. Compared to the baseline decisions of the control group, those in the treatment group shifted their decisions by 16.2%, 12.3%, and 8.0% depending on whether they viewed Prezi, PowerPoint, or oral presentations, respectively. The non- or marginal significance of some between-format comparisons (e.g., PowerPoint versus Prezi) is difficult to interpret. We hesitate to dismiss these differences as statistical noise given their general alignment with rating results, as well as the correlation between business decisions and presentation ratings (which do vary significantly with format). For the more objective outcome of decision-making, we can, at the very least, provisionally conclude that Prezi presentations are more effective than oral presentations, and that software-aided presentations are more effective than oral presentations.</p><p>We did not find any evidence that the presentations affected participants&#x02019; memory or understanding of the case, nor did we find evidence that certain presentation formats impacted learning more than others. Given the goals of the presentations and design of the experiment, however, we hesitate to draw any conclusions from these null results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>General discussion</title><p>The most important finding across the two experiments is easy to summarize: Participants evaluated Prezi presentations as more organized, engaging, persuasive, and effective than both PowerPoint and oral presentations. This finding was true for both live and prerecorded presentations, when participants rated or ranked presentations, and when participants judged multiple presentations of different formats or only one presentation in isolation. Results from Experiment 2 demonstrate that these presentations influenced participants&#x02019; core judgments about a business decision, and suggest that Prezi may benefit both behavioral and experiential outcomes. We have no evidence, however, that Prezi (or PowerPoint or oral presentations) facilitate learning in either presenters or their audience.</p><p>Several uninteresting explanations exist for the observed Prezi effects, none of which posit any specific efficacy of Prezi or ZUIs in general: namely, novelty, bias, and experimenter effects. We consider each in turn.</p><p>Novelty heavily influences both attention and memory [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and the benefits of new media have sometimes dissipated over time&#x02014;just as one would expect with novelty effects [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, we found no evidence that novelty explains the observed benefits of Prezi: Participants who were less familiar with Prezi did not evaluate Prezi presentations more favorably, and only a small fraction of participants who favored Prezi explained their preference in terms of novelty. We therefore are skeptical that mere novelty can explain the observed effects.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that participants had a pre-existing bias for Prezi. This seems unlikely because presenter participants were selected based only on minimal experience with both PowerPoint and Prezi and were assigned randomly to the experimental groups; audience participants from both experiments were selected based merely on high-speed internet access, and the words &#x0201c;Prezi&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;PowerPoint&#x0201d; were not used in any audience recruitment material. In fact, both sets of participants entered the research with biases against Prezi, not for Prezi: They reported more experience with PowerPoint and oral presentations than Prezi, and perceived PowerPoint and oral presentations as more (not less) efficacious than Prezi. Thus, we reject the idea that the results simply reflect pre-existing media biases.</p><p>For many reasons, we also find it unlikely that experimenter effects&#x02014;including demand characteristics (i.e., when participants conform to the experimenters&#x02019; expectations)&#x02014;can explain the observed effects. First, at the outset we did not have strong hypotheses about the benefits of one format over the others. Second, the results are subtle in ways that neither we nor a demand characteristics hypothesis would predict: the effects on subjective experience diverged somewhat from the effects on decision-making, and there were no memory or comprehension effects. Third, the between-participants design of Experiment 2 (and between-participants analysis of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Experiment 1</xref>) limited participants&#x02019; exposure to a single presentation format, thereby minimizing their ability to discern the experimental manipulation or research hypotheses. Fourth, we ensured that the presentations were equally high-quality; we did not unconsciously select Prezi presentations that happened to be higher quality than presentations in the other formats. Fifth, the random assignment of presenters to format limits the possible confounding of presenter variables with presentation formats or qualities; and no confounding with format was observed in presenters&#x02019; preexisting beliefs, prior experience, or demographics. And finally, in Experiment 2 we only explicitly mentioned or asked participants questions about Prezi, PowerPoint, and oral presentations at the conclusion of the experiment, after collecting all key outcome data.</p><p>We therefore conclude that the observed effects are not confounds or biases, but instead reflect a true and specific benefit of Prezi over PowerPoint or, more generally, ZUIs over slideware. If, however, these experimental effects merely reveal that Prezi is more user-friendly than PowerPoint&#x02014;or that PowerPoint&#x02019;s default templates encourage shallow processing by &#x0201c;[fetishizing] the outline at the expense of the content&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] (pB26)&#x02014;then we have learned little about the practice or psychology of communication. But if these effects instead reflect intrinsic properties of ZUIs or slideware, then they reveal more interesting and general insights about effective communication.</p><p>It is difficult to understand Prezi&#x02019;s benefits in terms of user-friendliness because the odds were so clearly stacked in PowerPoint&#x02019;s favor. Presenters were much more experienced in using PowerPoint than Prezi and rated PowerPoint as easier to use than Prezi. Especially given the task constraints&#x02014;participants only had 45 minutes to prepare for a 5-minute presentation on a relatively new, unfamiliar topic&#x02014;Prezi&#x02019;s user interface would have to be improbably superior to PowerPoint&#x02019;s interface to overcome these handicaps. Moreover, participants&#x02019; prior experience with PowerPoint or Prezi did not correlate with their success as presenters, as one would expect under an ease-of-use explanation. Finally, audience participants did not simply favor the Prezi presentations in an even, omnibus sense&#x02014;they evaluated Prezi as better in particular ways that align with the purported advantages of ZUIs over slideware. This pattern of finding makes most sense if the mechanism were at the level of media, not software.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; evaluations of Prezi were particularly telling in three ways. First, in participants&#x02019; own words (from <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Experiment 1</xref>), they frequently described Prezi as <italic>engaging</italic>, <italic>interactive</italic>, <italic>visually compelling</italic>, <italic>visually pleasing</italic>, or <italic>vivid</italic>, and PowerPoint as <italic>concise</italic>, <italic>clear</italic>, <italic>easy to follow</italic>, <italic>familiar</italic>, <italic>professional</italic>, or <italic>organized</italic>. Second, in participants&#x02019; ratings (from <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">Experiment 2</xref>), the visuals from Prezi presentations were evaluated as significantly more dynamic, visually compelling, and distinctive than those from PowerPoint presentations. And third, in judging the audiovisual attributes of presentations, participants&#x02019; identified animations as both the attribute most lacking in presentations and the attribute that most distinguished Prezi from PowerPoint; furthermore, the more a presentation was judged as lacking animation, the worse it was rated. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Prezi presentations were not just better overall, but were better at engaging visually with their audience through the use of animation. Because ZUIs are defined by their panning and zooming animations&#x02014;and animation is an ancillary (and frequently misused) feature of slideware&#x02014;the most parsimonious explanation for the present results is in terms of ZUIs and slideware in general, not Prezi and PowerPoint in particular. The medium is not the message, but it may be the mechanism.</p><p>The animated nature of ZUIs makes more sense as possible mechanism for the observed effects when one considers relevant literature on animation. Past research has shown that animation can induce physiological and subjective arousal (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]) and facilitate attention, learning, and task performance (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]; but see also [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]). Most pertinently, people appear to prefer animated media over static media. Participants rate animated online advertisements as more enjoyable, persuasive, effective, and exciting than static online advertisements [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], animated websites as more likeable, engaging, and favorable than static websites [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], and animated architectural displays as clearer than static displays [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In an experiment of online academic lectures, participants preferred whiteboard-style animations over a slideware-style version matched for both visual and audio content [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Moreover, ZUI&#x02019;s use of animation aligns with recommended principles for using animation effectively in presentations, which include the creation of a large virtual canvas and the use of zooming to view detail [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Slideware, on the other hand, encourages the use of superfluous animation in slide transitions and object entrances/exits, despite evidence that adding such &#x0201c;seductive details&#x0201d; to multimedia presentations can be counterproductive [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we not only conclude that audiences prefer Prezi over PowerPoint presentations, but also conclude that their preference is rooted in an intrinsic attribute of ZUIs: panning and zooming animations. Compared to slideware&#x02019;s sequential, linear transitions (and oral presentations&#x02019; total lack of visual aids), zooming and panning over a virtual canvas is a more engaging and enjoyable experience for an audience.</p><p>From this perspective, the reason that participants rated Prezi presentations as more persuasive, effective, and organized than other presentations&#x02014;and Prezi presenters as more knowledgeable, professional, effective, and organized than other presenters&#x02014;was because they confuse media with messages and messengers. Dual-process models of persuasion contend that opinion change occurs through not just slow deliberations grounded in logic and reason but also through fast shortcuts rooted in associations and cues [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. If better presenters with better arguments tend to give better presentations, then an audience&#x02019;s experience while viewing a presentation may shade their judgments about its presenter or argument. This is the same basic logic of research that demonstrates PowerPoint&#x02019;s persuasion advantage over oral presentations [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178774.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Just as audiences appear more persuaded by slideware than by oral presentations, they also appear more persuaded by ZUI than by slideware presentations. But unlike past research, we do not argue that audience members use technological sophistication as a cue for argument quality [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] or presenter preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; instead, we suggest that they use their subjective viewing experience as a heuristic for judging both presentations and presenters. Because ZUI presentations are more engaging than slideshows, ZUI presentations and presenters are judged more positively than slideshows.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Media research, including research into presentation software, is plagued methodologically by a lack of experimental control, the unjustifiable assumption that media effects are constant across individuals and content, and a failure to account for the biases of all involved: the presenters, the audiences, and the researchers. In the research reported here we strived to overcome these challenges by randomly assigning presenters and audience members to competing presentation formats, blinding them to the experimental manipulations, and sampling a sufficient array of presentations within each format.</p><p>Our conclusions about the advantages of ZUIs (such as Prezi) over slideware (such as PowerPoint) and oral presentations are, of course, tentative. Further research will need to replicate the findings across different presentation contexts, clarify whether the subjective benefits of ZUIs over slideware result in decision-making or behavioral advantages, and better investigate the precise media attributes responsible for these advantages. Like others [<xref rid="pone.0178774.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], we caution against technological determinism: Presentation medium is but one of many factors that determine presentation success, and presentations that rely on any given medium can succeed or fail. Because slideware can be used to zoom and pan over a virtual canvas just as ZUIs can be used to create slideshows, the benefits of ZUIs over slideware are ultimately based on affordances: How much do certain formats encourage or enable psychologically advantageous media attributes, such as zooming and panning animations?</p><p>In many ways, it is surprising that we found any effects of presentation medium. The presentations differed in many ways aside from their format, ways that surely influenced their effectiveness: Each presentation was made by a different person (sampled from a diverse pool of participants), presenters chose what content to include in their presentation, and presenters decided how to convey that content within their assigned format. Under real-world circumstances in which presentations of different formats are actually contrasted with each other, we expect this background &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; to be greatly reduced and impact of format correspondingly greater.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec038"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178774.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Experiment 1 audience pre-survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178774.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178774.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Experiment 1 audience post-survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178774.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178774.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Experiment 1 presenter pre-survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178774.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178774.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Experiment 1 presenter post-survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178774.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178774.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Experiment 2 audience post-survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178774.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Erin-Driver Linn, Brooke Pulitzer, and Sarah Shaughnessy of the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching for their institutional guidance and support, Nina Cohodes, Gabe Mansur, and the staff of the Harvard Decision Sciences Laboratory for their assistance with participant testing, Michael Friedman for his feedback on pilot versions of the study protocol, and Tom Ryder for his support in adapting the multimedia case for research purposes.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0178774.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">McCluhan M.
