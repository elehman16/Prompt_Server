Pharmacodynamic data show rabeprazole can achieve optimal acid suppression since the first administration and can maintain this advantage in the following days of therapy. Moreover, rabeprazole has the highest pKa (~ 5.0, the pH at which a drug becomes 50% protonated), and hence the molecule can be activated at higher pH levels much faster than other PPIs. Due to its peculiar catabolic pathway, ie, a prevalent metabolism through a non-enzymatic pathway, rabeprazole is less susceptible to the influence of genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19, resulting in minor influences on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In terms of clinical efficacy, rabeprazole 20 mg uid or 10 mg bid produced healing rates at 8 weeks similar to those obtained with omeprazole 20 mg uid in erosive esophagitis patients, and in NERD patients doses of 10 or 20 mg are equivalent and both are better than placebo at 2 and 4 weeks. To prevent symptomatic relapse, on-demand strategy with rabeprazole 10 mg daily appears to be ideal, due to its rapidity of onset; results on NERD patients have documented its superiority over placebo. Continuous treatment, however, up to 5 years, seems to achieve better results than on-demand therapy, particularly in patients with esophagitis. It is debated whether in the latter halved doses (10 mg) are really equivalent to full dose (20 mg). Rabeprazole has been used with success in the treatment of some atypical GERD manifestations, such as dysphagia associated with GERD, GERD-related asthma and chest-pain, and in the therapy of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus. Finally, rabeprazole achieves similar <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication rates compared with omeprazole and lansoprazole when co-administrated with low or high doses of antibiotics (amoxicillin and clarithromycin). In addition, low doses of rabeprazole (10 mg/bid) may be effective in eradicating the pathogen</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rabeprazole</kwd><kwd>acid-related disorders</kwd><kwd>gastro-esophageal reflux disease</kwd><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>therapeutic use</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and as such covalently binds with and inactivates the gastric parietal cell proton pump (H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase). This inhibits in turn gastric acid production and raises gastric pH. Proton pump inhibitors are indicated in the management of acid-related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease, in association with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication therapy when needed.</p><p>Rabeprazole has been previously reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Carswell and Goa 2001</xref>) and aim of the current review is to provide an update on the pharmacology and clinical profile of oral rabeprazole and its use in acid-related disorders, with particular focus on its role in GERD maintenance therapy, its use in Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus, and its cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacology</title><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>The most effective way to increase the pH in the stomach, and hence to reach a therapeutic level for GERD, is the blockage of the proton pump enzymes in the parietal cells. All PPIs, being substituted benzimidazoles, share the same antisecretory mechanism: to be activated, they concentrate in the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell thanks to the acid milieu of the environment. The protonated molecules undergo a conversion to an active sulfenamide compound (the rate-limiting step) and, in this state, form covalent inhibiting disulfide bonds with surface-exposed cysteines of the active parietal cell H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p><p>However, the five available PPIs differ in terms of acid stability as the modified functional substituents on the two-ring structures give rabeprazole the highest pKa (~ 5.0, the pH at which a drug becomes 50% protonated), and hence the molecule can be activated at higher pH levels much faster than other PPIs: at pH 1.2 (the pH level of the canalicular space after meals) rabeprazole took 1.3 minutes to be half-activated in vitro, compared with 2.0, 2.8, and 4.6 min respectively for lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole. At pH 5.1 (the pH during fasting), the activation half-life was again the shortest one for rabeprazole 7.2, 90, 84, and 282 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Kromer et al 1998</xref>).</p><p>In an isolated hog vesicle model, rabeprazole confirmed its potent and fast onset of action: within 5 min of rabeprazole exposure the proton pump was near-maximally inhibited. The same target was reached after 30 min for lansoprazole and omeprazole; but pantoprazole could only inhibit the 50% of the pump by the end of the 50 minute test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Besancon et al 1997</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, rabeprazole sodium produces a dose-related sustained inhibition of both basal and peptone meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Lew et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Ohning et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is widely recognized that the antisecretory activity of PPIs is predictive of their efficacy in acid-related disorders. It has been shown that duodenal ulcer healing correlates with an intragastric pH &#x0003e;3 holding time of 18&#x02013;20 hours, while erosive GERD healing with about a round-the-clock pH &#x0003e;4 holding time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Burget et al 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bell et al 1992</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has confirmed the in vivo past evidence that rabeprazole can achieve optimal acid suppression since the first administration and can maintain this advantage in the following days of therapy, resulting in a higher median 24-hour intragastric pH and longer times with pH &#x0003e;3 and &#x0003e;4 compared with omeprazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b99">Williams et al 1998</xref>).</p><p>In 2003 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Pantoflickova et al (2003)</xref> concluded that the higher pKa of rabeprazole might explain its major antisecretory effect of the former during the first 24 hours post-dose compared with the other PPI formulations tested. In a multiple crossover, comparative trial in 18 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative adults, rabeprazole 20 mg could reach a median 24-hour gastric pH of 3.4, compared with 2.9 for lansoprazole 30 mg, 2.2 for pantoprazole 40 mg, 1.9 for omeprazole 20 mg, 1.8 for omeprazole 20 mg MUPS (multiple unit pellet system), and 1.3 for placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs all other PPIs and placebo). In addition, rabeprazole maintained pH &#x0003e;4 for more time (8 hour) than the other agents (respectively 7.4, 4.9, 2.9, 3.0, and 0.9 hours, p &#x02264; 0.04 for rabeprazole vs the others).</p><p>A full article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b98">Warrington et al in 2002</xref>) presented the results of a study where rabeprazole was compared with esomeprazole on a mg-per-mg basis: in this randomized, two-way crossover study, 24 healthy volunteers received treatment for a total of 5 days separated by a 14-day washout period. On day 1 the mean 24-hour intragastric pH AUC and mean percentage 24-hour pH &#x0003e;3 and &#x0003e;4 holding times were statistically greater for rabeprazole 20 mg than for esomeprazole 20 mg. However, on day 5 the significant superiority was registered for only intragastric pH AUC (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90">Tolman et al (2006)</xref> have recently observed that lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg has a greater acid-suppression activity than, respectively, rabeprazole 10 and 20 mg during hours 0&#x02013;5 on days 1 and 5, whereas rabeprazole is equivalent or more effective during hours 11&#x02013;24 on both days. In an open-label, randomized, crossover trial 72 healthy volunteers received each of the four treatments for 5 days with 2-week washout periods and underwent continuous 24-hour intragastric pH-metry on baseline, 1 and 5 days. Mean percentage time for pH &#x0003e;4 and mean 24-hour pH were overall comparable between the two PPIs on both days 1 and 5, except for rabeprazole 10 mg which was statistically superior to lansoprazole 15 mg.</p><p>A reduced dose of rabeprazole (10 mg od) exhibited better antisecretory activity than either omeprazole 20 mg od or lansoprazole 30 mg od in a study that analyzed the percentage of time pH &#x02265;3 on each of the first three days of therapy in 8 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers. On days 1, 2, and 3 the ratios were 13.6%, 35.3%, and 62.8% for rabeprazole 10 mg; 7.4%, 13.6%, and 26.6% for lansoprazole 30 mg; and 6.1%, 11.4%, and 16.4% for omeprazole 20 mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Saitoh et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>Again rabeprazole 10 mg provided a faster acid inhibition compared with omeprazole 10 mg in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study on 27 volunteers. By the end of the 7-day treatment, median gastric pH was significantly higher with rabeprazole than with omeprazole (3.7 vs 2.2, p = 0.0016) and the time with pH above 4 was more than doubled (10.5 vs 4.6 hours, p = 0.0008) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Bruley Des Varannes et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>A number of researchers during recent years have investigated the occurrence of nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough (NAB), which has been defined as the occurrence of intragastric pH dropping to below 4 for at least 1 hour during the 12 hours of night sleeping period, in GERD patients with nocturnal reflux symptoms and have questioned whether this phenomenon is due to a failing efficacy of PPIs over the 24 hours. In 2003 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Pehlivanov et al (2003)</xref> demonstrated that rabeprazole 20 mg, administered in the morning or in the evening, significantly shortened the mean NAB duration versus the baseline recording (4.1 for rabeprazole a.m. and 3.4 for rabeprazole p.m. vs 7.8 for baseline, p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Rabeprazole has also shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Luo et al 2003</xref>) to be more effective than first-generation PPIs in reducing the duration of NAB and, hence, increasing the nocturnal alkaline amplitude (NAKA), which has been defined as the occurrence of an abrupt increase in intragastric pH to above 4&#x02013;6 after sleeping, mostly in the early morning. Forty patients with active peptic ulcer were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of rabeprazole 10 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, or pantoprazole 40 mg; the intragastric pH was monitored 1 hour before and 24 hours after the dose was given. In the rabeprazole group, the pH of NAB was statistically greater than the one in the others (1.84 vs 1.15 and 1.10 for respectively rabeprazole vs omeprazole and pantoprazole, p &#x0003c; 0.01). Rabeprazole also gave a longer time of NAKA (4.65 hours) than omeprazole (3.22 hours) and pantoprazole (3.15 hours), both p &#x0003c; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Luo et al 2003</xref>). It must be acknowledged that in Luo&#x02019;s study the <italic>H. pylori</italic> status was not controlled, and this factor is known to influence the duration of NAB, as for example shown by the increase of NAB following <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">van Herwaarden et al 2000</xref>). It is possible that the newest PPIs, such as esomeprazole and the not yet marketed tenatoprazole, might be even better for control of NAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Hunt et al 2005</xref>), although direct comparison with rabeprazole does not exist.</p><p>An important aspect that may influence the pharmacodynamics of PPIs is the CYP2C19 genotype status of patients. CYP2C19 is an isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 involved in the catabolism of PPIs. As rabeprazole is less dependent on the polymorphism of this isoenzyme (see Pharmacokinetics section), its antisecretory activity is more predictable than that of the other PPIs, which are mainly catabolized through this isoenzyme. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Adachi et al (2000)</xref> came to this conclusion when they investigated the intragastric pH in 20 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative volunteers during a 7-day dosing regimen with rabeprazole 20 mg od or lansoprazole 30 mg od. In the rabeprazole group, the median day-time and night-time pH was not influenced by CYP2C19 genotype; on the other hand, the median pH in poor metabolizers during lansoprazole administration was higher than in homozygous extensive metabolizers and heterozygous extensive metabolizers. The percentage of time with pH &#x0003c; 4.0 had a similar outcome to that of median pH.</p><p>Another aspect to take into consideration is the gastric pH profile, which has a regional variability in the stomach. It seems that this regional variability of pH profile, in particular the highly acid &#x0201c;pocket&#x0201d; observed close to the cardias, may be involved in the occurrence of postprandial heartburn in GERD patients. In 2001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Fletcher et al (2001)</xref> reported the presence of this acid pocket, after the meal, just below the gastro-esophageal junction. By using a dual pH-metry of the stomach, and a pull-through technique, they were able to show a pocket of acid at the gastroesophageal junction that extended from the cardias across the squamocolumnar junction 1.8 cm into the distal esophagus and escaped the buffering effect of meals, remaining highly acidic (median pH 1.6) compared with the body of the stomach (pH 4.7; p &#x0003c; 0.001). Fletcher et al hypothesized that the acid pocket is likely to contribute to the high prevalence of disease at this site. In a recent article, rabeprazole 20 mg, administered for 8 days in normal subjects, decreased the length, the magnitude, and the number of postprandial acid pockets. On day 1 and 8 the acid pockets were 62 and 50 in the placebo group, but 30 and 27 in the rabeprazole one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">Vo et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Considering the above data, it should be questioned whether for the purpose of acute therapy in GERD patients a reduced or a standard dose of PPI is more suitable to achieve optimal acid suppression (ie, an intragastric pH above 4 lasting for 20&#x02013;22 hours a day), which is considered necessary to promote esophageal mucosal healing within 8 weeks. Shimatani et al investigated the acid-suppressive effects of rabeprazole, omeprazole and lansoprazole at reduced and standard doses. These authors performed a prospective, randomized, open-label, 8-way crossover study in 9 healthy <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative CYP2C19 homozygous extensive metabolizers, each of one took either 10 or 20 mg rabeprazole; 10, 20, or 40 omeprazole; 15 or 30 mg lansoprazole; and placebo, all regimens once daily for 7 consecutive days with a washout period of at least 2 weeks. Compared with baseline data (7%), the median values of the 24-hour percentage of time with pH &#x0003e;4 significantly increased, but none of the 7 regimens used was able to reach the ideal threshold. The percentages of this threshold were: 51% for rabeprazole 10 mg, 59% for rabeprazole 20 mg, 26% for omeprazole 10 mg, 48% for omeprazole 20 mg, 62% for omeprazole 40 mg, 34% for lansoprazole 15 mg, and 56% for lansoprazole 30 mg. NAB was observed under all regimens, even if rabeprazole 10 and 20 mg kept intragastric pH &#x0003e;4 for a longer time than the respective doses of the other two PPIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Shimatani et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, besides its antisecretory effect, rabeprazole 20 mg has been demonstrated to significantly enhance gastric mucin and mucus content, both in basal and pentagastrin-stimulated conditions (mucin content was: 0.82 and 0.96, respectively with rabeprazole vs 0.58 and 0.36 mg/mL, respectively with placebo, p &#x0003c; 0.05) (mucus content was 3.31 and 3.36 with rabeprazole vs 2.28 and 1.5 mg/mL with placebo, p &#x0003c; 0.05) as well as the viscosity of gastric juice (24.4 and 28.47 with rabeprazole vs 19.37 and 19.20 with placebo, p &#x0003c; 0.05). Similar data were observed during concomitant administration of rabeprazole and naproxene, as a result of a direct stimulatory action of rabeprazole on gastric mucous cells. In fact, co-administration of rabeprazole 20 mg prevented the naproxen-induced decline of gastric mucin and mucus secretion in 21 asymptomatic <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative volunteers: during basal and pentagastrin-stimulated conditions, rabeprazole augmented the mucus production by 47% (p = 0.003) and 22%, and the mucin output by 40% (p = 0.05) and 67% (p = 0.003) respectively. This unique pharmacological property may exert a clinical benefit in protecting the upper alimentary tract mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">Skoczylas et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Jaworski et al 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Rabeprazole is marketed as an enterically coated formulation, due to the instability of all PPIs in acid environment. After oral ingestion it is relatively rapidly absorbed as maximal plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) is reached between 2.8 and 5.1 postdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Swan et al, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of the molecule has been shown to be linear in the range 10&#x02013;80 mg with an overall bioavailability of 52%, seen with rabeprazole 20 mg. Although C<sub>max</sub> and area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma concentration are proportional to the dose ingested, time to reach C<sub>max</sub> and half-life are dose-independent. This behavior confirms that rabeprazole does not have a saturable first-pass metabolism and it can be absorbed in high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Swan et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>Neither antacids nor food influence the bioavailability of the molecule, even if food intake delayed the absorption of rabeprazole 20 mg of about 1.7 h and reduced the apparent elimination half-life due to a probable delayed gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Swan et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>Preclinical studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole&#x02019;s volume of distribution is 0.34 L/kg in a variety of tissues, including the gastric mucosa, stomach, kidney, bladder, liver, intestine, and thyroid. In healthy volunteers, it was demonstrated to be bound to plasma proteins 94.8%&#x02013;97.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Swan et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>No significant accumulation occurs during repeated administration, as the elimination half-life is about 1 h after single and 1.5 h after multiple administrations. A 20 mg dose of rabeprazole is excreted approximately 90% in the urine (thioether carboxylic, glucoronide, and mercapturic metabolites) and 10% in the faeces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Swan et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Fuhr and Jetter 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">Thjodleifsson 2004</xref>).</p><p>In terms of its elimination, rabeprazole is unique. Whereas other PPIs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole are metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 in the liver, rabeprazole is metabolized mainly through a non-enzymatic pathway to rabeprazole-thioether and, to a much lesser extent, by the citochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C19 (demethylated rabeprazole) and CYP3A4 (rabeprazole-sulfone). It is known that there are genetically determined differences in the activity of this enzyme. The genotypes of CYP2C19 are classified into the three groups, rapid extensive metabolizer (RM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PPIs depend on CYP2C19 genotype status. Plasma PPI levels and intragastric pHs during PPI treatment in the RM group are lowest, those in the IM group come next, and those in the PM group are highest of the three groups. These CYP2C19 genotype-dependent differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PPIs influence the cure rates for the gastro-esophageal reflux disease and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection by PPI-based therapies. For the better PPI-based treatment, doses and dosing schemes of PPIs should be optimized based on CYP2C19 genotype status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Furuta 2005</xref>). The peculiar catabolic pathway implies that rabeprazole is less susceptible to the influence of genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19, resulting in minor influences on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.</p><p>The impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole, omeprazole, and lansoprazole was assessed in 18 Japanese subjects (6 homozygous metabolizers, 6 heterozygous metabolizers, and 6 poor metabolizers). AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, and elimination half-life were not affected by CYP2C19 genotype for rabeprazole; however, AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were increased in poor metabolizers for lansoprazole and omeprazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Sakai et al 2001</xref>). This predictivity of rabeprazole has the potential to reduce interpatient variability in both pharmacological and clinical effects.</p><p>Patient genetic characteristics increased the intragastric pH after single and repeated doses in heterozygous extensive and poor metabolizers versus homozygous extensive metabolizers who took omeprazole 20 mg for 8 days. In the rabeprazole group the pH profile was almost consistent in the three genetic subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Shirai et al 2001</xref>). A similar outcome was observed in patients with acid-related disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Horn 2004</xref>).</p><p>As a result of CYP2C19 polymorphism, most Caucasians (60%&#x02013;70% homozygous extensive metabolizers, 28%&#x02013;36% heterozygous extensive metabolizers, and 2.7%&#x02013;6.1% homozygous poor metabolizers) can rapidly metabolize PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole and show a diminished acid inhibitory activity of these PPIs among extensive metabolizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Furuta 2005</xref>). This phenomenon might be masked by the observation that both omeprazole and esomeprazole inhibit the activity of CYP2C19 through their sulfone metabolite and, hence, actually autoinhibit their own metabolism, resulting in a non-linear increase in blood levels of these PPIs following repeat dosing. With omeprazole 20 mg, AUC increased by 173% and with esomeprazole by 190%&#x02013;265% for the 20 and 40 mg doses respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">McColl and Kennerley 2002</xref>).</p><p>The prevalent non-enzymatic metabolic pathway of rabeprazole is also the reason for the absence of drug&#x02013;drug interactions between this PPI and other drugs, which are metabolized by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450. Co-administration of rabeprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87">Thjodleifsson and Cockburn 1999</xref>).

There is an ongoing debate as to whether the different manifestations of prolonged reflux of gastric content in the esophagus should be interpreted as a disease continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Pace and Bianchi Porro 2004</xref>) or as different and non-communicating sub-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Fass and Ofman 2002</xref>). This debate is not only of theoretical relevance, because different natural courses of disease mean different expectations from the drugs we test against GERD, which in turn may affect the way we plan clinical studies. The ability to prevent the development of erosions in patients with symptoms, but without esophagitis (non-erosive reflux disease, NERD), would be a strong endpoint for those considering GERD as a spectrum disease, while those who consider GERD an umbrella covering different non-communicating diseases would possibly not even consider the possibility of progression to erosive disease. When possible, we will consider GERD as a spectrum disease, which has milder, non-erosive cases and longer lasting, worse, erosive or complicated cases. Data on atypical and extra-esophageal symptoms will be included as well. An extensive review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Carswell and Goa 2001</xref>) covered these topics in 2001 and we will focus only on papers published after that date.</p><p>GERD is associated with several symptoms, such as heartburn, belching, and regurgitation, which arise from esophageal exposure to gastric acid. Symptoms may occur with or without the presence of endoscopically observed esophageal mucosal damage and inflammation. NERD patients represent the majority of those who present with GERD symptoms. Although acid suppression therapy is a logical approach to relieve GERD symptoms, it has been thought to be less successful in patients with endoscopically negative or symptomatic GERD, than in those with erosive GERD. Some suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Gardner et al 2003</xref>) that this might be due to a decreased response to antisecretory agents in the post-prandial period shown by NERD subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-erosive GERD</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Miner et al (2002)</xref> report the results of a placebo-controlled, double blind study conducted on 203 patients with NERD and moderately severe GERD symptoms.

Both doses of rabeprazole rapidly and effectively relieved heartburn, with significant improvements on day 1 of dosing, and an improvement of other GERD-related symptoms, including regurgitation, belching, bloating, early satiety, and nausea.

In this study rabeprazole 10 mg and esomeprazole 20 mg were comparable after 4 weeks of treatment with regard to the speed of action (time to achieve 24-hour symptom-free interval) for heartburn (8.5 vs 9 days) and regurgitation (6 vs 7.5 days) and patient&#x02019;s global evaluation at 4 weeks (96% on rabeprazole reported symptoms improvement vs 87.9% on esomeprazole, with p = NS).

Therefore the debate as to the optimal maintenance therapy for NERD is open. A logical consequence of the step-down treatment modality seems to be on-demand therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Pace et al 2002</xref>), which requires ideally a drug with a rapid onset of action. Unfortunately, there are very few studies comparing different PPIs used on-demand, with the only exception of a head-to head comparison of omeprazole with lansoprazole (Johnson et al 2002). Rabeprazole might prove to have some characteristics of an ideal PPI in regards to on-demand therapy, since the intragastric pH during the first 5&#x02013;6 hours after a single dose of 20 mg rabeprazole is higher than after a single dose of 20 mg omeprazole, in particular in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative men who are CYP2C19 homozygous or heterozygous extensive metabolizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Inamori et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>In 2004 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Ponce et al (2004)</xref> published a paper concerning on-demand therapy with rabeprazole in erosive and non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Fifty-five patients (17 with NERD and 38 with low-grade esophagitis) were treated with rabeprazole 20 mg/day and those, healed clinically after 4 weeks (n = 51), took the medication in an on-demand way for 6 months. At the end of the study symptom control (heartburn &#x0003c; twice a week) had been achieved in over 85% of the patients. The mean (SD) amount of PPI used was 0.3 (0.19) tablet/day.

In particular, direct comparison of PPIs are generally lacking; as an example, in the recent Cochrane review on the therapy of GERD-induced asthma with antisecretory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Gibson et al 2003</xref>), all PPI studies were placebo-controlled.</p><p>The studies with rabeprazole conducted on atypical GERD manifestations include the treatment of dysphagia, chest pain, laryngitis and GERD-induced respiratory and sleep disorders; most of them are open-label and uncontrolled studies.</p><p>To determine whether dysphagia associated with GERD could be effectively treated with rabeprazole, 68 outpatients with gastroesophageal reflux-associated dysphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Oda et al 2005</xref>) were studied with upper endoscopy (52 out of 68 had esophagitis) and then treated with rabeprazole 20 mg daily for 8 weeks. A further 6 months of treatment at 10 mg/day were warranted for those 16 subjects whose dysphagia improved. At the sixth month dysphagia was completely resolved in 40 subjects, improved partially in 20, and was unchanged in 8 subjects. Comparison between complete therapeutic successes and partial or total failures demonstrated that only improvement in heartburn symptoms seemed to correlate with efficacy of rabeprazole on dysphagia.</p><p>The use of rabeprazole in the empirical diagnosis of GERD-related chest-pain (the so called PPI test) has been assessed in a recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Dickman et al 2005</xref>) double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, that demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 90% for rabeprazole 20 mg bid, administered for 7 days in a therapeutic trial.</p><p>Treatment with rabeprazole 20 mg/day has shown to improve by more than 20% the peak expiratory flow (PEF) in 40% of asthma patients also suffering from GERD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92">Tsugeno et al 2003</xref>). The probability of getting a clinically relevant improvement in PEF with rabeprazole therapy is related to the intensity of GERD symptoms and the lack of steroid-dependency of asthma. The findings of another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Oribe et al 2005</xref>) show that rabeprazole, but not histamine H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, can directly decrease cough reflex hypersensitivity induced with an antigenic aerosol in guinea-pigs and elicited after 24 hours with capsaicin. Noteworthy, rabeprazole does not act reversing the pH drop in the bronchial washing fluid observed in antigen-challenged animals.</p><p>GERD is associated also with lower sleep quality. One week of therapy with 20 mg rabeprazole bid in GERD patients ameliorates subjective measures of sleep quality and overall acid reflux, but not objective sleep measures and night-time acid contact, as shown by polysomnography and 24-hour pH monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Orr et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another well-known extraesophageal manifestation of GERD is chronic laryngitis. An open label study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Klopocka et al 2004</xref>) tried to estimate the efficacy of 2 months of 20 mg rabeprazole bid treatment in patients with long history of chronic idiopathic laryngitis, but without typical GERD symptoms. There was remarkably good therapeutic outcome, with hoarseness and pharyngeal pain resolved, respectively, in 68.7% and 78.5% of patients and laryngeal signs in 50%&#x02013;80%. However, weak tension of vocal cords, which was often seen in these patients before the trial, persisted. A double-blind, randomized trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Steward et al 2004</xref>) comparing 2-month lifestyle modification therapy plus rabeprazole 20 mg bid or placebo in chronic GERD-related laryngo-pharyngitis deserves careful examination. In this study good compliance with lifestyle modification significantly improved laryngo-pharyngitis symptoms, but adding rabeprazole did not significantly improve typical reflux symptoms, health status, or laryngeal appearance. The only two factors predicting good outcome on laryngeal symptoms seemed to be a good compliance to lifestyle modification and a positive effect on typical symptoms. Possible studies with 24-hour esophageal impedance monitoring in ear, nose, and throat of patients might allow stratifying these patients and defining standard length of treatment and more objective outcome measures.</p><p>Another study, again open-label and uncontrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">Swiatkowski et al 2004</xref>), was conducted to estimate the effects of gastric acid output suppression with rabeprazole on course of angina pectoris and the results of the treadmill stress test in patients with coronary artery disease. In stable angina cases rabeprazole 20 mg bid significantly decreases the frequency of angina-like chest pain and improves the results of the treadmill stress test, which implies that at least some of their symptoms are related to GERD.</p><sec><title>

Three months after the therapy, the infection was cured in 84.6% vs 87.5% of patients, respectively (per-protocol analysis, p = 0.68).

This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial, investigating 803 patients with or without peptic ulcer. A urea breath test, performed 6 weeks after the end of the therapy, assessed a cure rate of 77% for the 7-day rabeprazole-based regimen compared with 78% and 73% for the 10-day rabeprazole- or omeprazole-based therapy.</p><p>A recent publication has evidenced the reproducible eradication rates of rabeprazole between subjects with different hepatic metabolism due to CYP2C19 polymorphism.

The eradication rates in the RAC and LAC groups were 75%, and 69% respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis, and 80% and 75% respectively, on a per-protocol basis. When stratified for CYP2C19 polymorphism, the cure rate in RAC extensive metabolizers was less affected by variability than that in LAC ones: 86%, 91%, and 86% respectively for homozygous extensive metabolizers, heterozygous extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers in the RAC group, compared with 74%, 83%, and 100% respectively for the same subgroups of metabolizers in the LAC group (the data were obtained in subjects with strains sensitive to clarithromycin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Kawabata et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>In 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Gisbert and Pajares (2005)</xref> questioned if a 1-week PPI-based triple therapy is enough to heal peptic ulcer.

In addition to this they evaluated trials through a meta-analysis, comparing the efficacy on ulcer healing of this regimen vs the same scheme, but prolonging the PPI for a further 2&#x02013;4 weeks. The authors concluded that a 7-day triple therapy is sufficient to promote ulcer healing; in fact, the healing rate was 86% and 95%, respectively, in all patients (both with <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication success and failure) and in patients successfully eradicated. Two or more weeks of prolonged PPI therapy did not ameliorate these figures (91% with only 1 week of triple therapy vs 92% with prolonged PPI treatment, odds ratio = 1.11, 95% CI, 0.71&#x02013;1.74).</p><p>Rabeprazole was demonstrated to be as effective as omeprazole in healing duodenal ulcer after a 1-week triple therapy.

The improvement of gastric ulcer size and ulcer healing rates were stratified per CYP2C19 subgroups metabolizers after 2 and 8 weeks of treatment.

The per-patient cost of rabeprazole therapy resulted higher than that of ranitidine therapy (US$2020 vs US$1917), but rabeprazole was more effective in preventing symptomatic recurrences (74% vs 41%). Rabeprazole had also a lower average cost-effectiveness ratio than ranitidine (US$2748 vs US$4719 per symptomatic recurrence prevented). Therefore management of esophagitis with rabeprazole is more effective and may be more cost effective, than with generic ranitidine.</p><p>PPI prescriptions might be appropriate or not. In an Irish general hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Mat Saad et al 2005</xref>), where the 30.6% of inpatients were on PPI therapy, up to one-third of cases had an unapproved or unknown indication, and even if the 70.8% of PPI therapies had been initiated in hospital, only one-third of the patients on PPI therapy had undergone endoscopy. Rabeprazole, the least expensive PPI, was the least prescribed. Of note, the substitution of the PPI with the greatest individual cost with any of the alternative agents, particularly the generics omeprazole preparations, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole, in accordance with therapeutic indication, would be expected to produce important cost savings. Decision analysis was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Ofman et al 2002</xref>) to calculate the clinical and economic outcomes of competing (traditional step-up plus endoscopy vs PPI test plus step-down therapy) management strategies. Based on the results of this analysis, PPI test followed by a &#x0201c;step-down&#x0201d; approach may result in improved symptom relief and quality of life over 1 year, and more appropriate utilization of invasive diagnostic testing at a small marginal increase in total costs.</p><p>Savings might be further enhanced by increasing the step-down strategy from healing to maintenance doses of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">McGowan et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>In order to compare the costs and effectiveness of treatment of not investigated GERD with other available PPIs, even in generic formulations, a treatment model was developed incorporating acute treatment, long-term continuous, or on-demand maintenance therapy and number of endoscopies to confirm diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Remak et al 2005</xref>).

An option to revert multi-drug resistance could be to target the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (V-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) that pump protons across the plasma membrane. Rabeprazole directly inhibits V-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and PPI pretreatment sensitizes tumour cell lines to the effect of cisplatin, 5-fluoro-uracil and vinblastine. PPI pretreatment was associated with the inhibition of V-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases activity and an increase of both extracellular pH and the pH of lysosomal organelles, consistent with a cytoplasmic retention of the cytotoxic drugs and targeting to the nucleus in the case of doxorubicin.
