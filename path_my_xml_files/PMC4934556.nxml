Long-acting bronchodilators with rapid onset may relieve patients&#x02019; symptoms. In the Symptoms and Pulmonary function in the moRnING study, we prospectively compared the rapid onset bronchodilator profile of glycopyrronium (GLY) and tiotropium (TIO) during the first few hours after dosing in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either once-daily GLY (50 &#x003bc;g) or TIO (18 &#x003bc;g) and corresponding placebos in a cross-over design for 28 days. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of GLY versus TIO in area under the curve from 0 to 4 hours (AUC<sub>0-4h</sub>) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) after the first dose. The secondary objective was to compare GLY versus TIO using the patient reported outcomes Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire 3 hours post-inhalation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One-hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized (male 70.2%; mean age 65.7 years) and 108 patients completed the study.

Improvements in morning COPD symptoms from baseline at Days 1 and 28 were similar between GLY and TIO. Post hoc analysis of the FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0-4h</sub> by time point on Day 1 showed significant improvements in patients receiving GLY versus TIO at 5 minutes (&#x00394;=0.029 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.015), 15 minutes (&#x00394;=0.033 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.026), and 1 hour (&#x00394;=0.044 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.014).

A statistically significant increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 1 hour after the first dose was observed with GLY versus TIO, thereby supporting the comparative fast onset of action of GLY versus TIO. No statistically significant difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0-4h</sub> was observed between GLY and TIO on Day 28.</p><p>In addition to the spirometric onset of action, the impact of GLY and TIO on symptoms was recorded using a self-administered PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire, as it was hypothesized that a faster onset of bronchodilator action would lead to a different perception of clinically relevant symptoms after dosing. Both GLY and TIO demonstrated comparable improvements in terms of PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire scores in the morning at 3 hours post-dose on Day 1 and after 4 weeks of treatment. In this context it is of note, that the PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire measurement is a newly developed tool, containing symptoms that may (eg, breathlessness) or may not (eg, cough, sputum production) be responsive to treatment in the short term (0&#x02013;4 hours). Most of the patients in this analysis were only mildly symptomatic (mean symptom score of 17 of a total of 60), which may have prevented the demonstration of a clinically significant difference in improvement in the PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire score. One also has to critically state that the study may have been underpowered to demonstrate statistical differences between active treatments for the PRO-morning score, and therefore in conclusion these results have to be seen as exploratory. However, and in order to understand the long-term effect of LAMA treatments on morning symptoms, a post hoc analysis was carried out to determine the statistical significance of the changes in the pre-dose PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire scores from baseline to Day 28. A significant improvement in the pre-dose PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire score versus baseline after 4 weeks of treatment was observed with GLY but not with TIO. The clinical meanings of these observations may be obscured by the fact that the SPRING study population was only mildly symptomatic, and they certainly require further research. In the SPRING study, no new safety signals were observed for GLY. Safety and tolerability of GLY were similar to TIO, with the overall incidence of AEs being low, and none of the AEs were suspected to be related to the study medication. Cardiac disorders were uncommon and no AE with fatal outcome was reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>There were limitations in the study that must be acknowledged. These involved the cross-over study design, short study duration, limited patient population due to the clinical trial settings, as well as selection of patients due to COPD Assessment Test rather than the presence of morning symptoms. An additional limitation was that the PRO-Morning COPD Symptoms Questionnaire has not been previously validated, and findings are additionally obscured by the mildly symptomatic population included in this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the SPRING study demonstrates the superiority of GLY versus TIO in improving lung function in the first 4 hours after administration, extending the existing clinical data that support a faster onset of action of GLY versus TIO. This study further builds on the good safety profile of GLY previously reported during the GLOW study program.<xref rid="b8-copd-11-1425" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-copd-11-1425" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The study further provides evidence on the differences in the onset of action between LAMAs that may be of value in treatment choices in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-copd-11-1425"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0-4h</sub> treatment differences between glycopyrronium and tiotropium post-first treatment dose on Day 28 (ITT).</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold>
