These products may therefore contribute to a lowered risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardio vascular disease. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the mechanism for a reduced postprandial insulin demand with rye products, and to explore possible appetite regulating properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>10 healthy subjects were served breakfast meals (50 g of available starch) with endosperm- or whole grain rye breads, with and without lactic acid, boiled whole grain rye- (RK) or wheat (WK) kernels, or white wheat bread reference (WWB) in random order in a cross-over design. Plasma concentrations of glucose, ghrelin, serum insulin, free fatty acids, adiponectin, breath hydrogen excretion (H<sub>2</sub>), and subjective satiety was evaluated during the postprandial phase. 270 min after the breakfast, an ad lib lunch buffet was served and the voluntary energy intake (EI) was registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All rye products and WK induced lower insulinemic indices (II) than WWB. A lower incremental insulin peak following breakfast correlated with a lower EI at lunch (r = 0.38). A low II was related to improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (fullness AUC 0-60 min, r = -0.36). RK induced a higher GP compared to WWB and WK. A higher GP was related to a lowered <italic>desire to eat </italic>before lunch (AUC 210-270) and to a lower concentration of ghrelin in the late postprandial phase after breakfast (270 min), r = -0.29 and -0.29), which in turn was related to a lower voluntary EI (r = 0.43 and 0.33). The RK breakfast improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (0-60 min) compared to WWB, and induced a lower EI at lunch (-16%). A high content of indigestible carbohydrates in the breakfast products was related to improved satiety (0-60 min, r = 0.68 for fullness), and a higher breath H<sub>2 </sub>in the late postprandial phase (120-270 and 270-390 min, r = 0.46 and 0.70). High H<sub>2 </sub>(AUC 120-270 min) also correlated with lower EI (r = -0.34).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rye products, rich in indigestible carbohydrates, induce colonic fermentation already post the breakfast meal, and lowers acute insulin responses. A high excretion of breath H2 also correlated with a higher GP. Especially, rye kernels induced a high GP which was associated with a 16% lowering of energy intake at a subsequent lunch meal. The bulking effect of rye fiber, colonically derived fermentation metabolites, a high GP and a low insulin response possibly all contributes to the benefits on glucose- and appetite regulation seen in an acute and semi-acute perspective.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing globally and preventive strategies are urgently needed. Whole grain foods have been shown to facilitate weight regulation and to lower the risk of T2D, cardio vascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The protective mechanism may be related to the presence of dietary fiber or other potentially bioactive components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, some whole grain products are characterized by a low glycemia and insulinemia, properties also known to protect against T2D and CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Products made from rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic>) have previously been shown to induce a low insulin response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] which may counteract development of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence of a facilitated glycemic regulation has been found with rye products in healthy subjects, with lower incremental peaks, avoidance of hypoglycemia, and glucose excursions remaining above fasting for a longer time i.e. a higher glycemic profile (GP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The mechanisms behind the beneficial glycemic and insulinemic responses of rye products are, however, not known.</p><p>Avoidance of frequent and elevated blood glucose excursions is protective against oxidative stress and subclinical inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies have shown that carbohydrate foods causing low postprandial insulin responses induce higher satiety and a lower voluntary food intake at a subsequent meal, as compared with foods inducing high acute insulinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In light of the low acute insulin responses commonly induced by rye products, such products could be anticipated to possess appetite regulating properties. In support of this, meal studies with rye products in healthy adults demonstrated that a low insulin response was associated with less accentuated late postprandial hypoglycemia, lowered sense of hunger, and lowered late postprandial increase of plasma ghrelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These findings indicate that further insights regarding the metabolic- and appetite regulating properties of rye products might add to the knowledge regarding mechanisms for health benefits of whole grains.</p><p>Since rye bread products are frequently processed using sour-dough fermentation, the potential effect of organic acids also deserve attention in this context. Lactic acid addition to bread has previously been reported to lower glycemic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the metabolic and appetite regulating properties of rye breads made from endosperm or wholegrain rye flour, were investigated in healthy subjects, using white wheat bread as reference (WWB). The effect of adding lactic acid to the rye breads was also studied. In addition, test products made by boiling of kernels from rye and wheat, respectively, were included. The test products were provided as breakfasts and postprandial plasma were analyzed for measures of glucose metabolism (glucose, serum insulin, FFA, adiponectin), and appetite regulating hormones (ghrelin). Additionally markers of colonic fermentation were measured (breath hydrogen excretion). Finally, subjective satiety was evaluated in the postprandial phase. At 270 min after the breakfast, an <italic>ad libitum </italic>buffet lunch meal was served and the energy intake was registered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Test subjects</title><p>Ten healthy non-smoking volunteers (5 men and 5 women) aged 26.0 &#x000b1; 1.1 y with normal body mass indices (22.6 &#x000b1; 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and without drug therapy participated in the study.

Measurements of resistant starch (RS) was performed on products as is. Total and resistant starch was analyzed according to Bj&#x000f6;rck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and &#x000c5;kerberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The available starch was calculated by subtracting RS from total starch. Insoluble and soluble dietary fiber were determined with a gravimetric, enzymatic method described by Asp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Protein content was determined by Kjeldahl analysis (Kjeltec Auto 1030 Analyser, Tecator, H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s, Sweden). Fat content in the products was calculated using data from endosperm and wholegrain rye and wheat flours from Lantm&#x000e4;nnen. Energy content of the test meals were calculated using fat, carbohydrate and protein contents of the meals (17 kJ per gram of protein and available carbohydrate and 37 kJ per gram fat). The rate of starch hydrolysis (HI) was determined using an in vitro procedure based on chewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], with WWB as a reference.

The subjects were instructed to eat a standardized evening meal (9:00-10:00 P.M) prior to the test, consisting of a few slices of white wheat bread. No eating or drinking except for small amounts of water was then allowed until the start of the test. The subjects were also told to avoid alcohol and excessive physical exercise the day before each test, and otherwise as far possible maintain their regular life style throughout the entire study. The subjects arrived at the laboratory at 07.45 a.m. on the test day. A peripheral venous catheter (BD Venflon, Becton Dickinson, Helsingborg, Sweden) was inserted into an antecubital vein.</p><p>Fasting blood samples were taken prior to the breakfast meal at time 0. Thereafter the test meals, contributing with 50 g of available starch, were served with 250 ml of tap water. The test subjects finished the breads within 14 minutes and the kernels within 25 minutes. At 120 min after the breakfast, the test subjects were served 250 ml of tea, coffee or water without any sweeteners or milk products. The chosen beverage remained consistent for each individual at all 7 visits.</p><p>At 270 min after commencing the breakfast meals, the subjects were provided the lunch buffet and were instructed to eat the amount needed to reach comfortable satiation. At the following visits they should eat until they reached the same degree of satiation as on their first occasion. On their first visit, the subjects could drink as much water as they desired, and the same amount of water was then served at the following 6 visits. The subjects had to finish their lunch within 30 min, before the next blood sampling occasion at 300 min after commencing breakfast. The weight of the different food items ingested was registered individually to allow calculation of the energy intake at the buffet lunch meal. The energy content of the foods in the lunch buffet was obtained from the manufacturer of the products, and that of the cucumber from food tables (Swedish National Food Administration).</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological parameters</title><p>Capillary blood samples were taken for analysis of plasma glucose (p-glucose).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that rye products beneficially affect both early and late appetite regulation, making them an interesting food component in weight management. The RK breakfast, in particular, improved appetite regulation and increased satiety acutely and at a subsequent meal, as judged from a lower energy intake. Consequently, compared with WWB, RK induced improved satiety ratings in the early postprandial phase after breakfast, and substantially lowered the voluntary energy intake (-16%) at a subsequent lunch. As a result of this the cumulative energy intake (breakfast + lunch) was lower on the RK day compared to the WWB test day.</p><p>Part of the early satiating effect of RK may be explained by portion size. Despite being similar to the other test products regarding energy content, the RK breakfast had the largest volume of the test products. The difference in size of the test products can be explained by the fact that RK was the test product containing the highest amount of indigestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber + resistant starch), contributing to a higher water-binding capacity during processing (cooking). Improved early (0-60 min) satiety ratings after the test meals correlated well with a high content of ingestible carbohydrates, a large portion size and a high water content in the products. The satiating effect of bulk-inducing indigestible carbohydrates and water has previously been demonstrated by Rolls et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] who showed that the amount of food eaten, but not the energy content of the foods affect satiety in healthy men. Also, Geliebter demonstrated in 1988 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] that larger distension of the stomach reduced voluntary food intake in both lean and obese subjects.</p><p>A low voluntary energy intake at lunch could be explained by increased colonic fermentation; Breath H<sub>2 </sub>has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of increased carbohydrate fermentation in colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and a high breath H<sub>2 </sub>prior to lunch (120-270 min) was related to a following lowered voluntary energy. Rye products tended to increase breath H<sub>2 </sub>prior to lunch, significantly so following the RK and WGRB breakfasts. After lunch, all rye products except the ERB-lac induced higher H<sub>2 </sub>excretions than WWB. All rye products had a high content of soluble fibers, probably explaining the early fermentation. Colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates yields SCFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which may promote feeling of satiety through a relaxation of the gastric tone and a slower gastric motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In support of the fermentation hypothesis; Cani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] has demonstrated lowered energy intake, increased GLP-1 secretion and lowered ghrelin secretion in rats fed a high fructan diet. Furthermore, Nilsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] demonstrated that an evening meal consisting of bread made from barley kernels, rich in dietary fiber and resistant starch, increased subjective satiety and reduced gastric emptying rate at a subsequent standardized breakfast in healthy subjects. The benefits on satiety were assigned to colonic fermentation and stimulation of GLP-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of colonic fermentation as a modulator of satiety.</p><p>Improved satiety ratings in the early postprandial phase after breakfast and a lowered voluntary energy intake at lunch were also associated with a low insulin response (II and incremental insulin peak) following the breakfast test meals. All rye products and the WK were characterized by a lower II than WWB. In a review by de Graaf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], insulin was suggested to be a poor biomarker of satiety, since it is confounded or moderated by several metabolic processes such as blood glucose and incretins. However, the current finding that a low postprandial insulin response correlates with improved satiety ratings and a lowered energy intake at a following meal is supported by several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], with equi-carbohydrate portions and similar macronutrient compositions in the test foods; that is, at conditions comparable to those in the present study. Possibly, it is the absorption characteristics of the carbohydrates rather than insulin concentrations <italic>per se </italic>that affect satiety. A slow uptake of carbohydrates would lead to a prolonged exposure of the small intestine to nutrients, thus extending the release of satiety peptides, e.g. GLP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Intake of food products containing slowly absorbable carbohydrates will require smaller amounts of insulin for the glucose uptake, thus limiting the risk of reactive hypoglycemia in the later postprandial phase. We have recently demonstrated that a product characterized by a low but prolonged blood glucose curve, described by a high Glycemic Profile (GP) was associated with lower insulin response, less postprandial hypoglycemia, and a smaller increase in late postprandial ghrelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present work, a high GP after a meal appears to positively affect appetite regulation, partly by reduced secretion of ghrelin. A high GP was associated with both a low postprandial concentration of ghrelin at 270 min, and a lower <italic>desire to eat </italic>both in the early and late postprandial phase (AUC 0-60 and 210-270 min). Furthermore, a lower concentration of ghrelin and a lower <italic>Desire to eat </italic>was related to a lower voluntary energy intake.</p><p>Rye products were characterized by higher GP than wheat products. Looking at specific rye products, RK induced significantly higher GP than WWB and WK. This is in line with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present work, the GP of the products were inversely related to the insulin response (II and incremental peak) but not to the GI. A prolonged blood glucose curve seen with high GP rye products could, besides a lowered insulin response, be a result of improved glucose tolerance induced by colonic fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Colonic fermentation has recently been demonstrated to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity, 10 h after the test meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In the present study, a high breath hydrogen excretion was detected already in the 90-270 min phase after the test breakfast, and was found to correlate to a high GP. Additionally, the lowered blood glucose incremental peak seen with the high GP rye products could be explained by bioactive components, and by a lowered starch hydrolysis. Although no direct correlations between the GP, GI or II of the rye breads and the rate of in vitro starch hydrolysis (HI) could be found, the HI was lowered for the rye products compared to WWB. Obstructed amylolysis could therefore partly contribute to the low glucose incremental peaks and insulin responses of most rye products in the study. That the GP of RK was higher than that of WK suggests a facilitated glucose regulation following the RK breakfast. Interestingly, RK and WK induced similar GI values which indicate the importance of GP as a complement to GI, where the latter does not provide information about the course of glycemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rye products, especially in the form of whole kernels, decrease both early and late appetite ratings after a breakfast meal, and lowers energy intake at a subsequent voluntary lunch. Our results suggest that a high content of indigestible carbohydrates and soluble fibers in the rye products may beneficially affect acute satiety through a bulking effect, and second meal satiety through a mechanism related to colonic fermentation by production of fermentation metabolites. Colonic fermentation might also contribute to an improved late glucose regulation. Indications of such a hypothesis stems from the correlation between a high breath hydrogen excretion and a high GP. A high GP was also related to lowered insulin response, late postprandial ghrelin secretion and desire to eat, thereby affecting a subsequent <italic>ad libitum </italic>meal. These findings indicate that the GP represent a nutritionally interesting entity in that it predicts metabolic responses as well as the satiating properties better than does the GI. This work provides information of a potential role in weight management for rye products. A high intake of rye products could contribute to a lowered energy intake, and thus protect against obesity. To evaluate this hypothesis, longer-term studies of rye products on metabolism and appetite regulation are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AUC: total area under the curve; BMI, body mass index; CVD: cardiovascular diseases; EI: voluntary energy intake at lunch; ERB-lac: endosperm rye bread made with lactic acid; ERB: endosperm rye bread; FFA: free fatty acids; GI: glycemic index; GP: Glycemic profile; H<sub>2, </sub>breath hydrogen; HI: hydrolysis index; II: insulinemic index; RK: Rye kernels; T2D: type 2 diabetes; WGRB: whole grain rye bread; WGRB-lac: whole grain rye bread made with lactic acid; WK: wheat kernels; WWB: white (endosperm) wheat bread.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LAHR coordinated the study and was responsible for the study design, the collection and analysis of the data, statistical analysis and for writing the paper.
