We hypothesized that an intervention aimed at both the worker and the workplace could be effective. Hence, we tested the effects of a new early intervention, based on the misdirected problem solving model, aimed at both workers at risk of long-term impairments and their workplace. <italic>Methods</italic> Supervisors of volunteers with back pain, no red flags, and a high score on a screen (&#x000d6;rebro Musculoskeletal Screening Questionnaire) were randomized to either an evidence based treatment as usual (TAU) or to a worker and workplace package (WWP). The WWP intervention included communication and problem solving skills for the patient and their immediate supervisor. The key outcome variables of work absence due to pain, health-care utilization, perceived health, and pain intensity were collected before, after and at a 6&#x000a0;month follow up. <italic>Results</italic> The WWP showed significantly larger improvements relative to the TAU for work absence due to pain, perceived health, and health-care utilization. Both groups improved on pain ratings but there was no significant difference between the groups. The WWP not only had significantly fewer participants utilizing health care and work absence due to pain, but the number of health care visits and days absent were also significantly lower than the TAU. <italic>Conclusions</italic> The WWP with problem solving and communication skills resulted in fewer days off work, fewer health care visits and better perceived health. This supports the misdirected problem solving model and indicates that screening combined with an active intervention to enhance skills is quite successful and likely cost-effective. Future research should replicate and extend these findings with health-economic analyses.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Screening</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Back pain</kwd><kwd>Problem solving</kwd><kwd>Communication skills</kwd><kwd>Early intervention</kwd><kwd>Work absence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>V&#x000e5;rdalstiftelsen; Rehsam</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Musculoskeletal disorders such as back or neck pain continue to be frequent and costly problems and a leading cause of functional difficulties including work impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While the literature base establishing risk factors for long-term problems has grown, this knowledge is under-utilized in practice, and there remains a need for effective early intervention strategies tailored to address these risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One implementation challenge has been the need to capture the synergy of both individual-level and organizational strategies to prevent long-term back disability, and there have been few efforts to integrate interventions with workers and employers in a single trial. Instead, most programs for early intervention are offered in a primary care facility and focus exclusively on the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Currently, risk screening and early intervention is left to a single health-care provider with limited time and training to deal with workplace and psychosocial concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study is a randomized investigation of a new approach to back disability prevention that applies psychological theories of pain management and focuses these efforts on both the worker and the workplace.</p><p>A number of self-report scales have been shown to predict those at greatest risk of developing long-term musculoskeletal pain-related impairments in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, the &#x000d6;rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (&#x000d6;MPSQ) predicts lengthy claims and high costs, even when used at the first visit or as a survey of workers reporting pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, there is evidence that various cognitive-behavioral preventive interventions reduce the risk of long-term work impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Third, brief workplace interventions focusing on supervisors have also shown benefits for reducing disability outcomes. Even though supervisors play a key role, they commonly report a lack of training in dealing with employees with pain problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Accordingly, programs that teach supervisors basic skills (e.g., communication and negotiating accommodations) may have significant benefits for workers with pain problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Based on the existing evidence supporting patient screening, early intervention, and supervisor involvement, we developed an experimental intervention that was based on two current theoretical perspectives. First, we focused on problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a fundamental component of evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment strategies in psychology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Since there are a large variety of risk factors and potential problems for individuals with back pain, solving relevant lifestyle problems is vital, and this method allows for adaptation to the needs of the individual patient. Second, we employed elements of the misdirected problem solving model. The fundamental idea of this model is that patients expend all of their problem solving efforts searching for a cure for pain, and repeated failures can inadvertently increase worry and distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Efforts to redirect problem solving efforts toward lifestyle challenges may improve coping.</p><p>While most psychosocial intervention strategies have been focused on pain sufferers, it&#x02019;s possible that interventions directed to other supporting individuals (e.g., spouses, family members, co-workers, supervisors) may also help to overcome problems associated with pain. Therefore, we developed a program that includes an intervention at the workplace by providing a brief training program for supervisors. In this study, we evaluate whether it is effective to focus on communication and problem-solving with workers with back pain and their supervisors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p>The purpose of this study was to test the effects of an early worker and workplace intervention program for employees at risk of developing long-term work impairments due to back pain. To this end, we compared this program with treatment as usual (based on best practice recommendations) in order to study its effects on outcomes e.g. work absence due to pain, perceived health, health care utilization, and pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview of the Design</title><p>We conducted a 2-arm randomized parallel controlled trial comparing: (1) a worker and workplace treatment package (WWP) or, (2) treatment as usual (TAU) based on current guidelines. Our main outcome variables were absence due to pain, health care utilization, perceived health, and pain intensity ratings. The initial screening and pre-treatment (baseline) assessment was followed by a treatment phase (4&#x000a0;weeks), and then a post-treatment and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up assessment.

To be included in the study, participants needed to fulfill the following criteria: (1) suffering from musculoskeletal low back pain, (2) elevated risk (&#x0003e;40) for developing chronic pain problems according to the the &#x000d6;rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire, short form (&#x000d6;MPSQ-SF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], (3) no red flags (signs of a possibly serious underlying condition), and (4) consenting to have their supervisor contacted for participation in the study.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a flow chart of the recruitment procedure. A total of 520 employees reported their interest in participation in the trial and were assessed for eligibility. The assessment procedure was two-step. First, employees filled out a screening questionnaire to assess the risk of developing chronic pain. If the employee reported back pain and had a screening score above 40 (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;163), they were invited to continue the assessment with a clinical interview. The clinical interview included an evaluation of possible &#x0201c;red flags&#x0201d; and this resulted in two individuals being excluded from the study and referred for further medical examination. The remaining employees were invited to participate in the study and asked for explicit consent to contact their workplace supervisors. When contacted to schedule participation, an addition 36 individuals were no longer suffering pain and declined the offer. This left 140 participants for the present trial. However, when supervisors were contacted, 7 declined the invitation mostly due to time limitations (the employee was provided with the treatment, but excluded from the study). Of the 30 supervisors participating in the WWP intervention, 20 completed the entire training, while 10 completed some training (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>A flow chart of recruitment and participants over the course of the study.

An overview of the characteristics of the employees is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The length of employment at the current workplace varied between 1 and 32&#x000a0;years.

Multiple pain sites (two or more) were much more common (80.7&#x000a0;%) than pain localized to a single body part (19.3&#x000a0;%). Participants scored their current pain intensity (last week, range 0&#x02013;10) at a mean of 5.9 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.9) and their average pain intensity (last 3&#x000a0;months, range 0&#x02013;10) at 6.27 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.6).

The overarching goal of the worker intervention was to increase their ability to self-manage daily work-related obstacles related to their pain experience. The main goal of the supervisor intervention was to minimize the impact of workplace-related psychosocial risk factors for developing chronic pain problems and to create a supportive work environment. Considering the brief character of the intervention, the supervisors were also offered the opportunity to telephone or e-mail consultation, if needed, within 2&#x000a0;months after the last session.

For binary outcome variables (work absence due to pain and health care utilization) logistic regression analysis was used. To analyze the continuous outcome variable (perceived health) linear mixed model methods with maximal likelihood estimation was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] (Raudenbush &#x00026; Bryk, 2002; Tabachnick &#x00026; Fidell, 2012). Analyses were carried out using an intention-to-treat approach employing the last observation carried forward imputation to account for missing data. An analysis of non-responders showed no significant differences between participants who dropped out from the study and those who were retained. Since the analyses of pretest scores showed no significant differences between the groups (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the results focus on differences in outcome between the groups. For the variables of absence due to pain and health care utilization we have examined both the percentage of participants in each group involved as well as the number of day off work and the number of health care visits since the data is skewed. Thus, we capture how many workers were off work or used health care as well as the number of times they utilized these benefits.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Means and standard deviations or percentages for outcome variables per treatment group over the course of the study and tests of significance</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2">Variable</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Worker and workplace package</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Treatment as usual</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Statistical comparisons</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Pre-test</th><th align="left">Post-test</th><th align="left">Follow-up</th><th align="left">Pre-test</th><th align="left">Post-test</th><th align="left">Follow-up</th><th align="left">Pre-test</th><th align="left">Post-test</th><th align="left">Follow-up</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="10">Pain intensity (<italic>M</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Past week</td><td align="left">5.80<break/>(1.98)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">4.69<break/>(2.49)</td><td align="left">6.14<break/>(1.90)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">5.24<break/>(2.30)</td><td align="left">

The figure shows that there were fewer incidents of work absence due to pain at follow up as compared to the pretest period in both treatment arms. However, the WWP treatment arm showed greater improvement and more than halved incidence. A logistic regression was calculated where treatment group was used as the predictor variable and work absence due to pain at baseline as a control variable. The result showed a significant difference between the treatment groups.

A logistic regression on health care utilization at follow up with treatment as a predictor, controlling for health care utilization at baseline showed that there were significant differences in outcome between the treatment arms. Comparison of the full model against the constant only model was significant, [&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (2)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24.194, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001] indicating that predictors included in the model explained health care utilization at follow-up.

In contrast, perceived health scores in the TAU arm decreased slightly over time. In order to investigate differences in outcome on perceived health, a mixed models analysis was used with treatment, time (in months) and treatment-time interaction as predictors of perceived health at follow-up.

However, the difference between the groups was not significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study found that a brief intervention focusing on problem-solving and communication skills for both the worker and the workplace resulted in significantly better improvements in perceived health, health-care utilization, and even work absenteeism due to pain as compared to a TAU based on current guidelines. Indeed, half as many of those receiving the WWP reported work absence due to pain, and these people reported less than a third as many days as compared to the TAU. Similarly, half as many in the WWP reported continued heath care visits and these participants reported half as many visits as did the TAU. This outcome provides some support that participants were able to (re)frame the problem as one of lifestyle limitations and coping challenges rather than as simply the need to find a cure. Consequently, this study provides a potentially new and feasible strategy for engaging both workers and their workplace in early pain management interventions.</p><p>Our study has several implications for theory as well as the clinic. While our findings are in line with earlier literature showing that psychologically informed early interventions are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a first novelty is that this study succeeded in combining interventions aimed at the worker and the workplace. Thus it provides impetus for actively providing this type of program for workers and their supervisors. The worker and the supervisor both participated in the same type of intervention which we hypothesized would result in improved communication and problem solving capabilities. Both the workers and the supervisors reported that they valued the program and recommended it to be continued. Participation from supervisors and workers was high. Moreover, the intervention was also acceptable to the various health care professionals at the occupational health care facility thus uniting these resources and enhancing implementation. Indeed, the problem solving involved a variety of solutions ranging over the entire biopsychosocial range. Future research will need to study what specific effects the program had on problem solving for both patients and their supervisors. Additional research is needed to specifically isolate how patients and supervisors interact before and after the intervention to determine whether the results have been directly influenced by them problem solving together.</p><p>A second novelty is the method of identifying participants. Rather than relying on clinical judgment or the passing of time, we judiciously utilized scores on the &#x000d6;MPSQ-SF. We provided the screen via a survey at work or at the first visit to the center. Thus, it was employed systematically and further intervention was guided by the score. This time frame was chosen to avoid over-medicalization of the pain problem. However, the current study shows that participants nevertheless had experienced a problem (off-and-on) for some time with more than 85&#x000a0;% reporting some problem for more than 6&#x000a0;months and about a third reporting a history of medical care and/or work absence due to pain. This may reflect a fallacy in the literature and clinic that patients seeking care for a new episode constitutes &#x0201c;acute&#x0201d; pain. More likely, it constitutes recurrent or persistent pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similarly, a large trial that recruited patients in primary care had just 17&#x000a0;% with a pain duration of less than 1&#x000a0;month and nearly a majority (46&#x000a0;%) having had pain 6&#x000a0;months to over 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. So, while there has been a fear that intervening too early might over-pathologize the problem and make it worse, our data suggest that this intervention is effective for those reporting a high score on the screening tool.</p><p>A third novelty with the present study is that it is the first trial to our knowledge of an intervention that is based on the misdirected problem solving model. Our results support the utility of the model, and suggest that how patients and supervisors formulate the problem may have significant impact on outcome. Our experiences during the trial suggest that the model is acceptable to health care personnel as well as to clients and supervisors. Although clients often anticipated medical interventions, they reported understanding the ideas involved and participation rates were very high. Patients often reported discovering that the pain was not the only or even the main problem and they enjoyed working toward clear-cut goals.</p><p>An interesting finding is that while the groups differed on several important outcomes (e.g., work absence due to pain), they did not differ on pain intensity ratings. Both groups improved on pain intensity ratings, but there was no significant difference between the groups. This indicates that significant reductions in work absence due to pain, improvements in overall health, and the need for less health care are not strictly dependent on pain intensity. This reinforces the idea that early interventions may well focus on reducing the <italic>impact</italic> of the pain rather than simply the <italic>intensity</italic> of the pain. Further, it also implies that the WWP intervention was successful in framing the problem in a broad (and solvable) fashion. Indeed, patients often worked on solving problems related to their function (being able to work or participate in desired activities).</p><p>The feasibility of providing early intervention is dependent on its cost-benefit. We provided a screening procedure and those at risk received 3 sessions of intervention and their supervisor 2 sessions (plus email and telephone support). Based on the time required to administer the program (coordinating, screening, psychologist time) as well as overhead charges, we estimate the cost at 10&#x000a0;000SEK (currently $1150) per participant in the WWP. A major benefit is the reduction of work absence due to pain where the WWP group had 11.3 fewer days than the TAU over a 6-month period. Using an average compensation level (1000:sek/day) and an estimated cost for the workplace (500:/day) in lost productivity and administration, the benefit is 16,950:SEK (currently $1949). This is an immediate savings of 6950 SEK ($800) per participant over half a year&#x02019;s time and previous research has shown that such difference tend to last for at least 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Since this is not a proper health-economic evaluation, future research should include such evaluations.</p><p>While this study has featured several initiatives it also has limitations that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. The worker and workplace intervention was tested as a package and thus we do not know which components were most effective or necessary. Our design permitted comparisons with recommended treatment, but additional investigations are needed to establish the contribution of the elements of the package. We did not study possible mediators of the effects and future studies using repeated measures during treatment will be needed to test the role of validation and problem solving on outcome. Although the intervention was designed to enhance communication and problem solving between the supervisor and the worker, we were unable to assess this. Our data collection focused on the individual workers suffering pain and a limitation is the lack of data about the supervisors and how they perceived and utilized the intervention. Future work would benefit from tracking supervisors and workers specifically assessing application. However, this study does demonstrate an effect of the interventions and therefore further research is warranted with additional measures and designs.</p><p>Our results suggest that how patients and supervisors frame, communicate about, and solve problems is important for outcome. Providing a short training in communication and problem solving skills was successful in engaging both the worker and the supervisor and resulted in significant improvements in self-reported health as well as work absenteeism due to pain. Developing this intervention and implementing it in primary care may provide a much needed step forward in preventing persistent work impairment due to back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We
