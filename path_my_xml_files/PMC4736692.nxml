An increased interest in the clinical effects of acupuncture has also been expressed in the West in recent years. In a 1997 report on the effects of acupuncture, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stressed the need for evidence of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Subsequently, the number of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using acupuncture to treat various conditions has rapidly increased; however, many acupuncture clinical trials have methodological limitations. Establishing appropriate placebo control groups is one of several issues. Ideally, placebo acupuncture should satisfy two conditions: (1) it should be indistinguishable from real acupuncture to blinded participants, and (2) it should be physiologically inert. Various placebo acupuncture devices that satisfy these conditions have been developed and used in acupuncture clinical trials.</p><p>Currently, there are two types of acupuncture controls: (1) sham acupuncture, in which real acupuncture needles are inserted into the skin either fully at non-acupuncture points or superficially at acupuncture points, non-acupuncture points, or non-relevant acupuncture points with certain conditions, and (2) placebo acupuncture, which uses non-penetrating acupuncture devices (i.e., blunt tip needles or non-needle devices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Various non-penetrating placebo acupuncture devices such as Streitberger&#x02019;s needle, the Park sham device (PSD), and the Takakura needle have been developed. The first device, Streitberger&#x02019;s needle, was developed in 1998 and used a plastic ring covered with a plastic sheet to place the needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. When the practitioner taps the needle, it moves inside the handle and appears as if the acupuncture needle punctures the skin. However, it does not puncture the skin, but only a pricking sensation is felt by the patient because the tip is blunt.</p><p>In 1999, Park et al. developed the PSD which was similar to Streitberger&#x02019;s needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The PSD included a flange with adhesive tape and a guide tube to place the placebo needle on the acupuncture point, while Streitberger&#x02019;s needle used a plastic ring and sheet. Although these two placebo acupuncture devices were successfully applied to blinded participants and their use validated, there still remains the limitation that they induce physiological activity by touching the skin.</p><p>In 2014, Lee et al. developed a novel form of placebo acupuncture, phantom acupuncture, which induces participant expectation without any tactile stimulation such as palpation, needle insertion, or manipulation and which was also validated using blinded participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, complex equipment is needed to perform phantom acupuncture. Therefore, it may be difficult to apply phantom acupuncture in clinical acupuncture trials.</p><p>Although various placebo acupuncture devices have been developed and used in acupuncture research, there is controversy concerning whether these devices are really appropriate for placebo control groups.</p><p>This trial will evaluate various placebo acupuncture devices that have been used in acupuncture clinical trials using a validation test to determine if they are suitable to be used in control groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the validity of different types of placebo acupuncture devices and determine their suitability for use as placebos in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design and study setting</title><p>This study will be a single center, prospective, randomized, random sequence, participant and assessor blinded trial with two parallel arms.</p><p>We will conduct the study in the Kyung Hee University Medical Center.</p><p>There are arm1 (Group1) and arm2 (Group2) in our trial that is separated. Each group has three different intervention sessions in random sequence. The order of intervention will be randomized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants who meet the following criteria will be included irrespective of previous acupuncture experience: (1) healthy participants 20&#x02013;50 years old, and (2) participants who can communicate and complete the questionnaire.</p><p>Participants will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) individuals who have taken medications during the prior month that could influence trial results (e.g. medications for epilepsy, depression, panic disorders, schizophrenia, etc.), (2) pregnant or breast-feeding women, (3) Korean Medicine Doctors (KMD) or Korean Medicine University students (because we think that they can distinguish between placebo and real acupuncture better than the general population), (4) individuals who drank alcohol or coffee, or overworked the day before or the day of the experiment, and (5) individuals who are determined to be unsuitable for following the study protocol by the researcher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p>We will upload an advertisement to the hospital and university homepages, and place a poster advertisement on the bulletin boards of the hospital and university. Potential participants will call the clinical research coordinator (CRC) and will be pre-screened for eligibility. Eligible participants will make an appointment. When potential participants visit the hospital, the investigator will provide information about volunteering and explain the risks and benefits of the research. When the individuals agree to enroll in the research, they will sign an informed consent form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>After signing the informed consent form, the participants will be randomized to Group 1 or Group 2. Group 1 will receive the Real Streitberger&#x02019;s needle (Real ST), Sham Streitberger&#x02019;s needle (Sham ST), and Phantom acupuncture (PHNT); Group 2 will receive the PSD with a real needle (Real Park), the PSD with a sham needle (Sham Park), and no treatment (No treat). The treatment orders in both groups will be randomized. A computerized balanced block randomization will be performed by an independent clinical research coordinator (CRC) using R version 3.1.2 with &#x02018;block random&#x02019; function. The CRC will send an e-mail regarding the name, random number, and treatment order of enrolled participants to the practitioners and operators. This e-mail will be documented in the trial master file (TMF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants will be blinded in this trial. However, it is almost impossible to blind practitioners and operators because they need to know which acupuncture devices to use. They will not be allowed to communicate with the participants concerning the type of acupuncture devices and the purpose of the study. Outcome assessors and statisticians will also be blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study flow</title><p>The study flow will be as follows. Group 1 will consist of Sham ST, Real ST, and PHNT. Group 2 will consist of Real Park, Sham Park, and No treatment. Groups 1 and 2 are separate groups; participants allocated to Group 1 will not receive Real Park, Sham Park, and No treatment and vice versa. Participants will have a total of three sessions (acupuncture or no treatment) in a day (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Before acupuncture treatment, the investigator will explain to participants that they will receive three different types of acupuncture except for the no treatment session. Participants will not know that placebo acupuncture occurred until all sessions are completed. To avoid order effect, the order of the three treatment sessions in each group will be randomly assigned by the CRC. Before the first session, the CRC will collect demographic information (e.g., age, sex) and baseline data (e.g., vital signs, acupuncture expectation questionnaire (AEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and bodily sensation questionnaire (BSQ)). After each treatment session, participants will complete the blinding test questionnaire 1 (BTQ 1) and acupuncture sensation questionnaire (ASQ) and will be asked about adverse events (AEs). After completion of the third BTQ 1 and ASQ, an independent assessor will inform the participants of the use of placebo acupuncture and instruct them to complete the blinding test questionnaire 2 (BTQ 2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow. <italic>AEQ</italic> indicates acupuncture expectation questionnaire, <italic>BSQ</italic> bodily sensation questionnaire, <italic>BTQ2</italic> blinding test questionnaire 2, <italic>R</italic> randomization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12906_2016_1026_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

We decided that we need to enroll at least 30 participants in our pilot study for each session assuming a drop-out rate of approximately 20&#x000a0;%. We calculated a sample size of 37.5 and rounded to this to 38 resulting in a total sample size of 76 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As our design has two independent groups that acquire comparability by randomization, we can compare variables not only within each group, but also between groups.</p><p>The primary outcome of our research will be to compare the blinding rates of the placebo acupuncture devices studied within and between groups. We will also conduct several exploratory secondary outcome analyses. Expectation for acupuncture (measured by AEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], previous acupuncture experiences, and age will be considered as covariates. We will analyze physiological data in three tonic responses (before, during, and after acupuncture) and during phasic responses. We will not statistically compare the Bang&#x02019;s BI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Instead, we will calculate the point estimate and 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval of Bang&#x02019;s BI.</p><p>For dichotomous variables (i.e., blinding rate), within group comparison will be performed using Cochran&#x02019;s Q test for Group 1 (Sham ST, Real ST, and PHNT) and McNemar&#x02019;s test for Group 2 (Sham, Real Park). We will not check the blinding of the No treatment session. Comparisons of blinding rates between group devices (Sham ST vs Sham Park or PHNT vs Sham Park) will be performed using the chi-square test, and comparisons within group devices (PHNT vs Sham ST) will be performed using McNemar&#x02019;s test. For continuous variables (i.e., the MASS index, De-qi sensation, physiological data such as HR, HRV, and SCR), within group comparisons will be performed using repeated measured ANOVA for Group 1 and paired <italic>t</italic>-test for Group 2. We will use the independent <italic>t</italic> test for comparisons between group.</p><p>When we analyze physiological data, we will use the both change ratio contrast to baseline and absolute value. Change ratio and absolute value of HR and SCR will be compared for three separate windows during the tonic responses (before vs during vs after acupuncture session). As absolute change value is very dependent on baseline value, it will be used as covariates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Quality control</title><p>Before the study begins, we will conduct several simulations using our colleagues and volunteers to identify any problems with our study protocol. Practitioners will conduct acupuncture sessions according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) of our study. We will have researcher meetings regularly to discuss issues that may be raised by investigators and participants such as protocol revisions, serious adverse events, and participant recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Safety and adverse event outcomes</title><p>When each session is completed, the assessor will ask if any AE occurred and it will be documented in the CRF. If any AEs occur, the type of AE, start/end date, severity, manner of report, course, outcome, causality with acupuncture treatment, and actions taken will be documented and appropriate treatment will be provided to the participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Ethics approval and registration</title><p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital (KOMCIRB-140923-HR-008). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. This study has been registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS), Republic of Korea, KCT0001347 (registered: January 15th, 2015).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial was designed to investigate if various placebo acupuncture devices are appropriate for control groups in acupuncture research. We will evaluate the blinding of participants and also measure physiological parameters such as HR, HRV, and SCR. In addition, we will investigate the effects of various factors on blinding and physiological parameters. We will examine the effects of the bodily sensation, de-qi sensation (i.e., acupuncture-evoked sensations including numbness, heaviness, soreness, or distention), or patient expectation for acupuncture on blinding and physiological parameters.</p><p>Acupuncture treatment is composed of a variety of components such as acupuncture point selection, skin penetration, stimulation dose (diameter, length, and number of needles, needling depth, and stimulation method), patient expectation, and practitioner-patient relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, studies on how each factor affects the total therapeutic effect are lacking. In this study, we are going to dis-associate a range of acupuncture treatment factors using a validation test of three types of placebo acupuncture techniques that have different components.</p><p>Other researchers have developed placebo acupuncture devices and evaluated their relevance using validation tests.</p><p>Streitberger et al. performed a validation study that investigated if acupuncture- na&#x000ef;ve healthy participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) could feel the difference between a real acupuncture needle and a placebo acupuncture device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They showed that the participants could not distinguish between the two needles and suggested Streitberger&#x02019;s needle as a credible placebo treatment. Also White et al. conducted a validation test of Streitberger&#x02019;s needle in participants waiting for orthopedic hip and knee joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most participants could not distinguish penetration with a real acupuncture needle from that with a placebo needle. However, in two similar treatments, almost 40&#x000a0;% were able to discern a difference between real and placebo acupuncture treatment administered by the male practitioner only. This shows that it is important how two interventions are delivered and that standardization of treatment technique is strictly required.</p><p>The PSD developed by Park et al. was validated in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in acute stroke patients and acupuncture-na&#x000ef;ve, healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study was designed to evaluate if PSD was indistinguishable from a real acupuncture needle and if PSD induced de-qi. They found that PSD was indistinguishable and inactive (in terms of de-qi), thus it is a valid placebo control for acupuncture research.</p><p>However, these previous two devices touch the skin and thus induce a physiological effect. To overcome this limitation, Lee et al. developed a phantom acupuncture technique that imitates the acupuncture treatment ritual without any tactile stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They showed the credibility of phantom acupuncture without somatosensory components of real acupuncture in healthy participants.</p><p>In summary, three types of placebo acupunctures were all evaluated to blinded participants using validation tests. In this study, by measuring blinding, de-qi sensation, and various physiological parameters such as HR, HRV, and SCR, we will investigate if placebo acupuncture techniques are indistinguishable from real acupuncture and physiologically inert.</p><p>This trial will evaluate the relevance of using placebo acupuncture devices in control groups using a validation test of various placebo acupuncture devices that have been used in acupuncture research.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AEQ</term><def><p>acupuncture expectation questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANS</term><def><p>quantify autonomic nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASQ</term><def><p>acupuncture sensation questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BTQ</term><def><p>blinding test questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSQ</term><def><p>bodily sensation questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>blinding index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p>clinical research coordinator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSQ</term><def><p>de-qi sensation questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRV</term><def><p>heart rate variability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMD</term><def><p>Korean Medicine Doctor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MASS Index</term><def><p>Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>No treat</term><def><p>no treatment session</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHNT</term><def><p>phantom acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSD</term><def><p>park sham device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Real Park</term><def><p>park sham device with real needle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Real ST</term><def><p>Real Streitberger&#x02019;s needle treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Sham Park</term><def><p>park sham device with sham needle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Sham ST</term><def><p>Sham Streitberger&#x02019;s needle treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCR</term><def><p>skin conductance response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOP</term><def><p>standard operation procedures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMF</term><def><p>trial master file</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SHL is as a principal investigator.
