Efforts toward reducing the toll of neonatal sepsis include preventive strategies, biomarker measurements for earlier detection, and use of adjunct immunotherapies. Extensive investigation into sepsis biomarkers has yielded promising candidates such as inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, acute phase proteins, and leukocyte activation markers <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but the drawback of these blood tests is that they are available on a limited basis and are usually obtained when a patient is already sick, even if only subtly so. Immune modulating therapies given after a patient develops signs of sepsis have also not proven beneficial <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Treatment with antibiotics or adjunct therapies prior to overt clinical deterioration might lead to better outcomes. The challenge is to identify patients early in transition from being well to being sick; continuous monitoring of heart rate characteristics was developed for this purpose <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Alterations in heart rate characteristics (HRC) occur as part of the pathophysiologic response to systemic infection. The autonomic nervous system modulates heart rate, with frequent small accelerations and decelerations occurring in response to sympathetic and parasympathetic input to cardiac pacemaker cells. Decreased beat-to-beat variability and transient decelerations occur in acute pathologic conditions such as fetal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In NICU patients, we have shown that changes in HRC wax and wane before onset of clinical signs of sepsis <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, raising the possibility of earlier sepsis detection and treatment through display of HRC monitor data to clinicians. Earlier institution of antibiotics and supportive therapies could curb the systemic inflammatory response linked to tissue damage and mortality in sepsis.</p><p id="P7">Continuous HRC monitoring translates reduced heart rate variability and transient decelerations to estimate the fold-increase in probability of imminent sepsis (HRC index) using mathematical algorithms <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The impact of HRC monitoring on outcomes was tested in a randomized clinical trial of 3003 VLBW infants in 9 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The trial had a pragmatic design in that clinicians were given information about how the HRC index was developed and were instructed that an elevation in the HRC index should prompt a bedside evaluation and consideration of appropriate blood tests or treatment, but no specific course of action was mandated in response to the HRC index <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, there was a 22% relative reduction in mortality among infants whose HRC index was displayed to clinicians (10.2% to 8.1%, p=0.04). Here, we focused on infants in the clinical trial who had one or more episodes of LOS and tested the hypothesis that mortality within 30 days of LOS is lower in the HRC display compared to the non-display group To explore the possibility that HRC monitoring led to earlier diagnosis of LOS, we analyzed large, abrupt increases, or spikes, in the HRC index and also tested the hypothesis that LOS was diagnosed after fewer spikes when the HRC index was displayed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S6"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S7"><title>Septicemia incidence and clinical characteristics</title><p id="P8">Of 3003 VLBW infants randomized, 2989 met criteria and were included in the original analysis (1500 HRC display, 1489 non-display). Fourteen patients were excluded from analysis due to withdrawal of consent, birthweight &#x02265; 1500 g, or cardiac arrhythmias <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. 9882 blood cultures were obtained (5225 from 1020 infants in the HRC display group and 4657 from 980 infants in the non-display group), and there were 974 episodes of LOS in 700 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of LOS episodes (70%) were caused by Gram-positive bacteria, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) accounting for 49%. The 974 episodes of LOS were equally distributed among patients in the HRC display and non-display groups (486 in 348 infants and 488 in 352 infants, respectively). There were no significant differences in the distribution of organism classes causing septicemia in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

In the HRC display and non-display groups, there were no significant differences in birth weight, gestational age, or gender for infants with septicemia compared to those without. Infants with one or more episodes of LOS in the HRC display group had more days alive and not on a ventilator (the primary endpoint of the clinical trial) compared to those in the non-display group (76.4 vs 69.7 days, p=0.048).

In contrast, the concurrent baseline probability of sepsis, calculated from established risk factors of gestational and postmenstrual age, birth weight, and presence of mechanical ventilation showed only a small increase due to some patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation around the time of septicemia. There was an increase in the average HRC index prior to clinical diagnosis of LOS with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, other Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Peak HRC index was similar for each pathogen group (CONS 3.0 &#x000b1; 2.2, Other Gram-positive 3.1 &#x000b1; 2.3, Gram-negative 3.0 &#x000b1; 2.2, Fungus 3.3 &#x000b1; 2.2, mean &#x000b1; SD, p=0.68). 92% of cases of LOS in non-display infants were associated with HRC index &#x0003e;1 and 79% with HRC index &#x0003e;2 within 24h of diagnosis.</p><p id="P11">Infants in the non-display group had a significantly higher average HRC index in the 2 to 7 days leading up to the time of positive blood culture compared to infants in the HRC display group (p&#x0003c;0.01 for each day from &#x02212;2 to &#x02212;7 relative to LOS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the occurrence of a single abrupt rise in the HRC index (&#x0201c;spike&#x0201d;) around the time of LOS versus multiple spikes in the days leading up to diagnosis.

In contrast, more patients in both groups had spikes in the 2 to 7 day time interval prior to diagnosis of LOS, demonstrating that the spikes are relevant to septicemia. Further, more patients in the non-display group had large spikes than in the HRC display group regardless of the infecting organism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P12">In this secondary analysis of data from a large, randomized clinical trial of HRC monitoring in VLBW infants, we found that mortality reduction was much greater for infants with septicemia when the HRC index was displayed to clinicians than for infants without septicemia. In addition, we found that the average HRC index increased prior to clinical diagnosis of late-onset septicemia, irrespective of infecting organism.</p><p id="P13">Sepsis-related morbidity and mortality are unacceptably high in part because the diagnosis is often delayed by the subtlety of presenting signs. New biomarker tests for sepsis improve on earlier ones <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but require clinical suspicion of illness to prompt blood testing. By then, the stage of illness may be so advanced that antibiotic administration fails to curtail the systemic inflammatory response that can lead to death and disability. Adjunct sepsis therapies such as IVIG given to neonates once they show clinical signs of infection have not proven effective in reducing mortality and morbidity <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Continuous monitoring of heart rate characteristics has the potential advantage of alerting clinicians to pathophysiologic changes in the early phase of sepsis, prior to overt clinical deterioration, leading to earlier treatment and improved outcomes.</p><p id="P14">In this large trial of VLBW infants, the incidence of sepsis was comparable to that reported in other large surveys <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and was very similar in HRC display and non-display groups, underscoring that the function of HRC monitoring is not sepsis prevention, but rather early detection. The HRC index increased in the day prior to clinical diagnosis of LOS with Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria or fungi. The average HRC index was significantly higher in the week leading up to LOS diagnosis in infants whose HRC index was not displayed to clinicians and was accompanied by more acute HRC index spikes. We have previously described waxing and waning of abnormal heart rate characteristics for several days prior to the clinical presentation of sepsis in NICU patients <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. There is no way to determine exactly when an infant develops a bloodstream infection, so we can only speculate that these pre-diagnosis HRC spikes represent an early phase of illness and that recognition, evaluation and treatment at this time averted clinical deterioration and contributed to lower morbidity and mortality. Among the 700 infants who developed sepsis in the randomized trial, those whose HRC index was displayed to clinicians had not only fewer acute increases in HRC index and lower mortality, but also significantly more days alive and not on a ventilator, which was the primary endpoint of the original study. Lower mortality among HRC display infants occurred across all organism classes, with the largest reduction occurring with CONS septicemia, which accounted for nearly half of all LOS cases. The tradeoff for lower mortality is that infants whose HRC index was displayed had 12% more blood cultures obtained and 11% more days on antibiotics. The fact that there were, on average, only 3 extra antibiotic days in the infants in the HRC display compared to non-display group among infants who developed LOS leads us to speculate that monitoring the HRC index may give clinicians insight into appropriate timing of both initiating and discontinuing antibiotics.</p><p id="P15">The HRC monitoring study is the largest randomized clinical trial in very low birth weight infants reported to date. A limitation of the current analysis of LOS in this trial is that the exact timing of onset of sepsis relative to the changes in the HRC index cannot be known. The design of the clinical trial did not include a mandated intervention for infants with an acute increase in HRC index, and we can only speculate as to whether the increases in the HRC index in the days leading up to the positive blood culture represent a subclinical sepsis prodrome and an opportunity for earlier intervention.</p><p id="P16">In conclusion, HRC monitoring in very low birth weight infants reduces mortality and this reduction in mortality is associated with a lower mortality following late-onset sepsis. It is possible that HRC monitoring prompts recognition of sepsis in its earlier stages when treatment is more likely to reduce morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>Patient population</title><p id="P17">VLBW infants at 9 NICUs were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of HRC monitoring from April 2004 through May 2010. The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical Predictive Science Corporation (Charlottesville, VA). Institutional review boards approved the protocol at each study site, and informed consent was obtained from parents for infants&#x02019; participation. In this trial, all infants had their HRC index monitored and were randomized 1:1 (stratified by birthweight &#x02265; or &#x0003c;1000 grams) to having their HRC index continuously displayed or not displayed to nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Clinical data collection, and sepsis and mortality definitions</title><p id="P18">In the RCT, we recorded demographics, dates and results of blood cultures, days on antibiotics or antifungal agents (other than prophylactic fluconazole or ampicillin), days on mechanical ventilation, and date of death or NICU discharge. The current analysis results from a careful reclassification of septicemia episodes in the trial with LOS defined as 1) a positive blood culture obtained at &#x0003e;3 days of age, excluding corynebacterium and diphtheroids, 2) no prior positive blood culture for the same organism in the previous 7 days, and 3) antibiotics administered for at least 5 days when the organism grown was coagulase-negative staphylococcus. &#x0201c;Other positive&#x0201d; blood cultures were reclassified if a specific organism could be identified through database review. The 18 cases of multiple organisms in a blood culture were classified by what was considered the most virulent organism. We excluded 15 episodes from the organism-specific analyses because the organism could not be identified through database review. We also excluded 92 episodes in which there was a positive blood culture for CONS but the infant received fewer than 5 days of antibiotics. As a result of this analysis, 37 patients were reclassified as having no sepsis.</p><p id="P19">Mortality was assessed as all in-hospital mortality and as death within 30 days and within 7 days of the last episode of LOS.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Analysis of risk factor-based LOS probability</title><p id="P20">The HRC index was originally conceived, developed, and validated for assessment of probability of imminent LOS in VLBW infants <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. To establish the baseline probability of LOS based on standard risk factors <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, we developed a model incorporating gestational and postmenstrual age, birth weight, and presence of mechanical ventilation in the patients in the control, non-display group.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>HRC index monitoring and spike analysis</title><p id="P21">The FDA 510(k)-cleared HeRO (Heart Rate Observation) monitoring system was provided by Medical Predictive Science Corporation (Charlottesville, VA). The monitor uses existing electrocardiogram or heart rate data from standard bedside monitors to calculate the HRC index, which is the fold-increase in probability that the patient will have a clinical deterioration consistent with sepsis in the next 24 hours. The HRC index is derived from an externally validated logistic regression expression that relates decreased HR variability and transient HR decelerations to the probability that the baby will imminently be diagnosed with sepsis. The monitor displays the current HRC index, which is updated every hour and represents heart rate characteristics over the previous 12 hours. The monitor also displays the 5-day HRC index trend.</p><p id="P22">We analyzed the average hourly HRC index around the time of LOS in infants in the HRC display and non-display groups. In order to examine a possible mechanism of lower mortality with HRC index monitoring, we also counted large, abrupt increases in the HRC index (&#x0201c;spikes&#x0201d;) in the 2&#x02013;7 day period before clinical diagnosis of LOS (the time period during which there was a significant difference in average HRC index in HRC display versus non-display infants). We defined a spike as an increase in HRC index of at least 3 compared with the prior 5-day running average, excluding the 12 hours before the peak. Rates of large spikes were compared in infants who never developed LOS, and in infants in the HRC display and non-display groups who developed LOS, both during a randomly chosen non-septic 5-day period and in the 2 to 7 day period prior to LOS diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P23">HRC index is reported as mean &#x000b1; SD.
