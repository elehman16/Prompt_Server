We previously showed that the multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score in patients with newly diagnosed RA identified patients at risk for RP. We evaluated the MBDA score at multiple time-points as a predictor of RP during 2&#x02005;years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A subset of patients with RA (N=220) from the Swedish Farmacotherapy (SWEFOT) trial were analysed for MBDA score, disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28), C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at baseline (BL), month 3 and year 1, for predicting RP based on modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores at BL, year 1 and year 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with persistently low MBDA (&#x0003c;30) scores or those with a decrease from moderate (30&#x02013;44) to low MBDA scores, did not develop RP during 2&#x02005;years of follow-up. The highest risk for RP during 2&#x02005;years of follow-up (42%) was observed among patients with persistently high (&#x0003e;44) MBDA scores. Among methotrexate non-responders with a high MBDA score at BL or month 3, significantly more of those who received triple therapy had RP at year 2 compared with those who received antitumour necrosis factor therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Measuring the MBDA score both before and during treatment in RA was useful for the assessment of individual patient risk for RP during 2&#x02005;years of follow-up. In comparison with low CRP, ESR or DAS28, a low MBDA score at any time-point was associated with numerically lower proportions of RP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT00764725.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd><kwd>Anti-TNF</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Disease Activity</kwd><kwd>Patient perspective</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A low multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score at baseline was associated with a very low risk of radiographic progression (RP).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Achievement of a low MBDA score at later time-points also was associated with low risk of RP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Among patients with low C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the majority had high/moderate MBDA score and a substantial proportion had RP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Combination of MBDA score at multiple time-points may help choose optimal therapy, since patients with a high MBDA score might be better protected from RP while using biologics compared with patients having a low/moderate MBDA score.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), early therapeutic intervention increases the chances of achieving better clinical and radiographic outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

The analyses of RP from BL to year 1 and to year 2 for this study were performed on a subset of 220 patients with eRA for whom the MBDA scores, CRP, ESR and DAS28 were available at BL. Of the 220 patients, data on these four disease activity measures at month 3 and year 1 were available for 205 and 133 patients, respectively. From the study subset, 76 patients responded to MTX monotherapy and 144 were randomised to the TT (n=73) or anti-TNF (n=71) treatment arms.

This figure&#x000a0;illustrates that some patients at very low CRP levels at all three time-points have RRP over 2&#x02005;years, while those with low or moderate MBDA scores have lower proportions with RRP. Moreover, when comparing proportions of patients with RRP from BL to year 2 between the TT and anti-TNF treated groups, patients with a high MBDA score at BL or month 3 differed significantly, whereas those with high CRP did not (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000197F4">figure 4</xref> and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref>s S2). Although using &#x00394;SHS&#x0003e;3 cut-off did not show a significantly, but only numerically, higher proportion of patients with CRRP in the TT versus anti-TNF therapy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000197F4">figure 4</xref>B), when comparing all patients together, the associations of the MBDA score categories with risk of CRRP were similar to the association with RRP using &#x00394;SHS&#x0003e;5 cut-off (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1).</p><p>When comparing predictive ability of the MBDA score at different time-points, we noticed that combination of the MBDA score from BL and month 3 substantially improved the identification of patients at a low risk of RRP during the first year of the trial compared with single time-points, due mainly to an increase in the sample size from n=33 to n=50 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S1). As for the prediction of RRP during the second year of follow-up, year 1 was the best single time-point for identification of patients at a low risk of RRP. Simultaneous use of the MBDA score from BL and year 1 or from month 3 and year 1 slightly increased the sample size of this subset of patients (from 87, to 90 and 88, respectively).</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that it was based on one cohort, which was not a full representation of the RA population. However, the SWEFOT trial was designed to include a real-life eRA population. Another limitation was that the MTX responder population lacked MBDA data at year 1, which limited our ability to perform analyses. Next, because of the lack of information about cut-offs for CRP and ESR categories, we had to use non-validated cut-offs for CRP and tertiles for ESR in order to define low/moderate/high levels of disease activity. This makes the comparison with MBDA score more limited and the health-economic point of view cannot be evaluated. Changes in the treatment of patients from different arms could affect the radiographic outcome. And, finally, in comparison of proportion of RRP within each therapy group, some subgroups of patients are very small. Considering this and the fact of multiple testing, the results of significant difference of proportions of RRP between TT and anti-TNF therapy groups need to be confirmed.</p><p>The strength of this study is the availability of data from multiple time-points, which provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the MBDA score as a predictor of RRP at the onset of the disease, and also during subsequent treatment. The presence of two different treatment strategies (TT vs biological therapy) gave an opportunity to study the MBDA score as a predictor of patients at high versus low risk of RRP for each therapy group, separately. As the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000197F4">figure 4</xref> suggest, patients with a high MBDA score would benefit more from anti-TNF therapy than from TT, decreasing their risk of RRP by year 2. Thus, while MBDA testing is more expensive than using conventional biomarkers (ie, ESR and CRP), targeting (biological) therapies to the patients with the greatest potential benefit may generate considerable savings.</p><p>In conclusion, a low MBDA score at BL, month 3 and year 1, was predictive for low risk of RRP over 2&#x02005;years of follow-up in patients with eRA, and this association was stronger (non-significantly) than associations with low DAS28, CRP or ESR. The MBDA score may thereby become a useful tool for guiding treatment choices in individual patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The SWEFOT trial investigating groups, besides the authors: Johan Bratt, Stockholm, Ingemar Petersson, Lund, Pierre Geborek, Lund, Sofia Ernestam, Stockholm; Kristina Albertsson, Stockholm; Lars C&#x000f6;ster, Link&#x000f6;ping; Eva Waltbrand, Bor&#x000e5;s; Agneta Zickert, Stockholm; Jan Theander, Kristianstad; &#x000c5;ke Th&#x000f6;rner, Eskilstuna; Helena Hellstr&#x000f6;m, Falun; Annika Teleman, Halmstad; Christina Dackhammar, M&#x000f6;lndal; Finn Akre, &#x000d6;rebro; Lotta Ljung, Ume&#x000e5;; Rolf Oding, V&#x000e4;ster&#x000e5;s; Katerina Chatzidionysiou, Stockholm; Margareta W&#x000f6;rnert, Stockholm.
