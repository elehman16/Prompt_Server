A number of resorbable and nonresorbable guided tissue regeneration (GTR) materials have been proposed to delay epithelial downgrowth during healing. The use of bioresorbable barriers eliminates the need for second surgery to remove the membrane and decrease the associated disturbances of newly formed osteoid that may result in bone resorption.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Oral cavity comprises tissues which are complex in nature harboring distinctive progenitor cell colonies residing in the form of extracellular matrix framework. Complex natural scaffolds allow repopulation of own cells, thereby producing an autologous tissue-engineered organ. Periosteum and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) are two natural scaffolds suited for tissue regeneration.</p><p>Periosteum, a structure rich in osteoprogenitor cells, has been as having regenerative potential. Periosteal grafts provide the wound area with additional osteoprogenitor cells which compensate for the deficiency of cells available in the periodontal defect.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Gamal and Mailhot introduced a novel marginal pedicle periosteum (MPP) flap as a biologic guided tissue membrane in the management of deep angular two- and three-wall intrabony periodontal defects. They reported that the use of vascularized MPP graft as a barrier membrane significantly improved clinical and radiographic parameters of deep intrabony defects and proved superior to open-flap debridement alone.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>PRF is a second-generation platelet concentrate introduced by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>. It is an autologous leukocyte and PRF biomaterial which is made up of an intimate assembly of cytokines and structural glycoproteins enmeshed within a slowly polymerizing fibrin network.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] PRF also induces the proliferation of various cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with strongest induction effect on osteoblasts.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A collapse of the mucoperiosteal flap may limit the area available for the regenerative process and may thus affect the result. To avoid these disadvantages, combination therapies of bone substitutes and GTR have been recommended.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of autogenous marginal periosteal pedicle graft (MPPG) and bioactive glass with autogenous PRF membrane and bioactive glass in the treatment of intrabony defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study undertaken was a single-blind, active, prospective, split-mouth clinical trial. Patients were recruited from outpatient center of the Department of Periodontics, GITAM dental college, Visakhapatnam, India. The study protocol pro forma was submitted and approved by the Ethical Committee of the institution. Systemically healthy individuals, in the age group of 20&#x02013;60 years, with the presence of at least two periodontal pockets with probing depth &#x02265;6 mm and radiographic evidence of two intrabony defects on bilateral or contralateral sides with one site showing a 4&#x02013;5 mm band of keratinized gingiva were included in the study. Patients with poor oral hygiene, users of tobacco in any form, pregnant and lactating women, patients with the study tooth mobility, and patients with a history of drug intake known to affect the periodontium were excluded from the study. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients.</p><p>Following initial examination and treatment planning, the selected patients underwent Phase I periodontal therapy. Customized acrylic stents with grooves were prepared on the study model of the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical parameters</title><p>The clinical parameters, including full-mouth plaque index (PI) and site PI (Silness and Loe 1964), were recorded at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, while the full-mouth sulcus bleeding index (SBI) and site SBI (Muhlemann and Son 1971) were recorded baseline, 6, and 9 months. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level, and gingival recession (GR) were recorded to the nearest millimeter with a UNC-15 probe at baseline, 6, and 9 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Radiographic parameters</title><p>Intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs were taken for each site at baseline (patient's initial visit) and at 6 and 9 months postoperatively using long cone paralleling technique. The IOPA radiographs were digitalized and the measurements from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the base of the defect (A) and CEJ to the crest of the alveolar bone (B) were done using Image J software. Based on these measurements, the amount of defect fill, percentage of defect fill, and change in alveolar crest height at 6 and 9 months were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>The operative sites A and B were anesthetized with 2% xylocaine in hydrochloric acid with adrenaline (1:80,000) using block and infiltration techniques. The surgical procedure for the study groups was performed by a single operator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Site A</title><p>As described in detail by Gamal and Mailhot, the procedure consisted of facial and lingual intrasulcular incisions extending to two teeth adjacent to the defect that possessed wider attached gingiva. Subsequently, one facial vertical releasing incision extending into the alveolar mucosa was given, and a facial split-thickness flap reflection was done that would permit free movement of a 3-to 4-mm wide periosteal pedicle strip. Full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were raised lingually. A marginal periosteal strip was obtained from the facial periosteum adjacent to the defect using one vertical incision starting from 4 mm apical to the alveolar crest and one horizontal incision parallel to the gingival margin. The periosteum was elevated with a periosteal elevator from the underlying bone and the separation extended laterally keeping the base attached for use as a pedicle biological carrier membrane. Debridement of all inflammatory granulation tissues from the intrabony defect was performed until a sound, healthy bone surface was obtained using the appropriate scalers and Gracey curettes. The surgical site was thoroughly irrigated with 0.9% normal saline, and an alloplastic graft bioactive glass material (Perioglas) was used to fill the defect. The periosteal flap material was rotated to cover the interproximal defect without suturing since the flap adheres well to the bony surfaces. Finally, the soft-tissue flap was repositioned and secured to the original position with interproximal and sling sutures using black silk (3-0) [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative probing depth Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Partial thickness flap elevated Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Surgical defect depth Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Placement of bone graft Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Marginal periosteal graft Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Preoperative radiograph Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g006"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Postoperative radiograph Site A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-96-g007"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Site B</title><p>Facial and lingual sulcular incisions were made, and full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were reflected.

In the present study, both the sites showed a significant reduction in mean PD, CAL gain, defect fill, and percentage of defect fill.</p><p>The results of the present study are in accordance with Gamal <italic>et al</italic>. who reported probing depth reduction of 5.6 &#x000b1; 1.5 mm, CAL gain of 4.3 &#x000b1; 1.9 mm, and a defect fill of 3.2 mm[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] at 9-month follow-up which suggests that more gain in CAL, bone fill, and probing depth reduction can be obtained using pedicled periosteal flaps. Autogenous free periosteum is less vascularized and may have less number of viable cells when compared to pedicled periosteum.</p><p>All MPPG grafts performed in the present study were placed against residual periodontal pocket bony walls. In terms of viability, a vascularized MPP graft provides a more adequate vascular supply to the graft. The osteogenic capacity of a vascularized periosteum is less affected by the environment of the recipient site compared to free periosteum. Frost described a situation referred to as &#x0201c;regional acceleratory phenomenon.&#x0201d; It denotes that there is a local exuberant response to noxious stimuli, which accelerates the normal healing process.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Mesenchymal stem cells are normally quiescent. Relevantly, elevation and relocation of the periosteum performed in MPPG surgery can be considered a noxious stimulus.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Application of this concept is being used in MPPG surgery as a method to initiate local tissue release of osteoprogenitor cells and osteoinductive agents.</p><p>The results of the study are in accordance to the study performed by A. Pradeep <italic>et al</italic>. who reported a 63.39 &#x000b1; 16.52 percentage of defect fill at the end of 9 months when PRF was used along with hydroxyapatite. The combination of fibrins and cytokines within PRF becomes a powerful bioscaffold with an integrated reservoir of growth factors TGF-&#x003b2;1, VEGF, and MPO in the first 7 days and IGF1, PDGF-AB, and platelet activity (PF4-CXCL4) in the first 8 h, followed by a decrease to close to zero at 28 days.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Qi Li <italic>et al</italic>. found a stronger effect of PRF on alveolar bone cells and dental follicle cells than on PDL progenitors, and the PRF induces the elevation of proliferation of alveolar bone progenitors. PRF can upregulate p-ERK expression in human osteoblasts and enhance the cell proliferation through p-ERK signal transduction pathway.</p><p>There was a slight increase in GR and alveolar crest loss in Site B from baseline and 9 months, and this may be attributed to reduced vascular supply to the overlying flap due to the placement of a barrier that creates two avascular surfaces &#x02013; the root surface and the barrier membrane.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although the PRF acts as a good scaffold and is enriched with growth factors, it does not contain viable cells. The greater increase in percentage of defect fill in Site A demonstrates that periosteum has more osteogenic potential than the PRF owing to the presence of viable osteoprogenitor cells in the defect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Thus, the present study demonstrates that both the treatment modalities have predictable outcomes and were successful in showing promising results in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects.
