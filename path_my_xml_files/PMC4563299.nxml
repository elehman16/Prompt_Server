exercise on the balance ability of the elderly. [Subjects and Methods] Ten elderly
patients were assigned to an experimental group, and they performed 15&#x02005;min of horseback
riding. Another 10 elderly patients were assigned to a control group, and they performed
15&#x02005;min of one-leg standing exercise. Both exercises were repeated five times a week for a
total of six weeks. The participants&#x02019; balance ability was evaluated. [Results] The
horseback-riding group showed significant differences between the pre-and post-test
balance abilities as assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go
(TUG) test. [Conclusion] Horseback riding effectively improves the balance ability of the
elderly. Horseback riding should be considered as a therapeutic method for the physical
therapy of the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance ability</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Mechanical horseback riding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among the elderly, falls are caused by decreased balance ability and stability resulting
from decreased performance of exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exercise designed to increase flexibility and response time can improve the balance of the
elderly<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, aerobic
exercise, strength exercise, walking, postural adjustment, and repeated muscle coordination
exercises can improve balance and prevent falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have been conducted to investigate methods for the improvement of balance
ability to prevent falls. Recently, research efforts have given much attention to helping
the elderly reduce pain and increase stability and muscle strength through ball exercises
which have positive effects on health<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The elderly are more likely to experience accidental falls as they age, and efforts to
prevent such accidents are desperately needed. With an increasing elderly population,
raising the quality of life of the elderly has become more important. Illness-based aging
rather than simple aging is emerging as a social issue beyond the individual economic level.
The number of exercises which have been proven to actually prevent falls by the elderly is
low. This study investigated the effects of mechanical horseback riding, which is on
interest and enjoyment among the elderly, and on its efficacy as an exercise for improving
the balance ability of the elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were those being treated under the Elderly Welfare Act and those who were
hospitalized in a nursing hospital in Gyeonggi Province. Prior to their participation in
the study, a written informed consent accepted by the local ethics committee was obtained
from all of the subjects. The subjects were able to understand the purpose and procedures
of this study. They were free of musculoskeletal system problems, capable of independent
walking, and had no vestibular sense problems, and sufficient cognitive ability.</p><p>The physical characteristics of the subjects were as follows. For the experimental group,
the mean age was 70.1&#x02005;years, the average height was 164.4&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was
60.8&#x02005;kg. Seven patients were male, and three were female. For the control group, the mean
age was 71.2&#x02005;years, the average height was 163.2&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 62.1&#x02005;kg.
Six patients were male, and four were female.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ten of the 20 subjects were randomly assigned to the one-leg standing exercise control
group, and 10 to the mechanical horseback-riding experimental group. All subjects listened
to detailed explanations about each posture, watched demonstrations, and practiced a few
times before testing.</p><p>The control group performed the one-leg standing exercise. The subjects were asked to
unfold their arms, stare in front, and raise their right and left feet alternately. The
experimental group performed mechanical horseback riding using a Slim Rider (Shinwa
Electronics, South Korea), which has speeds and courses from levels 1 to 15. Each course
lasts 4&#x02005;min, and it has a variety of programs. The horseback-riding machine was covered
with a leather pad and mounted on supports at the approximate height of an average horse.
The subjects sat on the horseback-riding machine as one would on a real horse, with a
supervisor on standby. While sitting on the horseback-riding machine, the subjects
maintained their balance throughout the session. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to evaluate the subjects&#x02019; balance ability.</p><p>SPSS version 18.0 for Windows was used to statistically process data to examine the
effects of six weeks of balance exercises, specifically one-leg standing exercise and
horseback riding, on the elderly subjects&#x02019; balance ability. The paired t-test was
conducted to compare the effects on each group before and after exercise. A significance
level of &#x00251;=0.05 was used to test the statistical significance of differences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The elderly subjects performed one-leg standing exercise or horseback riding and the BBS
and TUG test were used to assess their balance ability. The findings are as follows:</p><p>After the intervention, the experimental group showed a statistically significant increase
in BBS from 41.25&#x000b1;2.46 to 46.50&#x000b1;2.30 (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group showed no
significant difference, 42.56&#x000b1;4.21 and 43.81&#x000b1;3.85 (p&#x0003e;0.05). The experimental group showed
a statistically significant improvement in the TUG time from 11.28&#x000b1;1.54&#x02005;s to 8.36&#x000b1;1.29&#x02005;s
(p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group showed no significant improvement, 11.41&#x000b1;1.77&#x02005;s and
10.32&#x000b1;1.72&#x02005;s (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>McGibbon et al. found that horseback riding could increase task performance skills by
improving regulation of trunk movements, and even balance ability by eliciting better
sensory information control, and reported that children who had difficulty with walking
showed improvement in exercise functions and walked more easily after horseback riding<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fleck reported that horseback riding could
generate the same effects as walking exercise, as the pelvic exercise the rider has on
horseback is similar to that while walking<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kang and Song reported that indoor horse riding stimulated interest
in children with cerebral palsy and was worth considering as a therapeutic method to enhance
their functions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to our present
results, the horseback riding group showed a reduction in the TUG time of 2.9&#x02005;s and an
increase in the BBS score of 5.2, consistent with the results of previous studies. Regular
exercise for maintaining posture can affect the physical ability of the elderly. Even
low-intensity exercise that considers the physical conditions of the elderly can effectively
improve their balance ability.</p><p>It was reported that horseback riding led to improved muscle strength and vestibular and
visual stimuli with effects on sensory functions. It helped facilitate the stability and
balance reactions of the spine as well as postural adjustment training of the patients.
Horseback riding therapy improves trunk balance and postural adjustment through the repeated
stimuli of the horse&#x02019;s movement that enhances the muscles around the pelvis, abdomen, and
waist, which are used to maintain posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horseback riding is an exercise that can enhance both static and
dynamic balance. It can simultaneously strengthen the musculoskeletal and neurological
factors that specifically improve balance. In terms of musculoskeletal factors, horseback
riding may result in functional improvement and increased stability; in terms of the
neurological factors, it may stimulate proprioception<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental group showed great interest in the therapeutic
methods and achieved a high participation level in the exercise, which seemed to improve
their balance ability. Horseback riding resulted in significant improvements in the balance
tests, and this improvement raises the possibility of its application at home programs.
Future studies are needed to search for various methods of exercise programs and to
accumulate scientific evidence and basic data for the establishment of horseback riding as a
stability exercise for the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by Wonkwang Health Science University in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Buchner</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>de Lateur</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The importance of skeletal muscle strength to physical
