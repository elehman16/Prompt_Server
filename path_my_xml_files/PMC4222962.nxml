Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and healthy eating behaviours not only contribute to obesity but also have important independent health implications <xref rid="pone.0111954-Iannotti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The primary outcome focus of most interventions for overweight and obese adolescents has been adiposity rather than activity and healthy eating behaviours <xref rid="pone.0111954-Luttikhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Aside from the importance of these behaviours to multiple health issues, including adiposity <xref rid="pone.0111954-Iannotti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, a focus on weight-related outcomes may have unintended negative psychological consequences <xref rid="pone.0111954-Bacon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Evidence also suggests that interventions targeting both activity and healthy eating behaviours should be multi-disciplinary and involve families in community settings for sustained change <xref rid="pone.0111954-Luttikhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Hoelscher1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Zook1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

This design was selected to minimize ethical concerns with withholding treatment in a no treatment control for 18 months <xref rid="pone.0111954-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the likely unacceptably high drop-out over multiple assessments over an extended study duration for a no-treatment or minimal standard care control group. Additionally, the within-subject design reduces error variance from individual differences, thus increasing the power with the expected high dropout rates and reduced sample sizes found in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0111954-Luttikhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Bean1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The trial was registered (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry # ACTRN12611001187932) and the protocol published <xref rid="pone.0111954-Straker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111954.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111954.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. Participants were assessed at six time-points including baseline, 3-months after baseline prior to beginning the intervention (end of waitlist period), immediately following the 8-week intervention (end of intervention period), and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months following the intervention (maintenance periods). Entry into the program was staggered into three waves, beginning in February, May and August 2012 to control for bias from external events and seasonal changes. Follow-up assessments were completed by December 2013. The program was conducted at three sites (two urban and one rural) with a high proportion of low socio-economic status residents. Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee approved all procedures (HR105/2011). Written informed assent was obtained from adolescents and consent was obtained from parents prior to commencing the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment And Participants</title><p>One hundred and twenty three participants enquired about the program from the community following information provided by health professionals, community newspapers and radio media, and distribution of flyers, of which 69 entered the study. Recruitment began in late November 2011 and continued through to August 2012. To be included in the study, participants had BMI-for-age and sex greater than the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile on the Centers for Disease Control BMI-for-age growth charts <xref rid="pone.0111954-Kuczmarski1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and passed a medical screening prior to participation. Participants were excluded if their obesity was related to a diagnosed metabolic, genetic, or endocrine disease, were receiving current treatment for a psychological disorder, or were unable to attend sessions twice weekly at the community locations. Sample size estimates were reported in the protocol paper <xref rid="pone.0111954-Straker2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Seven cohorts ranging in size from 6 to 13 adolescents and the same number of parents were conducted in three waves. Recruitment ceased after the planned three waves despite smaller than anticipated numbers due to grant funding constraints. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111954-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of participants through the study.</p><fig id="pone-0111954-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111954.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Participant flow diagram for the waitlist controlled trial of Curtin University's Activity, Food, and Attitudes Program.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0111954.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>This intervention was adapted to be conducted in the community from a previous program conducted in healthcare and university settings. Additional detailed formative work with adolescents, researchers and practitioners guided the development and refinement of the curriculum <xref rid="pone.0111954-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In summary, a team of 13 multidisciplinary community practitioners (psychologist, physiotherapist/exercise physiologist, dietitian) were trained to implement the program across the seven cohorts, with one facilitator from each domain working with each cohort typically. The theoretical framework for the intervention was self-determination theory <xref rid="pone.0111954-Deci1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and goal setting theory <xref rid="pone.0111954-Locke1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and is described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone-0111954-g0enner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Both instructors and parents were encouraged to provide a need-supportive environment to increase adolescents' autonomous motivation for physical activity and healthy eating behaviours.</p><p>The initial 8-week intervention included 2-hour group sessions twice per week in community locations. Both adolescents and parents participated in all sessions, with each session having separate and joint activities. An outline of the sessions and which facilitators supported each session is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111954-t001">Table 1</xref>. Phone contact was made with participants who missed a session to increase attendance adherence. At every session, adolescents participated in 45-minutes of enjoyable physical activity and a behavioural component on healthy eating, activity and overcoming barriers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111954-t001">Table 1</xref>). During the CAFAP activity sessions, participants were taught to self-monitor their heart rate and self-perceived level of exertion. The sessions began with a warm up, usually 1&#x02013;2 group games, to increase the heart rate and body temperature in preparation for the circuit exercises. During the circuit training, participants moved through alternate &#x02018;huff and puff&#x02019; and &#x02018;strength&#x02019; stations. &#x02018;Huff and puff&#x02019; stations, like boxing, were designed to increase the participants' heart rate and increase their level of cardiovascular exertion. &#x02018;Strength&#x02019; stations included a focus on different parts of the body, specifically trunk (e.g. oblique crunches), upper limb (e.g. bicep curls) and lower limb (e.g. squats). Sessions usually ended with another group game and cool-down stretches. Adolescents were encouraged to bring their own music to play for the group during the activity sessions. Adolescents set weekly, manageable goals and parents were guided to set their own goals to support these adolescent goals.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0111954-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111954.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Overview of CAFAP sessions.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0111954-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0111954.t001"/><table frame="void" rules="none" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session#</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adolescents</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parents</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The phone coaching was completed by members of the facilitation/assessment team who were well known to participants and aimed to provide structure, support attempts at change, and promote adolescents' sense of autonomy.

Data were collected in 15-second epochs. Diary information and visual inspection of the data were used to determine individual daily wear-time. Periods where participants attended CAFAP sessions or assessments were excluded from the data. Accelerometry data were processed using a customised LabView V7 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) program to determine daily minutes of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous physical activity using intensity cut-points for children <xref rid="pone.0111954-Colley1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Adolescents were trained in completing the record and estimating portion size using household measures. The completed food record was reviewed by the research dietitian and details were clarified with the adolescent. The records were analysed for the number of serves of fruits and vegetables, determined according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating serve sizes <xref rid="pone.0111954-National1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and junk food according to published criteria <xref rid="pone.0111954-National1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Rangan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Serves of fruit (150 g fresh fruit and 30 g dried fruit) were calculated excluding fruit juice, given the difficulty in identifying juice that had been sweetened and the propensity to consume excessive amounts of juice. Vegetables (75 g) included all vegetables other than fried potato, which were included in the junk food serves. The term &#x02018;junk food&#x02019; was used to describe foods that are considered energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods <xref rid="pone.0111954-National1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Rangan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and do not belong to the core food groups. To account for the typically high prevalence of underreporting in self-reported food intake <xref rid="pone.0111954-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, underreporting ratios were calculated. Total energy expenditure was estimated from resting energy expenditure calculations <xref rid="pone.0111954-Henes1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and activity energy expenditure from individual participant accelerometer data <xref rid="pone.0111954-Puyau1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. When accelerometer data was missing, energy activity energy expenditure was calculated for a sedentary individual <xref rid="pone.0111954-Puyau1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Staff assessing outcomes were not blind to the participant's intervention stage, but did not have access to participant prior scores. Participants were not able to be blinded to the intervention. Data on adolescent fitness, food behaviours, perceived parent need-supportive behaviours, autonomous motivation, mental health and quality of life; parent mental health, autonomous motivation to support adolescents, demonstration of need-supportive behaviours, and family functioning; adolescent and parent perceptions of facilitator support; program fidelity; and adolescent, parent and facilitator perceptions of the program were collected and are being reported in detail elsewhere.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Data were visually inspected for potential outliers.

A comparison of baseline values between those participants completing both the intervention and maintenance periods were compared with those not completing either the intervention or maintenance periods using ANOVA and &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>To assess within-subject change, changes in physical activity were assessed using separate linear mixed models with random intercepts for sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous physical activity and adjusted for accelerometer wear-time. Participants who participated in at least 2 assessments were included in statistical models (total used in analysis, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;56). Missing values were accounted for in the linear mixed models, which uses a likelihood-based estimation procedure resulting in non-biased estimates by imputation of missing responses based upon the surrounding responses and modelled covariance structure. Count data of servings of fruit, vegetables, and junk food were analysed using negative binomial regression utilising generalized estimating equations, with an exchangeable correlation structure and robust estimates of standard errors. Due to the bias that is likely to result from excluding underreporters <xref rid="pone.0111954-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, the ratio of estimated energy expenditure and reported energy intake was included in the models for food servings as a time-varying covariate <xref rid="pone.0111954-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Linear contrasts are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Model fits were assessed through residual plots and diagnostics.</p><p>In all models, a priori linear contrasts compared the mean point estimate at each time point to pre-intervention point estimates. Further, the monthly rates of change over the following periods were estimated: the waitlist period between baseline and pre-intervention, the intervention period between pre-intervention and post-intervention, and the maintenance period between post-intervention and 12-months. Due to the waitlist control design, changes over the intervention and maintenance periods were compared to changes during the waitlist period. The change over periods was adjusted for varying time between assessments by expressing changes as rate of change per month rather than absolute change across the period. No explicit control for multiple comparisons was performed, rather 95% confidence intervals for all parameter estimates are presented together with actual p-values where appropriate.

Indeed the effect size of 4 minutes a day more moderate to vigorous activity when comparing the waitlist and intervention periods is consistent with activity interventions across child and adolescent samples <xref rid="pone.0111954-Metcalf1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Of the few physical activity interventions for overweight and obese adolescents that have measured physical activity by accelerometry, most have found no significant changes <xref rid="pone.0111954-Wengle1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Even following the intervention, on average participants were only achieving half of the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA per day <xref rid="pone.0111954-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, with just six percent of participants achieving an average of 60 minutes per day at post-intervention and the 12-month follow-up. However, as previous researchers have suggested, preventing a further decline in already low activity levels may be a key target during this age transition <xref rid="pone.0111954-Dumith1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and participating in 30 minutes of activity per day or 150 minutes per week in adulthood has been shown to have widespread health effects <xref rid="pone.0111954-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>This was the first study to objectively measure physical activity up to 12 months following a lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese adolescents. The maintenance period was less effective at improving physical activity and sedentary time. While the text messaging during this 12 month period to support this behaviour was based on the limited available evidence, little is known on how adolescents actually change their behaviour and respond to such messages <xref rid="pone.0111954-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Healthy Eating</title><p>Compared to research on physical activity levels during adolescence, even less is known on how food behaviours typically change during this life stage <xref rid="pone.0111954-Smith3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, partially due to the difficulty in obtaining high quality food record data from adolescents.</p><p>During the intervention, servings of junk food decreased and servings of fruit increased. There were no changes in vegetable consumption. Evidence from studies in children suggests that fruit consumption may increase more in response to intervention than vegetable consumption <xref rid="pone.0111954-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

One program <xref rid="pone.0111954-Bean1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> increased combined fruit and vegetable consumption by 0.6 servings per day after 6 months of intervention, similar to the 0.5 servings per day increase in fruit in CAFAP. Using a 15-item food frequency questionnaire, the Loozit study found an improved proportion of participants meeting fruit and vegetable guidelines after a two-month intervention <xref rid="pone.0111954-Shrewsbury1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. While the consumption of fruits and vegetables following participation in CAFAP still fell short of Australian guidelines for 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables each day, <xref rid="pone.0111954-National1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> the increase of half a serve of fruit per day almost doubled the amount of fruit consumed by participants at baseline. The magnitude of change was also much greater than the 10% modelled <italic>a priori</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111954-Straker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and the changes observed in activity. Evidence on the precise health impact of a change of this magnitude given baseline levels of fruit, vegetables and junk food is lacking and thus an important topic for future research.</p><p>In the CAFAP intervention, positive changes in fruit and junk food consumption were successfully maintained up to 12 months following the intervention, however, junk food had increased at 12 months. Additionally, vegetable consumption increased 6 months after the intervention. The Loozit study found no changes in fruit, vegetable, or junk food consumption after 12 or 24 months following the intervention <xref rid="pone.0111954-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Nguyen2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

While underreporting is known to be a problem of food records, particularly in overweight and obese adolescents <xref rid="pone.0111954-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, they remain the best available method for detecting short-term changes in diet and intake patterns <xref rid="pone.0111954-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

As is common with many adolescent interventions <xref rid="pone.0111954-Luttikhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Bean1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, there was high attrition through the study but analyses were performed on all participants with two time points of data, and sensitivity analyses confirmed findings in those who completed the study. A process evaluation of the intervention is currently underway to explore barriers to successful completion.</p><p>While this quasi-experimental study did not have a concurrent control group, the waitlist period provided a within-subject control period comparison for changes seen in the outcomes across the intervention and maintenance periods. This design was selected as providing the best evidence enabling high external validity (staggered entry) and high internal validity (within person control period) whilst providing best practice health behaviour interventions for high-risk adolescents with a 12 months follow-up. For the physical activity and sedentary behaviour outcomes, the changes during the waitlist period were greater than previously published <xref rid="pone.0111954-Olds1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111954-Dumith1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but were in the anticipated direction. The lack of literature on dietary trends across adolescence does not provide a reference for changes in healthy eating outcomes. Whilst there may have been some reactivity during the waitlist period, changes during the intervention were greater than those seen during the waitlist period, suggesting positive effects of the intervention on moderate physical activity, sedentary time and servings of fruit and junk food.</p><p>While behaviours are critical outcomes, further research is needed to determine whether such changes in behaviours translate into changes in fitness, mental and physical health status and quality of life. Further research to understand the patterns for both healthy eating behaviour (such as which meals or specific foods are best to target) and physical activity (such as which day of the week or types of physical activities are best to target) could inform more effective interventions, as could a process evaluation of the current study. Research should also explore whether the effects observed were due to the theoretical mechanism proposed <xref rid="pone-0111954-g0enner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, that is, whether training parents in need-supportive behaviours can enhance adolescent autonomous motivation and subsequent physical activity and healthy eating behaviours.</p><p>The delivery of the program by community health professionals in community settings, whilst challenging, provided high external validity for the findings to be replicable. However, the small sample size and delivery of the intervention in just three sites of similar populations suggest caution in extrapolation to other samples with different social and other characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found that a community-based, family focussed multi-disciplinary physical activity and healthy eating intervention can have a positive influence on behaviours in overweight and obese adolescents and many of these changes can be maintained for up to a year following the intervention. This is encouraging, especially when contrasted with the common pessimistic trajectories of physical activity and healthy eating during adolescence. Improving physical activity and healthy eating behaviours during adolescence is important for current and future physical and mental health and thus successful programs should be made widely available to benefit as many adolescents as possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s7"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111954.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><title>
