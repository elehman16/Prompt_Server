It enhances the ability to use somatosensory information, which improves postural capabilities, reduces injury ratios and improves player&#x02019;s sport performance. We hypothesized that a short-time (3 week) intensive neuromuscular training would significantly improve postural balance of professional football players. We also hypothesized that the non-dominant leg of football players would show a better level of stability than the dominant leg (kicking leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixteen professional soccer players participated in the study. They were tested before and after the 3-week training period. The controlled grup consisted of 20 players that were tested twice in 3-week period. The study was performed with a use of stabliographic platform, which is based on the measurement and analysis of center of pressure movement (COP). Players were tested during one leg stance with eyes opened and closed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After a period of neuromuscular training football players show statistically better postural control (p &#x0003c;0.05) for both the dominant and non-dominant leg for the test with eyes open and also comparing to the controlled group. The non-dominant leg did not show a better level of stability than the dominant leg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The postural stability of professional football players was better after the 3-week intensive neuromuscular training. A combination of balance, coordination, agility, core and trunk control appears to be a successful training schedule to improve postural balance and reduce injury in football.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
