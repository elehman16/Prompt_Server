Depression in individuals with type 2 diabetes is associated with less active diabetes self-management (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), persistent hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), higher rates of diabetes-related complications and mortality (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and a 4.5-fold increase in health care expenditures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and with higher levels of depression (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and poorer HRQoL (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Reducing the incidence of depression and improving HRQoL in obese persons with diabetes is an important clinical objective.</p><p>Behavioral weight loss interventions consistently induce reductions of 5% or more of initial weight in overweight/obese persons with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), losses that are associated with initial improvements in the control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Several studies also suggest that behavioral weight loss interventions facilitate short-term reductions in depression symptoms, as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as well as improvements in the physical health component of quality of life (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, only a few studies of weight loss and mood were conducted in persons with type 2 diabetes, and none followed participants for more than 4 years. Whether the effects observed in the short-term studies are sustained remains unknown. This question is of particular relevance because of lingering concerns about the possible adverse psychological effects of weight loss interventions, as reported in early weight reduction programs (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of long-term intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), designed to achieve weight loss, on depression symptoms and HRQoL.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Look AHEAD was a randomized clinical trial that investigated the long-term health impact of an ILI in 5,145 overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes. The design and methods of this trial have been reported elsewhere (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), as have the baseline characteristics of the randomized cohort (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The trial&#x02019;s primary objective was to determine whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality would be reduced with an ILI designed to achieve weight reduction. As reported previously (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), the trial was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis (when the median duration of follow-up was 9.6 years). No significant differences were observed between treatment arms on the primary outcome, a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for angina. The trial currently is continuing as an observational cohort study.</p><p>Look AHEAD participants were recruited at 16 clinical centers in the U.S. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Eligibility requirements included 45 to 76 years of age; self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus verified by physician report, use of diabetes medication, or tested blood glucose levels; BMI &#x02265;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (&#x02265;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in those taking insulin); hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels &#x0003c;11% (&#x0003c;97 mmol/mol); systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;110 mmHg; and triglyceride levels &#x0003c;600 mg/dL. Individuals with a current diagnosis of psychosis or bipolar disorder, or who had been hospitalized for depression in the past 6 months, were excluded.</p><p>Prior to randomization, participants completed 2 weeks of diet and exercise self-monitoring and successfully completed a maximal graded treadmill test to assess ability to exercise safely. All participants signed a consent form approved by their local institutional review board.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Study participants were randomly assigned within each center to the ILI or to diabetes support and education (DSE), the comparison condition for this trial. As reported previously (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), the ILI was designed to induce &#x02265;7% weight loss in the first year of the trial and to maintain the weight loss in subsequent years. ILI participants were prescribed a calorie goal of 1,200&#x02013;1,800 kcal/day (based on initial weight), with &#x0003c;30% of total calories from fat (&#x0003c;10% from saturated fat) and &#x02265;15% of total calories from protein. ILI participants were encouraged to engage in &#x02265;175 min per week of moderate intensity exercise (e.g., brisk walking). The ILI incorporated behavioral strategies, including regular self-recording, to facilitate achievement of the above goals (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>ILI participants were seen in a combination of individual and group sessions, weekly for the first 6 months and three times per month for the next 6 months. Sessions addressed behavioral adherence and ways to improve it. In all subsequent years, ILI participants were offered monthly in-person sessions. In addition, two to three times per year, they were invited to participate in a once-weekly 6&#x02013;8 week group program designed to achieve a specific weight loss (e.g., 3&#x02013;5 lbs.) or activity goal.</p><p>DSE participants were invited to three group sessions per year for the first 4 years. These sessions addressed general issues of diet, exercise, and social support using a standardized protocol. One group session per year was provided thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>At baseline and study years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, participants completed the BDI-1A, a self-report depression symptom scale with well-documented psychometric properties (i.e., validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change) across a wide spectrum of clinical and nonclinical populations (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The BDI-1A lists 21 symptoms, with responses scored from 0 to 3 for each item in ascending symptom severity, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate more depression symptom burden. For this study, presence of elevated depression symptoms, indicating likely mild or greater depression, was defined as a BDI score &#x02265;10 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). (This study used the BDI-1A, rather than the BDI-II, which has different cut points for mild or greater depression [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].) The BDI-1A also may be scored, as it was in the current study, by separating the 14 items that assess principally cognitive and affective components of depression (e.g., negative mood and guilt) from the seven items that evaluate predominantly somatic components (e.g., appetite and sleep). Participants&#x02019; history of depression was assessed at baseline by questionnaire in response to the item: &#x0201c;Has a doctor or other health care provider ever said that you have depression?&#x0201d;</p><p>Twice annually for the first 4 years and then annually through year 10, participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), a self-report HRQoL measure with well-documented psychometric properties across a wide range of clinical and nonclinical populations (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The SF-36 provides eight subscale scores: general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain; mental health; role limitations due to emotional problems; vitality; and social functioning. Two summary norm-based T-scores (U.S. mean = 50, SD = 10) can also be derived from the SF-36: the physical component summary (PCS) score and mental component summary (MCS) score, with higher scores indicating more favorable HRQoL. The PCS score is derived from the first four subscales listed above, and the MCS from the last four subscales. Only the two summary scores were used in the present analyses, and only values from the annual assessments (at years 1&#x02013;10) were examined.</p><p>Participants brought all prescription medications to their annual assessment visits, at which study staff recorded medications used (but not dosages). Antidepressant medications (ADMs) were identified using the Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s classification system.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Analyses included all randomized participants according to intervention assignment (i.e., by intention to treat) and were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data were censored at 14 September 2012, the day the intervention was stopped by the National Institutes of Health on the recommendation of the Data and Safety and Monitoring Board. At this time in the trial, all study participants had reached the 8-year assessment of mood and HRQoL. By contrast, fewer than 40% had reached the 10-year assessment of HRQoL when the study was halted, resulting in a substantially smaller sample of participants at this time, compared with year 8. (The same was true of the 9-year assessment of HRQoL.)</p><p>We examined the effect of the intervention on the incidence of likely mild or greater depression (BDI &#x02265;10). Participants had to be free of the outcome at baseline to be included in the analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs from Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for clinic were compared between the two treatment groups using PROC PHREG. Time to event was defined as the time from randomization until the first occurrence of the outcome of interest. Proportional hazard assumptions were tested and met the criteria. Similar analyses were used to examine the potential incidence of worsening of depression symptoms (BDI score &#x02265;19) in participants who began the trial already reporting mild depression (BDI score = 10&#x02013;18).</p><p>Plots over time were constructed to assess the effect of the intervention on mean BDI, PCS, and MCS scores. Linear mixed longitudinal models controlling for clinic (the randomization stratification variable) were constructed using PROC MIXED to test the overall significance of treatment on these mean scores over time. Participants were treated as a random effect, and unstructured covariance structure techniques were used. Year-by-year differences in treatment effects were examined only when a significant treatment-by-time interaction existed.</p><p>Exploratory analyses (suggested during editorial review) examined the correlation among baseline BDI, PCS, and MCS scores to determine the extent to which the scales measured shared constructs. In addition, the ILI and DSE groups were compared on changes on the cognitive and somatic subscales of the BDI (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 5,145 participants were randomly assigned to treatment conditions (2,570 to ILI and 2,575 to DSE) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Subgroup analyses showed that in participants who at baseline had mild depression symptoms (BDI score of 10&#x02013;18), the lifestyle intervention did not increase the risk of progressing to moderate or greater depression symptoms (BDI score &#x02265;19). Instead, at the end of the first year, ILI participants who began the trial with mild or greater depression symptoms (BDI score &#x0003e;10) experienced substantial improvements in mood, with reductions in mean BDI scores from 14.1 to 8.8. Part of the improvement likely was attributable to the spontaneous remission of depression, typically observed in 3 to 12 months (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A similar (though more modest) pattern of improvement was observed the first year in comparable DSE participants, in whom mean BDI scores fell from 13.2 to 9.6.</p><p>The ILI&#x02019;s prevention of mild or greater depression symptoms has important public health implications, particularly for people with type 2 diabetes. According to the World Health Organization, unipolar depression was the third most important cause of disease burden worldwide in 2004 and the most important in middle- and high-income countries (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Depression is more prevalent among people with diabetes than it is in the general population. A study that included national samples reported that 6.1% of individuals without diabetes, and 9.3% of those with the condition, were currently depressed (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The combination of depression and diabetes leads to negative effects on self-care behaviors (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and glycemic control (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and ultimately increases morbidity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), mortality (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and health care costs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Reducing the risk of developing depression over 8 years in individuals with diabetes could thus have an important health impact.</p><p>A second principal finding of this study is that participating in ILI may mitigate the effects of aging on physical HRQoL. Epidemiological studies have consistently reported a decline in SF-36 PCS scores with age (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). None of these studies involved follow-up of &#x0003e;5 years, and none was restricted to overweight/obese individuals or to those with type 2 diabetes. The current study, which followed participants for a median of 9.6 years, also found that PCS scores declined (i.e., worsened) in both treatment arms. However, participants in the ILI arm experienced significantly less decline than those in DSE over the course of the study and at every year of follow-up through year 8. This ILI advantage is consistent with the findings of other lifestyle interventions of shorter duration in overweight/obese adults (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The lifestyle intervention, for example, in the Diabetes Prevention Program resulted in a mean 1.3 point increase in the PCS score at 1 year, as compared with a 0.04 decline in the placebo group.</p><p>Some investigators have suggested that people perceive a 3% difference in HRQoL scores (e.g., 1 to 1.5 T-score points on PCS) as beneficial or deleterious (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). By this criterion, the ILI, compared with DSE, produced a perceptible improvement in physical HRQoL over the first 8 years of follow-up. Other health professionals (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), however, have proposed that a 3 to 5 T-score point change on the PCS is required to be considered clinically meaningful, a magnitude which the ILI group only approached at year 1.</p><p>Slowing age-related decline in physical HRQoL has important public health implications, especially for individuals with diabetes. HRQoL is increasingly recognized as an essential measure of health status, especially in chronic diseases. An analysis of 118 studies found that SF-36 PCS scores were lower in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with U.S. population norms (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), suggesting that interventions that mitigate age-related decline in physical functioning may have substantial benefits for those with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The current study found no significant difference between the treatment and comparison arms in changes in mean MCS scores over the course of the study, a finding consistent with that from several similar trials (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We examined the mental health subscale of the MCS to see if there were statistically significant treatment effects for this subscale (i.e., results more similar to those for BDI score; we found no such effects). The SF-36 mental health subscale is more general than the BDI, assessing mental health issues other than depression (e.g., anxiety) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This view is supported by the moderate correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.49) between the MCS and BDI observed in the current study and suggests that the mental health benefits of the ILI intervention were specific to protection from developing significant symptoms of depression.</p><p>We similarly observed that the baseline PCS score correlated only moderately with both the full BDI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.34) and the BDI somatic subscale (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39). While the PCS and BDI somatic subscale assess some similar domains (e.g., worry about health), the PCS includes numerous items on specific physical abilities (e.g., walking stairs) and bodily pain, which the BDI does not include. Conversely, the BDI somatic subscale evaluates complaints about sleep, appetite, appearance, and sexual function&#x02014;hallmarks of depression&#x02014;which are not assessed by the PCS. While the ILI participants reported significantly greater improvements on both the PCS and the BDI somatic subscale at all assessments during the first 8 years, we believe that the two measures captured different aspects of participants&#x02019; psychosocial and physical function (as also suggested by the scales&#x02019; shared variance of only 15.2%). ILI as compared with DSE participants reported greater reductions on the BDI cognitive subscale only at year 1, the time when the ILI group experienced its greatest improvement on the full BDI score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Several aspects of the lifestyle intervention may have contributed to the reduced risk of depression and improved HRQoL observed in this study. These include the greater initial weight losses and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness achieved by ILI versus DSE participants (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). ILI participants also received extensive group and individual support that could have protected them from depression, as could their improvements in diabetes control and cardiovascular risk factors, which were generally greater in ILI than DSE participants during most of the trial (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A separate paper will examine the factors that potentially mediated the reported improvements in depression and physical quality of life, as well as explore the relationships between initial depression level, changes in depression over time, and subsequent weight change. As reported previously, among ILI participants who began the study free of symptoms of depression (BDI score &#x0003c;10), those who experienced incident depression at 1 year lost significantly less weight at this time than their ILI counterparts who remained free of a mood disorder (mean losses of 4.6 vs. 9.0% of initial weight, respectively). By contrast, ILI participants who began the study with mild or greater symptoms of depression (BDI score &#x0003e;10) lost only marginally (though significantly) less weight at 1 year than ILI participants who were free of baseline depression (mean losses of 7.8 vs. 8.7%, respectively) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of the current study include its large racially/ethnically diverse population, long duration of intervention, excellent participant retention, and use of well-validated questionnaires. Study limitations include that all participants had type 2 diabetes, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings to populations without diabetes (although our results are similar to those observed in earlier trials of nondiabetic individuals) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Participants also generally had average to good mental health, as indicated by their BDI and MCS scores, thus raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to populations with a greater mental health burden. Our study would have been improved by the use of a structured clinical interview to evaluate depression (which also was conducted at all annual assessment visits). Alternatively, we could have administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), which, unlike the BDI-1A, evaluates multiple domains needed to diagnosis major depressive disorder according to recognized criteria (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Other study limitations included our not determining the dose of ADMs used and not identifying reasons other than depression that participants may have taken ADMs (e.g., anxiety, neuropathy). In addition, quality of life was assessed in fewer than 40% of participants at year 10, the approximate percentage of persons who, based on their date of enrollment in the trial, had been eligible to complete this assessment when the intervention was stopped in September 2012.</p><p>In summary, participation in an ILI, designed to produce weight loss, protected overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes from developing mild or greater symptoms of depression, as well as reductions in HRQoL. Clinicians may want to take these findings into account when evaluating the potential benefits of behavioral weight loss treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
