The subjects received one of the following four treatments in each period: a single dose of 20, 40, 80 mg eletriptan HBr or a repeated oral dose of 40 mg 2 h apart. Blood samples were collected before and up to 26 h after dosing for quantification of plasma eletriptan concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem&#x02013;mass spectrometry. The PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods. Ethnicity differences between Korean and non-Korean subjects were identified using geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of dose-normalized maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 h to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After single-dose administration of eletriptan HBr to Korean subjects, the mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> increased linearly with dose.

The prevalence of migraine is relatively high: about 15%&#x02013;18% in women and 6% in men.<xref rid="b1-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For effective treatment of migraine, it is necessary to understand its pathophysiology. A proposed theory on migraine pathophysiology is the neurovascular theory, which is characterized by a cascade of events involving various combinations of neurologic, autonomic, and gastrointestinal changes.<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists can arrest the pathophysiological cascade; therefore, various agonists, which are collectively called triptans, have been developed for clinical use.</p><p>According to the neurovascular theory described above, triptamine-based drugs such as triptans elicit their effects on migraine patients through intracranial vasoconstriction, in addition to the inhibition of neuropeptide release,<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which ultimately relieves the acute migraine symptoms. The triptans currently available and widely used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in Korea are naratriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan. As a potent and selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, eletriptan hydrobromide (eletriptan HBr) acts selectively on the carotid region of 5-HT receptors<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> instead of the coronary arteries.<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability profiles of eletriptan HBr in Koreans were undetermined and not yet approved in Korea. By comparing with the results of a previous head-to-head comparative study with sumatriptan<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and double-blind single-attack studies with naratriptan<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and zolmitriptan,<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> eletriptan HBr was found to show a more rapid onset of efficacy.</p><p>Owing to the presence of greater lipophilic characteristics than other triptans, eletriptan HBr has relatively higher bioavailability (~50%) and volume of distribution. The peak plasma concentrations in non-Korean healthy subjects occurred between 1 and 1.5 h after dosing (time required to reach maximum plasma concentration [T<sub>max</sub>]), and in migraine patients with an acute migraine attack, the median T<sub>max</sub> occurred at 2 h.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Approximately 85% of eletriptan HBr was protein bound with an elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) ranging from 4.8 to 7 h in healthy subjects, and the half-life was unaffected by sex, race, age, or menstrual cycle phases in female subjects.<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Only 10% of eletriptan is cleared through the renal pathway, about 80% is eliminated via hepatic demethylation by CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and 10% by CYP2D6.<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Eletriptan HBr is approved in the United States and Japan at recommended single doses of 20, 40, 80 mg or repeated doses of 40 mg if required, with a maximum daily dose of 80 mg. However, the PK and tolerability profiles of eletriptan HBr in Koreans were undetermined, and the medication is not yet approved in Korea.</p><p>We performed a clinical study with the objective of evaluating the PK and tolerability profiles of eletriptan HBr in healthy Korean subjects and compared it with those reported previously in non-Koreans.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study drug, ethics approval, and consent to participate</title><p>Eletriptan HBr 20 mg as a 20 mg tablet, 40 mg as a 40 mg tablet, and 80 mg as two 40 mg tablets were administered for the assessment of PK and tolerability to healthy Korean subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.

Sixteen subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years were randomized into four treatment groups; a single oral dose of 20, 40, or 80 mg, and a 2 h apart repeated oral dose of 40 mg of eletriptan HBr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-12-331">Figure 1</xref>). The subjects had at least a 46-h washout period between the doses in each period. The study drugs were orally administered under fasting conditions, with 240 mL of water.</p><p>All subjects were admitted to the Clinical Trials Center a day before dosing, and they were required to fast for at least 8 h prior to dosing. During the entire study period, the subjects were restricted from taking any concomitant medication or beverages containing xanthine or alcohol.</p><p>For the determination of plasma eletriptan concentrations, blood samples (6 mL) were serially collected in tubes containing lithium heparin prior to dosing and at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 h after dosing for the single-dose treatment groups. For the repeated-dose group of 40 mg, the blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 26 h after dosing.

The lower and upper limits of quantification were 0.5 and 250 ng/mL, respectively, and the calibration curve of the method was linear over this range. Where necessary, samples were diluted with normal human plasma to bring the concentration within the calibration range. Calibration standards were prepared by spiking blank plasma samples with known amounts of eletriptan ranging from 0.5 to 250 ng/mL. The accuracy (expressed as the percentage difference from the theoretical concentration) of the quality control samples used during the sample analysis ranged from &#x02212;2.0% to 4.7% with a precision (expressed as the coefficient of variation) of &#x02264; 9.7%.</p></sec><sec><title>PK evaluation and ethnic comparison</title><p>The plasma concentrations of eletriptan with time after the dose were analyzed. The following PK parameters for each treatment group (20, 40, 80 mg, and two 40 mg repeated dose, 2 h apart) were analyzed: maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), T<sub>max</sub>, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 h to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, where t is the last time point with a measurable concentration), area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>), and the elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>). The AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The observed concentrations and times were used to estimate the C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of eletriptan. AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> was calculated as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> + C<sub>t</sub>/&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>, where C<sub>t</sub> is the last measured concentration and &#x003bb;<sub>z</sub> is the elimination rate constant calculated using linear regression of the log-linear portion of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve. The t<sub>1/2</sub> was calculated as ln (2)/&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>. All the PK parameters were estimated using Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (version 6.3; Certara USA Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA). For evaluating the dose linearity of eletriptan HBr in Korean subjects, the dose-normalized mean differences of C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of dose-normalized geometric means and 90% CIs.</p><p>The current PK of eletriptan HBr in Koreans were compared with the data of non-Koreans published in 2002<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> for an ethnic comparison between the two populations.

In addition, the PK characteristics of the repeated dose of 40 mg 2 h apart were assessed.

This phenomenon may have occurred owing to the enterohepatic recirculation of eletriptan, which is mainly eliminated via metabolism by the liver CYP enzymes<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and through bile acid secretion after food intake, which was done 4 h after dosing; eletriptan HBr undergoes extensive biliary excretion.<xref rid="b16-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The already absorbed eletriptan is reintroduced into the gastrointestinal tract via the bile. As a result, the systemic exposure of eletriptan rises. This reabsorption from the bile contributes toward the formation of shoulders and double-peaked characteristics of the PK profiles.<xref rid="b17-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Such PK characteristics were often observed in previous studies.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The point estimates of dose-normalized C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> were also similar in Korean and non-Korean subjects after single oral doses of eletriptan HBr (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-12-331">Table 2</xref>). Sensitivity to ethnic differences evaluated in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization E5 guideline, Appendix D, would be expected to be low.<xref rid="b19-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Low sensitivity to ethnic factors of eletriptan HBr was estimated using the known characteristics such as relatively high bioavailability,<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> metabolism distributed among multiple pathways,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and linear PK in previous non-Korean studies and the present Korean study.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b15-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Currently, there is no evidence that the onset of migraine pattern differs in Korean and the non-Korean patients. In addition, no differences in dosage and corresponding effects have been reported in Korean and non-Korean subjects for other triptan drugs so far.<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The quantitative relationships between the exposure of eletriptan (PK) and the drug-driven effects (pharmacodynamics) observed in migraine patients have been well established in previous studies.<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus, we deduce that the clinical efficacy in Korean migraine patients will be similar to that in non-Korean patients at same dosage.</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs were nausea and headache, in the 20 mg and 40 mg single dose-groups, respectively, and chest discomfort from a single subject was the only moderate AE reported in 80 mg single-dose and 40 mg repeated-dose groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-12-331">Table 3</xref>). Based upon the absence of serious AEs, dose reductions or discontinuations due to reported AEs, eletriptan HBr was considered both safe and well tolerated after single administration within the dose range of 20&#x02013;80 mg, as well as after repeated administration of 40 mg 2 h apart in healthy male subjects.</p><p>In summary, PK and tolerability in Korean subjects were comparable to those in the non-Korean subjects after single and repeated doses of eletriptan HBr. Although the present study has been performed in healthy male volunteers, the similar PK and tolerability profiles shown between the healthy and migraine patients in the previous non-Korean subject studies<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and known evidence of eletriptan PK being unaffected by sex<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-331" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> suggests that different sex and patient status are factors unlikely to alter the conclusions reached from the healthy subjects in this study. From this evidence for low sensitivity to ethnic factors, dosage regimens identical to those for non-Korean patients may be suggested for Korean patients without further confirmatory study in Korean migraine patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Eletriptan HBr showed linear PK and was well tolerated in Korean subjects. The observed PK and tolerability were similar to those of non-Korean subjects. Therefore, we suggest that the same dosage regimen of eletriptan HBr may be recommended for Korean as well as non-Korean patients with migraine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The first author (Yu Kyong Kim) received a scholarship from the BK21-plus education program provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea.
