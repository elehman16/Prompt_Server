Both HIV and HCV can also be transmitted from mother to child during birth or through breastfeeding. Viral infection can also occur in rare circumstances when virally infected bodily fluids come into contact with a noninfected person&#x02019;s bloodstream, mucous membranes, or damaged tissue such as through use of contaminated needles or other medical equipment, transfusion of virally contaminated blood or blood products, or various other routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Coinfection with both HIV and HCV is not uncommon because of shared transmission modes. Globally, approximately 7 million people are thought to be coinfected with both HIV and HCV and, in the United States, about one-quarter to one-third of HIV-infected individuals are estimated to be coinfected with HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Infection with HCV can result in long-term illness and death, and viral hepatitis progresses faster and causes more liver-related health problems among people living with HIV than among those without HIV infection. Although combination antiretroviral therapy has extended the life expectancy of people with HIV, liver disease has become the leading cause of non-AIDS-related deaths in this population, and HIV-infected people coinfected with HCV are at increased risk for serious, life-threatening complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Treatment for HCV infection has made remarkable progress in the last several years, from treatments with relatively low cure rates that typically included pegylated interferon alfa in combination with ribavirin, to all-oral, direct-acting antiviral regimens that produce sustained viral responses with cure rates exceeding 90&#x000a0;% for many patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Dolutegravir (DTG, Tivicay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, ViiV Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC) is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in a broad patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Daclatasvir (DCV, Daklinza<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) is an inhibitor of the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in combination with other medicinal products across genotypes 1, 3, and 4 for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults and by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 3 infection in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because DTG and DCV may be concomitantly administered in subjects coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV, a drug interaction study between DTG and DCV was warranted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of both drugs, as well as patient safety and drug tolerability when these drugs are coadministered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>This was an open-label, 3-period, crossover study conducted at a single-center in healthy adult subjects. The study protocol, amendments, and consent forms were reviewed and approved prior to study initiation by the study site&#x02019;s institutional review board (Quintiles Early Clinical Development, Overland Park, KS, USA), and all subjects provided their written consent prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures. The study was conducted in a manner consistent with good clinical practices and local regulatory requirements and in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments,</p><p>Adult men and women ranging from 18 to 65&#x000a0;years of age with a body mass index ranging from 18.5 to 31.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (inclusive) and no clinically significant abnormalities on the basis of physical examination, laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and medical history were eligible for study inclusion. Eligible female subjects had negative results on human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy tests. Male or female subjects who were not surgically sterile/postmenopausal agreed to use nonhormonal contraceptive methods, including abstinence, an intrauterine device, or 2 forms of barrier contraception. Excluded subjects were those with a preexisting condition that interfered with normal gastrointestinal motility or anatomy; as well as subjects with hepatic dysfunction or renal dysfunction, or both that could have interfered with the study drugs&#x02019; absorption, metabolism, or excretion. Subjects were excluded if they had an average weekly alcoholic beverage intake of more than 14 drinks for males or more than 7 drinks for females within 6&#x000a0;months of the study start. Exclusion criteria also included the regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6&#x000a0;months prior to screening; or a positive test for HCV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV antibody. Eligible subjects were prohibited from ingesting any prescription or nonprescription drugs, including herbal and dietary supplements and vitamins within 30&#x000a0;days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product, whichever was longer, before the first dose of study medication.</p><p>Twelve healthy male or female subjects were enrolled to provide data from at least 10 evaluable subjects. The sample size of 12 to obtain 10 evaluable subjects was chosen based on an expected withdrawal rate of approximately 10&#x000a0;% and the within-subject variability of DTG. Within-subject variability of DCV, based upon historical data, is lower than that of DTG. Using a within-subject variability (CVw) of 30&#x000a0;% and a sample size of 10 evaluable subjects, it was estimated that the precision for the treatment comparison would be within 25.8&#x000a0;% of the point estimate for the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC<sub>[0-&#x003c4;]</sub>), C<sub>max</sub>, and C<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>. If the point estimate of the ratio of geometric means was 1, then the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval would be approximately 0.79 to 1.26. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment sequences (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 in each sequence) according to a randomization schedule. Study medications were DTG as a 50-mg tablet given once daily and DCV as a 60-mg tablet given once daily. Subjects in sequence 1 received DTG for 5&#x000a0;days in period 1 (treatment A), followed by DCV for 5&#x000a0;days in period 2 (treatment B), and finally DTG plus DCV for 5&#x000a0;days in period 3 (treatment C). Those in sequence 2 received DCV (treatment B) for 5&#x000a0;days in period 1, followed by DTG (treatment A) for 5&#x000a0;days in period 2, and then DTG plus DCV for 5&#x000a0;days in period 3 (treatment C). All doses of study drug were ingested under fasting conditions. Between period 1 and period 2, there was a washout period of at least 7&#x000a0;days. There was no washout period between period 2 and period 3. Day 1 of period 3 started the day after the last day in period 2. Periods 1, 2, and 3 were conducted on an inpatient setting. Within 7 to 14&#x000a0;days after the last dose of study drug was taken, a follow-up visit was conducted.</p><p>The safety evaluations performed during the study included clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign monitoring, and physical examinations. Electrocardiograms were performed at screening. Throughout the entire treatment phase and at the follow-up evaluation, there was close monitoring for all adverse events (AEs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><p>Blood samples were collected (2&#x000a0;mL per collection) at predose (within 15&#x000a0;min prior to dosing) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h postdose on day 5 in period 1 or 2 and in period 3 for the determination of plasma concentrations of DTG. Blood samples were collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of DCV using the same sample collection schedule as was used in prior drug-drug interaction studies with DCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which was 4&#x000a0;mL per collection at predose (within 15&#x000a0;min prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24&#x000a0;h postdose on day 5 in period 1 or 2 and in period 3. Blood samples were drawn into potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K<sub>2</sub> EDTA)-containing tubes via venipuncture or through a cannula and were kept chilled on ice until centrifugation. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C within 45&#x000a0;min of sample collection and stored at&#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or below until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Bioanalytical methods</title><p>Plasma samples were analyzed for DTG concentrations by PPD (Middleton, WI). All samples were received frozen on dry ice and in acceptable condition and stored frozen at&#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C upon arrival. The DTG analysis was done using a validated analytical method based on protein precipitation using acetonitrile, which was followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis using positive-ion electrospray, which was based on previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

No pattern of AE frequency was seen with respect to treatment, and none of the AEs were grade 2 or greater in severity or were considered to be drug-related. Two AEs were reported by subjects when taking DTG alone, 1 AE was reported by a subject taking DCV alone, and 2 AEs were reported when DTG and DCV were taken concurrently. Only 1 AE, headache, was reported more than once and it was reported 3 times, once with each treatment. There were no consistent, treatment-related, or clinically significant changes in median or mean clinical chemistry or hematology values observed in this study, and no clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram results or vital signs. After period 3 had been completed and during the follow-up visit, one African-American male subject had a grade 2 glucose measurement of 8.05&#x000a0;mmol/L (144.9&#x000a0;mg/dL). This subject, on one prior measurement during period 2, day&#x02212;1, had a grade 1 glucose elevation of 6.22&#x000a0;mmol/L (112&#x000a0;mg/dL) that occurred after he completed DCV dosing and before he received DTG.

This result is consistent with the preclinical findings for DCV and DTG. Daclatasvir is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In vitro, DTG demonstrates minimal or no direct inhibition of CYP isozymes or of P-gp; and DTG is not considered an inducer of CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Coadministration of DTG with DCV increased DTG AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and C<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> by approximately 33, 29, and 45&#x000a0;%, respectively, compared with DTG administered alone. Dolutegravir is metabolized primarily through UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 with a minor component (~10&#x000a0;%) via CYP3A4 and is a substrate of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Daclatasvir is an inhibitor of some transporters, including P-gp, and BCRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which provides a reasonable mechanistic explanation of the effect on DTG plasma exposure from the current study. However, the effect of DCV on increasing DTG plasma exposure is not considered clinically significant and does not confer significant safety risks as the increased DTG levels remain in the range previously observed in the dose-ranging clinical trial with HIV-1-infected subjects. In that trial, which evaluated 2, 10, and 50&#x000a0;mg once-daily DTG dosing, the ratios for AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and C<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> after 10&#x000a0;days of administration were estimated to be 1.25 to 1.43, 1.23 to 1.40, and 1.27 to 1.42, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Similarly, in the VIKING-3 and&#x02212;4 studies, integrase-resistant, HIV-infected patients received 50&#x000a0;mg of DTG twice daily, and predose (C0) DTG concentrations were obtained at day 8 and at weeks 4 and 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The geometric mean and between-subject CV% for the DTG C0 in VIKING-4 was 1.80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (123&#x000a0;%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) at day 28 and 2.05&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (127&#x000a0;%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) at week 24; comparable to those observed in VIKING-3 at week 4 (1.90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml [113&#x000a0;%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;161]) and week 24 (2.14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml [93&#x000a0;%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;134]). There have been no apparent differences in safety profiles across DTG doses evaluated in phase IIb/III studies, and DTG is well tolerated in HIV-1-infected subjects, with no dose-limiting toxicity observed to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An upper limit of exposure associated with an increased incidence of AEs or significant clinical chemistry toxicity has not been identified. As a result, no DTG dose adjustment is necessary when it is coadministered with DCV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, since DTG and DCV were well tolerated when given alone or in combination and no clinically significant increases in plasma exposure for either drug were observed, these results indicate that DTG and DCV can be coadministered without dose adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE, adverse event; AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;,</sub> area under the concentration-time curve over a dosing interval; BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein; C0, predose DTG concentrations; CI, confidence interval; CL/F, apparent clearance following oral dosing; C<sub>max,</sub> maximum observed concentration; CV, coefficient of variance; CVw, within-subject variability; CYP, cytochrome P450; C<sub>&#x003c4;,</sub> concentration at the end of the dosing interval; DCV, daclatasvir; DTG, dolutegravir; HCV, hepatitis C virus; K<sub>2</sub> EDTA, potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; PK, pharmacokinetic; QC, quality control; SD, standard deviation; t<sub>1/2,</sub> terminal phase half-life</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Co-authors&#x02019; are Ivy H.
