Here, we studied whether chloroquine can be replaced by mefloquine, which is the only other licensed anti-malarial chemoprophylactic drug that does not affect pre-erythrocytic stages, exposure to which is considered essential for induction of protection by CPS immunization. In a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial, volunteers under either chloroquine prophylaxis (CPS-CQ, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) or mefloquine prophylaxis (CPS-MQ, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) received three sub-optimal CPS immunizations by bites from eight <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infected mosquitoes each, at monthly intervals. Four control volunteers received mefloquine prophylaxis and bites from uninfected mosquitoes. CPS-MQ immunization is safe and equally potent compared to CPS-CQ inducing protection in 7/10 (70%) versus 3/5 (60%) volunteers, respectively. Furthermore, specific antibody levels and cellular immune memory responses were comparable between both groups. We therefore conclude that mefloquine and chloroquine are equally effective in CPS-induced immune responses and protection.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01422954">NCT01422954</ext-link>

Anti-disease immunity against malaria is not easily induced: in endemic areas this takes many years of repeated exposure to develop <xref rid="pone.0112910-Doolan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and sterile protection against infection does not seem to be induced at all <xref rid="pone.0112910-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

Subjects, investigators and primary outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation. Subjects in the CPS-CQ group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) received a standard prophylactic regimen of chloroquine consisting of a loading dose of 300 mg on the first and fourth day and subsequently 300 mg once a week for 12 weeks. Subjects in the CPS-MQ group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) and the control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) received mefloquine prophylaxis starting with a loading split dose regimen to limit potential side-effects: 125 mg twice per week for a duration of 3 weeks and subsequently 250 mg once a week for 12 weeks. Chloroquine and mefloquine were administered as capsules, indistinguishable from each other. During this period all subjects were exposed to the bites of 8 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes three times at monthly intervals, starting 22 days after start of mefloquine prophylaxis and 8 days after start of chloroquine prophylaxis. Volunteers in the CPS-CQ and CPS-MQ groups received bites from mosquitoes infected with the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 strain, control subjects received bites from uninfected mosquitoes. The immunization dose was based on our previous dose-de-escalation trial <xref rid="pone.0112910-Bijker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and aimed to establish partial protection in the CPS-CQ group in order to enable detection of either improved or reduced protection in the CPS-MQ group. Sample sizes were calculated based on the expected difference of 4 days in prepatent period between the CPS-CQ and CPS-MQ groups, a standard deviation of 1.6 and 2.3 days respectively, an &#x003b1; of 5% and a power of 0.90. This calculation resulted in a CPS-CQ group of 4 and a CPS-MQ group of 8 subjects. To account for possible dropouts based on (perceived) side effects we included one and two extra volunteers in the CPS-CQ and CPS-MQ groups respectively. The control group was included as infectivity control for the challenge infection.</p><fig id="pone-0112910-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112910.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study flow diagram.</title><p>Thirty-six subjects were screened for eligibility, of whom twenty were included in the trial and randomized over three groups.

After this challenge-infection, all subjects were checked twice daily on an outpatient basis from day 5 up until day 15 and once daily from day 16 up until day 21 for symptoms and signs of malaria. Thick blood smears for parasite detection were made during each of these visits after challenge, hematological and cardiovascular markers were assessed daily. As soon as parasites were detected by thick smear, subjects were treated with a standard curative regimen of 1000 mg atovaquone and 400 mg proguanil once daily for three days according to Dutch national malaria treatment guidelines. If subjects remained thick smear negative, they were presumptively treated with the same curative regimen on day 21 after challenge infection. All subjects were followed closely for 3 days after initiation of treatment and complete cure was confirmed by two negative blood smears after the last treatment dose.

This interval is similar to previous CHMI studies with the NF54 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain in the absence of prophylactic drug levels <xref rid="pone.0112910-Bijker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112910-Roestenberg4" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; ii) the two volunteers with the highest mefloquine levels (116 and 77 &#x000b5;g/L) were control subjects who became thick smear positive with only a minimal delay in patency within the time-frame of historical controls <xref rid="pone.0112910-Roestenberg5" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; iii) plasma chloroquine and mefloquine levels at C-1 were in all volunteers well below the minimum therapeutic concentration (CQ: 30 &#x000b5;g/L <xref rid="pone.0112910-Rombo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>) or the concentration at which breakthrough infections are observed in non-immune people (MQ&#x0003c;406&#x02013;603 &#x000b5;g/L <xref rid="pone.0112910-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>). iv) We cannot rule out that protected subjects experienced transient parasitemia after challenge, which was cleared in the first blood-stage cycle by remaining drug levels. But because parasitemia was not detected by qPCR in any of the protected subjects at any time point after challenge potential parasitemia must have been below the qPCR detection limit of 35 parasites/ml, indicating a reduction of at least 92% in liver load, given a geometric mean height of the first peak or parasitemia in non-immune historical controls of 456 parasites/ml <xref rid="pone.0112910-Roestenberg5" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; v) None of the protected subjects showed a boost in anti-MSP-1 antibodies after challenge while all unprotected subjects did, suggesting that protected subjects did not experience blood-stage parasitemia after challenge. <xref rid="pone.0112910-Bijker2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. From these combined data we believe that remaining drug concentrations are unlikely to have contributed to the observed protection, although this cannot be formally excluded.</p><p>A review of rodent studies using different attenuation methods for whole sporozoite immunization shows that increased development of the parasite in the liver, but absence of blood-stage parasitemia during immunization is associated with the highest protective efficacy <xref rid="pone.0112910-NganouMakamdop1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It would therefore be interesting to investigate CPS immunization with alternative antimalarials with varying targets in the parasite life cycle. CPS immunization with causal prophylactic drugs affecting liver-stages, e.g. primaquine, will likely results in a reduction of AEs because of reduced or absent blood-stage exposure. Whether antigen-exposure is sufficient to induce protection when the liver-stage is abrogated, remains to be answered.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that immunization of healthy volunteers under mefloquine prophylaxis with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites is safe, immunogenic and protective. These findings could have important implications for malaria vaccine development and further development of CPS approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112910.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
