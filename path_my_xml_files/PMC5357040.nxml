We examined whether valspodar, a selective inhibitor of the ATP binding cassette B1 transporter (ABCB1, a.k.a., p-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein-1) used in the neoadjuvant setting would sensitize LPCs to doxorubicin and extend the length of remission in dogs with therapy na&#x000ef;ve large B-cell lymphoma. Twenty dogs were enrolled into a double-blinded, placebo controlled study where experimental and control groups received oral valspodar (7.5 mg/kg) or placebo, respectively, twice daily for five days followed by five treatments with doxorubicin 21 days apart with a reduction in the first dose to mitigate the potential side effects of ABCB1 inhibition. Lymph node and blood LPCs were quantified at diagnosis, on the fourth day of neoadjuvant period, and 1-week after the first chemotherapy dose. Valspodar therapy was well tolerated. There were no differences between groups in total LPCs in lymph nodes or peripheral blood, nor in event-free survival or overall survival. Overall, we conclude that valspodar can be administered safely in the neoadjuvant setting for canine B-cell lymphoma; however, its use to attenuate ABCB1

We agree that valspodar is not cytotoxic and should not cause a reduction in LPCs by itself. Rather, our prediction was that by reducing the activity of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) proteins, valspodar would sensitize LPCs to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin.&#x000a0; We expected doxorubicin treatment to induce rapid clinical remission with consequent lymphoid necrosis and lymphodepletion of malignant nodes. Thus, we felt that quantification of LPCs from this nodal environment would be challenging. Instead, we decided to measure depletion of LPCs in peripheral blood as a surrogate measure of valspodar-induced sensitization to doxorubicin. As noted in the materials and methods section, blood was collected from each dog on day 11 of the study, seven days after administration of doxorubicin.&#x000a0; We believe this was a reasonable time point for sampling blood to investigate whether circulating LPCs were sensitized by the neoadjuvant valsopodar and depleted by doxorubicin treatment in treated dogs as compared to controls. From our results, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis; that is,&#x000a0;the data do not demonstrate that combined treatment with valspodar and doxorubicin selectively depletes LPCs relative to doxorubicin plus placebo treatment. Based on the reviewers' suggestions, we re-analyzed the RNA sequencing data. We identified&#x000a0;differential changes over time in lymph node samples from dogs treated with placebo and from dogs treated with valspodar. However, the differentially expressed genes were driven by a few samples in each group and there were no global (genome-wide) changes in gene expression that could be attributed to the drug or to time. This is not entirely unexpected, as on average the LPCs comprised less than 3% of the lymph node cells.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The importance of tumor-propagating cells in the pathogenesis of cancer is becoming increasingly well recognized
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. However, there are only a few reports supporting the existence of such cells in human lymphoma cell lines or in transgenic lymphoma mouse models
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Our group identified a subset of lymphoid progenitor cells (LPCs) in primary canine B-cell lymphomas that were characterized by co-expression of hematopoietic progenitor antigens CD34, CD117, and CD133, the B-lymphoid lineage marker CD22, and the common leukocyte antigen CD45
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These LPCs had phenotypic properties consistent with tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating cells (TIC/TPC); they also persisted in the xenotransplantation setting, suggesting that they were relevant to the biology of this disease
<italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. When compared with the bulk of the tumor cells, LPCs showed significantly lower expression of 44 genes across the genome, mapping to cell cycle and transmembrane signaling pathways
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This indicated that LPCs exhibit the characteristic &#x0201c;slow proliferation&#x0201d; seen in normal bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells and in TIC/TPC in other cancers.</p><p>One common feature of TIC/TPC in solid tumors is the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins such as ABCB1 (multidrug resistance protein-1 or P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein)
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. ABC transporter proteins confer drug resistance by actively transporting drugs from the intracellular space to the extracellular space, thereby preventing the interaction of these drugs with their intracellular targets. In the case of ABCB1, expression has been shown to confer resistance to vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins, and other drugs
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>Genome-wide gene expression profiling data showed that mRNAs for ABCB1 and ABCG2 were expressed in several types of spontaneous canine lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Valspodar (PSC-833) is a selective ABC transporter inhibitor with an acceptable safety profile. Specifically, valspodar had acceptable toxicity when given alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in Phase I/II clinical trials in humans with several types of cancer and in one study of dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma treated with doxorubicin
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles made valspodar an attractive candidate for targeting LPCs, especially because a safe protocol had been previously established for its neoadjuvant use to inhibit ABCB1 in dogs receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Three large, double blinded, randomized phase-3 clinical trials have been reported using valspodar in combination with chemotherapy to treat people with cancer. One targeted patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, another was done in women with stage IV or suboptimally debulked stage III ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and the third enrolled newly diagnosed patients under 60 years old with acute myeloid leukemia
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The addition of valspodar did not improve objective results in any of these studies, and it generally enhanced toxicity associated with chemotherapy. However, none of the studies evaluated whether valspodar sensitized specific cell subpopulations within the tumors, including TICs or TPCs, to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.</p><p>We designed this study specifically to test that question; that is, whether neoadjuvant valspodar treatment would enhance the sensitivity of LPCs to doxorubicin in dogs with spontaneous large B-cell lymphomas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Supplies and reagents</title><p>Clinical grade valspodar (PSC-833) was provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Valspodar was compounded for use in pet dogs by Custom Rx Compounding Pharmacy (Roy D. Katz R. Ph., Richfield, MN). Capsules containing 100 mg valspodar or placebo (compounding materials without valspodar) were formulated with the same method used to compound cyclosporine-A for oral use in dogs, since these compounds share a high degree of structural similarity. Activity of the compounded valspodar was confirmed using the side population assays described below.

Samples passed a QC step if they contained &#x0003e;1 &#x000b5;g with a RIN &#x0003e;8. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq, 50-bp paired-end) with HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) was done at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (UMGC) in 14-paired (pre- and post-treatment) samples and two additional pre-treatment samples as described

<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The &#x00394;LPC was calculated as the ratio of LPCs at Day 4 over LPCs at Day 0. The Mann-Whitney Test (Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used to determine significance between LPC numbers in lymph nodes from dogs in the experimental treatment and in the control groups. The associations between variables were determined using the Pearson correlation. Differences between groups in duration of remission and overall survival were determined using Kaplan-Meier probability and log-rank tests. The proportion of LPCs in peripheral blood was calculated by conservatively gating on CD22/&#x0201c;Progenitor mix&#x0201d; double positive cells identified in two-dimensional scatter plots. However, the very low numbers of LPCs detected in peripheral blood and the presence of random effects (significant intra- and inter-dog variation in light scatter parameters characterizing LPC cells shape and size) made a direct comparison of the identified proportions between dogs challenging.

Blood LPCs were also quantified for each dog 7 days after doxorubicin treatment (Day 11). The distribution of lymph node LPCs at diagnosis was narrower in the dogs that received valspodar than in the control dogs (

Our results confirmed the previous observation from Cagliero
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> showing that valspodar can be safely administered to dogs twice daily at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Furthermore, we verified that CD22
<sup>+</sup>/CD34
<sup>+</sup>/CD117
<sup>+</sup>/CD133
<sup>+</sup> LPCs constitute between 0.3 &#x02013; 2% of lymph node B cells. The narrow conservative gating required due to high inter-sample variability identified the LPC frequencies in peripheral blood at a level of ~1 per 10
<sup>6</sup> to 1 per 5 &#x000d7; 10
<sup>6</sup> cells. The observation that these cells are virtually undetectable in lymph node samples from healthy dogs, while they exist in a steady state in canine B-cell lymphomas even in the xenotransplantation setting
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, suggests that they contribute to the maintenance or propagation of the tumor population. However, we were unable to demonstrate that combined treatment with valspodar and doxorubicin selectively depletes LPCs relative to doxorubicin plus placebo treatment.</p><p>Upregulation of ABC transporters is a well-described mechanism of acquired drug resistance in lymphoma and other cancers, making these proteins attractive targets for pharmacologic modulation
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. These proteins are transport channels that extrude a variety of compounds, including xenobiotics, from cells. Cells expressing these proteins have been defined functionally as &#x0201c;side populations&#x0201d; based on their ability to exclude fluorescent dyes in flow cytometric assays. The possibility that increased expression of ABCB1 and other transporters was due to selection of cells intrinsically possessing this trait, as opposed to through
<italic>de novo</italic> induction of expression, was proposed more than 20 years ago
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and recapitulated most recently in canine lymphomas
<italic>in vitro</italic> through drug selection, with expansion of a valspodar-sensitive subclone that had increased expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.</p><p>&#x0201c;Side populations&#x0201d; are routinely detectable in canine lymphomas
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. In that study, 0.1 to 4% of cells in the canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines GL-1 and 17&#x02013;71 excluded Hoechst 33342 and expressed detectable levels of ABCB1 and ABCB2. A dye-excluding side population was also variably detectable in five primary lymphomas. GL-1 cells and one of the lymphoma samples expressed a form of ABCB1 with slower electrophoretic mobility, possibly representing the active, phosphorylated form of this transporter
<sup><xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. ABCG2 was expressed ubiquitously in GL-1 cells and in the five primary lymphomas. However, the side population identified by Kim and colleagues was insensitive to verapamil and to fumitremorgin-C
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, suggesting that the dye exclusion activity might have been mediated by an ABC transporter distinct from ABCB1 and ABCG2.</p><p>The notion that cells expressing ABC transporters can behave like cancer stem cells in lymphomas is not universally accepted. Indeed, the existence of tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating cells (TIC/TPC) or of a hierarchical organization in lymphoid malignancies at all remains a matter of debate
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. In acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), models for cells of origin have been proposed, including common hematopoietic progenitors, common lymphoid progenitors, and committed B-lymphoid cells, depending largely upon the molecular subtype of ALL. In preliminary experiments, samples from two human patients with ALL included a subset of CD117
<sup>+</sup> cells that were present at a similar frequency to LPCs in canine lymphoma (D. Ito and J. Modiano, unpublished results); however, the functional significance of this finding remains to be determined. The evidence for TIC/TPC in solid lymphomas is even more sparse. Drug-resistant TIC/TPCs were defined in follicular lymphoma using side population assays and increased expression of ABCG2
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Tumor formation in these cells was limited by an obligate interaction with follicular dendritic cells in the microenvironment niche, which was mediated through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor. TIC/TPC were similarly identified using side population assays in a mouse model of mantle cell lymphoma
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and more recently in human anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive and -negative anaplastic large cell lymphomas
<sup><xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.</p><p>Next generation sequencing and genome-wide epigenomic analyses of human DLBCL have revealed a potential mechanism to explain how lymphoid cells might acquire TIC/TPC properties and how this acquisition could be related to the expression of ABC transporters. The gene encoding the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) had gain of function mutations in 7/49 (14%) DLBCL patients sequenced
<sup><xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that functions as part of the polycomb group complex, which controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation
<sup><xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. In germinal center (GC) B cells, EZH2 appears to suppress differentiation genes and favor behavior that resembles stem cells
<sup><xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. As in GC DLBCL cells, depletion of EZH2 in Bel/Fu hepatocellular carcinoma cells inhibited proliferation, but in Bel/Fu cells this depletion also increased methylation at the ABCB1 gene, reduced ABCB1 gene and protein expression
<sup><xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, and showed consequent sensitization of these cells to the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil
<sup><xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Together, these findings provide a strong rationale for the use of neoadjuvant therapies to sensitize TIC/TPCs in lymphoma using ABC transporter inhibitors, at least in a subset of GC DLBCL.</p><p>Nonetheless, clinical results using valspodar in combination with chemotherapy for human patients have been unrewarding. Three large, phase-3 double blinded clinical trials incorporated valspodar into the therapeutic regimen with no improvements in survival outcomes. In the first study
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, the experimental group of patients with recurring or refractory multiple myeloma received oral valspodar (4 mg/kg) one day in advance of starting the chemotherapy cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with appropriate dose reductions (50% for vincristine and 22% for doxorubicin). Valspodar was continued daily at the same dose through the sixth day of treatment. More patients had partial responses in the valspodar group, but the difference was not statistically significant and was counteracted by increased toxicity that led to inferior survival, which the investigators attributed to higher bioactive levels of doxorubicinol in the patients receiving valspodar. In the second study
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, women with stage IV or suboptimally debulked stage III epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without valspodar as first line-chemotherapy. Valspodar was dosed orally at 5 mg/kg every 6 hours for three days with chemotherapy starting one day after valspodar; a reduced dose of paclitaxel was used in the valspodar group to provide equivalent exposure and toxicity between groups. Addition of valspodar to this chemotherapy protocol did not improve time to progression or survival, although it significantly enhanced toxicity. In the third study
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> previously untreated patients younger than 60 years old with acute myelogenous leukemia were randomized into treatment groups of cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, and etoposide with or without valspodar. Valspodar was administered as a loading dose of 2.8 mg/kg intravenously on the first day followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg for 72 hours. The doses of daunorubicin and etoposide were reduced by 2.25-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively to mitigate toxicity. Addition of valspodar did not produce a survival benefit despite increased gastrointestinal toxicity.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that none of these studies evaluated whether tumor cells in general, or cells expressing ABCB1 or other TIC/TPC markers in particular, were sensitized to chemotherapy treatments. Kolitz
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> indicated that pre-therapy myeloblasts were collected from patients for analysis of ABCB1 expression and modulation of drug efflux
<italic>in vitro</italic> by valspodar, but the results of these experiments were not reported. For this study, our intent was to assess the possibility that neoadjuvant treatment with valspodar for 4 days, with maintenance for an additional day after the start of chemotherapy, would sensitize LPCs to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Our results indicate that LPCs in canine large B-cell lymphoma were heterogeneous regarding the expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2, with slightly fewer positive cells present in the dogs randomized to the placebo group. Such heterogeneity is consistent with previous observations in human lymphoma samples
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The apparent reversal in outcome trends between the placebo and valspodar groups as a function of the percent lymph node B-cell LPCs at diagnosis was intriguing, and while tempered by the small sample size, it suggests this approach merits additional investigation.</p><p>Gene expression analysis showed differential changes over time in lymph node samples from dogs treated with placebo and from dogs treated with valspodar. However, the differentially expressed genes were driven by a few samples in each group and there were no global (genome-wide) changes in gene expression that could be attributed to the drug or to time. This is not entirely unexpected, as on average the LPCs comprised less than 3% of the total population of lymph node cells.</p><p>The proportion of ABCB1
<sup>+</sup> and ABCG2
<sup>+</sup> LPCs appeared to decrease in the samples from four dogs during the neoadjuvant period where we could perform the analysis; however, the change was unrelated to valspodar, since a reduction of similar magnitude occurred in the dogs assigned to both the placebo and the valspodar groups. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were not found in either the total number of LPCs or in the duration of remission (or overall survival) between groups of dogs treated with valspodar and placebo.</p><p>In fact, the proportion of ABCB1
<sup>+</sup> and ABCG2
<sup>+</sup> LPCs appeared to decrease in the lymph node samples from four dogs during the neoadjuvant period where we could perform the analysis; however, the change was unrelated to valspodar, since a reduction of similar magnitude occurred in the dogs assigned to both the placebo and the valspodar groups. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were not found in either the total number of LPCs or in the duration of remission (or overall survival) between groups of dogs treated with valspodar and placebo. Similarly, our data suggest that neoadjuvant valspodar had little effect to sensitize peripheral blood LPCs to doxorubicin. Yet, the morphologic variability in peripheral blood leukocytes and noise in the system, both among dogs as well as within dogs sampled at different time points, confounded our attempts to create a robust strategy for identifying blood LPCs (rare events) with a high degree of certainty. The preponderance of evidence does not support an effect of valspodar to sensitize LPCs to chemotherapy. However, we must consider that the sample size (
<italic>i.e.</italic>, the number of dogs) could be insufficient to demonstrate the effect given the extremely low frequency of cells with LPC phenotype and the pronounced inter-sample variability, so we must consider the data from peripheral blood LPCs inconclusive. Nonetheless, our results suggest that LPC cell enumeration is technically possible, and future attempts to document changes in proportions of LPCs will need to be paired with improved and rigorous quality control measures and a sufficiently large sample size to minimize or manage this variability.</p><p>It is worth noting that the duration of remission and the overall survival of dogs in this study slightly exceeded the expectations based on previously published results using single agent doxorubicin
<sup><xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. This could be attributed to improved management of cancer patients over time, but it also could be due to recruitment of a relatively uniform population of dogs based on clinical and pathologic criteria
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The latter possibility highlights the benefits of study designs that narrow disease heterogeneity, particularly for canine lymphoma where each disease entity in this complex should be considered as an individual condition.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the absence of clinical improvement in dogs receiving valspodar vs. placebo. First, it is possible that this treatment would be most effective against a specific subset of DLBCL, such as EZH2-mutated GC DLBCL. It has been challenging to separate canine DLBCLs into activated B-cell (ABC) type and GC-type DLBCL
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, although one study suggested canine DLBCL might be more similar to human ABC type DLBCL
<sup><xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. Second, the study was designed to address chemosensitization of LPCs by valspodar, and the sample size was not powered to reveal if this protocol would significantly improve survival outcomes. Based on our results, we estimate that a clinical trial where we could detect a doubling of the median overall survival (from 12 months to 24 months) in dogs receiving neoadjuvant valspodar would require 35 dogs each in the treatment and in the placebo arms.</p><p>We confirmed absorption and bioavailability of the drug on the fourth day of administration, and we showed that the drug was able to fully inhibit ABC transporter activity in a side population assay even at the lowest dose detected. However, the levels of valspodar required for sustained, active inhibition of ABC transporter activity
<italic>in vivo</italic> have not been conclusively established. For example, when valspodar (50 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (10 mg/kg) were administered concurrently to mice through the oral route, they passed rapidly through the stomach and reached the intestine together, but showed enhanced uptake and plasma levels for paclitaxel
<sup><xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. In rats, oral valspodar was absorbed rapidly and had excellent bioavailability with low hepatic extraction
<sup><xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. In human patients with chemotherapy-resistant multiple myeloma, a dose escalation study showed similar pharmacokinetic properties. Orally administered valspodar combined with doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone led to a doubling of the area under the curve for doxorubicin levels in the plasma and reduced its clearance by half
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The concentration of valspodar in serum increased proportionately with a dose of up to 15 mg/kg/day, although it reached a maximum effectiveness level vis-&#x000e0;-vis increasing plasma doxorubicin at 5 mg/kg/day where the median trough and peak levels (of valspodar) were 461 ng/ml and 1134 ng/ml, respectively. The treatment regimen was associated with increased toxicity and required dose reduction in more than 50% of the patients (13/22). Yet, 14 of the patients treated had either a partial response or stable disease, and ABCB1 expression in bone marrow plasma cells was reduced in four of the five responding patients examined.</p><p>In another study, valspodar was administered concurrently with doxorubicin to 31 cancer patients using an intravenous loading dose of 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg and a continuous dose of 1&#x02013;10 mg/kg over 24 hours. Doxorubicin was given immediately at the end of the loading dose, and the treatment was repeated every 21 days until there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. As noted in the Sonneveld study
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, patients receiving valspodar showed a significantly increased area under the curve for doxorubicin, with a 50% shortening of doxorubicin clearance as compared to controls. The steady-state concentrations of valspodar over the time of continuous administration ranged from 190 ng/ml to 1383 ng/ml with unchanged rates of clearance, and serum from treated patients contained sufficiently high levels of valspodar to inhibit ABCB1 activity in an
<italic>in vitro</italic> bioassay. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed only in patients treated with the highest dose of valspodar (2 mg/kg loading dose and 10 mg/kg continuous dose) and 50 mg/kg doxorubicin. One patient (ovarian cancer) had a partial response, but none of the patients in this trial had non-Hodgkin lymphoma
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The effective serum concentrations and positive bioassay results in these studies are in contrast to those in another series of experiments showing that the concentration required to inhibit ABC transporter activity
<italic>in vitro</italic> under complete serum conditions (cells cultured in 100% fetal bovine serum) is almost a full order of magnitude (8&#x02013;9 times) higher than the plasma concentrations achieved in clinical trials, probably due to binding of valspodar by serum lipoproteins
<sup><xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Among the compounds examined, daunorubicin was the most relevant. In 100% serum, the half maximal concentration of valspodar required to inhibit ABCB1-mediated daunorubicin transport was approximately 1.5 &#x000b5;M (or approximately 1800 ng/ml), which is close to the peak levels achievable using continuous infusions
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and almost 3-fold higher than the levels we measured in our study.</p><p>It also is possible that inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCG2 in LPCs is insufficient to ablate the population. In our study, 30% to 90% of lymph node LPCs did not express ABCB1 or ABCG2. In addition, the variable sensitivity to verapamil and other ABC transporter inhibitors by LPCs and side population cells in leukemia and lymphoma suggests that these cells might rely on alternative mechanisms of drug export and/or drug resistance. Still, it has been shown that clinically relevant anti-lymphoma immunotherapies including rituximab
<sup><xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> and anti-CD19 antibodies
<sup><xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> induce ABCB1 to translocate out of lipid rafts, reducing its ability to extrude chemotherapy agents such as vincristine and doxorubicin and increasing the chemosensitivity of drug-resistant lymphoma cell lines. We propose that the totality of data continues to support the rationale for implementing treatment approaches for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that target ABCB1 and ABCG2 in the neoadjuvant or the adjuvant settings. These treatments might be most effective for patients with tumors that do not respond to other targeted agents, such as those diagnosed with EZH2-mutant GC DLBCL. Thus, additional work and diligently crafted clinical trials, as well as creative animal models of induced and spontaneous disease, will be needed to establish the significance of LPCs in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies and the potential to improve patient outcomes by targeting the ABC transporter-enriched and the ABC transporter-deficient subsets of these cell populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#x000a9; 2017 Ito D et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).

<bold>Comment: </bold>My main concern with the manuscript is that the main outcome studied was a change in LPCs before and 4 days after starting valspodar. Given the mechanism of action of the drug in inhibiting the ABC transporter and not cytotoxcity of these cells specifically I am not surprised that the authors did not see a drop in their numbers.&#x000a0; It is unfortunate that there were only a few samples with enough material to test if valspodar could inhibit the ABC transporters in vivo as this would have been a very useful component of the study. In my opinion these points should be in the discussion.</p><p>
<bold>Response: </bold>This comment (as well as a comment from Reviewer #2) made it clear to us that we failed to explain clearly why we hypothesized that LPCs would be depleted in dogs treated with neoadjuvant valspodar followed by doxorubicin. This failure was partly due to circumstances explained in our cover letter to the editors, and our efforts to correct it were the main reason it took so long for us to submit a response. In fact, we agree with the reviewer that valspodar is not cytotoxic and should not cause a reduction in LPSc by itself. Rather, our prediction was that by reducing the activity of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) proteins, including ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein), valspodar would sensitize LPCs to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin.&#x000a0; We expected doxorubicin treatment to induce rapid clinical remission with consequent lymphoid necrosis and lymphodepletion of malignant nodes. Thus, we felt that quantification of LPCs from this nodal environment would be challenging. Instead, we decided to measure depletion of LPCs in peripheral blood as a surrogate measure of valspodar-induced sensitization to doxorubicin. As noted in the materials and methods section, blood was collected from each dog on day 11 of the study, 7 days after administration of doxorubicin.&#x000a0; We believe this was a reasonable time point for sampling blood to investigate whether circulating LPCs were sensitized by the neoadjuvant valsopodar and depleted by doxorubicin treatment in treated dogs as compared to controls.</p><p>
<bold>Comment: </bold>While underpowered I think the length of remission and overall survival data are important as they show that there is not likely to be differences in these groups even in a larger study.</p><p>
<bold>Response: </bold>We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comment. We agree, and that is the reason why we included the data in the original manuscript and kept this section unchanged.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article><sub-article id="report8454" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5256/f1000research.6482.r8454</article-id><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thamm</surname><given-names>Douglas H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r8454a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r8454a1">

<bold>Comment: </bold>As written, it appears that changes in lymphoid progenitor cell percentages in patient dogs were assessed before and after valspodar treatment, but before any chemotherapy was given (&#x0201c;Trial design&#x0201d; section and Table 2). The role of P-GP in mediating chemotherapy sensitivity is through facilitating the cellular efflux of certain cytotoxic drugs. In the absence of these cytotoxic drugs, P-GP inhibitors would be expected to have no independent cytotoxic effect on any cell population. Thus, the absence of a change in LPC percentage (or gene expression) is intuitive based on the mechanism of the drug and the study as-designed. If LPC number was assessed following doxorubicin (+/- valspodar) treatment, a difference MIGHT have been observed. If I am somehow mistaken about the study design, then it needs substantial clarification.</p><p>
<bold>Response: </bold>We agree with the reviewer, and refer to our response to comments from reviewer 1 and our cover letter to the editors for a detailed explanation. Moreover, we re-analyzed the RNA sequencing data, and corrected a technical error in our previous statement, although it does not change the interpretation of the data. In fact, there were observed genes whose expression was significantly different in pre-treatment and post-treatment groups. However, we did not find consistent, genome-wide changes in gene expression that could be attributed to drug treatment (valspodar vs. placebo) or to time (Day 0 vs. Day 4). A more precise description of the methods used, the results, and the interpretation are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>
<bold>Comment: </bold>Extensive clinical evaluation of valspodar/chemotherapy combinations in humans has failed to demonstrate an improvement in outcome, even in very large randomized phase-3 trials. For example, CALGB 19808 randomized 302 patients with AML to chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus valspodar &#x02013; response rates, DFS and OS were no different and were actually numerically shorter in the valspodar arm (Kolitz et al, 2010). A second study randomized 762 patients with ovarian cancer to carboplatin/paclitaxel +/- valspodar &#x02013; no difference in outcome was observed (Lhomm&#x000e9; et al., 2008). A third randomized study, ECOG E1A95, evaluated VAD +/- valspodar in 94 patients with refractory myeloma. No difference in outcome was observed (Friedenberg et al, 2006). Although an alternate mechanism for drug efficacy is invoked in this study, it seems counterintuitive to think that differences in outcome (although a secondary measure) would be observed in a study of 20 dogs with lymphoma. None of the above-mentioned studies were discussed or cited in the Introduction or Discussion.</p><p>
<bold>Response: </bold>The reviewer is correct that valspodar had been evaluated previously in three large phase-3 clinical trials with no evidence of improved response rates. Our intent was to determine if inhibition of ABC transporters, and ABCB1 in particular, would sensitize LPCs to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, presumably by increasing the retention time of the drug in the cells. Our study was not powered to detect differences in duration of remission or overall survival, but differences in LPCs might have supported a revised study design for new trials in cancers of dogs or humans that are presumed to be driven by tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating cells with elevated ABC transporter activity. We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s point, that clarifying the previous use of valspodar in cancer patients and how this study was meant to build on the negative data, and specifically how the design differed from those studies, is valuable for context. We have added this information to the Introduction and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article></article>
