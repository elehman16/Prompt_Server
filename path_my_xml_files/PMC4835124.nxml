The pharmacokinetics of FDC_EVO5/MET1000 was compared to the corresponding loose combination in a randomized, open-label, crossover study in 36 healthy male subjects (Part 1), and the food effect on FDC_EVO5/MET1000 was assessed (under fasted or fed conditions) in a randomized, open-label, crossover study in 28 healthy male subjects (Part 2). Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 72 hours, and pharmacokinetic parameters of evogliptin and metformin were calculated using non-compartmental methods. The geometric mean ratios (fixed-dose combination to loose combination) and 90% confidence intervals of pharmacokinetic parameters for evogliptin and metformin were all within 0.800&#x02013;1.250, suggesting bioequivalent pharmacokinetic. After a single oral dose of FDC_EVO5/MET1000, food did not significantly affect evogliptin pharmacokinetic while systemic exposure of metformin was increased about 47.5% under the fed condition, which is consistent with the already established food effect on metformin XR. FDC_EVO5/MET1000 was generally well tolerated without any drug-related serious adverse events. In conclusion, FDC_EVO5/MET1000 can be substituted for the loose combination of FDC_EVO5/MET1000, providing better compliance with convenient administration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>food effect</kwd><kwd>fixed-dose combination</kwd><kwd>evogliptin</kwd><kwd>metformin XR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type 2 diabetes, which is also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, accounts for more than 90% of patients with diabetes.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend metformin as the first-line therapy, followed by adding second-line agents to metformin for patients with insufficient control of hyperglycemia.<xref rid="b2-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Among the add-on agents, DPP-4 inhibitors are a relatively new and expanding class of treatment option.</p><p>DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control mainly via stimulation of glucose-mediated incretin secretion, resulting in increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon release.<xref rid="b4-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This glucose-dependent mechanism of DPP-4 inhibitor suggests a lower risk for hypoglycemia.

Each study had a randomized, open-label, single dose, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment crossover design. Healthy male subjects were included who were 20&#x02013;45 years of age, weighed at least 55 kg, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x02013;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 60&#x02013;125 mg/dL at screening. Subjects had to present no clinically significant abnormalities based on medical history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests, performed within 3 weeks before the first administration of the study drugs. A total of 64 subjects who met the screening criteria were admitted to the Clinical Trials Center at Seoul National University Hospital for 5 days in each period, with a 14-day washout between the two adjacent periods.

The collected samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm and 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, and the obtained plasma samples were frozen at below &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until assayed.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of plasma drug concentration</title><p>Plasma concentrations of evogliptin and metformin were determined by a validated liquid chromatography (Agilent 1260 series; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry method (Agilent 6490 Quadrupole for evogliptin and Agilent 6460 Quadrupole for metformin, Agilent Technologies). Chromatographic separation was performed under gradient conditions using a Venusil ASB C8 column (50.0&#x000d7;2.1 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m; Agela, Wilmington, DE, USA) for evogliptin and using a Kinetex HILIC 100 &#x000c5; column (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column; 100.0&#x000d7;2.1 mm, 2.6 &#x003bc;m; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) for metformin.

Therefore, the 35 subjects in Part 1 and the 27 subjects in Part 2 who completed the study as planned were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses, and all of the enrolled subjects were included in the safety assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>In Part 1, the mean plasma concentration-time profile of evogliptin following a single oral administration of FDC_EVO5/MET1000 was almost superimposed on that of EVO+MET. Likewise, metformin showed a similar pharmacokinetic profile between the two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-10-1411">Figure 2</xref>). These similar plasma concentration-time profiles for both evogliptin and metformin resulted in GMRs (FDC_EVO5/MET1000 to EVO+MET) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of evogliptin and metformin close to unity. Furthermore, 90% CIs of the GMRs fell entirely within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0.800&#x02013;1.250 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-1411">Table 2</xref>). Other pharmacokinetic parameters of evogliptin and metformin, including T<sub>max</sub>, CL/F, and t<sub>1/2</sub>, were also comparable between the two treatments.</p><p>In Part 2, a single dose of FDC_EVO5/MET1000 under the fed condition had a pharmacokinetic profile of evogliptin comparable with that of FDC_EVO5/MET1000 administered under the fasted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-10-1411">Figure 3</xref>). In terms of total systemic exposure, the pharmacokinetic parameters of evogliptin under the fed condition were similar to those under the fasted condition, leading to GMRs and 90% CI values that satisfied bioequivalence criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-1411">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, the T<sub>max</sub> of metformin was slightly delayed, and systemic exposure (AUCs) increased under the fed condition compared to the fasted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-10-1411">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-1411">Table 2</xref>). Especially, AUC<sub>last</sub> of metformin under the fed condition increased by 36%&#x02013;60% compared to the fasted condition. However, the fed condition did not significantly affect C<sub>max</sub> of metformin, resulting in GMR and 90% CI values within the bioequivalence range.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Safety results</title><p>In Part 1, four subjects (11.1%) experienced a total of five AEs that were considered possibly treatment-related; four AEs (two incidents of headache, and one incident each of diarrhea and mouth ulceration) occurred after FDC_EVO5/MET1000 administration, whereas only one AE (mouth ulceration) occurred after treatment with EVO+MET. In Part 2, seven subjects (25.0%) experienced at least one of eleven treatment-related AEs, among which four AEs (one incident each of headache, dizziness, nausea, and myalgia) occurred after treatment under fasted condition, and seven AEs (two incidents of headache, and one incident each of myalgia, abdominal discomfort, dry lips, oral mucosa erosion, and ear pain) occurred after treatment under the fed condition. All AEs were mild in intensity and resolved spontaneously without any intervention.

The complexity of the treatment regimen and polypharmacy are known to be determinants of poor medication adherence, and FDCs have the potential to improve adherence by reducing the pill burden (polypharmacy).<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Indeed, a meta-analysis study showed that FDCs reduce the risk of medication non-compliance by 24%&#x02013;26%.<xref rid="b11-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, the FDC formulation of evogliptin and metformin XR would be helpful to improve adherence, further reducing the practice&#x02013;outcome gap, in which clinical guidelines are implemented but expected benefits are not realized.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization guidelines for registration of FDC medicinal products, the data requirements for marketing authorization of FDC depend broadly on the scenario into which the application falls.<xref rid="b12-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As FDC_EVO5/MET1000 contains a new chemical entity, evogliptin, this new FDC corresponds to scenario 4. For marketing approval of a new FDC in scenario 4, comparative bioavailability data for a new dosage form are required as well as clinical safety and efficacy data.<xref rid="b12-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Consequently, the present study was designed to compare bioavailability and demonstrated bioequivalent pharmacokinetics between FDC_EVO5/MET1000 and the corresponding loose combination. It was verified that all pharmacokinetic parameters for both evogliptin and metformin were similar between FDC_EVO5/MET1000 and the loose combination, leading to GMR and 90% CI values falling entirely within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0.800&#x02013;1.250 for both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub>.</p><p>Because FDC_EVO5/MET1000 includes an XR dosage formulation, metformin XR, a food effect study was also conducted in accordance with Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety guidelines.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> According to the US Food and Drug Administration labeling of the metformin XR product, the extent of metformin absorption, as measured by AUC, increases by approximately 50% when given with food, although there is no effect of food on C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of metformin.<xref rid="b14-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Consistently, in the present study, food increased the bioavailability of metformin by about 47.5% while C<sub>max</sub> was not significantly affected following administration of FDC_EVO5/MET1000. Practically, metformin is recommended to be taken with food to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.<xref rid="b15-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> As the pharmacokinetics of metformin from FDC_EVO5/MET1000 with food was similar to that of metformin XR, the change in pharmacokinetics of metformin by food would not be clinically meaningful. On the other hand, the pharmacokinetics of evogliptin from FDC_EVO5/MET1000 was consistent regardless of food intake. Consequently, the results of the food effect study suggest that FDC_EVO5/MET1000 can be used according to the instructions for metformin XR regarding administration with food.</p><p>In bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, blood sampling is recommended to continue for at least three or more t<sub>1/2</sub>s of the drug to capture at least 80% of the relevant AUC.<xref rid="b16-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, the current study was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of FDC_EVO5/MET1000 up to 72 hours, which covers only about two terminal half-lives of evogliptin. This time frame was chosen because most regulatory agencies accept the assessment of bioequivalence using truncated AUC (AUC<sub>0-72 h</sub>) for drugs with an elimination half-life of longer than 24 hours and low intrasubject variability in distribution and clearance.<xref rid="b16-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-dddt-10-1411" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the present study, the terminal half-life of evogliptin was longer than 24 hours, and intrasubject variability in the CL/F of evogliptin was low (around 10.0%). Therefore, truncated AUC at 72 hours for evogliptin is reasonable to use in a bioequivalence and food effect study for FDC_EVO5/MET1000.</p><p>In the present study, subjects did not experience any serious AEs, and the AEs observed were mild to moderate in nature and resolved without sequelae. Furthermore, there was no clinically meaningful difference in frequency and occurrence of AEs relative to treatments, and safety profiles were not altered to any clinically meaningful extent by treatment. Based on these safety outcomes, FDC_EVO5/MET1000 seems to be well tolerated and is expected to be used safely. However, it should be considered that the safety assessment was not a primary objective of the study, which also was conducted in only a few dozen healthy subjects.</p><p>In conclusion, FDC_EVO5/MET1000 is expected to be a substitute for the loose combination of evogliptin 5 mg and metformin XR 1,000 mg, providing better adherence with convenient administration. Furthermore, FDC_EVO5/MET1000 can be administered with food, which is recommended for metformin XR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Dong-A ST Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>All the authors significantly contributed to the conception, design, execution, and/or analysis and interpretation of data in this study.
