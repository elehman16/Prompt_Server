Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of most antimalarials in pregnancy. Indeed, clinical trials assessing antimalarial treatments systematically exclude pregnancy for fear of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. The little available information originates from South East Asia while in sub-Saharan Africa such information is still limited and needs to be provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A Phase 3, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomized, open-label clinical trial on safety and efficacy of 4 ACT when administered during pregnancy was carried out in 4 African countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia. This is a four arm trial using a balanced incomplete block design. Pregnant women diagnosed with malaria are randomised to receive either amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ-AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or mefloquine-artesunate (MQAS). They are actively followed up until day 63 post-treatment and then monthly until 4&#x02013;6 weeks post-delivery. The offspring is visited at the time of the first birthday. The primary endpoint is treatment failure (PCR adjusted) at day 63 and safety profiles. Secondary endpoints included PCR unadjusted treatment failure up to day 63, gametocyte carriage, Hb changes, placenta malaria, mean birth weight and low birth weight. The primary statistical analysis will use the combined data from all 4 centres, with adjustment for any centre effects, using an additive model for the response rates. This will allow the assessment of all 6 possible pair-wise treatment comparisons using all available data.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The strength of this trial is the involvement of several African countries, increasing the generalisability of the results. In addition, it assesses most ACTs currently available, determining their relative &#x02018;-value-&#x02019; compared to others. The balanced incomplete block design was chosen because using all 4-arms in each site would have increased complexity in terms of implementation. Excluding HIV-positive pregnant women on antiretroviral drugs may be seen as a limitation because of the possible interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial treatments. Nevertheless, the results of this trial will provide the evidence base for the formulation of malaria treatment policy for pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00852423">NCT00852423</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Artemisinin-based therapy</kwd><kwd>Malaria in pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Pregnant women</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Sub-Saharan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>The risk of malaria is higher in pregnant women than in the general population. There is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of most antimalarial drugs in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] as they are systematically excluded from clinical trials for fear of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This has complicated the generation of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy. Though the experience on the use of ACTs and their safety and efficacy in pregnancy is increasing (over 1,000 documented pregnancies, mainly in South East Asia), such information is still limited in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Preclinical data indicate that the artemisinin derivatives were embryotoxic and potentially teratogenic in several animal species, without maternal toxic effects or impaired fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More recent studies confirm these findings. One important aspect is that the critical window for drug exposure is approximately 10&#x02013;14 days in the rat and their extrapolation to humans would indicate a sensitive period of weeks 2&#x02013;6 of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is increasing experience with the use of artemisinin derivatives in the second and third trimesters and there have been no reported adverse effects on the mother or foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite limited data the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends effective artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACT) in the second and the third trimester and several African countries are already implementing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>We propose to assess the efficacy and safety of the most important ACTs currently available, namely artemether-lumefantrine (AL), amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ-AS), mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ). The choice of ACTs is based on several criteria, including known treatment efficacy in children, safety in pivotal phase-3 trials in children and adults, practicality of the dosing regimen (duration, e.g. 3 vs. 7&#x000a0;days), fixed dose combinations, drug tolerance, current availability in the population and affordable cost. The rationale for contemporaneously testing several drug regimens is to shorten the time of data collection and determine the relative &#x02018;value&#x02019; of each treatment, providing the basis for an informed choice by malaria control programmes and policy makers.</p><p>Reliable data on the safety and efficacy of ACTs in pregnant women can be rapidly collected only within the context of a randomized-controlled trial. The production of such a large dataset will advance considerably the knowledge on the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in a relatively short period of time compared to pregnancy registers. One of the major issues for this trial is the altered pharmacokinetic of antimalarial drugs during pregnancy and the influence on the outcome of treatment. There has been a recent increase in trials that measure the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent information on the pharmacokinetics of both artemisinins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and partner drugs in the ACT is reassuring as amodiaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], mefloquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and piperaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] do not seem to need dose adjustment. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetic of lumefantrine (when administered as co-formulated artemether-lumefantrine) seems altered in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The clinical implications of the PK findings may not be clear from small rich PK studies alone and, unless the effects are important, may not be apparent in a pilot study in one site. Therefore, the proposed study aims not only at collecting safety and efficacy data on ACTs in a systematic and standardized manner but also explanatory variables (pharmacokinetic and <italic>in vitro</italic> drug sensitivity) that may help in interpreting the observed results.</p><p>ACTs have been shown to be extremely efficacious in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Efficacy is determined by the drug partnering the artemisinin derivative and, for artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine, artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine, and dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine, this usually exceeds 95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Amodiaquine-artesunate has proved to be an efficacious combination (range 90-95%) in areas where 28-day cure rates with amodiaquine monotherapy exceed 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Few data on pregnant women are available but efficacy should be as good, if not better, than in children. In all the three areas where AQAS is assessed, efficacy of AQ monotherapy exceeds 80%. Therefore, it is expected that all the four treatments will have an efficacy of about 95%.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objectives and purpose</title><p>The main objective of the trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of 4 ACTs when administered to pregnant women with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection during the second and the third trimester, and collect explanatory variables for therapeutic response.

There are 7 sites in the study distributed in the four countries, i.e. Burkina Faso (Nanoro and Nazoanga), Ghana (Effiduase, Ejisu and Juaben), Malawi (Chikwawa) and Zambia (Nchelenge).</p><p>The treatments tested are distributed in a way to allow a head-to-head comparison and the establishment of the treatment&#x02019;s relative value according to a series of outcomes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This approach has the advantage of testing several treatment options at the same time, maximizing the use of resources, and is the most likely to achieve our aim of identifying at least 2 antimalarial treatments suitable for use in pregnancy and one rescue/alternative treatment.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Thick blood smears are stained with 3% Giemsa for 30&#x000a0;minutes and read by trained microscopists at each site. Parasite densities are calculated by counting the number of asexual parasites per 200 leukocytes (or per 500 leukocytes if the count is &#x0003c;10 asexual parasites/200 leukocytes), assuming a leukocyte count of 8,000/&#x003bc;l.

Complementing efficacy data with some information on the pharmacokinetic properties of the treatment used allows a better interpretation of the observed recurrent infections or true recrudescences/new infections, as these may be the results of inadequate drug levels because of altered distribution, poor absorption or metabolism. The day 7 drug concentration has been shown to be the most important single measure, in terms of correlation with the area under the concentration time curve and association with treatment response, for lumefantrine, piperaquine and mefloquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, a blood sample of 2&#x000a0;ml is collected from all women at day 7 with the aim of measuring with an appropriate assay the concentration of the partner drug to the artemisinin derivative. Not all samples will be analysed; instead a smaller number of samples will be chosen for the analysis according to the observed therapeutic response, i.e. in each arm women having experienced a true recrudescence will be compared with those having had a new infection and with those with an adequate clinical and parasitological response.

If the true response rate for one of the treatments is lower than 95%, then power is reduced to 80% (for a true response rate of 94%) or 50% (for a true response rate of 93%). Allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up, a total of 870 patients are recruited to each treatment; this is equivalent to 290 patients in each treatment group in each centre (i.e. a total centre sample size of 870 patients) &#x02013; and hence a total study sample size of 3480 patients. Inclusion of HIV-infected women is not expected to have a major influence on the sample size calculation. The percentage of therapeutic success may be slightly but not dramatically lower in this subgroup of patients.</p><p>For safety, when combined, the trial is able to detect with 90% power major adverse events occurring at the frequency of at least 2-3%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A detailed analysis plan is drawn up prior to the analysis.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Baseline comparability</bold>: Patients in each treatment group in each site are described separately with respect to baseline characteristics.

Assessment of the difference in true response rates is performed by calculating the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates from the observed data, using the following decision rule:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>if the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates lies entirely between &#x02212;5% and +5%, then therapeutic equivalence of the two treatments is concluded;</p></list-item><list-item><p>if the 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates includes &#x02212;5% or +5%, then therapeutic equivalence cannot be established;</p></list-item><list-item><p>if the 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates lies entirely below &#x02212;5% or entirely above 5%, then one treatment is clinically inferior to the other.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary analysis uses the combined data from all 4 centres together, with adjustment for any centre effects, using an additive model for the response rates (i.e. a generalized linear model with Bernoulli error distribution and an identity link function). This allows the assessment of all 6 possible pair-wise treatment comparisons using all available data. Equivalence will be established using two-sided confidence intervals. Though 6 treatment comparisons will be performed, no adjustment for multiplicity is needed as the focus of the study is on the individual pair-wise treatment comparisons. In addition, combined hypotheses of interest (e.g. all 4 treatments are therapeutically equivalent) require each of the individual hypotheses to be accepted. Consequently, there is no inflation of the type I error rate due to multiple testing. However, the power for combined hypotheses is lower than for the individual pair-wise comparisons. Thus, the power calculation of this study required a high (95%) power for individual pair-wise treatment comparisons, resulting in an acceptable (80%) power for the combined hypothesis. For the efficacy analysis, both an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol approach are adopted, with the per-protocol analysis being the primary approach, as recommended for equivalence studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Safety</title><p>For safety analysis, all non-serious and serious adverse events (SAE) are grouped according to a pre-specified side-effect coding system and tabulated. The number (and percentage) of patients experiencing any adverse event, any SAE, and any drug-related SAE are compared between treatment groups using Fisher's exact test. Safety is analyzed using the all-patients-treated approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Selection of the patients</title><p>All pregnant women in the second and third trimester (&#x0003c;37&#x000a0;weeks) and attending the antenatal clinic of the study health facilities are systematically screened for malaria infection with a rapid diagnostic test; if positive they are further assessed for eligibility. They are included if they are at least 15&#x000a0;years old, with a pregnancy of at least 16&#x000a0;weeks, a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> monoinfection of any density, regardless of symptoms, and a Hb concentration of at least 7&#x000a0;g/dL. Pregnant women with a negative blood slide are not included in the study and go through the routine antenatal clinic procedures according to national policy and receive a dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent preventive treatment (IPT). Exclusion criteria include history of allergic reactions to the study drugs, of known pregnancy complications or bad obstetric history such as repeated stillbirths or eclampsia, of presence or history of major illnesses likely to influence pregnancy outcome, e.g. diabetes mellitus, severe renal or heart disease, or active tuberculosis, current cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or ARV treatment. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides the full list of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The reason of including women with any parasite density is justified by the important adverse outcomes any malaria infection has on the mother&#x02019;s and her offspring&#x02019;s heath. Limiting the inclusion to women at 16&#x000a0;weeks or more of gestation is justified by the uncertainty on the safety of ACT when administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. The gestational age was confirmed by measuring symphysio-fundal height and the foetal viability by using an ultra-sonography. Exclusion criteria are formulated because of possible safety issues, e.g. history of allergic reactions to the study drugs, or the need for a clear interpretation of the therapeutic response, e.g. recent exposure to antimalarial treatments.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

HIV-1 infected pregnant women have a higher prevalence of peripheral parasitaemia and placental malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and their infants experience higher postnatal mortality when both diseases are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. HIV-1 infected adults have a higher risk of malaria infection and clinical malaria, the latter increasing with falling CD4-cell count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, offering adequate and efficacious antimalarial treatment and prevention is extremely important for this high risk group. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of antimalarial drugs in HIV-infected individuals and much less on the interaction between antimalarials and antiretrovirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and reliable data are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HIV-infected individuals have a higher risk of experiencing treatment failure and this depends on the degree of immune-suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, no major safety problems related to ACT treatment in pregnant women have been identified so far.</p><p>Considering that most pregnant women recruited in the study will have an infection with a relatively low parasite density and that they will be treated with an ACT, it is expected that the number of treatment failures in this specific sub-group would be extremely low. They will have to be treated in any case as the consequences of the malaria infection on the woman&#x02019;s health and that of her offspring are well known.</p><p>In the second and third trimester of pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of ACT known to be effective in the country/region. Despite this recommendation, it should be recognised that the available information on the treatments to be used in this trial is limited. ACT should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy, the time of greatest concern for potential teratogenicity, and particular care will be taken in excluding women of this gestational age. DHA-PQ is the least used of the 4 ACTs studied in this trial and it is not among the WHO recommended ACTs during pregnancy because of insufficient information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, DHA-PQ is the first line treatment in Papua Indonesia, where it is also used to treat pregnant women with malaria; an observational study reported significant benefits of DHA-PQ over quinine-based regimens in reducing recurrent malaria and poor foetal outcome in pregnant women in the second or third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This trial will increase significantly the knowledge on the use of DHA-PQ in African pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Data collection completed.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ACPR</term><def><p>Adequate clinical and parasitological response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Artemisinin combination therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AL</term><def><p>Artemether lumefantrine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALAT</term><def><p>Alanine amino-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQAS</term><def><p>Amodiaquine artesunate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARV</term><def><p>Antiretroviral</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CS</term><def><p>Consortium secretariat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHA-PQ</term><def><p>Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DNA</term><def><p>Deoxynucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p>Data safety and monitoring board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETF</term><def><p>Early treatment failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLURP</term><def><p>Glutamate-rich protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRP</term><def><p>Histidine-rich protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International conference on harmonisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPT</term><def><p>Intermittent preventive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITN</term><def><p>Insecticide treated net</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAR</term><def><p>Legally authorised representative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LCF</term><def><p>Late clinical failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPF</term><def><p>Late clinical failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTF</term><def><p>Late treatment failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIP</term><def><p>Malaria in pregnancy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MQAS</term><def><p>Mefloquine artesunate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSP</term><def><p>Malaria merozoite surface protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>Polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCT</term><def><p>Parasite clearance time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PK</term><def><p>Pharmacokinetics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDV</term><def><p>Source data verification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SP</term><def><p>Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TF</term><def><p>Treatment failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VCT</term><def><p>Voluntary counselling and testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World health organisation.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The research was funded by EDCTP and Co-funding from Bill and Melinda Gates foundation (BMGF) - USA, Directorate-General for Development Cooperation (DGDC) &#x02013; Belgium, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) &#x02013; United Kingdom, Netherlands-African Partnership for Capacity Development and Clinical interventions Against Poverty-related diseases (NACCAP) &#x02013; Netherlands, and Medical Research Council (MRC) &#x02013; UK.
