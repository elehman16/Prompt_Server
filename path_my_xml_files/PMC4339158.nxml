resistance exercise (CERE) applied to chronic stroke patients on their pulmonary
functions, chest expansion, and functional gait ability. [Subjects] Forty chronic stroke
patients without any respiration-related rehabilitation program experience (21 men and 19
women; times elapsed since occurrence of stroke: 21.8 &#x000b1; 5.3 months) were randomly and
equally allocated to a CERE group (experimental group) and a control group. [Methods] An
ordinary stroke rehabilitation program was performed on the subjects. While the
experimental group received a CERE intervention, the control group performed passive range
of motion exercise with automatic instruments. [Results] The CERE group&#x02019;s chest expansion
significantly increased after the intervention, whereas the control group did not see any
significant difference. As regards VC (vital capacity), FVC (forced vital capacity), and
FEV<sub>1</sub> (forced expiratory volume in one second), there were no significant
changes in either the CERE or control group. In the 10MTWT (10-meter timed walking test),
there were no significant changes in either group, but in the 6MWT (6-minute walk test),
while there were no significant differences in the control group, the CERE group saw
significant changes. [Conclusion] The results of application of CERE to chronic stroke
patients demonstrated the importance of respiratory exercise in an approach to stroke
rehabilitation treatment intervention and the need to add respiratory exercise to a
rehabilitation intervention program.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Breathing</kwd><kwd>PNF</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In hemiplegia patients, weakened respiratory muscles in relation to chest expansion cause

The
10MTWT (10-meter timed walking test) and 6MWT (6-minute walk test) were performed on all the
subjects one day after the experiment started. At the same time, after one day lapsed, their
VC (vital capacity), FVC (forced vital capacity), FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one
second), and chest expansion were measured. After the application of CERE, the same items
were measured and compared with the pre-intervention values. Then 10MTWT and 6MWT were
applied to the subjects, and the values before and after the intervention were compared. The
control group conducted passive range of motion exercise within a range that would not
affect respiratory function using lower extremity automatic instruments, while the
intervention was applied to the CERE group. To facilitate respiration, CERE was applied to
the CERE group based on the concept of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). For
CERE, patients lay on their side with the affected side upward, and the therapist placed
both hands obliquely along the ribs from the apex of the lower ribs. For 5 minutes, the
therapist trained each patient on inspiration using a quick stretch while breathing out
completely. After the patient fully understood this process, the therapist applied
resistance in caudal and medial directions in such a way as to cause responses in all ranges
of motion but not to such a degree that movements were suppressed<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This technique was applied to the CERE group for 20
minutes, and when a patient complained of dizziness or fatigue, the patient was allowed to
rest until the symptoms disappeared. Using a tape measure, their lower chest expansion was
measured. The 10th thoracic spinous process and the xiphoid process were marked with a pen,
and the measurement was made during inspiration by linking the two marked points in parallel
with the ground<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a tool for
measurement in the pulmonary function test, a spirometer (EasyOne spirometer, ndd Medical
Technologies, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland) was used; VC, FVC, and FEV1 were measured with it. The
10MTWT was applied to measure the time taken to move 10 meters<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. To reduce errors from the acceleration and deceleration sections at
the beginning and end of gait, the subjects were made to walk 14 meters, and the velocity
for 10&#x02005;m excluding the first 2&#x02005;m and the last 2&#x02005;m was measured<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 6MWT was used to measure the distance moved in 6
minutes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A track was drawn indoors,
and a mark was made every 1 meter with tape. The length of the tape was measured to
calculate the distance travelled in 6 minutes after the subject walked for 6 minutes. With
this method, a stroke patient&#x02019;s muscle endurance and functional gait ability may be
evaluated<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Windows SPSS version 18.0 was used to analyze the data for this research. The values of the
CERE group and control group were expressed as means and standard deviations. A paired
t-test was applied to compare changes between the CERE group and the control group after the
exercise. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The clinical and demographic features of the patients are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

group saw functional improvement, whereas the control group did not experience any
significant improvement (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To examine the effect of CERE, an exercise to facilitate respiration, VC, FVC, FEV1, and
chest expansion were measured before and after CERE. To look at changes in functional gait
ability, the 10MTWT and 6MWT were performed, and movement distances were measured and
compared one day before and after CERE.</p><p>The result of CERE application was that the control group did not experience any
significant change in chest expansion, whereas the CERE group experienced a significant
change (p&#x0003c;0.05). This was similar to the result of research<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> that compared changes in chest expansion prior to and
after the application of a PNF deep-breathing exercise to myotonic dystrophy patients,
although there were numerical differences between the two studies. This result provides
clinical grounds for the effects of a CERE intervention in facilitation of respiration, and
other research results<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> that found that
improved chest expansion capability translates into increased inflow of air into the lungs
support the significance of the changes in this research.</p><p>Regarding VC, defined as the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after
a maximum inspiration, the control group&#x02019;s change amount was 0.01 (L) and the CERE group&#x02019;s
change amount was 0.4 (L), which were not statistically significant. Regarding FVC, defined
as the volume change of the lung between a slow full inspiration to total lung capacity and
a rapid maximal expiration to residual volume, the control group&#x02019;s change amount was 0.02
(L) and the CERE group&#x02019;s change amount was 0.11 (L), which were also not statistically
significant. Regarding FEV1, defined as the maximum volume of air expired in one second, the
control group&#x02019;s change amount was 0.02 (L) and the CERE group&#x02019;s change amount was 0.05 (L).
Neither of these was statistically significant. Nonetheless, the CERE group&#x02019;s VC, FVC, and
FEV1 numerically increased by more than those of the control group. This may be interpreted
as meaning that CERE is not expected to have an immediate effect that improves pulmonary
function but may have a positive influence on pulmonary function.</p><p>Reduced respiratory function is a crucial issue in stroke patients; decreased
cardiopulmonary function among different types of damage makes up a large part of the
disorders in chronic stroke patients and acts as an important factor, along with declined
gait and movement ability, in their return to the community after rehabilitation
treatment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the functional gait tests, the changes measured by the
10MTWT to evaluate gait velocity were not statistically significant in either group. In the
6-minute walking test to measure gait endurance, however, the control group&#x02019;s changes were
not statistically significant, whereas the CERE group&#x02019;s changes were. Therefore, the
importance of respiratory exercise in an approach to rehabilitation treatment intervention
for stroke patients was verified, and addition of respiratory exercise to a rehabilitation
treatment intervention program should be considered a priority. Future research needs to
examine the minimum time period required for CERE to cause significant changes pulmonary
function and chest expansion in stroke patients and to include a larger number of stroke
patients with different ages as subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Teixeira-Salmela</surname><given-names>LF</given-names></name><name><surname>Parreira</surname><given-names>VF</given-names></name><name><surname>Britto</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Respiratory pressures and thoracoabdominal motion in
