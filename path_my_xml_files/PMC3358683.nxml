This is unlike coronary intervention without regular exercise. In the two-year follow-up period of the patients, there were fewer cardiac events in the regular-exercise-without-coronary intervention group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></p><p>It is known that in patients with coronary artery diseases, the implantation of a DES reduces the rate of restenosis, compared with the insertion of a bare metal stent. However, there have not been any controlled studies that compared the extent of restenosis after the implantation of the DES in the cardiac rehabilitation group and in the non-cardiac rehabilitation group. There are also no published studies that have compared the extent of the restenosis of different types of DESs based on the findings that cardiac rehabilitation reduced the rate of restenosis after the insertion of a stent. As such, this study compared the extents of the in-stent restenosis between the cardiac rehabilitation group and the control group of patients who had received various types of DESs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients who were admitted to this hospital for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and successfully underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a DES were included in this study. The criterion for a successful PCI was a &#x0003c;30% reduction in residual diameter stenosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or neuromusculoskeletal disease that may disturb the exercise program were excluded from this study. All subjects were asked to participate in the cardiac rehabilitation program through training on the need for cardiac rehabilitation and the contents of the program. The patients who wanted to participate in the cardiac rehabilitation program in a hospital setting were assigned to the cardiac rehabilitation group, and those who did not want to participate in the program, to the control group. Previous studies performed by this author have shown that the most common cause of non-participation in the cardiac rehabilitation program was a lack of awareness (78%), followed by doubt regarding the effect of the program, lack of time, anxiety, prohibitive program cost, difficulty in movement, distance from the patient's home to the hospital, and transportation difficulty. In particular, the causes of discontinuance of the cardiac rehabilitation program were a lack of awareness and the regional and socioeconomic conditions of the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The patients in the cardiac rehabilitation group underwent a pretest that included an exercise stress test at the cardiac rehabilitation clinic of our hospital after they were discharged following a coronary artery intervention. On average, they began performing cardiac rehabilitation exercise 14 days after the onset of the disease.</p><p>For the exercise stress test, the symptom-limited exercise test based on the modified Bruce protocol was used. Based on the maximum and resting heart rates that were measured in the exercise stress test, the heart rate reserve was calculated, and the exercise intensity was set at the target heart rate (40-85% of the heart rate reserve). The objective markers that included the electrocardiographic change, heart rate, and blood pressure (BP) were monitored, and the patient's subjective symptoms during the exercise were monitored based on Borg's rate of perceived exertion (RPE), a subjective marker. Each training session comprised a warm-up (10 min), main exercise (30 min), and cool-down (10 min). The main exercise included a treadmill course (8 min), rest (3 min), ergometer measurement (8 min), rest (3 min), and another treadmill course (8 min). The patients were asked to perform the 50-min exercise program three times a week for 6-8 weeks (for a total of 18-24 sessions), and all the patients and their families were educated on the risk factors, drug therapy, and smoking cessation, and given obesity and nutrition consultations. A blood test, body mass index measurement, BP measurement, and exercise consultation were performed at one- to three-month intervals to ensure that the patients managed their risk factors of coronary artery disease. After 6-8 weeks of the in-hospital exercise program, an exercise stress test was performed to determine the target heart rate and the RPE, based on which another new exercise was prescribed and the patients were asked to continue doing the newly prescribed exercise in a community setting for up to nine months after the onset of the disease. The control group that did not participate in the cardiac rehabilitation program received basic training on the management of risk factors after the onset of the acute coronary artery syndrome risk factors and on exercising; and the patients were left to carry out the risk factor management and exercises on their own.</p><p>The patients in the cardiac rehabilitation and control groups were followed and all received a drug prescription for up to nine months at the cardiac medicine and rehabilitation clinics as outpatients. Both groups underwent coronary angiography with the same cardiologist both at the time of their initial PCI and nine months after the onset of the disease. Based on the groups' minimal lumen diameter (MLD), their diameter stenosis % was measured, and their late luminal loss (LLL) and luminal loss (LL %) at the time of the onset of the disease and at nine months were compared. The criterion for restenosis was &#x0003e;50% of the in-stent diameter stenosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> Next, the patients were further divided into the first-generation stent group (Taxus and Cypher), the second-generation stent group (Endeavor Sprint and Endeavor Resolute), and the third-generation stent group (Xience and Promus), and their in-stent diameter stenosis values were compared using the same markers as those between the three subgroups in the cardiac rehabilitation and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analysis, the SAS Enterprise Guide 4.1 (4.1.0.471) was used. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the cardiac rehabilitation and control groups in terms of their sexes, ages, ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions, proportions of patients with unstable angina, hypertension, diabetes, numbers of cases of dyslipidemia, smoking habits, body mass indexes, left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) at the start of their cardiac rehabilitation, and drug used, as well as their HbA1c values at the start of and nine months after their cardiac rehabilitation. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was also used to compare the number and locations of the affected vessels, number of stents used, and number of stents in each generation (further classified according to the types of DES) in the cardiac rehabilitation and control groups. The response values were ranked using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, which involved multiple comparisons of the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test. The rankings were applied to a one-way ANOVA multiple comparison to compare the diameter stenoses with the three types of stents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics of the subjects</title><p>A total of 103 patients were included in this study, and they were classified into the cardiac rehabilitation group (n=52) and the control group (n=51).

In addition, a study had reported that regular exercise reduced the inflammatory reaction related to the in-stent restenosis in patients with heart failure or CAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> Thus, it is believed that various relevant factors that may induce restenosis should be controlled with an active cardiac rehabilitation program for patients who had undergone coronary artery intervention. This study was performed with patients who had a DES implanted, and we investigated the influence of cardiac rehabilitation-based regular exercise on post-stent implantation restenosis in patients who had a DES implant. A study that compared two types of first-generation DESs, a SES (sirolimus-eluting stent) and a PES (paclitaxel-eluting stent), showed that SES was superior to PES in reducing late loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> and another study reported that there was no difference between SES and PES with regard to late loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> This study compared the late restenoses of first-, second-, and third-generation stents, and found no difference in the restenoses of the three generations in the cardiac rehabilitation and control groups.</p><p>Recently, however, it was reported that the risk of very late thrombosis increased by 0.1-0.6% each year in the DES-implanted group (unlike in the bare-metal-stent-implanted group)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> and that interest in DES-related mortality and late stent thrombosis is increasing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> As such, studies are underway to compare mortality and the recurrence of myocardial infarction in relation to DES. Therefore, a study that compares the diameter restenoses after a short- and long-term follow-up is needed. One study that has demonstrated the relationship between a high level of activity and the proportion of cardiovascular diseases has shown that 3-6 months of high-intensity exercise reduced in-stent restenosis in patients who had undergone coronary artery intervention. The high-intensity exercise was related to the activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (due to the improved vascular endothelial cells), the decreased CRP that promotes arteriosclerosis, and the reduced endothelin-1 production that exacerbates the endothelial cell function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> Likewise, in this study, late luminal loss and late loss were significantly lower in the cardiac rehabilitation group than in the control group, and the number of patients with in-stent restenosis significantly differed between the two groups (n=1 and 8, respectively). Steady cardiac rehabilitation-based exercise capability measurement can assist in the early detection of coronary artery restenosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> and the assessment of the exercise capability through regular measurement of the VO<sub>2</sub> consumption can be the most robust and independent predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> Thus, regular cardiac rehabilitation and exercise capability measurements are considered important for patients who had undergone coronary artery intervention. The limitations of this study are: first, the decision to participate in the cardiac rehabilitation program was left to the patients to decide, and those with a high risk of cardiac crisis were not assigned to the community setting exercise group. Thus, it was impossible to perform a random selection comparative analysis. Second, the difference in the management of various risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking between the two groups was not clearly identified. Third, as the study period was nine months, follow-up time was short. Further studies with long-term comparison of the restenosis of the cardiac rehabilitation group with that of the control group and between different-generation DESs are needed, as are studies on the mortality and morbidity of coronary artery disease. Fourth, this study did not have a large sample, which was also a limitation in the other studies that compared restenosis after the insertion of DESs. In particular, interpreting the results of the studies that compared the diameter restenosis of different generations of DESs is still debatable. Thus, it is believed that randomized controlled studies with more subjects will achieve more objective outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation significantly reduced in-stent late luminal loss, late loss, and percent diameter stenosis, regardless of the type of the ever-advancing DESs.
