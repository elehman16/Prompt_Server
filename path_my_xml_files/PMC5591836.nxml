This is even more challenging in minimally verbal children, who do not have the verbal abilities to learn through usual methods. To address the learning of literacy skills in French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD, we designed the serious game SEMA-TIC, which relies on non-verbal cognitive skills and uses specific learning strategies adapted to the features of autistic individuals. This study investigated the usability of SEMA-TIC (in terms of adaptability, efficiency, and effectiveness) for the acquisition of literacy skills in French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD. Twenty-five children with ASD and no functional language participated in the study. Children in the training group received the SEMA-TIC training over 23 weeks (on average), while no intervention was provided to children in the non-training group. Results indicated that SEMA-TIC presents a suitable usability, as all participants were able to play (adaptability), to complete the training (efficiency) and to acquire significant literacy skills (effectiveness). Indeed, the literacy skills in the training group significantly improved after the training, as measured by specific experimental tasks (alphabet knowledge, word reading, word-non-word discrimination, sentence reading and word segmentation; all <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) compared to the non-training group. More importantly, 3 out of 12 children of the training group could be considered as word decoders at the end of the intervention, whereas no children of the non-training group became able to decode words efficiently. The present study thus brings preliminary evidence that French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD are able to learn literacy skills through SEMA-TIC, a specific computerized intervention consisting in a serious game based on non-verbal cognitive skills.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autism spectrum disorders</kwd><kwd>reading skills</kwd><kwd>literacy skills</kwd><kwd>serious games</kwd><kwd>non-verbal cognition</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="8"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="74"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="11665"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex and heterogeneous disorders, characterized by deficient social communication and by repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition to these core features, intellectual and language levels are the two main prognostic factors for the severity of autism at adult age (Howlin et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>It is widely recognized that about 30% of children with ASD remain minimally verbal after age 6, even after receiving years of behavioral, developmental and educational interventions (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Although there is a lack of consensus, minimally verbal school-aged children are characterized by the use of a very limited repertoire (less than 20 functional words) of spoken, non-echoed or scripted language for the purpose of communication (Kasari et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Because of their poor verbal communication, some of these children are sometimes considered as &#x0201c;low-functioning,&#x0201d; due to difficulties in performing classical assessments of global cognitive skills. However, minimally verbal children with ASD are not necessarily characterized by severe levels of intellectual disability (Tager-Flusberg and Kasari, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Due to the peculiarities of ASD, many children experience significant difficulties in learning to read (Ramdoss et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the access to new knowledge can thus be challenging. Indeed, reading is traditionally regarded as &#x0201c;the most important academic skill learned in school&#x0201d; (Mastropieri and Scruggs, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Nation et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) because children &#x0201c;learn to read&#x0201d; so that they can &#x0201c;read to learn.&#x0201d;</p><p>In children with typical development, it is assumed that spoken language emerges before the ability to read, thus making efficient oral language one of the most important predictive factors for successful reading skills (Miranda, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Muter et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Clarke et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Nation et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; St Clair et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>The Simple View of Reading proposes that reading comprehension implies both word recognition and oral language comprehension (Hoover and Gough, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). These literacy skills may indeed include phonological awareness (i.e., the ability to identify and manipulate sounds in speech), phonics (i.e., the knowledge of letter&#x02013;sound correspondences and their use in reading and spelling, decoding unfamiliar words), fluency (i.e., reading with speed, accuracy, and proper expression), vocabulary (i.e., the understanding of word meanings), and comprehension (i.e., the construction of meaning from text). Other important factors for successful reading consist of non-verbal cognitive abilities (Howlin et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lidstone et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), literacy basic knowledge, and motivation (Becker et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In line with these ideas, children with typical development are classically taught to read by decoding words through the recognition and the manipulation of the correspondence between letters and sounds (Randi et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>However, it appears that the learning to read is complex in children with ASD, with large discrepancies among individuals concerning their reading skills (Nation et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Newman et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Jones et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Lindgren et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). While their decoding skills are often described as correct, although heterogenous (Nation et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), reading comprehension skills are usually poor in individuals with ASD (Jones et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Huemer and Mann, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ricketts et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Letter-sound correspondence and phonemic awareness are indeed considered as critical skills in children at risk of reading difficulties (Benedek-Wood et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The learning of reading in minimally verbal children with ASD is even more complex, because of their lack of oral language skills. Consequently, very few of these children succeed in developing literacy skills beyond sight word recognition (Vacca, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Indeed, very little research and learning interventions do exist in this population (Mucchetti, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), even though literacy skill acquisition might be a support for minimally verbal children with ASD to access opportunities for greater academic performance, and may contribute to improve their communication (Benedek-Wood et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, it was found that some individuals with ASD were able to read and write meaningfully despite the absence of spoken language (Goh et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, minimally verbal children with ASD have cognitive potential other than verbal-based skills (Munson et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Courchesne et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), including efficient spatial cognition (Edgin and Pennington, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and good memory for material with low levels of structure (Williams et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Analogical reasoning (Morsanyi and Holyoak, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and implicit learning (Barnes et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Brown et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Nemeth et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) even appear as cognitive peaks in people with ASD, independently of the overall IQ.</p><p>Previous studies support the idea of an advantage for visual-graphical than for phonological processes in individuals with ASD (Kamio and Toichi, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Koshino et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In addition, individuals with ASD rely more on visual imagery to understand sentences than individuals without ASD, suggesting that they may employ visual thinking to compensate for language limitations (Kana et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It has also been suggested that the functioning of neural networks that underlie the visual decoding of words may be enhanced in individuals with ASD (Grigorenko et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In line with these studies, recent evidence suggests that not only oral language performance, but also non-verbal cognition plays a significant role in meaning-related emergent literacy skills in children with ASD (Westerveld et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These findings may provide the basis to develop new ways of teaching academic knowledge&#x02014;such as literacy skills&#x02014;in minimally verbal children with ASD relying mainly on their non-verbal abilities and not on phonological processes. Recent animal studies suggested that literacy skills can be learned without the implication of any phonological abilities. Grainger et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) demonstrated that baboons can learn the statistics of letter co-occurrence inherent in the English language, so that they become able to distinguish between written words and non-words. The Visual Word Form Area in the left occipito-temporal sulcus region is selectively activated when reading written characters, and not when recognizing spoken words.</p><p>Previous literature reviews underline the need of specialized reading instruction interventions in order to improve the reading abilities of children with ASD, targeting both code-focused and meaning-focused reading instructions (Whalon et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tager-Flusberg and Kasari, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In contrast, the interest of sight word reading approach for children with ASD with cognitive and verbal limitations should not be neglected, as sight word instruction allow the identification of printed words (Spector, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Indeed, while identifying sounds in words, mapping them to corresponding letters and combining sounds together to form words should be possible regardless of the IQ of children with ASD (Tjus et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Browder et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), it appears much more complex for children with ASD with verbal limitations (Whalon et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Alternative approaches, not relying on phonological processes, appear thus necessary in this specific population. However so far, most literacy instructions have focused on isolated skills, in decontextualized, behavioral approaches (Katims, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Moreover, only few studies addressed basic literacy and skills in minimally verbal children with ASD, while a recent study focusing on teaching key pre-verbal skills suggested that teaching reading and writing skills might be possible even in non-verbal children with severe ASD (Goh et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the only computer-assisted intervention which has been used so far in non-verbal children with ASD.</p><p>Indeed, to date, only few computer-based interventions are used in teaching literacy skills and academic skills in children with ASD, and their effects are limited and inconsistent (see Ramdoss et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Knight et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref> for reviews).</p><p>To address to these limitations and to provide the opportunity to minimally children with ASD to improve their communication and their global literacy skills, we developed a serious game, named SEMA-TIC, whose approach for the learning of reading is based on non-phonological processes. SEMA-TIC aims at teaching the pre-requisites for reading, i.e., to identify words as logographs and to learn basic syntax, without focusing on phonemic awareness.</p><p>While a video game can be defined as &#x0201c;a physical or mental contest, played according to specific rules, with the goal of amusing or rewarding the participants&#x0201d; (Zyda, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), a serious game can be seen as a video game in which the designers have concealed an educational or training purpose (Stokes, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>It has been observed that children with ASD show great interest in technology and computers, and this interest could be used as a mean to improve their engagement and concentration in academic activities (Williams et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Tuedor, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Based on this assumption, SEMA-TIC has been conceived to provide playful aspects while learning literacy skills. It has been designed based on the following principles: (1) Minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD present spared non-verbal cognitive abilities (Courchesne et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), on which SEMA-TIC relies to teach literacy skills. (2) Individuals with ASD are extreme &#x0201c;systemizers&#x0201d; and prefer organized environments based on logical rules (Baron-Cohen, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Reading consists in applying a complex code, composed by many logical rules accompanied by exceptions. SEMA-TIC thus contains many words supporting the different logical exercises-games to address literacy skills. (3) Individuals with ASD are atypical learners (Qian and Lipkin, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), for whom the storage of specific examples is easy, but generalization to other contexts is difficult. For this reason, SEMA-TIC includes exercises employing specific examples, but also contributing to transfer the newly-learned skills to other domains. (4) Individuals with ASD can rapidly learn new things, provided that they are given opportunity to do that (Mottron et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that extensive exposure to educational materials might be more effective for individuals with ASD than typical forms of teaching (Kourkoulou et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this line, SEMA-TIC contains more than 5,000 words to promote literacy basic knowledge. (5) Children with ASD with spoken language limitations require appropriate interventions based on a non-phonological approach. Previous studies of our own group have shown that serious games without verbal instructions, such as JeStiMulE, can be beneficial for individuals with high but also low functioning autism (Serret et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). (6) Finally, individuals with ASD prefer to use new technologies for educational learning (Ramdoss et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Allen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lorah et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore, the environment developed in SEMA-TIC has been designed in order to increase the attractiveness of the game and the motivation to learn.</p><p>The main aim of the present work was to develop a specific intervention that employed a serious game (SEMA-TIC) to teach literacy skills to French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the usability of SEMA-TIC, defined as the degree at which a product can be used by identified users, its efficiency and effectiveness in allowing the target users to reach specific goals, as well as users' satisfaction in a specific context (Nielsen, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Serret et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Assessments thus addressed three specific domains of SEMA-TIC in French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Adaptability: are these children able to use SEMA-TIC, and is it engaging? (indeed, motivation is a key element for children with ASD)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Efficiency: are they able to progress in the games in a given time?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Effectiveness: does the training allow these children to improve the targeted abilities? We hypothesized that after SEMA-TIC training, a performance improvement would be found in literacy skills acquisition in the training group (minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD which used SEMA-TIC) compared to non-training group (minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD which did not use SEMA-TIC) using experimental literacy skill tasks (alphabet knowledge, word reading, word non-word discrimination, sentence reading and word segmentation).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The second purpose of this study, in relation with the effectiveness of SEMA-TIC, was to compare the results of the two ASD groups on standardized and validated French reading tasks (Alouette reading test, Lefavrais, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref> and ODEDYS, Jacquier-Roux et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) before and after SEMA-TIC training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><sec><title>SEMA-TIC game description</title><p>SEMA-TIC includes (1) word-drawing associations, (2) sentence-3D animation associations (3) logical games with words and (4) logical games without verbal instructions (neither oral nor written). Its design allows children to discover the game using a trial and error strategy. SEMA-TIC was conceived as a tool to be used by a player accompanied by a trained caregiver and/or a family member. The caregiver and/or families can help the player either verbally, and/or through physical guidance, and/or through demonstration. SEMA-TIC includes a menu where players can discover SEMA-TIC's organization: 3 games designed to learn how to employ the mouse, 10 series of 10 games, a dictionary of letters, words and sentences and caregiver's monitoring (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In order to verify the game reliability, during game's conception a user-test was conducted with reader children with ASD (<italic>n</italic> = 4) who used a prototype version of SEMA-TIC for 1 session; questionnaires were filled in by children's specialized educators, concerning the appropriateness of the game visual interface, the interest for the materials, the relevance of reinforcements, and the ease of use. Children and educators' feedbacks served as input to adapt game features during the game development process.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SEMA-TIC menu.

The difficulty of the games is progressively increased within a series, to promote learning. Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are presented at the end of some games, to verify participants' acquisitions.

As a reinforcement, 3D video animations are displayed after a certain number of successful trials (the number of successful trials to obtain the reinforcement increases through the game progression, and after each game completion). These videos were created based on our clinical experience with children with ASD, and according to children's feedbacks during pre-tests. The videos consist in bright moving objects matching the interests of children with ASD, and allowing to maintain their attention (e.g., fireworks, bouncing balloon, etc.).</p><p>To summarize, these 10 series of 10 games propose a structured, progressive and adapted learning procedure based on nonverbal cognitive skills and without verbal instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>SEMA-TIC content</title><p>SEMA-TIC includes (1) 100 words (9 nouns or adjectives, and 1 verb in each of the 10 series), (2) 50 sentences employing these 100 words, and (3) more than 5,000 words used as distractors (in some of the games). All words were chosen from <italic>Manulex</italic>, a validated web-accessible database which provides grade-based frequency lists of the 1.9 million words found in French elementary school readings (L&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The 100 words trained in the games were chosen according to a number of criteria: (1) word length between 2 and 10 letters, (2) words composed of 1&#x02013;4 syllables, (3) words graphically displayable in pictures (for isolated words) and 3D animations (for sentences). The 100 words were allocated to each series to obtain series of balanced mean word lengths, number of syllables, word frequency in the French language, and by topic (in order to provide coherent sentences using the words in each series). Furthermore, the words were chosen according to the interests of children with ASD, and to their usefulness in daily life. Finally, the choice of the words and sentences was validated based on an inter-professional agreement, based on focus groups including speech therapists, psychologists, teachers and parents of children with ASD.

Each child in the training-group was supervised by a trained caregiver, whose role was to guide the child in his progression in the games and in the series, and to validate the progression from a game to another. Parents' role was to practice the games already done with the caregiver, in order to consolidate learning. Caregivers and parents thus received a specific training about the games mechanics and procedures. SEMA-TIC was installed on a computer in the educational structures of the children (medical education institutes, or specialized home education and healthcare services) and at home with their parents. All training sessions in the educational structure were performed with a caregiver in a quiet room. Training sessions at home were performed with a trained parent. Compliance at home was verified by using home liaison diaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Adaptability assessment</title><p>Adaptability assessment included (1) the ability to use mouse (2) the ability to use the visual menu, (3) motivation to play. After the SEMA-TIC training was completed, each caregiver completed a brief questionnaire to collect information on the perceived acceptability of the intervention by the children. The questionnaire included a 5-point Likert-type scale for 3 questions. The questionnaire asked the caregiver to indicate their level of satisfaction (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>very satisfying</italic>) concerning their perception about the ability of the child to use a mouse, the ability to use the visual menu of SEMA-TIC, and the motivation of the child to play SEMA-TIC.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficiency assessment</title><p>Efficiency assessment was defined as the time required by participants to complete each series once they had learned the game design.</p></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness assessment</title><p>Finally, the evaluation of effectiveness included the performance assessment on experimental tasks and standardized reading tests in both groups, before and after SEMA-TIC training. Participants were tested individually by an independent psychologist in a quiet room with pauses, if necessary.</p><sec><title>Experimental literacy skill tasks</title><p>The experimental tasks were composed of words seen during the SEMA-TIC training as well as new words, never seen in SEMA-TIC. Four tasks were similar to tasks used in the training: (1) alphabet knowledge (upper-lower case associations), (2) word reading (word-drawing associations), (3) word-nonword discrimination (words with 2&#x02013;10 letters), (4) sentence reading (short sentences with subject-verb-direct object). One additional task was created in order to evaluate the transfer of literacy skills to new tasks, and consisted in word segmentation (making separations in a group of letters to form 3 distinct words), thus implying alphabet knowledge and decoding. Two blocks of experimental tasks were scheduled at baseline (pre-test/T0) and after SEMA-TIC training (post-test/T1). To avoid children's frustration, evaluation tasks at baseline only used material of the first series of SEMA-TIC. Evaluation tasks conducted after SEMA-TIC training used material from all 10 series of SEMA-TIC, thus with 10 times more items.

Results are presented in Supplemental File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Validated reading tests</title><p>Standardized reading tasks included two French classical validated tests: (1) the Alouette Reading Test, in which children have to read 5 letters, 10 words, and a text of 265 words which they have to read in 3 min and which includes familiar and unfamiliar words; the test structure was built to avoid lexical knowledge-based guessing (Lefavrais, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>); (2) the ODEDYS, in which participants have to read 60 isolated items, consisting of 20 regular words, 20 irregular words and 20 pseudo-words (Jacquier-Roux et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The Alouette Reading Test has been shown to have a satisfying discriminatory power in distinguishing dyslexic readers from non-dyslexic readers in young adults, with 83.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity (Cavalli et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Unfortunately, to our knowledge no psychometric data exists concerning the ODEDYS.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Study procedure</title><p>After inclusion, all participants were tested on standardized and experimental tasks at baseline, 2 weeks before training. All training sessions of the training-group were conducted with a trained caregiver in the educational structure, and with parents at home. Each week had to be composed of 4 h of training (approximately 2.5 h in the educational structure and 1.5 h at home), although the number and duration of the sessions within some specific weeks had to be adapted for each child (because of life events such as diseases, holidays, field trips). Participants played until they completed SEMA-TIC. Finally, all participants were tested on experimental and standardized tasks 2 weeks after SEMA-TIC training. Game data were collected by the caregiver of each participant. All children continued to follow their individual and institutional interventions (such as speech therapy and behavioral and developmental interventions) as well as special educational pre-school learning during the overall study.</p><p>All procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e V: reference number 13.046, accepted 8th October 2013) and by the French National Security Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM), (trial registration number: 2013-A01024-41 accepted July, 24th 2013). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and their parents prior to inclusion in the study, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were calculated for participant's clinical characteristics. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was performed in order to test for statistical differences between groups for these variables at baseline and after the end of the intervention, at the two-sided significance level of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Because baseline and post-test evaluations had different number of items, we did not analyze statistically the difference between pre- and post-test performance. We hypothesized that while the performance of the training and the non-training group would be similar at baseline, the training group should significantly improve in the experimental literacy skills tasks after the intervention, with no improvement in the non-training group. Standardized tasks evaluations were described with raw scores and standard deviations according to normative data for second grade of regular school on typical readers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Results on adaptability</title><p>Results of the questionnaire suggested that the caregivers judged that 100% of the participants of the training-group were able to use the mouse to play SEMA-TIC.

Results provided evidence that children with ASD were able to handle correctly the computer mouse and to navigate through game menus, and thus to interact appropriately with games mechanics, highlighting their ability to learn new competence in an appropriate learning context. Moreover, one important result concerned children's motivation to play SEMA-TIC. Indeed, according to caregivers, most of the children in the intervention group expressed interest and investment in SEMA-TIC games, expressed satisfaction about items and gameplays of the different games, and showed great interest in the reinforcement videos. Children were reported to produce less stereotyped behaviors, to be less agitated, and to stay longer in front of the computer screen, when playing SEMA-TIC. In line with the principles of a serious game, the strong interest in playing SEMA-TIC observed in our participants confirmed the possibility for children with ASD to access academic skills learning procedures through a fun and computerized system. The children were thus involved in playing the games while promoting the acquisition of knowledge (Stokes, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>SEMA-TIC was conceived for children with ASD with verbal limitations, and thus does not include verbal instructions, so that users with ASD have to deduce games rules by trial-and-error strategies as well as by the repetition of the same games (e.g., similar games throughout the 10 series). MCQ used to validate acquisition during games indirectly allowed to ensure the understanding of games instructions during the progress in SEMA-TIC, indicating that minimally verbal children with ASD played efficiently.</p><p>Concerning the efficiency of SEMA-TIC, the number of training sessions varied from one participant to another, according to individual learning rates. However, all participants achieved the first series after an average of 4 weeks, while they achieved each following series after about 2 weeks, suggesting a better understanding of the games rules and mechanics after an initial discovery phase of SEMA-TIC. These results thus indicate that children in the intervention group were actually able to progress in the games series.</p><p>Remarkably, results concerning effectiveness showed that minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD in the intervention group were able to acquire efficient literacy skills and, most importantly, to transfer their learning to novel materials, as observed in the results on the experimental tasks. They were not only able to memorize SEMA-TIC materials (word and sentence reading tasks), but also to apply simple rules (alphabet knowledge task) as well as complex rules (word non-word discrimination task) taught in SEMA-TIC to new material. In addition, most of the children were able to transfer the knowledge learnt during the training to a novel task, which was not trained (the word segmentation task) and involved alphabet knowledge, literacy conventions, and decoding skills. Moreover, 3 out of the 12 trained participants achieved clinically significant improvements in validated reading tests after SEMA-TIC training, and could thus be considered as efficient word decoders following the study period according to these validated tests (although their performance remained below scores from age-related typical reader children). This result could correspond to an efficient transfer of learning in some of the SEMA-TIC users. It should be noted that two of these children had better spoken language performance than the other children of the training group at inclusion (participants 6 and 9, see Supplemental File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">3</xref>). However, their spoken language level was actually low, as it corresponded to the production of utterance of 3 years old typically developing children, whereas these two children were, respectively, 6.2 and 11.4 years old. Moreover, participant 3 (7 years old) significantly improved his literacy skills after the training and could became considered as efficient word decoder, despite his spoken language level was significantly below the production of utterance of 3 years old typically developing children at inclusion. Thus, improvements in literacy skills could not only be attributed to the initial level of language.</p><p>In addition, none of the children who did not train on SEMA-TIC improved in the validated reading tests and could be considered as an efficient decoder after the study period.</p><p>Taken together, we thus consider these observations as clinically significant evidence for the effectiveness of SEMA-TIC.</p><p>SEMA-TIC aims at promoting basic literacy knowledge of the reading code, and could therefore represent an alternative to the traditional phonics approach. In consequence, it might pave the way for a literacy skills instruction program for minimally verbal French children with ASD, who are often excluded of formal reading instruction at regular school. The 10 SEMA-TIC games were designed based on children with ASD's non-verbal cognitive abilities, including (1) visual memorization, to memorize whole words and sentences, (2) focused attention, for being attentive on details while writing and recognizing words with similar first letter/visual syllable, in order to discover literacy conventions, (3) analogical reasoning, to learn alphabet, root words and the sequence of visual syllables composing words, in order to discover the logical rules of visual reading code, and finally (4) implicit learning, to discover letter co-occurrence inherent in the French language. All these non-verbal cognitive skills, frequently underestimated in minimally verbal children with ASD, have been used to develop specific learning strategies, which appeared clinically efficient in the children involved in this study.</p><p>In contrast to most of the studies conducted in this field, which focused on the training on sight word recognition in children with ASD with significant cognitive disabilities and verbal limitations (Chiang and Lin, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Spector, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ramdoss et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), SEMA-TIC offers more broadly and diversified learning techniques, including visual and logical approaches with letters, visual syllables, words and sentences, in order to promote the learning to read as a visual code solving. To our knowledge, only very few studies addressed literacy skills in minimally verbal children with ASD or the improvements in reading through a nonverbal intervention, while no study so far addressed these two thematic together. Our results are in line with the study of Goh et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which also focused on the training of literacy skills in children with ASD with verbal limitations. Their study included a computerized intervention and similarities in the training, implying nonverbal abilities (i.e., visual sequencing of letters in words, of words in sentences, and noun-verb pairing). Despite important drop-out rates, their results showed significant improvements in experimental tasks of literacy skills. However, to our knowledge, our study is the first to show improvements in validated reading tests in addition to experimental tasks. In line with nonverbal interventions targeting reading skills, a recent study showed that playing action video games (not linked to language or reading) could improve reading skills in dyslexic children, thanks to spatial and temporal attention improvements during the training (Franceschini et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Taken together, these results represent growing evidence for the relevance of targeting nonverbal skills through computerized interventions to improve literacy and reading skills in developmental disorders.</p><p>In summary, our study indicates that SEMA-TIC presents a suitable usability, as all participants were able to play appropriately and to engage in the training (adaptability), to progress in the series and to complete the training (efficiency), and to acquire and improve some literacy skills (effectiveness). The design of SEMA-TIC, which relies on non-verbal cognitive skills to teach verbal skills and implies atypical learning strategies, seems thus to be adapted to minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD for the training of literacy skills. Overall, the results of our exploratory study suggest that French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD are able to understand, to learn and to be evaluated by means of experimental and standardized tasks upon a specific intervention adapted to this population.</p><p>SEMA-TIC appears to provide a great opportunity for children with TSA to access to the learning of literacy skills, and could be used as an alternative to traditional phonics methods. Indeed, several minimally verbal children with TSA became effective decoders through their use of SEMA-TIC, which allowed their caregivers to propose more diversified procedures for learning to read and to address reading comprehension skills. The use of SEMA-TIC also encouraged the teachers to use this serious game with children who were not included in the study.</p><p>Finally, SEMA-TIC has shown evidence to the caregivers that learning through new technologies allow faster, greater and more motivating learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although very encouraging, our results should be considered with great caution, as the current study was exploratory.</p><p>A first important limitation is the absence of randomization between the two groups of children with ASD, as the non-training group could only be constituted after the beginning of the study. Although the initial purpose of our study was to evaluate the usability of SEMA-TIC with minimally verbal school-aged children with autism, a randomized controlled study with homogeneous groups matched on cognitive abilities would provide stronger evidence concerning the efficiency of the training. Moreover, in the present study, the control group did not receive any intervention. Further studies will require addressing this limitation, and proposing alternative interventions to the participants in the control group.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is the definition of the population of minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD, as this definition does not take into account other cognitive abilities (i.e., non-verbal skills). Indeed, our population was recruited based on limited verbal skills but also based on higher non-verbal cognitive skills. Detailed characterization of the children's non-verbal skills would allow a better understanding of the scope and of the efficiency of each game, considering that each game relies on a different combination of non-verbal skills.</p><p>Furthermore, this study concerned the learning of literacy skills in the French language, thus requiring further replications in other languages before generalizing conclusions.</p><sec><title>Perspectives</title><p>Future researches will need to further explore the potential of SEMA-TIC and should focus on (1) investigating precisely the number of sessions needed for efficient learning in each exercice; (2) identifying the cognitive skills in children with ASD which are the most important to efficiently learn literacy skills and to transfer learnings; (3) evaluating the usability of SEMA-TIC in regular classrooms and institutions; (4) assessing the efficacy of SEMA-TIC compared to formal reading instruction programs based on phonological approaches, as well as its association with other supports of reading skills learning (i.e., pictures, books, computer-based applications). SEMA-TIC exercices and mechanics would significantly benefit from these researches, and would thus enhance their learning potential.</p><p>Language processing difficulties limit the psychosocial opportunities of intellectually able autistic people (Howlin et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Previous research suggests the existence of links between reading components teaching and language development such as oral vocabulary acquisition (Cain et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ricketts et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and between the cognitive process of writing and augmentative communication (Koppenhaver and Williams, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). SEMA-TIC helped children with ASD in learning and memorizing word-picture associations (game 1 and 2) and in writing words (game 4), but vocabulary and communication were not assessed in our study. It would be interesting for future research to investigate if playing SEMA-TIC contributes to improve vocabulary and communication in minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD.</p><p>SEMA-TIC enabled the access to academic knowledge such as literacy skills, using specific learning strategies based on non-verbal cognitive skills. We suggest that other academic domains, such as mathematics, could be teached in the same way. Indeed, a recent study showed that the strongest predictor of math problem solving was perceptual reasoning, which is a non-verbal cognitive skill (Oswald et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly, the ability to solve applied mathematical problems is associated with everyday problem-solving abilities and vocational outcomes. Then, it could be interesting to investigate the improvements in problem solving and in the understanding of daily living situations after literacy and mathematical skills training through non-verbal methods.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Reading instruction is as an important academic skill, typically learned at school. It promotes access to knowledge for the developing child, and promotes his inclusion in the society. Each child deserves the best instruction possible to develop his ability to read at the highest possible level. Spoken language limitations and communication impairments in minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD significantly reduce their academic learning exposure at school. SEMA-TIC proposes to these children a specific and adapted basic literacy skills exposure. Indeed, this study provided further evidence that teaching literacy skills to children with ASD is not ineluctably linked to spoken language.</p><p>The findings of our exploratory study suggest that minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD are able to learn literacy skills through a different way compared to typically developing children. Therefore, our results pave the way for novel educational approaches based on theoretical support which has been mostly unexplored in the past: an academic instruction based on visual and logical approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SS, SH, ST, PP, AS, and FA contributed to the conception and design of the study.
