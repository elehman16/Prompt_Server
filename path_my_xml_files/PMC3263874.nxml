Although dietary flavonoids have been shown to reduce CVD risk factors in healthy participants, no long-term trials have examined the additional benefits of flavonoids to CVD risk in medicated postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a parallel-design, placebo-controlled trial with type 2 diabetic patients randomized to consume 27 g/day (split dose) flavonoid-enriched chocolate (containing 850 mg flavan-3-ols [90 mg epicatechin] and 100 mg isoflavones [aglycone equivalents)]/day) or matched placebo for 1 year.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Ninety-three patients completed the trial, and adherence was high (flavonoid 91.3%; placebo 91.6%).

Pharmacological treatment is critical in delaying the underlying progression of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), yet it remains inadequate in preventing the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Gender disparities in the treatment and control of CVD risk factors have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and observational studies suggest poorer metabolic control in women with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), suggesting potential gender differences in the mechanisms underlying disease progression. These data reinforce the need for effective preventative and disease management strategies to reduce CVD risk associated with type 2 diabetes, particularly in women.</p><p>Dietary flavonoids are bioactive constituents, with observational data supporting an association between high intakes of some flavonoid subclasses and a reduced risk of CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In particular, there is growing evidence to support the cardioprotective effects of two specific subclasses, the flavan-3-ols (present in cocoa and tea) and isoflavones (present almost exclusively in soy). Observational studies support the association between high cocoa intake and reduced CVD risk and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and improvements in flow-mediated dilatation, hyperemic blood flow, and blood pressure (BP) have followed short-term interventions with cocoa flavan-3-ols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A growing body of in vitro evidence also supports the potentially beneficial effects of flavan-3-ols on CVD risk, via effects on nitric oxide and glucose transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In Asian populations, where soy is consumed as a staple, increased habitual intake of soy isoflavones has also been associated with a reduced risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and recent meta-analyses suggest beneficial effects of increased isoflavone intake on CVD risk biomarkers and glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes, no long-term trials have been conducted to examine the effects of either isoflavones or flavan-3-ols on CVD risk biomarkers, although the available data from short-term studies (maximum duration 12 weeks in both flavonoid subclasses) are suggestive of favorable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the long-term effects of a combined intervention of these bioactive flavonoids on CVD risk in medicated patients with type 2 diabetes, and given our knowledge of their specific mechanisms of action, there is the potential of synergistic effects. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#x02013;controlled, parallel trial to examine the vascular protective effects of a 1-year combined intervention of flavan-3-ols and isoflavones in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Subjects</title><p>One hundred and eighteen postmenopausal women (no menstruation for &#x02265;12 months), aged 51&#x02013;74 years and receiving standard U.K. care for type 2 diabetes (including statin therapy, established for &#x02265;12 months and glycemic target of HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.0%) were recruited through general practitioners, specialist diabetes clinics, and local media advertisements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Flavonoid extracts were purchased (flavan-3-ols and Acticoa cocoa [Barry Callebaut]; isoflavones and SoyLife40 [Frutarom, Veenendaal, the Netherlands]), and intervention and placebo chocolates were produced by Barry Callebaut, which were matched for macronutrient content, appearance, and taste.

Subjects were advised to exchange the study chocolate with foods of similar nutritional content (total daily intake provided 152 kcal, 10 g fat, and 13 g carbohydrate). Adherence to intervention was determined by counting returned wrappers and objectively assessed through quantification of 24-h urinary total epicatechin (sum of epicatechin, 3&#x02032;-methyl epicatechin, 4&#x02032;-methyl epicatechin, epicatechin-3-sulfate, and epicatechin-methyl-sulfate) and isoflavone (daidzein, genistein, and equol) excretion levels at 6 and 12 months determined by HPLC with mass spectrometric (MS) detection after enzyme hydrolysis using established methods. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for total epicatechin, daidzein, genistein, and equol levels were 7.7, 6.3, 8.0, and 8.1%, respectively, and interassay CVs were 9.1, 11.0, 14.1, and 8.6%, respectively.</p><p>One week preceding and during the 1-year trial, habitual diet and exercise routines were maintained, with the exception of restricting the intake of specific flavonoid-rich foods (a list of which was provided).

Additionally, for 24 h before study assessments, subjects were asked to refrain from caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise. Each volunteer consumed a low-flavonoid meal the evening before each assessment followed by an overnight fast (&#x0003e;10 h).</p><p>At baseline and 12 months, vascular measures were made at the research facility, including 2-h ambulatory BP monitoring (Spacelabs Healthcare, Issaquah, WA), with recordings every 10 min.

Fasting HbA<sub>1c</sub> was assessed by HPLC (A. Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy). LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was determined using the Friedewald equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, plasma/urine aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent analyses. Anthropometric measures (body weight and height) were taken in duplicate, according to standardized protocols. From banked plasma, insulin concentrations were assessed using routine methods (insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The intra-assay coefficients of variation were 2.90% (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), 2.82% (glucose), 1.24% (total cholesterol), 3.01% (HDL-C), 1.43% (triglycerides), and 3.84% (insulin).

To our knowledge, this is the only long-term flavonoid trial that has been conducted in medicated postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes, and these data highlight the additional benefit of dietary flavonoids to standard drug therapy in managing CVD risk in these patients.</p><p>All patients were receiving statin therapy (&#x02265;40 mg simvastatin or &#x02265;10 mg atorvastatin) as part of standard medical care, but flavonoid intervention resulted in further improvements in lipoprotein status, specifically significant reductions in LDL-C and total-C:HDL-C ratio. The observed reduction of 0.16 mmol/L LDL-C is consistent with data from the meta-analysis of short term (maximum 12 weeks) cocoa (&#x02212;0.15 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and soy isoflavone (&#x02212;0.13 mmol/L<italic>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) intervention trials in healthy participants and with the magnitude of change observed in the few short-term trials on soy isoflavones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or chocolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) in type 2 diabetic patients. Our findings do not suggest any additive effect of our combined intervention on lipoprotein status in this medicated group.</p><p>The observed effect is of potential clinical significance. A 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C has been associated with a 21% decrease in vascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), suggesting that long-term flavonoid intervention may be associated with a 3.4% reduction in vascular events. These effects are also supported by in vitro work, suggesting that flavan-3-ols increase apolipoprotein A1 and decrease apolipoprotein B production as a result of upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins and an increase in LDL receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Likewise, isoflavones have been shown to decrease apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cells through multiple mechanisms and may augment the efficacy of statins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>We also observed a significant reduction in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvements in insulin sensitivity (QUICKI) that were driven by a significant decrease in insulin concentrations. These findings are clinically important, as insulin resistance is not only a key determinant of the metabolic syndrome but is also associated with increased arterial stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and risk of cardiovascular events even in individuals with no diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Our recent meta-analysis of short-term cocoa/chocolate trials (&#x02264;4 months duration) also showed that intervention improved insulin resistance (HOMA-IR &#x02212;0.67 [95% CI &#x02212;0.98, &#x02212;0.36]) due to significant reductions in serum insulin, although only 3 of the 42 studies were in patients with type 2 diabetes (A.

However another recent meta-analysis observed no effect of soy isoflavones on measures of glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>); although only 3 of the 24 trials were in type 2 diabetic patients, there was wide variability in source and dose of soy isoflavones fed, and few studies reported changes in HOMA-IR. In another review, only soy isoflavones and genistein exerted beneficial effects on HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). There are supporting underlying mechanisms for these effects; in vitro, flavan-3-ols, isoflavones, and their metabolites enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes through increased expression of GLUT4, and improved insulin secretory function of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Our combined intervention attenuated the UKPDS-estimated, 10-year CHD risk as a result of beneficial effects on lipoprotein status. The UKPDS algorithm incorporates additional risk factors for diabetes (i.e., HbA<sub>1c</sub> and duration of diabetes) beyond traditional risk factors, and, although validation studies have identified a tendency to overestimate CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), it is still considered a useful tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) to compliment other CHD risk assessments. Over half of our study population was on antihypertensive medication, and this may have influenced our lack of effect on BP. In the few previous short-term studies with type 2 diabetic patients, flavan-3-ols alone did not improve BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), although in one study, isoflavones reduced BP in patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on medication for hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This is in contrast to flavonoid trials in participants without type 2 diabetes, where systolic BP and diastolic BP were reduced by short-term flavan-3-ol (by 4.5 and 2.5 mmHg, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and isoflavone intake (by 2.5 and 1.5 mmHg, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. The dropout rate during the intervention was high (21%), with the most frequent reason for participant withdrawal (in both groups) attributable to palatability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>); however, these numbers are comparable to other nutrition trials in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and as observed in other studies, a small number of patients had changes in BP medication during the 1-year trial period (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Our findings also relate specifically to a combined flavonoid intervention given to postmenopausal women receiving standard diabetes therapy (including lipid-lowering medication), and further studies are now required to determine the relative influence of each flavonoid subclass (flavan-3-ols and isoflavones) on biomarkers of CVD risk in this population and to examine whether similar effects are observed in male patients or in other patient groups. Finally, although the flavonoid intake in our trial could potentially be attained through high intake of dietary flavonoid, an emerging range of flavonoid-rich functional foods may offer additional opportunities to consume flavonoids at optimal levels. Despite these limitations, our trial is the longest intervention to date to assess the effects of flavonoids on CVD risk factors in a population of medicated, postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes and benefits from objective assessment of compliance.</p><p>This pragmatic 1-year trial provides evidence to suggest that the intake of flavonoids results in sustained improvements in lipid profile and insulin sensitivity and an attenuation of estimated CHD risk, highlighting the additional benefit of flavonoids to standard drug therapy in managing CVD risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our study is the only combined flavonoid trial and the longest flavan-3-ol intervention to date, and our findings have potential clinical relevance. Long-term studies are now required to determine whether these effects are restricted to populations of medicated postmenopausal women with established type 2 diabetes and to determine whether chronic intake of flavan-3-ols or isoflavones is as effective when consumed independently.</p></sec>
