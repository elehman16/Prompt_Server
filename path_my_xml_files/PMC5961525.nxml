In view of this, the current study was conducted with the hypothesizes: whether the escalated dose of 26 Gy (VBT alone) in comparison with various major international trials (PORTEC-2) has any difference in rates of disease-free and overall survival with fewer adverse effects in low resource setting like India.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><p>An open-labeled, non-inferiority, randomized control trial was undertaken at a regional cancer center among patients with stage IA or IB high-intermediate risk endometrial carcinoma. A total of 50 patients were divided equally among two arms of combined EBRT with VBT (arm I) and VBT alone (arm II). A dose of 50-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions of EBRT with 2 fractions of VBT 6.5 Gy each were delivered to patients in arm I and 4 fractions of VBT 6.5 Gy each to patients in arm II, and were followed up for 60 months.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>During the median follow-up of 36.5 months, two patients developed loco-regional recurrence in arm II, three (arm II), and one (arm I) developed distant metastasis. The 5-year survival rates for arms I and II were 96.0% vs. 92.0% overall, and 88.0% vs. 84.0% disease-free, respectively, and were not found to be statistically significantly different. Dermatological, gastro-intestinal toxicities, and cystitis were lower in the VBT group compared to combined group.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VBT alone is as effective as EBRT+VBT in ensuring loco-regional control and achieving comparable survival rates, with fewer toxic effects for patients with stage I intermediate- and high-risk endometrial carcinoma. The dose escalation did not make a difference in the survival rates and was like in the other major trials (PORTEC-2).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endometrial cancer</kwd><kwd>EBRT</kwd><kwd>vaginal brachytherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Purpose</title><p>Cancer of the corpus uteri ranks fifth among cancers in women worldwide, and accounts for nearly 5% of all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer in women [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries where its prevalence rate is increasing, primarily affects post-menopausal women over the age of 60 years [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The age-standardized rate across all geographic estimates remains 8.2 per 100,000 female populations [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The incidence and prevalence of carcinoma uterus in India, as reported in GLOBOCAN 2012, are 12,325 and 44,980 cases, respectively [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) boost is often performed in patients who are known to benefit from external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) but have a higher risk of vaginal failure. However, there are no randomized trials comparing EBRT+VBT with VBT alone. The knowledge about the efficacy of these two lines of treatment can guide cost-based judgements, which is critical in low resource settings like India [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In different trials, like PORTEC-2 [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], VBT with the dose of 7 Gy &#x000d7; 3 fractions alone did not make a significant difference in the overall or disease-free survival when compared to patients treated with EBRT only. Hence, in the current study, based on trials published before, the dose of VBT was escalated (within the maximum tolerance of vaginal cuff) and compared for any reduction in the loco-regional recurrences, improvement in the overall or disease-free survival with minimal toxicities. The doses delivered were prescribed considering the different dose schedules used in other trials and after considering an expert&#x02019;s opinion [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><p>This was an open-labeled, non-inferiority, randomized control trial. The study was conducted for a period of 60 months from August 2011 to July 2016 in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI), Ahmedabad. Patients aged between 18-70 years, who underwent the surgical procedure (as mentioned below) with FIGO stage I intermediate- and high-risk endometrial carcinoma, consisting of stage Ia (grade II, grade III), stage Ib (grade I, grade II) and stage Ib (grade III), respectively, with no lymphovascular and peri-neural invasions; and patients who had never been treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies with normal hematopoietic parameters, KPS &#x02265; 70, adequate liver and renal functions, and who were willing to come for the follow-up were included in the study.</p><p>Furthermore, patients with history of other malignancy of pelvic organs interfering with the treatment, incompletely surgically staged patients, histology other than adenocarcinoma, and delay of more than 6 weeks for initiation of radiotherapy after surgery were excluded from the study. Detailed blood profile for complete blood count, blood chemistry profile (serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, serum total proteins, albumin) were done. Urine routine and microscopic examination, chest X-ray, ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis were done before starting the treatment; CT scan or MRI of abdomen and pelvis were done only when necessary.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Sampling and sample size calculation</title><p>Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study after obtaining written informed consent from patients and ethical committee clearance from the institutional ethical committee board. First patient was randomly allocated among two arms using a coin toss with heads falling to arm I, receiving pelvic EBRT followed by VBT, and tails falling to arm II, receiving VBT alone. After the selection of the first patient, following patients were allocated systematically to consecutive arms I and II.</p><p>In the previous studies, true hazard ratio (relative risk) of control subjects relative to experimental subjects in terms of loco-regional recurrence was &#x02248; 0.4 [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and median survival time (follow-up time) on the control and experimental arm was 45 months. We planned a study with 1 control per experimental subject, with an accrual interval of 25 months, and additional follow-up after the accrual interval of 35 months. We needed to study 24 experimental subjects and 24 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the difference in experimental and control loco-regional recurrences are equal with probability (power) of 0.8. The type I error probability associated with this test of null hypothesis is 0.05 [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Surgery and histo-pathological examination</title><p>Medically fit patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection of 12-14 in number, para-aortic lymph node dissection, and omental sampling.

In the current study, the loco-regional recurrence and distant recurrence rates were lesser in combined EBRT and VBT arm; however, it was not significant, which shows the importance of VBT as an alternative to EBRT with or without VBT.</p><p>The rates of acute grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicities were significantly lower in the VBT group than in the EBRT group at completion of radiotherapy (12.6% vs. 53.8%) in PORTEC-2 trial [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present study in combined EBRT+VBT group, 30.0% of them developed low-grade GI toxicities, whereas only 2.0% developed low-grade toxicities during the treatment in VBT group. Similarly, during the follow-up, higher percentages of high- and low-grade GI toxicities persisted in combined EBRT and VBT group compared to VBT group. Late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxic effects were reported in 2% patients receiving EBRT and in &#x0003c; 1% receiving VBT, as noted in PORTEC-2 trial [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is in concordance with the present study, where late (low- and high-grade) toxicities were noted more in patients receiving combined EBRT and VBT when compared to patients in VBT group, where the toxicity remained at the baseline. Draghini <italic>et al</italic>. observed acute toxicities among 12.0% patients after administration of VBT. Among those, grade 2 nausea and proctitis (6.0%), grade 2 diarrhea and proctitis (6.0%), and grade 1 late rectal bleeding (12.0%) were noted. No grade 3-4 iatrogenic toxicities were observed in their study, like in the current study. However, these findings by Draghini <italic>et al</italic>. were noted among inoperable cases and differences among the toxicity percentages were observed because of the different brachytherapy techniques used [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sekii <italic>et al</italic>. noted grade 2 rectal bleeding among 5.0% of all patients who underwent HDR brachytherapy for initial recurrence as a salvage option in the vagina for endometrial cancer after definitive surgery with or without EBRT, and there was no grade 3 or higher late complications experienced, which is similar to present study findings in arm II with VBT alone [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Comparing the trend of vaginal toxicities among both the arms, patients treated with VBT alone had higher incidence of high-grade vaginal toxicities during the follow-up of 60 months. Low-grade vaginal toxicities were higher in arm II in the initial 3 months of treatment, however, the reported toxicities were significantly higher from 24<sup>th</sup> month of follow-up in arm I compared to arm II, except at 36 months. On the other hand, high-grade vaginal toxicities were higher in arm II compared to arm I, except at 36 months, and it was significant during 18<sup>th</sup> month to 30<sup>th</sup> month and at 60<sup>th</sup> month of follow-up. During the initial 36 months, the patients underwent multiple dilatations using vaginal dilators, because of which the vaginal toxicity has dropped to baseline at around 36<sup>th</sup> month, after which the dilatations did not make much of a difference. Grade 1/2 mucosal atrophy (vaginal toxicity) increased from 6 months onwards and the increase was significantly more with grade 2 atrophy after VBT than after EBRT [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Grade 3 atrophy (marked atrophy with or without shortening or narrowing) was reported in &#x0003c; 1% patient receiving EBRT and 2% receiving VBT in the PORTEC-2 trial [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in the present study, high-grade vaginal toxicity (grade 3 and grade 4) was significantly higher in VBT group, which could be due to the difference in the total dose delivered in VBT. The most common side effects of HDR intravaginal brachytherapy in a retrospective study by Sourav <italic>et al</italic>. were mucosal telangiectasia, atrophy, stricture, or adhesions, similar the findings in this study [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Laliscia <italic>et al</italic>. also found the most common acute toxicities as vaginal inflammation, dyspareunia, fibrosis, and telangiectasias, like the current study. These findings were noted among cases with VBT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there were no statistical differences in terms of acute or late vaginal toxicities between patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not. The decrease in the vaginal toxicity compared to our study is because of the usage of hyaluronic acid for all the patients.</p><p>During the treatment, 30.0% and 2.0% of patients developed low-grade GU toxicities in combined EBRT and VBT group and VBT alone group, respectively. 12.0% of patients developed high-grade GU toxicities in combined group and none developed high-grade toxicities during the treatment in the other group. In a study by Sourav <italic>et al</italic>., late radiation-induced bladder toxicity was noted in 27.3% of cases and 3.5% patients had experienced grade 3 adverse events.

Since the studies with dose prescribed in the present study (6.5 Gy x 4 fractions) are few, we also have attempted to observe if escalation of dose makes any difference in the survival of patients. The same has been done in a limited resource setting using 2D technique, however, the toxicity profiles are comparatively acceptable as per the observation in the current study.</p><p>The difference in toxicity profile is one of the most important advantages in conduction of regional studies, based on international trials. This difference in toxicities depends on multiple factors. The impact of these factors can be studied by data from multiple small trials like the current ones. In this study, the patients received 6.5 Gy per fraction in VBT but still had toxicity comparable to other international trials. The cause for this will have to be evaluated with further studies. In endometrium carcinoma, only vaginal brachytherapy to the stage I intermediate-risk group improves the patient&#x02019;s quality of life and compliance for the treatment. Unlike in developed countries with extensive support systems for patients, in a developing country like India, the avoidance of EBRT and treating with VBT alone without compromising on the treatment results is more important.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The present study is an open labelled RCT, where blinding could not be adopted because of some feasibility issues. The patients in this study were staged based on FIGO 2009 staging. Though, FIGO staging has been revised in 2010, it is unlikely to affect the trial results. Because of the limitation of the resources at the center, all the patients could only be treated using 2D technique and hence, the dose delivered to the surrounding organs at risk could not be assessed. The recent studies also suggest that if pelvic lymph nodes are negative on imaging then the retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is not necessary, however in the current study, all patients have undergone retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, which may differ the outcome of the study. The study was initially designed to recruit patients for both high- and intermediate-risk group but only 2 patients of high-risk group were accrued; hence, the study could not analyze the treatment outcome in high-risk groups separately. Though, the minimum sample size has been calculated, the study lacks generalizability to all the ethnic groups, therefore, the study needs to be conducted in larger group of patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VBT is as effective as combined EBRT and VBT in ensuring loco-regional control and in achieving the same rates of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with endometrial carcinoma of high- and intermediate-risk. VBT has fewer side effects and better quality of life in terms of toxicity profiles compared to combined EBRT and VBT. However, the benefit of vaginal brachytherapy in terms of survival did not outweigh the combined technique, comparing toxicity profile of the two treatment arms, VBT alone far outweighed the combined VBT and EBRT technique. Hence, VBT alone can probably be the treatment of choice for adjuvant treatment of patients with high- and intermediate-risk endometrial carcinomas. On the other hand, the escalated dose in the current study compared to the other major trials did not make any difference in the disease-free and overall survival [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO.
