muscle training on expiratory muscle activity in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-five stroke patients were assigned to either the intervention group (n=12) or the
control group (n=13). Both groups participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation
program, while the intervention group also received respiratory muscle training for 20 to
30 minutes a day, 3 times a week, for 8 weeks. Surface electromyographic data were
collected from the rectus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique on the paretic
side. Pulmonary function (forced vital capacity) and cough capacity (peak expiratory flow)
also were measured. [Results] Both groups showed a significant increase in muscle activity
after the intervention. However, the intervention group also showed significant increases
in forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow. Comparison of the 2 groups revealed
that the intervention group had greater improvements in pulmonary function, cough
capacity, and muscle activity. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that
combined respiratory muscle training has positive effects on both respiratory function and
expiratory muscle activity in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Combined respiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Occurrence of stroke dramatically reduces patients&#x02019; physical activity as a result of motor
function impairment accompanied by muscle weakening. This increases the CO<sub>2</sub>
sensitivity of the paralyzed muscles and impairs voluntary breathing, inducing asymmetric
respiration<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, hemiplegia
caused by brain injury damages motor control function, which is essential for coordination
of the respiratory muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
respiratory function declines due to muscle weakening and impaired coordination<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The major and minor muscles involved in
inspiratory and expiratory functions are in continuous interaction with the static/dynamic
and intrinsic/extrinsic environments associated with respiration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients show reductions of both maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal
expiratory pressure (MEP) compared to healthy age-matched subjects<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to their importance for ventilation, the
inspiratory and expiratory muscles also are necessary to maintain upper airway patency
through an efficient cough mechanism<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Neuromuscular diseases often cause reductions of MIP and MEP as well as an imbalance of
inspiratory vs expiratory muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In particular, weakening of the expiratory muscles of the abdomen and thorax reduces cough
capacity and sputum elimination, leading to accumulation of respiratory secretion, and
resulting in several respiratory-related complications<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering the preventive function of cough to inhibit foreign
body inhalation and aspiration, voluntary cough is a very important problem among stroke
patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the authors
suggest introducing respiratory muscle training (RMT) as a rehabilitation intervention in
stroke patients.</p><p>Diverse training methods have been applied for respiratory rehabilitation in stroke
patients. Among patients with sub-acute stroke, respiratory re-education training and
inspiratory muscle training (IMT) were found to have beneficial effects on respiratory
muscle function, training capacity, and quality of life<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Enhancement of lung function also was observed among chronic
stroke patients who received inspiratory muscle resistive training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, expiratory muscle training (EMT)
increased MEP in patients with neurologic disease, and improved maximal voluntary cough
capacity in patients with moderate disability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite the numerous studies focusing on improvement of muscle strength via IMT in stroke
patients, there are few studies investigating combined RMT including EMT. However, both IMT
and EMT are necessary to improve respiratory function, such as cough capacity, in stroke
patients.</p><p>The purposes of this study were to measure changes in activity of the expiratory muscles,
including the rectus abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), and external oblique (EO), after
combined RMT in stroke patients, and to assess the effect of expiratory muscle activity on
respiratory function, such as cough capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were 25 stroke patients (intervention group: n=12, control group: n=13)
who had a full understanding of the study and voluntarily consented to participate. Patients
had the disease for at least 6 months. The intervention group comprised 7 men and 5 women
with an average age, height, weight, body mass index and onset duration of 66.17 &#x000b1;
4.08&#x02005;years, 161.87 &#x000b1; 7.79&#x02005;cm, 58.56 &#x000b1; 6.89&#x02005;kg, 22.32 &#x000b1; 1.80&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 17.75 &#x000b1;
4.26 months respectively. The paretic side was left in 7 patients and right in 5 patients.
The control group comprised 6 men and 7 women with corresponding parameter values of 66.08 &#x000b1;
3.70&#x02005;years, 160.53 &#x000b1; 7.20&#x02005;cm, 56.36 &#x000b1; 7.87&#x02005;kg, 21.87 &#x000b1; 2.68&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 18.54 &#x000b1;
4.48 months. The paretic side was left in 7 patients and right in 6 patients. No significant
differences in baseline characteristics were found between groups. Patients were diagnosed
as having stroke via computed tomographic examination and were capable of performing
independent gait. The selection criteria of this study followed the standard of previous
research<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was approved by
the university institutional review board (CUPIRB-2014-023).</p><p>Both groups participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program, while the
intervention group also received RMT for 20 to 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week, for 8
weeks. Combined RMT was performed using a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer (Respironics
Inc.) and threshold positive expiratory pressure device (Respironics Inc.). IMT was
performed by increasing inspiratory pressure in 3 phases (40%, 60%, and 80%), while EMT was
performed by increasing expiratory pressure in 3 phases (10, 15, and 20
cmH<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>A spirometer (Pony FX; Cosmed Srl) was used to measure pulmonary function (forced vital
capacity), MIP, and MEP, while a peak expiratory flow meter (MicroPeak; Carefusion) was used
to measure cough capacity (peak expiratory flow) before applying the intervention in each
group. For accurate measurements, participants were given sufficient explanations and
demonstrations to help them understand before they were assessed in a sitting position with
90&#x000b0; flexion of the hip joint<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Expiratory muscle activity on the paretic side was measured using electromyography (EMG)
(LXM3204; LAXTHA Inc.). Electrodes for surface EMG were attached to the RA, EO, and IO at
locations consistent with previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sampling rate of EMG signals was set
at 1,024&#x02005;Hz. To remove noise from the EMG signals, raw data were processed by bandpass
filtering in the range of 10 to 200&#x02005;Hz, and then smoothed with the root mean square 20&#x02005;ms
after rectification<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
standardization method was used to compare EMG signals between subjects and muscles. The
percent reference voluntary contraction (%RVC) method was used, which references muscle
contraction of a particular movement as the standard<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. With reference to a previous study, %RVC was used to measure
activity of the expiratory muscles for 5 seconds with subjects in a stable state by using
the mean value of the middle 3 seconds and excluding the first and last seconds. Expiratory
muscle activity was measured with subjects in a sitting position with 90&#x000b0; flexion of the hip
joint. Subjects were instructed to &#x0201c;keep the mouth closed for 5 seconds after exhaling the
air out entirely.&#x0201d; They repeated this 3 times and the average value was used for analysis.
Muscle activity during maximal breath holding also was measured, and subjects were given 1
minute of rest after EMG measurement. Measurements were taken immediately before and after
the 8-week intervention.</p><p>Collected data were analyzed using PASW Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc.). Differences
after the intervention within each group were analyzed using the paired t-test, while
differences between groups were analyzed using the independent t-test. Statistical
significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in the variables before and after the 8-week intervention in each group are

stroke deteriorates motor performance capacity and exercise tolerance. Muscle weakening and
impaired coordination further reduce respiratory function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it was reported that strength and endurance of the
respiratory muscles can be restored similar to other skeletal muscles. Functionally similar
problems can occur from muscle weakening, decreased endurance, and accumulation of muscle
fatigue<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the authors
suggest RMT as a solution to these problems.</p><p>Much research has been conducted on RMT to enhance respiratory function in patients with
lung and neurologic diseases. In a previous study, a significant increase in cough capacity
was observed in the intervention group of stroke patients, who received RMT in addition to
therapeutic exercise. This increase was significant compared to the control group, which
received therapeutic exercise alone for 6 weeks<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study comparing the increase in cough capacity in stroke patients, the RMT
group, which received RMT together with therapeutic exercise showed a greater increase than
the control group, which received therapeutic exercise alone or 4 weeks<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings are consistent with our results.
Consequently, although there may be a variation in the extent of impact depending on the
method and duration of training, 8-week combined RMT is expected to positively affect
respiratory function and cough capacity in stroke patients.</p><p>A previous study reported an increase in abdominal muscle activity after RMT in
quadriplegic patients<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, while another
study observed an increase in activity of the EO (8%) and RA (5%) in patients with muscular
dystrophy<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results resemble the
effect of combined RMT on expiratory muscle activity. The increase in expiratory muscle
activity in stroke patients is presumed to improve respiratory function, such as cough
capacity, through lumbar stabilization and increased intra-abdominal pressure, which
eventually helps with sputum elimination and reduces risk of aspiration.</p><p>In conclusion, the authors confirmed the benefits of RMT on lung function and expiratory
muscle activity in this study. In particular, it is assumed that combined RMT, rather than
therapeutic exercise alone, may further improve respiratory function, such as cough
capacity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lanini</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Bianchi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Romagnoli</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Chest wall kinematics in patients with
