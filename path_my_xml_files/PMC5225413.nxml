However, under conformity pressures group members are biased towards exchanging commonly known information, and away from exchanging unique information, thus undermining group decision-making quality. At the neurobiological level, conformity associates with the neuropeptide oxytocin. A double-blind placebo controlled study found no evidence for oxytocin induced conformity. Compared to placebo groups, three-person groups whose members received intranasal oxytocin, focused more on unique information (i) and repeated this information more often (ii). These findings reveal oxytocin as a neurobiological driver of group decision-making processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Whether in politics, governance or industry, decision-making is often delegated to groups. These groups make important decisions that impact the lives of many. Groups have the potential of making decisions of higher quality than individual decision makers when group members open-mindedly contribute and evaluate their own and their fellow group members&#x02019; unique information and insights, and when they constructively discuss doubts, criticisms, and competing scenarios<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Conversely, the quality of group decision-making is often threatened by individual self-censorship along with conformity pressures and excessive need to affiliate with others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Such &#x0201c;groupthink&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> biases individuals away from sharing uniquely held insights and information, leaving the potential for groups to outperform individuals unrealized. Indeed, groupthink has been connected to the Challenger and Columbia Space Shuttle disasters, the collapse of Enron in 2001, and the recent financial crisis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Although the socio-motivational antecedents to group information sharing and decision-making are well-understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, its neurobiological underpinnings are sparsely addressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It stands to reason, however, that critical group decision-making processes and outcomes link to oxytocin, a nine amino-acid hormone and neurotransmitter that is produced in the hypothalamus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Oxytocin has been hypothesized to raise the salience of social cues in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and to shift individuals&#x02019; focus from self- to group-interests in particular<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In agreement with these theories, oxytocin facilitates interpersonal coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; increases positive communication between couples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and raises cooperation towards the in-group in social dilemma settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Yet, these processes do not always result in positive outcomes, as indicated by work showing that oxytocin increases dishonesty to favor one&#x02019;s group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, envy, and gloating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Effects of oxytocin induced group-focus might also not be unequivocally beneficial for group decision-making, but rather depend on the magnitude and scope of such group focus. As stated above, group decision quality tends to benefit from open-minded exchange of ideas and information, during which the quality of contributions is critically processed and monitored. For this to occur group-focus should be moderate. When group-focus is absent and group members are mostly focused on their personal interests, decision quality tends to decrease due to unwillingness to exchange information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> or due to a tendency to distort information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In contrast, when group members are too much focused on their group, they might resort to conformity and shallow compromising by negotiating preferences instead of discussing information, which also decreases group performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>There is some evidence that oxytocin indeed results in such conformity driven decision-making: Under oxytocin people are more likely to conform to their group members on factual<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and judgmental issues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This willingness to align one&#x02019;s opinion to others &#x02013; based on little more than joined group membership &#x02013; suggests that oxytocin might reduce group decision-quality by resorting to quick compromises in which members with a minority preference conform to those members with the majority preference. This type of decision-making process undermines the decision-quality further because information exchange tends to be limited in such preference-driven discussions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>A recent study, however, indicates that oxytocin induced conformity might not be based on simple blind followership but on the careful monitoring of one&#x02019;s own and other members&#x02019; capabilities. Hertz and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> showed that dyads working on a visual search task performed better when given intranasal oxytocin because the less performing group members were more willing to conform to the opinion of the best members, while the best members became less willing to conform to their worse performing partners. Such an effect of oxytocin would be beneficial because adopting views of people with new and useful information increases (group) decision-quality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Whether and how oxytocin influences decision making processes and quality in group decision making is examined in a double-blind placebo controlled experiment in which three-person groups perform a hidden profile task, a well-established group decision making assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <italic>Methods</italic>). In this task, some information is shared by all group members and some information is unique for each group member. In order to perform well, group members should exchange all information &#x02013; with unique information being crucial for identifying the correct alternative. Participants individually read case materials about a murder they had to solve that included, among other things, interviews with three suspects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Next, participants indicated their individual preference for one of the suspects and discussed the case with their two group members using a chat-program. Chats were coded for case-relevant indicators of information exchange and repetition (<italic>Methods</italic>), and group decisions were recorded as &#x0201c;incorrect&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d;.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Treatment was unrelated to age, <italic>t</italic>(112)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.17, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.863, gender &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;114)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.702, and gender composition of the groups, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.27, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.731.

Following group discussion, 74% of oxytocin groups identified the correct alternative, compared to 47% of placebo groups, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.75, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.097, Odds Ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

While increased information exchange and processing in itself can be seen as lack of conformity pressure, we also investigated whether group members switched their preferences during the group discussion. Approximately the same amount of group members switched in the placebo (32) and oxytocin (31) groups, however under oxytocin group members made more correct switches (i.e. from the wrong to the correct suspect; 81%) than placebo group members (56%), &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.33, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038. Moreover, as stated above, prior to group discussion, an equal percentage of groups in both treatments had a two-member majority preferring the correct answer (26% in oxytocin condition). Thus, in three-quarters of the oxytocin groups, conformity pressures should have resulted in incorrect group decisions. However, an overwhelming 74% of all oxytocin groups chose the correct alternative.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions and Discussion</title><p>When groups received oxytocin this resulted in increased exchange and processing of new information. This finding is important because carefully processing and integrating of new information is essential for reaching high quality decisions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Results of our study points in the same direction: After group discussion the solve-rate of oxytocin groups was 26% higher than that of placebo groups. While not reaching statistical significance, this effect on decision quality in combination with significant effects on both information exchange and information processing indicates that decision-making in groups is facilitated by oxytocin. As happens in most decision-making groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, groups whose members received placebo were biased towards the exchange of commonly held information and were less likely to repeat unique information. However, groups whose members received oxytocin had more un-biased discussions and used each other&#x02019;s inputs better.</p><p>These results resonate with recent work showing that oxytocin leads to selective conformity to the best performing member of a team<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. If, as was suggested by previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, oxytocin stimulates quick &#x0201c;uncritical&#x0201d; conformity to the majority opinion in the group, we should have found that oxytocin groups performed worse after discussion. Instead, our results suggest that oxytocin facilitated the exchange and processing of information, raises members willingness to correctly shift their preference during discussion and thus groups seemed to benefit from oxytocin. In the current task group members needed (and were able) to recognize the correct solution &#x02013; based on the combination of their and others&#x02019; information. Consequently, group members were able to adjust their opinion accordingly when confronted with crucial facts. Therefore, our findings apply to information-based group decision-making, in which a verifiable correct solution is available.</p><p>There are cases in which groups have no objectively verifiable solutions and where group decisions are, ultimately, &#x0201c;a matter of taste&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It cannot be excluded that (oxytocin-induced) pressures towards conformity operate more strongly when group decisions are evaluative and opinion-based and have no identifiable solution (as was the case in the earlier cited work on conformity)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, such opinion-based situations might elicit more competition among group members, as people tend to identify more strongly with their personal opinions and preferences, than with more factual information given to them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It would, accordingly, be interesting to examine the role of oxytocin in group-decision making when individuals have stronger motivation to compete than was the case in the currently used more cooperative task<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>Present findings resonate with the more general hypotheses about oxytocin shifting individuals&#x02019; focus from self- to group-interests<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Similar to the task used by Hertz and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, in group decision making the group&#x02019;s outcome is supported by adopting a goal to perform well as a group. Individualistic motives such as proving competence, gaining status, being faster than others and convincing others would undermine group performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In contrast, group performance would benefit from independent thinking (as opposed to conformity). This relates to the finding that oxytocin facilitates creativity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, which can be regarded as a specific type of independent, out-of-the-box, thinking. In addition, group decision-making depends on coordination between group members (e.g., who says what and when&#x02009;?&#x02009;). Studies have shown that under a common goal, oxytocin facilitates brain responses to social synchrony<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and coordinating movements resulting in better performance on a drawing task<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Previous work has shown that trust is a predictor of information exchange<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The current study did not include any data to directly measure trust. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that (part of) our results can be explained by increased trust within groups under oxytocin. Although a recent meta-analysis revealed no overall effect of oxytocin on trust<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, there is evidence that oxytocin does increase trust among individuals that are part of the same group and have are a common task to perform (For a review see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Accordingly, future research should include trust as a potential mediator to explain effects of oxytocin on information exchange in highly interactive groups.</p><p>There are several possible neurophysiological pathways through which intranasal oxytocin operates on brain and behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. One possibility is that intranasally administered oxytocin passes the blood-brain barrier, and directly targets specific regions and networks in the human brain. Indeed, recent work in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> shows brain-level increases in oxytocin following intranasal administration. Another, complementing possibility is that intranasal oxytocin reduces HPA-axis activity and lowers cortisol-levels in body and brain (e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Detecting which pathway(s) are involved is important, also given the present observation that oxytocin may be a key neurobiological driver of information sharing within groups. One important avenue for new research is to focus on the inter-play between oxytocin and other hormones, such as cortisol. Cortisol can interact with oxytocin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and has been related to (risky) decision-making<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We expect such new research to generate novel insights into the neuroendocrine adaptations underlying a range of decisions, including those made in, and by groups.</p><p>Previous research on oxytocin&#x02019;s effects on social behavior has mostly been limited to situations in which participants could not freely communicate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. In these studies social behavior was inferred from reactions to preprogrammed responses, scenarios or (patterns of) choices; communication was not possible, not allowed or limited to exchanging choices via the computer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Few studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> examining the effects of intranasal oxytocin have included unstructured communication and free exchange of information. The current study adds to this work by examining oxytocin in a socially rich context, in which participants met each other before the task and in which they could freely exchange information. In this less controlled yet arguably more realistic setting oxytocin facilitated group decision-making by rendering decision makers more open for others&#x02019; information and more willing to share valuable unique information, thereby underlining oxytocin&#x02019;s role in guiding human social interaction. The current study focused on written, computer-mediated communication without face-to-face contact. Although meta-analytic work has shown that both group decision-making quality and information-exchange does not significantly differ between computer-mediated and face-to-face communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, this does not mean that the role of oxytocin is similar in computer-mediated versus face-to-face communication. Indeed, oxytocin facilitates reading body language, emotion recognition and judging facial-expressions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, all processes that are more relevant in face-to-face settings, than in computer-mediated interactions. Future research should thus extend our findings to face-to-face settings.</p><p>Important decisions may be delegated to groups because of the assumption that &#x0201c;two heads know more than one&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Crucially, these &#x0201c;heads&#x0201d; need to constructively and open-mindedly exchange and build on each member&#x02019;s unique information, perspectives, and insights. Here we have shown that oxytocin, without any evidence of conformity pressure, enhances information exchange and processing within groups, suggesting that these critical group processes have tractable neurobiological drivers such as oxytocin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants, exclusion criteria, and ethics</title><p>Participants were recruited via an online recruiting system and offered a reward of &#x020ac;20 (approx. $22.5) for participating in the two-hour study on group decision-making.

Accordingly, when combining all 24 relevant arguments, suspect A was clearly the guilty suspect, while suspects B and C could be ruled out because of the exonerating clues. However, the 24 arguments were not all openly available to each group member (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).
