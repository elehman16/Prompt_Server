Bone formation is part of a sequential process initiated by a blood clot that is formed and organized into a granulation tissue before woven bone spans the defect space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Woven bone provides a scaffold for parallel-fibred bone deposition, and finally bone remodeling dominates the scene, resulting in lamellar bone. Recombinant platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) can support the process of bone formation, presumably by serving as a mitogen and chemoattractant for mesenchymal cells and by stimulating inflammatory cells such as macrophages to secrete growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This concept has led to a series of preclinical and clinical studies on the beneficial effects of PDGF-BB when combined with bone substitutes that provide a surface for the newly formed bone to grow from the edges into the center of the defect.</p><p>Preclinical studies have suggested that PDGF-BB in combination with deproteinized bovine and equine bone blocks can regenerate significant amounts of bone in severe mandibular ridge defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar approaches have shown that PDGF-BB can accelerate fracture healing in geriatric osteoporotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and enhance healing after bone distraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, there is accumulating evidence from preclinical research that PDGF-BB can support bone formation. From a clinical perspective, the FDA has approved the combination of PDGF-BB and &#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) for the treatment of periodontal defects (GEM21S&#x000ae;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, locally administered PDGF-BB and TCP (Augment&#x000ae;) have been investigated in acute wrist fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and proved to support hindfoot and ankle fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, supplementation of TCP with PDGF-BB is a favorable strategy in regenerative dentistry, orthopedics and traumatology.</p><p>Critical-size rat calvarial defect models have been used to test PDGF-BB together with a chitosan carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, whether TCP and demineralized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) supplementation with PDGF-BB is capable of overcoming the weak osteogenic potential of the rat calvarium remains to be tested. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of PDGF-BB on bone formation in rat calvarial defects augmented with TCP or DBBM after 45&#x000a0;days, by means of histomorphometry and fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and ethics</title><p>Twenty-five Wistar rats (90&#x000a0;days old), acquired from the Animal Center of S&#x000e3;o Paulo State University were maintained at a temperature of 22&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a 12-h light/ 12-h dark cycle with free access to water and rodent food.

By using an aseptic technique, an incision was made through the skin of the calvaria and periosteum, and full-thickness flaps were reflected. Under copious sterile saline irrigation, one 5-mm-diameter bone defect was prepared with a trephine bur (3i Implant Innovations, Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, USA) in each animal. The defect was treated as described above before the periosteum was repositioned and sutured with polylactic acid sutures (Vycril 5.0, Ethicon, Johnson Prod., S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; dos Campos, Brazil).

The samples were dehydrated in ascending grades of alcohol and embedded in light-curing resin (Technovit 7200 VLC&#x02009;+&#x02009;BPO, Kulzer &#x00026; Co., Hanau, Germany). The blocks were processed with the Exakt Cutting and Grinding Equipment (Exakt Apparatebau, Norderstedt, Germany) in accordance with a standardized method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Sections were prepared parallel to the sagittal suture through the center of the defect and reduced to a thickness of approximately 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m before being stained with Levai-Laczko dye. One sample per animal, the centermost section, was subjected to blinded histomorphometric analyses. Stained sections were examined by light microscopy, and digital images were captured with the Olympus DotSlide system 2.4 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Single pictures were assembled and stitched to one another to generate large overview images with a resolution of 3117 pxl/mm. For the final histomorphometric evaluation this initial resolution was reduced to 1559 pxl/mm. A set of rules for the classification of bone and bone substitute materials was created with the Definiens Developer XD 2.1 software (Definiens, Munich, Germany) based on color and morphological differences and the results were manually controlled and corrected in the Photoshop program (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Analysis was restricted to the gap region (TAr) between the two edges of the drilled hole. With the histomorphometry software (Definiens Developer XD 2.1, Munich, Germany) the areas of newly formed bone (nBAr) and bone substitute material (BSAr) were measured in mm<sup>2</sup>. From these primary measurements the percentages of newly formed bone (nBAr/TAr) and bone substitute material (BSAr/TAr) within the total region of interest (TAr) were calculated.

There were no obvious signs of cellular inflammatory infiltrate or foreign body reaction in most of the sections. A large portion of the graft particles remained unchanged and maintained the defect space.

Consistent with these findings, PDGF-BB loaded onto TCP had no effect on new bone formation after 8&#x000a0;weeks in the rat calvarial defect model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, PDGF-BB combined with DBBM failed to improve bone formation after 3 and 5&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. PDGF-BB in combination with allografts did not significantly increase bone formation in supracrestal defects in dog mandibles after 8&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The findings of the present study are also consistent with previous studies showing that PDGF-BB had limited impact on degradation of TCP particles over 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and 8&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although the majority of studies have found beneficial effects of PDGF-BB during bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it should be borne in mind that as yet, there are no clearly defined variables that predict the beneficial effects of PDGF-BB on bone regeneration.</p><p>The authors could speculate that the osteogenic capacity of rat calvarial defects is weak, probably because of the thin calvaria that is the origin of new bone. In support of this theory are the authors&#x02019; data showing no differences in the biomaterial residues between TCP and DBBM. These data were also unexpected because DBBM has a considerably slower degradation profile compared with TCP. Once again, the low turnover situation in rat calvarial defects may hold an explanation for this observation. Overall, bone healing for all groups was limited in this study, compared with other studies conducted with similar observation periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This low turnover situation was supported by the fluorescence staining results at 15 and 30&#x000a0;days post-surgery that were consistent with the histological observation of bone formation, again without visible changes arising from the addition of PDGF-BB. This low turnover situation is a possible explanation why the expected beneficial effects of PDGF-BB on bone regeneration failed in the present study. The rat calvarial defect model may perhaps not be ideal for studying the impact of PDGF-BB on bone formation in the presence of bone substitutes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the pilot study, PDGF-BB loaded onto TCP or DBBM had no beneficial effect on new bone formation after 45&#x000a0;days in the rat calvarial defect model.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statement on ethics approval and consent</title><p>The present study complied with the principles of laboratory animal care and national laws on animal use, and the study was authorized by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Ara&#x000e7;atuba Dental School, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil (protocol # 02402-2012).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Consent to publish</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Availability of data and materials section.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BSAr</term><def><p>Bone substitute material area.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>nBAr</term><def><p>Newly formed bone (nBAr)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDGF-BB</term><def><p>platelet-derived growth factor-BB</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tar</term><def><p>Tissue area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCP</term><def><p>&#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LER, OR and SCK made a substantial contribution to the conception and design of the project and were responsible for the rat surgeries from the beginning of the project to the sample acquisition stage.
