Periodontitis has a multifactorial etiology with the primary etiologic agents being pathogenic bacteria that reside in the subgingival area.</p><p>Treatment of periodontal disease is routinely based on the mechanical debridement of the tooth surface and appropriate and meticulous maintenance of oral hygiene. However comprehensive mechanical debridement of sites with deep periodontal pockets is difficult to accomplish. It alone may fail to eliminate the pathogenic microflora because of their location within the gingival and dental tissues or in other areas inaccessible to periodontal instruments. As an adjunctive approach, systemic or local administration of antimicrobials is used because of the microbial etiology of periodontitis. Since the systemic antibiotics therapy has various disadvantages like hypersensitivity reaction, organ toxicity and development of resistant bacteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and also requires higher dosage to attain required gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) concentration at the target site, this lead to use of local drug delivery system.</p><p>Topical administration of antibacterial agents in the form of mouthwashes, dentifrice or gels can be used effectively in controlling supragingival plaque. Irrigation systems or devices can deliver agents into deep pockets, but are not effective in halting the progression of periodontal attachment loss. As GCF within a periodontal pocket is replaced every 90 s, the effects of antiseptic pocket irrigation are only transient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Local delivery devices are system designed to deliver agents into the periodontal pocket to retain therapeutic levels for a prolonged period of time. The periodic use of local delivery systems in reducing probing depths (PD), stabilizing attachment levels and minimizing bleeding would allow better control of the disease. Controlled release local delivery systems, in which the antimicrobial is available at therapeutic levels for several days, have been evaluated in several forms and using different antimicrobials. Devices that have been developed include fibers, chips, slabs and injectable systems. Different drugs used for local drug delivery are tetracyclines including doxycycline and minocycline, metronidazole and chlorhexidine (CHX). These devices are less invasive treatment options and it requires less time compared to surgical treatment.</p><p>Hence patients with moderate periodontitis can be treated by non-surgical therapy to halt periodontal disease and limit the extent of surgical intervention needed in the future. Patients&#x02019; in whom surgery is contraindicated due to certain systemic factors in those patients local drug therapy is needful.</p><p>CHX is one of the most effective topical agents, long been used as an effective antimicrobial agent. It is an antiseptic, which adheres to organic matter and demonstrates low toxicity when applied topically. Its efficacy as a topical rinse to inhibit dental plaque and gingivitis has been well-established in study periods for up to 2 years without evidence of development of any bacterial resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It has been found to be effective against subgingival bacteria when delivered through a sustained release device. CHX has been shown to be an effective agent in plaque inhibition because it is well-retained in the oral cavity, reacting reversibly with receptors in the mouth due to its affinity for hydroxyapetite and acidic salivary protein.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It has very low systemic toxic activity in humans and has not produced any appreciable resistance to oral microorganism and has not been associated with any teratogenic alterations.</p><p>Short term use of CHX causes a striking reduction in the number of oral microorganisms. In the absence of other oral hygiene measures, CHX has been shown to reduce the number of bacteria in saliva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>In a developing country with a high prevalence of periodontitis, any strategy that arrests or prevents the progression of periodontitis will be definitely useful. There are very few studies available for the use of CHX in gel form as a local drug delivery system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. In the present study, an attempt has been made to evaluate and compare the efficacy of gel containing chlorhexidine digluconate (0.5%) and chlorhexidine dichydrochloride (1.0%) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing with scaling and root planing alone. Digluconate is released immediately and dihydrochloride is released more slowly and over a longer period of time. These are bacteriostatic and bactericidal antiseptics, capable of protecting the treated pocket from recolonization of microorganism for at least 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 subjects, above 30-60 years of age comprising of both the gender were randomly selected and diagnosed as suffering from chronic localized or generalized periodontitis, from the Outpatient Department of Periodontics, K.

The gel is a combination of two CHX formulations: 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate and 1.0% chlorhexidine dihydrochloride incorporated in a saccharidic polymer, xanthan. Cross linking structure of xanthan controls the release of drugs and it exhibits a near zero order drug release. When in contact with water, it forms a three dimensional pseudoplastic reticulum capable of holding and maintaining various substances in suspension. The CHX xanthan based gel undergoes a progressive process of imbibition and is physically removed in 10-30 days. Chlorhexidine digluconate is liberated in the first day and achieves a concentration &#x0003e;100 &#x003bc;g/ml, which is maintained for an average of 6-9 days which is greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for CHX (0.10 &#x003bc;g/ml). Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride is released in the following days and maintains the bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentrations for at least 2 weeks and prevents recolonization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The CHX gel is supplied with a special needle having a blunt tip and a lateral opening. This facilitates the application of the gel without traumatizing or damaging the periodontal tissues.</p><p>Periodontal probing is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools for the clinical assessment of connective tissue destruction in periodontal disease. Increased PD and loss of clinical attachment are pathognomonic for periodontitis and hence, serve as primary parameters in diagnosis of periodontal disease and evaluation the success of periodontal therapy. Results of this study are consistent with the results observed by Vinholis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] when they evaluated the effect of subgingival irrigation with a 1% CHX collagen gel in periodontal pockets as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] observed similar reduction of probing pocket depth with both the group that were treated either by scaling and root planing alone or scaling and root planing with controlled release CHX chip.</p><p>Determining change in attachment level (gain or loss) is a primary measure and one of the most practical methods of determining progression of periodontal disease. The results of this study coincide with the study carried out by Perinetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] who observed more gain of relative CALs in subjects treated with 1% CHX gel as compared to placebo gel. Cosyn and Wyn[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] observed significant additional gain of clinical attachment with sites treated by scaling and root planing with CHX varnish as compared with sites treated by scaling and root planing alone. These results are similar to those obtained in the present study.</p><p>The degree of severity of gingival inflammation can be measured by assessing GI. Furthermore, several investigators have indicated that bleeding from gingiva after light probing is indicative of gingival inflammation and disease activity. Soskolne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] observed significant reduction of GI score with scaling and root planing with CHX treated sites when compared with the control (scaling and root planing) site, which is similar to the observation of the present study. Similar results were obtained in the study by He <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] where significant percentage reduction of GI was observed in the experimental group (scaling and root planing with CHX chip) compared with the control group (scaling and root planing).</p><p>Azmket <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] observed that the PI decreased in both the control (scaling and root planing alone) and experimental group (scaling and root planing with CHX chip). The results of present study are similar to this study. In the present study, the reduction of plaque from baseline in the control and experimental group could be due to greater attention to oral hygiene practice by all the selected participants.</p><p>It is accepted that bleeding upon probing and PD is critical site-specific periodontal parameters evaluating the probability of periodontal disease progression. The observations of the present study are consistent with the findings of Heasman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] who observed mean reduction of bleeding index score from baseline in the experimental group (scaling and root planing with CHX chip) as well as control group (scaling and root planing alone). The result is similar to the results observed in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It can be concluded that experimental local drug delivery system containing 1.5% CHX gel can be effectively used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing and is more effective than scaling and root planing alone in the treatment of periodontal pockets. The experimental local drug delivery system is easy to use, noninvasive and requires less chair side time.</p><p>To elucidate the use of this local drug delivery system in future, a long term study, carried out on a large sample of subjects, is required.</p><p>In addition, microbiological studies can also be used to correlate with the clinical findings observed. An attempt is required to find out the efficacy of experimental material in comparison to other marketed local drug delivery system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>I am immensely thankful to Dr. Sharmila Verma and Dr. Nehal Sheth Dr. Monali Shah, whose invaluable advice and support helped extract the best in me.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Golomb</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Soskolne</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Stabholz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sela</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sustained release device containing metronidazole for periodontal use</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>1984</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>1149</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6589279</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heitz-Mayfield</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Surgical and nonsurgical periodontal therapy.
