Some degree of blood loss occurs after the birth of the baby due to separation of the placenta. This period is a risky period because uterus may not contract well after birth and heavy blood loss can endanger the life of the mother. Active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) reduces the occurrence of severe postpartum haemorrhage by approximately 60&#x02013;70%. Active management consists of several interventions packaged together and the relative contribution of each of the components is unknown. Controlled cord traction is one of those components that require training in manual skill for it to be performed appropriately. If it is possible to dispense with controlled cord traction without losing efficacy it would have major implications for effective management of the third stage of labour at peripheral levels of health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective is to determine whether the simplified package of oxytocin 10 IU IM/IV is not less effective than the full AMTSL package.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A hospital-based, multicentre, individually randomized controlled trial is proposed. The hypothesis tested will be a non-inferiority hypothesis. The aim will be to determine whether the simplified package without CCT, with the advantage of not requiring training to acquire the manual skill to perform this task, is not less effective than the full AMTSL package with regard to reducing blood loss in the third stage of labour.</p><p>The simplified package will include uterotonic (oxytocin 10 IU IM) injection after delivery of the baby and cord clamping and cutting at approximately 3 minutes after birth. The full package will include the uterotonic injection (oxytocin 10 IU IM), controlled cord traction following observation of uterine contraction and cord clamping and cutting at approximately 3 minutes after birth. The primary outcome measure is blood loss of 1000 ml or more at one hour and up to two hours for women who continue to bleed after one hour. The secondary outcomes are blood transfusion, the use of additional uterotonics and measure of severe morbidity and maternal death.</p><p>We aim to recruit 25,000 women delivering vaginally in health facilities in eight countries within a 12 month recruitment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Management</title><p>Overall trial management will be from HRP/RHR in Geneva. There will be eight centres located in Argentina, Egypt, India, Kenya, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uganda. There will be an online data entry system managed from HRP/RHR. The trial protocol was developed following a technical consultation with international organizations and leading researchers in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Expected outcomes</title><p>The main objective of this trial is to investigate whether a simplified package of third stage management can be recommended without increasing the risk of PPH. By avoiding the need for a manual procedure that requires training, the third stage management can be implemented in a more widespread and cost-effective way around the world even at the most peripheral levels of the health care system. This trial forms part of the programme of work to reduce maternal deaths due to postpartum haemorrhage within the RHR department in collaboration with other research groups and organizations active in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTRN12608000434392</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The third stage of labour refers to the period between birth of the baby and complete expulsion of the placenta. Some degree of blood loss occurs after the birth of the baby due to separation of the placenta. This period is a risky period because uterus may not contract well after birth and heavy blood loss can endanger the life of the mother.</p><p>The third stage of labour is managed differently around the world. Over the years two management packages, known as 'active management' and 'expectant management' emerged. The primary aim of active management is to reduce postpartum blood loss as a preventive intervention. In active management (AMTSL) a number of interventions are applied in combination while the expectant management represents a more hands-off style with those interventions used in AMTSL withheld. AMTSL has been defined in various ways and current international definition comprises three components: administration of an uterotonic soon after delivery of the baby; controlled cord traction; and uterine massage after delivery of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) reduces the occurrence of severe postpartum haemorrhage by approximately 60&#x02013;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In previous active versus expectant trials the cord was clamped as soon as possible usually within one minute. However, trials of cord clamping timing have shown beneficial effects on newborn haematological indices leading to the recommendation to clamp the cord at around 3 minutes although the effects on the mother are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The WHO PPH Prevention Guidelines published in 2007 recommended AMTSL defined as the use of oxytocin 10 IU IM/IV after birth, cord clamping at around 3 minutes when the uterus contracts and controlled cord traction. There were no recommendations related to the use of uterine massage in this guideline.</p><p>Unfortunately, the relative contribution of the components of AMTSL to the overall reduction in blood loss is not clearly known. Understanding the contribution of the components of AMTSL to the overall effect in reducing the incidence of haemorrhage could have major programmatic significance since some components require training while others require an efficient drug procurement and utilization system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. At the same time the probability of interaction between AMTSL components should be kept in mind.</p><p>These considerations led to a technical consultation of scientists working in the field of postpartum haemorrhage research in December 2007 to discuss work on a research project to evaluate the effects of different components of AMTSL. Such research is important and timely because some components such as the uterotonic and controlled cord traction may not be feasible in all settings and it is worthwhile evaluating a more simple package with fewer components.</p><sec><title>Systematic reviews of effects of AMTSL components</title><sec><title>Uterotonic</title><p>The uterotonic component of AMTSL seems to be important for the reduction in blood loss after delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Two trials compared oxytocin to nothing without other active management components practiced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and one trial compared oxytocin to nothing with other active management components practiced in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Oxytocin used at 5&#x02013;10 IU seemed to reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage although the other components were not well described.</p></sec><sec><title>Controlled cord traction</title><p>Cord traction was introduced into obstetric practice by Brandt (1933) and Andrews (1940) by the so-called Brandt-Andrews maneuver. The aim is to facilitate the delivery of a placenta that is already separated. In 1962 the term <italic>controlled cord traction </italic>(CCT) was introduced which aims to facilitate the separation of the placenta once the uterus contracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In performing CCT placental separation is not waited and once the uterus contracts the CCT is initiated. The third stage is usually completed in less than 10 minutes when CCT is used.</p><p>There is concern by clinicians, based on teachings from their pre-service education that traction on the cord prior to placental separation may lead to maternal complications such as separation of the cord from the placenta and uterine inversion. There is not a large body of direct evidence for or against effects of controlled cord traction in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>CCT requires training to acquire this manual skill. Evaluation of CCT component is important because if it does not add any beneficial effects it can be dropped from the AMTSL package with important programmatic implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Uterine massage</title><p>Uterine massage is used following delivery in various forms. Between delivery of the baby and the placenta a birth attendant will often put his/her hand over the uterus to ensure that there is no undiagnosed twin, to assess if the uterus is contracting and may rub the uterus to stimulate contraction. The Cochrane review on active versus passive management does not refer to the use of uterine massage as part of AMTSL whereas the FIGO/ICM statement on AMTSL does include uterine massage as part of AMTSL. Evidence that massage contributes to a reduction in blood loss would provide evidence to support the use of this intervention with simple instructions.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom published comprehensive guidelines on intrapartum management on 26 September 2007 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/IPCNICEGuidance.pdf"/> and has made no reference to uterine massage.</p><p>A small pilot trial (n = 200) conducted in Assiut, Egypt, used 'sustained uterine massage' started after delivery applied every 10 minutes and continued for 60 minutes. The findings are promising, since women receiving massage had less blood loss &#x0003e; 500 ml and received less additional uterotonics than women not receiving uterine massage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the two surveys conducted by Prevention of Postpartum Hemorrhage Initiative (POPPHI) massage before placental delivery was practiced in about one third of all deliveries. In the same surveys massage after placental delivery was used in 80&#x02013;90% of women although it was not possible to observe how long after delivery the massage was continued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Williams Obstetrics states "massage is not employed but the fundus is frequently palpated to make certain that the organ does not become atonic and filled with blood from placental separation". In the United States and some other countries, palpating the uterus and massaging if "soft" for the first few hours after childbirth is considered standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In many countries however, no well-defined massage protocol exists. A systematic review to evaluate the effects of sustained uterine massage from the time of birth of the baby currently contains very little evidence to guide practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Other interventions</title><p>One intervention that has recently been included in AMTSL package is delayed cord clamping. There is evidence that delayed cord clamping increases newborn haematological indices in the short term and also has beneficial effects of reduced intraventricular haemorrhage when applied to preterm infants. However, there is almost no evidence on maternal effects especially whether it increases the blood loss.</p><p>Other third stage interventions include squeezing the uterus from the fundus to expel the placenta (Cred&#x000e9; maneuver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], placental cord drainage, umbilical vein injection and variations in timing, dose, and route of above discussed components.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Rationale for selecting the experimental intervention</title><p>An important aspect of AMTSL components is that one cannot assume that each component has no interaction with others. Such interactions could occur for single, double or triple components. The implication is that even if an intervention may not be (as) effective when individually applied it may have effect together with another component. For example, oxytocin and massage could act synergistically.</p><p>The relative importance of all of these uncertainties and the feasibility of evaluating the effects of one or more of the components were discussed in detail at the technical consultation referred above in December 2007. The evaluation of two components namely CCT and uterine massage after placental delivery was given priority. The feasibility of evaluating both interventions in one trial was discussed in detail. Different epidemiological designs such as three-arm and 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design were considered. Evaluating more than one component in a single trial posed particular difficulties. Such difficulties originated from the nature of the intervention(s) (manual procedures being difficult to mask) and the low incidence of the primary outcome measure. The implications of these two factors were resorting to cluster or cross-over cluster designs with added complexity and large sample sizes. At the end of the consultative process evaluation of a package that does not include controlled cord traction was regarded as the highest priority research question among all discussed. The main reason for this conclusion is that currently, the global scale up of AMTSL is limited to those settings where skilled birth attendants are available largely because controlled cord traction (CCT) requires clinical skills training. Considerable training investments are needed to enable health providers to do CCT correctly and safely.</p><p>The presence of a skilled birth attendant is essential in every childbirth. Birth attendants are required for not only basic care during the first and second stage of labour but also in the third stage when haemorrhage risk is greatest and also for the immediate care of the newborn. We aim to identify the relative effect of one component that requires manual skill training. In the most peripheral points of the health system the availability of health personnel with skills to implement the full AMTSL package may be more difficult to ensure in some settings. Therefore, evaluation of whether a simplified package without CCT is non-inferior to the full AMTSL package has both clinical and public health importance. The simplified package is also less intrusive for the mother.</p><p>If it were possible to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a simplified form of AMTSL, dispensing with CCT, it would greatly reduce programme costs associated with training, and enable the intervention to be used by lower level providers, especially in out-of-hospital settings.</p><p>We therefore put forward the hypothesis that a simplified package comprising oxytocin 10 IU IM/IV (with or without uterine massage) is as effective as the full AMTSL package.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective is to determine whether the simplified package of oxytocin 10 IU IM/IV, without CCT, is not less effective than the full AMTSL package with regard to reducing blood loss &#x02265; 1000 ml in the third stage of labour. The hypothesis will be that of non-inferiority within a margin of 0.45 to 0.50%. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, the simplified package without CCT could be adopted, with the advantage of not requiring training to acquire the manual skill to perform this task.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This will be a hospital-based, multicentre, individually randomized non-inferiority controlled trial.</p><p>Each woman will be randomized to receive either the full (AMTSL) package or the simplified package. The blinding of the intervention will not be possible because the comparison includes a manual procedure.</p><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>In order to overcome the variations in the actual practice of AMTSL a working definition was discussed and agreed upon during the technical consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental arm: Simplified package</title><p>The simplified package will include;</p><sec><title>&#x02022; Uterotonic</title><p>Oxytocin 10 IU IM.

The blood loss measurement will continue for one hour regardless of whether the woman is kept in the delivery room or moved elsewhere. If the bleeding continues beyond one hour the blood loss measurement will continue until two hours postpartum.</p><p>Side effects will be recorded by the researcher. Any side effect requiring treatment will be regarded as an adverse event and a separate form will be filled.</p><p>Serious adverse events will be recorded in special forms and will be returned by the local investigators to the trial coordination unit within 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>All women expecting to deliver vaginally at the participating hospitals will be potentially eligible.

Once the envelope is opened the name of the woman will be entered on the log file with the envelope number and that woman is enrolled in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for the non-inferiority hypothesis and for sample size estimation</title><p>The objective of this trial is to show 'non-inferiority' of the simplified package' compared to the full AMTSL package. As such, while superiority would be an added bonus it is not expected and is probably not plausible since the experimental intervention has fewer interventions.</p><p>In the conventional superiority trial, the aim is to determine whether one intervention is superior to another, for example, whether uterotonic is superior to nothing. By contrast, in a non-inferiority trial, the aim is to determine whether an alternative intervention with certain advantages is similar to a gold standard. The full AMTSL package represents the gold standard management strategy for reducing blood loss in the third stage of labour. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a simplified package with fewer components that package has to be compared to the full package to see whether t is "non-inferior" to the gold standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Because proof of exact equality is impossible, a pre-stated margin of non-inferiority (&#x00394;) for the difference in effectiveness has to be defined. The choice of the non-inferiority margin can be made using clinical assessment, which is to a certain extent arbitrary, and needs consensus among different stakeholders. A technique which has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to establish the non-inferiority margin is to look at the effect of the gold standard, in this case the full AMTSL, compared with placebo in historical (past) trials, in this case the expectant management. A reasonable criterion is to preserve 80% of the benefit of the full AMTSL package (considered as 100%) over expectant management (considered as 0%). Preserving a higher percentage (say 90%) will push the sample size calculations very high while a smaller percentage (say 50%) may not be considered acceptable.</p><p>Estimates of blood loss &#x02265; 1000 ml (severe PPH &#x02013; sPPH) with active and passive management were taken from the literature. In addition, unpublished data from several ongoing WHO studies where postpartum blood loss is measured were obtained. Based on those data, a 1.5% risk of blood loss of 1000 ml with full active management was considered realistic and appropriate.</p><p>The expectant management sPPH rate was more difficult to estimate because the data was only available from earlier published trials and blood loss estimation methods and the actual expectant management method differed between trials. Values between 3.0 to 4.0% are considered realistic and used for sample size estimations.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> includes different scenarios for the calculation of sample size, obtained by varying the sPPH rate with expectant management (3.0 to 4.0%) and varying the % retained effect (70% to 80%), assuming a fixed 1.5% sPPH rate for the full AMTSL package. These different scenarios result in different choices of the margin of non-inferiority <bold>&#x00394;</bold>. The total sample size required for a non-inferiority test at the 2.5% level using a two-sided 95% confidence interval and a power of 80% is shown, as well as the power obtained for fixed sample sizes of 20,000 and 25,000.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sample size scenarios</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Blood loss &#x02265; 1000 ml with full amtsl</td><td align="left">Blood loss &#x02265; 1000 ml with Expectant</td><td align="left">Estimated impact of Full AMTSL</td><td align="left">Proportion (of full AMTSL effect) retained by the simplified package</td><td align="left">&#x00394; (Difference to exclude to claim equivalence)</td><td align="left">Total N for 80% Power</td><td align="left">Power with total N = 20,000</td><td align="left">Power with total N = 25,000</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">3.0</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.7</td><td align="left">0.45</td><td align="left">22,908</td><td align="left">75%</td><td align="left">83%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">2.0</td><td align="left">0.75</td><td align="left">0.50</td><td align="left">18,555</td><td align="left">83%</td><td align="left">90%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">4.0</td><td align="left">2.5</td><td align="left">0.8</td><td align="left">0.50</td><td align="left">18,555</td><td align="left">83%</td><td align="left">90%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>A trial of 22,908 women will have 80% power to show non-inferiority of the simplified package within 0.45% of the full AMTSL package sPPH rate (i.e. less than 1.95% sPPH rate), with a level of significance of 2.5% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, row 1). The estimates from the centres that have expressed interest in participating in the trial indicate that approximately 20,000&#x02013;25,000 women can be recruited in a 12 months recruitment period. These centres have collaborated with WHO before and have experience in third stage trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Type of data and data collection procedure</title><p>The trial will be conducted in the labour ward of maternity facilities. All women with anticipated vaginal delivery will be eligible. During the trial period information on the total number of births in the facility will be collected to monitor the recruitment efficiency. Ideally, the participating centres should enroll women 24 hours a day. However, such recruitment may not be possible at all centres.</p><p>The main data collection will be during the immediate postpartum period but women will be followed up until discharge from the hospital to record any additional interventions and complications that may occur. Once the bleeding stops and the woman is ready for transfer to the postnatal ward the researcher will fill the data collection form. After discharge the data collection forms will be completed and the form data will be entered on to the online system. The online data entry will be either at the hospital or country level depending on local capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis plan</title><p>The main analysis will be on an intention-to-treat principle with comparisons made between the 'simplified' and 'full' AMTSL packages for primary and secondary outcomes. An alternative to the ITT analysis (non-ITT analysis, sometimes called 'per-protocol'), that excludes patients not on their intended treatment and/or those who are not protocol-compliant in any other way could bias the trial in either direction, depending on which patients are thus excluded. In non-inferiority and equivalence trials, performing non-ITT analysis in addition to ITT analysis is desirable as a protection from the increase in type I error risk.</p><p>We expect only a small number of protocol deviations because the personnel involved in the study will receive intensive and continuous training and because the trial will be closely monitored by trial investigators and periodically by a Data Monitoring Committee that will look at protocol deviations. Thus, the decrease in power due to exclusions of protocol deviations will be minimal. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that for the proposed sample size, the power is higher than the usually required 80%.</p><p>There may be deviations from the trial protocol if the baby's condition requires urgent action. In such situations the cord may be clamped and cut immediately after birth of the head and if the caregiver is involved in the resuscitation the timing of placental delivery may differ (this could be in either direction). We would expect this deviation to be equally distributed in the two groups. A second type of deviation could occur if a woman who has earlier given consent and randomly allocated to one group withdraws her consent after randomization. The withdrawal of consent after random allocation should be extremely rare since the random allocation will be made when vaginal delivery is imminent We have looked at earlier trials where expectant management was used (because expectant management omits controlled cord traction) and did not find any suggestion that there was a compliance problem with omission of CCT. Nevertheless, the sample size calculation has a margin of additional power as mentioned in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> to ensure that such protocol deviations do not have a negative impact on the conclusions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>CONSORT recommendations in the protocol &#x02013; Checklist for non-inferiority and equivalence trials.
