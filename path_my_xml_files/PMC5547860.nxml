The inclusion criteria for participants were: (1) Those who were able to take part in the weekly rehabilitation program; (2) those who had &#x0003c;30 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score among the patients at least &#x02265;2 years after diagnosis with schizophrenia; (3) those who can respond to the questionnaire; and (4) those who have not received any programs related to gratitude. To prevent the contamination of a third variable, all members of both groups were asked for consent not to participate in program or seminars related to gratitude, read about them, and search for explanatory reasons for them. Participants were excluded from the study if they had comorbidity with diseases such as alcoholism, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>In this study, initial participants were twenty people in the experimental group and 17 people in the control group. Excluded participants included three members who did not take part in this intervention for &#x0003e;2 sessions for private reasons in the experimental group and two members who only responded to the pretest but did not respond to the posttest in the control group. Finally, the participants included in this study were 17 people for the experimental group and 15 people for the control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Gratitude disposition measurements</title><p>Gratitude disposition measurements (Gratitude, Resentment, and Appreciation Test: short GRAT) by Thomas and Watkins[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is the revised questionnaire of 44 items developed by Watkins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and translated by Kim and Yi.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This tool consists of 16 items and 3 subscales (a rich sense, minor gratitude, and gratitude for others).

Three college students from a church located at Incheon were intensively interviewed, using a questionnaire based on the prior studies about the definition, attributes, and function of gratitude, to develop the preliminary program. Elements that were able to indicate gratitude disposition were identified as a rich self-awareness for sense, minor gratitude, and gratitude for others, corroborating previous literature. The program was constructed utilizing emotional and cognitive attributes of gratitude by reviewing the literature and improved with advice from a single nursing professor. Many illustrations were included in the program booklet to induce the participants&#x02019; interest. In addition, we utilized audiovisual materials when providing explanation for gratitude. The process of program, the relevance of contents and intervention method, and the validity of the tool were evaluated in the preliminary program that was conducted on ten schizophrenic patients participating in weekly rehabilitation at the mental health center located in Gyeonggi-do. Based on these results, the pilot program was modified and the final version of gratitude disposition promotion program for chronic schizophrenic patients in community was developed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Construction and contents of the program</title><p>This program focused on reducing depression and improving the quality of life by promoting the gratitude disposition of chronic schizophrenic patients in community. The contents aimed at promoting a rich self-awareness, minor gratitude, and gratitude for others in chronic schizophrenic patients on the basis of the literature related to the gratitude disposition. Learning methods consisted of education, demonstration, discussion, watching movies, role-playing, feedback, and game. Learning media and materials also included videos, multi-media materials, a CD player, and colored papers. A gratitude diary note was handed out to participants and they were given an assignment to write a gratitude diary daily.</p><p>This program consisted of four stages, i.e., the introduction stage, recognition of gratitude stage, expression of gratitude stage, and empathy of gratitude stage. First, the introduction stage aimed to improve the perception of external stimuli and a sense of self-worth. Second, the recognition of gratitude stage promoted determining and understanding general gratitude, the trivial gratitude, and gratitude for others, and learning trivial gratitude and gratitude for others. Third, the expression of gratitude stage emphasized experiencing and expressing the trivial gratitude and gratitude for others. Fourth, the empathy of gratitude stage facilitated conveyance of their experience for gratitude and empathy of the experience of others by reading aloud a gratitude diary that all participants had written from the initial stage of the program [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Construction and contents of gratitude disposition promotion program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsy-59-189-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Application of gratitude disposition promotion program</title><p>This program comprised a total of eight sessions, of 45 min twice a week, for chronic schizophrenic patients in community. It was applied by modifying the preliminary investigation based on the research result that the appropriate treatment time for schizophrenic patients was twice a week, 60&#x02013;90 min,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and provided the intervention in the order being planned, after making protocols of program procedures and contents. The practical assignment that matched the theme of each session was implemented at the end of all sessions. First session, the introduction stage, is a stage that chronic schizophrenic patients understand the purpose and contents of this program and recognize the need to promote gratitude disposition. Second session, the stage of gratitude recognition, is an intervention process for understanding components and characteristics of gratitude. Third session, the learning intervention for recognizing and expressing gratitude in daily situations, was made to share gratitude that they found through discussion after watching part of the movie &#x0201c;Yes Man.&#x0201d; Fourth session, the stage of learning to appreciate the minor things or circumstances of everyday life, is creating awareness of value and expression of gratitude for them. Fifth session, which is the stage of recognizing gratitude of others and giving expression to them, is the intervention of reciprocal gratitude with the help of play format. Sixth session is the stage of gratitude expression for the minor things in the surrounding environment. Seventh session is the stage of gratitude expression facilitating the experience of gratitude of others, with a written gratitude letter to people in control group or others. Eighth session, the intervention to announce their own experience of gratitude and allow feeling of empathy for other's announcing contents, is the stage of gratitude empathy terminating the program by evaluating the change in their own. In addition, it required participants to talk about their feelings and thoughts and check their change through gratitude disposition program for 4 weeks in this session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection of this study consisted of the selection of study participants, pretest, the experimental intervention, and posttest conducted from July 1, to October 30, 2009.

In the introduction of the program, participants were made to describe the experience of the application of the real life related to the topic of all sessions; this centralized attention through a warm-up related to the topic of the session, and introduced the contents of education. We used methods such as education, discussion, demonstration, meditation, watching a movie, role-playing, and feedback in the deployment phase and conducted participants&#x02019; evaluation for the session, giving an assignment (writing a gratitude diary) and guiding for the next session in the termination phase.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Posttest</title><p>Posttest, immediately after the experimental treatment of 4 weeks, was carried out through the survey for gratitude disposition, depression, and quality of life in the same way as pretest to all participants, including the experimental group and control group.

This result was similar to the study result of Emmons and McCullough[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that college students were more optimistic about their life and had an increased sense of subjective well-being by recording five gratitude events once a week; the study result of Kim[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that high school students&#x02019; life satisfaction and positive affection increased by completion of a gratitude program; and the study result of Jo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that improved gratitude disposition and increased life satisfaction in the general adults through writing a gratitude journal. This effectiveness is due to the features that gratitude disposition promotion program consisted of feeling and expressing emotional aspects after learning the cognitive aspects for gratitude at first and included the sessions that recognized and expressed a lot of gratitude for life occurrences, focusing on chronic schizophrenic patients in community who recognize gratitude more easily but had more difficulty in expressing the emotion than general people. It is determined that increasing the experience of gratitude and reminders of it again during the course of life is effective in improving the quality of patients&#x02019; life, as shown by Gordon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that importance of learning and practice was related to the resource of gratitude in one's life. In addition, it is thought that this program achieves higher quality of life, as compared with other existing intervention programs that have been studied for enhancement of quality of life in mentally ill patients. However, in this study, the depressive score of before and after the gratitude disposition promotion program did not differ significantly in the experimental group and the control group. This result differed from the report of Seligman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that five interventions including writing the gratitude letter using internet reduced the depressive level. Furthermore, Kim and Yi[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] determined that gratitude awareness reduced depressive score effectively in college students by writing gratitude event and gratitude letter. The awareness level of depression is due to the difference in response to the patient's level of depression. Furthermore, all the individual's life events that could affect the patients were uncontrollable though patients had BDI score of pretest of &#x0003c; 30 and belonged to severe depressed state that made it difficult to participate in the program while ruling out the variables that could affect the result of this study; in addition, covariance analysis was performed considering that the difference of depressed level between patients could influence the effectiveness of program. No significant difference was observed in this study, but we could not conclude that the effectiveness was negative since there was a certain reduction of depression score before and after the program in the experimental group. Therefore, sessions for emotional expression in program need to be increased because the depressive patients require the outlet for emotion.</p><p>Although this study was conducted in chronic schizophrenic patients in community, it may be limited to a sufficient understanding of the process of chronic illness and its symptoms in each participant. Therefore, we propose in-depth interviews about the patient's disease process in the future studies. We presume that interviews with the participants can enhance their better understanding and may be the basis of individual intervention by identifying information such as their illness, relapse, cognitive level, medication use (current and history), side effects and types of medication, and the type of treatment being performed. In addition, it is necessary to confirm the chronic characteristics and level of cognitive function of the participants by examining them by applying a tool such as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (which can confirm the positive and negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenic patients), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (which is a typical method to measure the execution function). In addition, it is important to look at whether this program has effectiveness on the chronic characteristics and level of cognitive function through comparison of the pre- and post-tests.</p><p>In particular, research participants were free of any other psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, one-session treatment, neurofeedback, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, except intervention related to the contents of gratitude in this study. However, these interventions have considered the possible impacts on the outcome. Therefore, in the future studies, it may be meaningful to view what kind of intervention the patient performed during the study intervention and to view how it affected the result of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In this study, we newly developed a gratitude disposition promotion program for promoting gratitude disposition, reducing depression, and improving quality of life of chronic schizophrenic patients in community and verified its effect. The study results indicated that gratitude disposition promotion program was a useful intervention to raise the gratitude disposition and quality of life of chronic schizophrenic patients in community. This program could contribute to the expansion of schizophrenia research area and reaffirms that a practical application is easy and the utilization is high, from the practical point of view.</p><sec
