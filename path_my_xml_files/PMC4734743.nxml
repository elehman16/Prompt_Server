An important question remains: Do the positive effects from teen smoking cessation interventions seen at up to 12 months post-intervention <italic>endure into young adulthood</italic>? This study examines for the first time whether such positive early effects from teen smoking cessation intervention can endure into young adulthood in the absence of additional intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>High school smokers (n = 2,151) were proactively recruited into the trial from fifty randomly selected Washington State high schools randomized to the experimental (Motivational Interviewing + Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training telephone counseling intervention) or control (no intervention) condition.

Smoking prevalence among teens and young adults continues to be a severe problem, putting young people at risk for a lifetime of smoking and its associated health problems, including premature death. Smoking prevalence in the 18&#x02013;24 age group is 17.8%, second only to that of the 25&#x02013;44 age group (20.1%) [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Finding ways to reduce smoking prevalence among teens and young adults is a high research priority.</p><p>The Hutchinson Study of High School Smoking (HS), the setting for this paper, was the first randomized trial to show the effectiveness of a smoking-cessation intervention in a large population-based sample of adolescent smokers in a non-medical population setting [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Motivational Interviewing plus Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training (MI+CBST) was proactively delivered by telephone to high school seniors who smoke. The cessation endpoint for evaluating intervention impact was six-month prolonged abstinence at one year post-intervention (one year after high school). Results showed that 21.8% of baseline smokers in the experimental condition, compared with 17.7% in the control condition, achieved 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence (difference = 4.0%, 95% confidence interval = -0.2 to 8.1, p = .06), and in particular among baseline daily smokers: 10.1% vs. 5.9% (difference = 4.1%, 95% CI = 0.8 to 7.1, p = .02). Not only was the intervention effective with respect to <italic>impact on smoking cessation</italic>, but also with respect to <italic>reach</italic>: the intervention&#x02019;s proactive approach for recruitment engaged two-thirds of proactively-identified high school smokers in the telephone intervention [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Additional evidence for smoking-cessation effectiveness in teen smokers from interventions that incorporated Motivational Interviewing were reported by two other large randomized trials [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These two trials, conducted in family practice and pediatric clinics, reported statistically significant intervention effects for teen smokers with respect to 30-day smoking abstinence, at a follow-up of 1 and 2 years post intervention, and at 6 weeks and 3 months post intervention, respectively, for the Hollis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] trial and Pbert et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] trials. Commonalities among these two trials and the HS trial included: (1) proactive identification and recruitment of adolescent smokers, (2) liberal definition of smokers that included less-than-daily smokers in addition to daily smokers, (3) personalized multicomponent interventions that included MI. All three trials were able to overcome methodological challenges inherent in teen cessation research [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], so that the design and execution of these trials were rigorous, thereby providing confidence in the findings that the interventions were indeed effective. The sum of the evidence from these three trials point to the short-term effectiveness for adolescent smokers of multicomponent smoking-cessation interventions that include MI.</p><p>Recent reviews and meta-analyses [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which include the three trials mentioned above plus other (mostly smaller) ones, have concluded that interventions that include MI are effective for adolescent smoking cessation at 6&#x02013;24 months post intervention.</p><p>But these promising findings about effectiveness of teen smoking cessation interventions have thus far been evaluated <italic>only for the shorter-term</italic>: at six months to one year post-intervention. An important question remains: Do the positive effects from teen smoking cessation interventions seen at 6&#x02013;12 months post-intervention <italic>endure into young adulthood</italic>? We know of no teen smoking cessation intervention that has studied this important question about durability [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. From a public health perspective the question of <italic>durable long-term effectiveness</italic> is important, because smoking cessation that lasts beyond the immediate post-intervention period is what leads to permanent smoking abstinence and contributes reductions in tobacco-related health problems, disease and premature death. Given the lack of any empirical evidence about long-term effectiveness, we undertook this long-term follow-up.</p><p>Here we report to what extent the positive smoking abstinence results of the HS trial&#x02019;s proactive MI+CBST teen smoking cessation intervention observed at one year post intervention were maintained seven years later when study participants were young adults (~age 25).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The trial&#x02019;s original population of 2,151 smokers, high school juniors in 50 Washington State public high schools, were identified via self-report using a study-administered baseline classroom survey. The baseline survey was designed both to proactively identify smokers for recruitment to the intervention in experimental schools, and to provide baseline data for the trial. (The baseline survey is available as supporting information&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146459.s003">S3 File</xref>.)</p><p>For trial management purposes, the 50 participating high schools joined the study in three groups over three years (referred to as Waves I, II, III). Baseline data collections took place in the period March&#x02013;June in years 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, for Waves I, II, and III.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Consent Procedures</title><p>Because most of the high school juniors were minors at the time of the baseline survey, we sought consent from parents/guardians first. About three weeks prior to the baseline survey, we mailed to the parents/guardians, on high school letterhead and co-signed by the high school principal and the study&#x02019;s principal investigator, an informational letter. The outside of the envelope included instructions to the postal service to return undeliverable mail to the study office. The letter described the study and the survey, the saliva sample procedure, the confidential treatment of the data collected, and the voluntary nature of participation. The letter invited parents/guardians to call a toll-free telephone number with questions or to decline their high school junior&#x02019;s participation in the survey. This passive consent procedure was used to minimize burden for parents/guardians, to provide a reliable and easy way of declining participation for those parents/guardians who didn&#x02019;t want their teen to take part, and to maximize participation rates [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It was chosen for these older adolescents (16- to 17-year-olds), and approved by the Hutchinson Center&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, in accordance with the no-more-than-minimal risk nature of the questionnaire.</p><p>The baseline survey was conducted primarily in school classrooms, with in-class &#x0201c;clean-up&#x0201d; data collections two weeks later for those students who were absent from the initial data collection, and with mail and telephone follow-up for those students who were absent from both in-class data collections. Students were informed about the baseline survey in the following manner: Trained project data collectors presented a scripted explanation of procedures to students at the outset of each data collection class. The in-class explanation of procedures (script), similar in content to the parent letter, was designed to appeal to and be understood by high school students. In particular, the scripted in-class communication told students about the Hutchinson Center, the nature and rationale for the research study, what we hoped to learn from the survey, and a summary of the content of the questionnaire. We told students that their saliva sample could be tested for cotinine, explained that the test for cotinine is accurate and specific for nicotine, demonstrated how the saliva was to be collected (via cotton dental rolls), and assured them that their saliva would not be tested for anything other than cotinine. The script stated that participation in the survey activities was voluntary, and that they could decline all or part of the survey if they wished, and that we would keep their individual information confidential. It also invited students to ask questions, and stated that they could leave some questions blank, opt out of the survey and/or saliva sample, and stop at any time.</p><p>Staff administering the baseline survey informed prospective participants that &#x0201c;Some of you may be invited to participate in future research activities.&#x0201d; Also, the last page of the questionnaire requested contact information, and stated &#x0201c;We may invite you to take part in another activity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;We&#x02019;ll use the information below to contact you to see if you want to take part.&#x0201d;</p><p>Consent for the in-class survey and for the mailed baseline survey was documented by the return of an at-least-partially completed questionnaire and its entry into the study database. For telephone surveys, research project interviewers telephoned a parent/guardian first to explain the survey and its voluntary nature, and to seek verbal consent to talk to their student. If parental consent was provided, then the interviewer sought verbal consent from the student to survey him/her over the phone. Project interviewers documented all verbal consent conversations and consents in the study database. Students who indicated their decline or who returned a blank questionnaire were documented as nonparticipants for that survey. Students who requested no further contact from us were documented as nonparticipants for the survey <italic>and</italic> for the remainder of the trial; in accordance with their request we did not contact them further.</p><p>These data collection procedures, scripts, and the questionnaire were reviewed and approved in advance by the Hutchinson Center&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study Population</title><p>In the 50 schools, 93.1% (12,141 out of 13,042) of all enrolled juniors completed a baseline survey. Of the 901 (6.9%) who did not complete a baseline survey, 524 (4.0%) did not reply to the follow-up telephone or mailed survey after being absent during the in-class surveys, and 377 (2.9%) declined (by their own decision or that of their parents).</p><p>A total of 2175 smokers were proactively identified; 24 (1.1%) declined contact for future activities, leaving 2151 (98.9%) eligible for the trial. These trial participants were 47% female, and 25% nonwhite. Consistent with their being juniors in high school, most were 16 (30.5%) or 17 (62%) years old. (See [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] for more detail about characteristics the original cohort and their high schools.)</p><p>To capture the varied smoking patterns typical of adolescents, baseline smokers were defined as those who reported at least monthly smoking via a positive response to <italic>any</italic> of the following three baseline survey items: (1) How often do you currently smoke cigarettes? (Responded: once a month or more, but less than once a week; or once a week or more, but not daily; or at least daily); (2) Have you smoked one or more cigarettes in the last 30 days? (Responded: yes); and (3) When was the last time you smoked, or even tried, a cigarette? (Responded: 8&#x02013;30 days ago, or 1&#x02013;7 days ago, or earlier today). The steps for identifying and recruiting smokers were identical in the control and experimental conditions.</p><p>A sample of 743 baseline <italic>nonsmokers</italic> were also included in the trial (and in the experimental group for proactive intervention contact). The rationale for their inclusion was to maintain confidentiality of a participant&#x02019;s smoking/non-smoking status, and in particular to ensure that our contacting individuals for participation in the trial would not reveal a participant&#x02019;s smoking status. Nonsmokers received a different, shorter intervention than smokers, to enforce their choice to be a nonsmoker and to give them tips for supporting their friends who want to quit smoking.</p><p>The sample size of 50 high schools and 2151 teen smokers, with a minimum 80% design follow-up to Plus-7, was sufficiently large to accommodate intraclass correlation of outcome in achieving adequate statistical power: It provided 89% statistical power to detect a 6% absolute difference in smoking cessation percentage between the experimental and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec011" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>The HS trial used a two-arm, group-randomized design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146459.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

We mailed letters to the parents of these trial participants in the experimental arm. With the letter was a brochure that described the telephone counseling intervention. The letter emphasized both the intervention&#x02019;s inclusion of both of both smokers and nonsmokers, so that the smoking status of the participants was not revealed, and the confidential nature of all intervention conversations. Parents were requested to provide their written consent, or written decline, on an enclosed consent form, and mail it back in an enclosed postage-paid envelope. For those parents whose consent form was not received by us, project staff telephoned them to invite their questions and to allow them to provide (or decline) verbal consent for their teen&#x02019;s participation. Staff recorded and kept in the Project&#x02019;s secure project database a computerized record of the consent conversation and its outcome.</p><p>For those trial participants who were already 18, parental consent was not required from parents. Nonetheless, we mailed these parents an informational letter about the intervention, and let them know that we would be contacting their teen to invite them to participate in the telephone counseling intervention.</p><p>All 18-year old trial participants in the experimental high schools, plus those under 18 whose parents had provided consent, were then mailed an informational letter and brochure describing the intervention. Within two weeks of this mailing, trained counselors telephoned the trial participant to invite participation in the intervention. The counselors conducted informed consent on the telephone using a documented scripted procedure, informing them of the nature of the telephone conversations, stating that participation was voluntary and confidential, and invited questions. Consent or decline, given verbally over the telephone, was documented both by voice recording and by the counselor&#x02019;s recording of it into a secure project database of the consent conversation and its outcome.

In accordance with the scientific question (long-term impact on cessation), only baseline smokers were followed. The follow-up survey was minimal risk, using questionnaires that contained no sensitive items. Trial participant consent procedures, based on those that we had used successfully in a follow-up survey of young adults in a previous research project, are as follows.</p><p>We sent letters to trial participants that stated: the purpose of the survey, that responses would be kept strictly confidential, that participation was voluntary, and that the trial participant could decline the survey or leave any questions blank. A toll-free number was offered for asking questions about the survey.

Krall et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed a relapse rate of less than 1% after 10 years of abstinence; Wetter et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed annual relapse rates of between 0 and 1.4% for lengths of abstinence beyond six years out to 10 years. All of these findings are consistent with the familiar relapse curve that flattens out to nearly horizontal after 5&#x02013;10 years. Accordingly, six-year prolonged abstinence is a good predictor of permanent abstinence; long-term studies of relapse show very low levels of relapse among former smokers after having been continuously abstinent for such a long period of time [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The trial&#x02019;s Plus-7 endpoint of prolonged six-year abstinence was defined conservatively as consistent reporting of abstinence (bolded, below) on three abstinence items. 1) When was the last time you smoked, or even tried, a cigarette?

Three measures of sustained progress were evaluated: (a) sustained reduction in level of smoking: ie, reductions in smoking frequency number of cigarettes smoked, and number of days smoked in the last month. (Tindle and Shiffman [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] found that conversion from daily smoking to less-than-daily smoking is a predictor of successful quitting.); (b) sustained increase in length of quit attempts; and (c) sustained positive changes in readiness to change, both in Contemplation Ladder [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and in stage of change (from the Transtheoretical Model [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>In accordance with the group randomized design of this trial, the randomization-based permutation method of analysis [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was used for the Plus-7 evaluation implemented by a local coding (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.44485">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.44485</ext-link>) of the permutation method as described in [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Further, because a high level of follow-up (&#x0003e;80%) was part of the trial&#x02019;s design, and to avoid assumptions about imputation of missing data, our analysis plan specified a complete-case analysis: only those trial participants followed to Plus 7 were included in the analyses.</p><p>The random assignment of high schools resulted in good balance of baseline characteristics of smoker trial participants between the experimental and control conditions, with the exception of daily smoking [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because we have had relatively little attrition from our original cohort due to death or decline of follow-up, baseline characteristics were similarly balanced for the surviving cohort who responded at Plus-7.

We see that the percent smoking relapse that occurred between Plus-1 and Plus-7 was large, almost 65% overall, and that relapse was virtually identical for the control and experimental conditions: 64.6% (control) and 64.9% (experimental). In particular, there was no evidence (p = .75, not shown) for baseline daily smokers, the group for which the evidence was strongest of an intervention effect at Plus-1, that the percent relapse between Plus-1 and Plus-7 was greater for experimentals (77.8%) than for controls (64.7%).</p><p>The results for delayed six-year prolonged abstinence at Plus-7 are show in lines 4, 5 and 6 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146459.t004">Table 4</xref>. We see that among those baseline smokers not abstinent at Plus-1 the percent of delayed abstinence at Plus-7 was very low: 7&#x02013;9% overall, and not differing much by experimental condition: 8.6% for controls; 7.2% for experimentals.</p><p>In sum, we see no six-year sustained abstinence as a result of the high school intervention. Instead, there was a high percent of relapse (65%) that occurred throughout young adulthood, between Plus-1 and Plus-7, in both the control and experimental conditions. With respect to delayed abstinence, this was small in both the control and experimental groups, with no evidence of an intervention impact.</p><p>Finally, because it seems unlikely that delayed abstinence could be attributed to the MI intervention, which occurred one year prior to Plus-1, we explored whether or not there is evidence from the HS trial for a &#x0201c;consistent intervention effect&#x0201d; at <italic>both</italic> Plus-1 and Plus-7, which excludes delayed abstinence as a positive endpoint. We did this by considering the restricted outcome &#x0201c;Plus-1 abstinence followed by Plus-7 abstinence&#x0201d; in the subset of the study population (n = 1,584) for whom data were available at both the Plus-1 and Plus-7 follow-ups. Results (not shown) showed no evidence for an intervention effect overall (p = .32), either among daily smokers (p = .79) or among less-than-daily smokers (p = .29), or among females (.26) or among males (.77). This result underscores that the high degree of relapse from Plus-1 to Plus-7, and not differential (experimental vs. control) delayed abstinence at Plus-7, was responsible for the decay of intervention impact from Plus-1 to Plus-7.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>The HS trial was the first adolescent smoking cessation trial to report statistically significant increases in 6-month prolonged abstinence, as measured 12-months-post intervention, in a large population of adolescent smokers in a nonmedical setting [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is also the first to follow the study cohort into young adulthood to ascertain long-term effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>The results of the Plus-7 follow-up <italic>show no evidence of intervention effectiveness on six-years prolonged abstinence as measured at seven years post-intervention</italic>. That is, the intervention impact on smoking cessation observed at Plus-1 was not sustained at Plus-7.</p><p>The effectiveness of the intervention demonstrated earlier at Plus-1 [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was based on a strong definition of quitting: 6-months prolonged abstinence measured one year post-intervention, a high standard for short-term cessation that has been recommended as a preferred measure of abstinence by both the SRNT workshop on measures of abstinence in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the Russell Standards [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Because 6-months abstinence is a substantial period to be without cigarettes, even a single puff, and thus a strong measure of cessation at Plus-1, the results reported here cannot be attributed to use of a weak measure of cessation at Plus-1.</p><p>Several elements of this trial&#x02019;s design and execution contributed to the validity of these findings: (1) large number of high schools (50), and large numbers of trial participant smokers at both Plus-1 (2,151) and Plus-7 (2,105), (2) experimental conditions (intervention, control) assigned via (group) randomization, (3) data collection and endpoint ascertainment conducted per protocol, identical in control and experimental cohorts, (4) tracking, follow-up and contact procedures that resulted in 88.8% response at Plus-1 (1,910 of 2,151 eligibles) and 81.5% response at Plus-7 (1,715 of 2,105 eligibles), and (5) conservative definition of cessation at seven-years post-intervention: ie, six-year prolonged abstinence, measured by consistent reports among multiple survey items.</p><p>A high degree of generalizability of these results to the adolescent smoker population is suggested by (1) the high level (93%) of participation in the baseline survey used to identify smokers, (2) liberal definition of smoker: at least monthly, as determined from <italic>any</italic> of three survey items, and (3) high degree (81.5%) of endpoint ascertainment at the Plus-7 follow-up in young adulthood. A limitation of this study is the results do not pertain to the 18.5% who were not successfully followed.</p><p>The public-health significance of these findings is substantial: whereas there was evidence that the MI + CBST smoking-cessation intervention delivered during the teen years to proactively identified and recruited teens can effectively promote cessation <italic>at one year post high school</italic>, the evidence reported here for the HS trial&#x02019;s seven-year follow-up is that the intervention effectiveness was not sustained into young adulthood. <italic>This finding underscores the unmet need for teen smoking cessation interventions that can affect long-term abstinence into and beyond young adulthood</italic>. New intervention approaches for teen smokers that extend past high school need to be conceptualized, developed, and rigorously tested. Also, the processes by which young adults can relapse, even after a 6-month prolonged abstinence, need to be better understood.</p><p>In sum, to what extent was this MI-plus-CBST smoking cessation intervention for teen smokers effective? The evidence says that the intervention succeeded in effecting six-months prolonged abstinence, at one year post intervention, a notable achievement given this strong abstinence measure. Also, at the follow-up seven years post intervention it succeeded among males in effecting <italic>progress</italic> toward quitting. Two possible processes may be at work: either (1) that the progress among males is real, and would possibly result in greater observed cessation eventually among the experimental male smokers, if they were followed even longer; or (2) that some male smokers were influenced by the intervention to reduce their smoking to the level of intermittent or social smoking, but without a clear commitment to quitting completely.</p><p>Also, it is noteworthy that delayed abstinence at Plus-7&#x02014;ie, six-year abstinence among those who were not abstinent at Plus-1&#x02014;was very low: Even for less-than-daily smokers at baseline who were not abstinent at Plus-1, only 11.0% managed a long-term (six-years) prolonged abstinence on their own in young adulthood; for daily smokers at baseline, only 4% did so. These figures reinforce the need for new interventions that can help teen and young adult smokers to quit.</p><p>Where does teen smoking cessation go from here? What kind of intervention could be hypothesized to have some promise to last not only for the short term, but also for long-term, into young adulthood and beyond?</p><p>Several challenges would need to be overcome. First, smoking cessation is recognized as a complex and variable process [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], with the risk of relapse very high, even after an initial quit lasting six months or more. Moreover, the risk of relapse appears to be highly dependent on changing life circumstances and stressful life events [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Second, successful long-term smoking cessation for teens would need to address and overcome the special developmental processes of young adulthood, characterized by multiple and unpredictable life changes stimulated by young adults&#x02019; exploration and adaptation to new opportunities, difficulties and challenges [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, recent theories of life-span development (eg, [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]) posit that motivations play a key role in the individual&#x02019;s selection and pursuit of goals in response to changes in life-course circumstances (opportunities and constraints, difficulties and worries, success and failures). According to such theories, the individual is an active agent, active in his/her development, adapting to life changes. These processes of young adulthood are rich with changes in motivations, attitudes, interests and life circumstances, which can influence smoking behavior, both in the direction of abstinence and in the direction of relapse.</p><p>To address these challenges, we recommend development and evaluation of a long-term MI+CBST intervention that starts in the adolescent years <italic>and that is sustained</italic> throughout young adulthood, in parallel with (and in engagement with) the processes of young adult smoking cessation and young adult development. (Such an approach is consistent with the chronic disease model for treating tobacco use and dependence [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].)</p><p>In our judgment, multiple factors lend credence to the potential of such a sustained MI+CBST-intervention process: (1) MI&#x02019;s client-centered deferential approach, (2) The flexibility of an MI approach to adjust to client changes: new issues and circumstances, and new motivations, (3) The demonstrated success of proactive MI+CBST in overcoming barriers to recruitment and retention of teen smokers [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], (4) Older teens&#x02019; willingness to participate in counseling calls; indeed, due to participant interest, the average call length during the HS trial was twice what was planned, (5) The in-kind resource of rapport and trust established early in the intervention via MI, between client and counselor, that provides an already-established strong base for productive interactions in a long-term intervention, (6) The inclusion of training in skills for quitting and preventing relapse, so that once motivated, young adults know more about how to quit and are confident in their ability to do so, (7) The demonstrated short-term effectiveness of MI+CBST for teen smokers, (8) Evidence from this trial that at Plus-7 there may be an intervention impact, among males at least, on intermediate progress endpoints (cutting down on smoking, longer length of quit attempts, and increase in readiness to quit), and (9) The spontaneous quitting success, among both control and experimental cohorts, observed at Plus 7, suggesting that young adults want to quit but need help.</p><p>The short-term success of MI+CBST intervention in effecting smoking cessation in teens suggests that extending a similar intervention into young adulthood may decrease relapse among those who quit early in the intervention, and among those who didn&#x02019;t quit early increase cessation later in young adulthood, when circumstances change in response to new life circumstances and motivations.</p><p>We need to learn more also about the process of smoking cessation and relapse during adolescence and young adulthood, building on Hawkins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], Wetter et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], Gilpin et al.

The recent Cochrane report [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on youth smoking cessation stated: &#x0201c;As a complementary measure, long-term prospective studies of the natural smoking history of those making quit attempts in adolescence are needed.&#x0201d; Also, Hawkins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] noted that &#x0201c;a better understanding of smoking abstinence and relapse is needed to inform public health interventions to increase sustainable smoking cessation.&#x0201d; Such understanding would of course be especially crucial for the period of young adulthood, when smoking prevalence is high and the processes of cessation and relapse are especially complex, depending on a host of psychological, social, and external factors related to long-term relapse.</p><p>The most recent Cochrane review [<xref rid="pone.0146459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] stated: &#x0201c;There continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for [youth] smokers.&#x0201d; The results of the HS trial reported here underscore two needs, one concerning follow-up and one concerning intervention. With regard to follow-up, this trial underscores the need for long-term follow-up of those trials of teen smoking cessation that succeed in finding a short-term intervention impact, because a finding in the short-term of an intervention impact does not at all suggest that intervention impact would persist for the long-term. With regard to intervention, youth cessation programs are needed that can effect quitting that lasts throughout and beyond young adulthood. An intervention that incorporates MI and cognitive skills building, with delivery sustained into young adulthood, is recommended for consideration. Research is now needed to test the effectiveness of proactively-delivered interventions&#x02014;using the telephone or new technologies&#x02014;that span adolescence into young adulthood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was no evidence from this trial among adolescent smokers that the short-term effectiveness observed earlier from an MI-based proactive telephone intervention was sustained into young adulthood.
