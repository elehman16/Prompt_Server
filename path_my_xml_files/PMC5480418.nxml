Despite this, there is a lack of high quality evidence supporting medication use after first line benzodiazepines, with current treatment protocols based solely on non-experimental evidence and expert opinion. The current standard of care, phenytoin, is only 60% effective, and associated with considerable adverse effects. A newer anti-convulsant, levetiracetam, can be given faster, is potentially more efficacious, with a more tolerable side effect profile. The primary aim of the study presented in this protocol is to determine whether intravenous (IV) levetiracetam or IV phenytoin is the better second line treatment for the emergency management of CSE in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">200 children aged between 3&#x000a0;months and 16&#x000a0;years presenting to 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand with CSE, that has failed to stop with first line benzodiazepines, will be enrolled into this multicentre open randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to 40&#x000a0;mg/kg IV levetiracetam infusion over 5&#x000a0;min or 20&#x000a0;mg/kg IV phenytoin infusion over 20&#x000a0;min. The primary outcome for the study is clinical cessation of seizure activity five minutes following the completion of the infusion of the study medication. Blinded confirmation of the primary outcome will occur with the primary outcome assessment being video recorded and assessed by a primary outcome assessment team blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include: Clinical cessation of seizure activity at two hours; Time to clinical seizure cessation; Need for rapid sequence induction; Intensive care unit (ICU) admission; Serious adverse events; Length of Hospital/ICU stay; Health care costs; Seizure status/death at one-month post discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This paper presents the background, rationale, and design for a randomised controlled trial comparing levetiracetam to phenytoin in children presenting with CSE in whom benzodiazepines have failed.

It has an annual incidence of 17&#x02013;23 cases per 100,000 children per year, with 22% of patients requiring Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mortality following paediatric CSE is reported at 3&#x02013;5% and neurological sequelae occur in up to 34% of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Management guidelines for paediatric CSE recommend early and prompt use of anticonvulsant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recommendations from the Advanced Life Support Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the Status Epilepsy Working Party in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and major textbooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], are broadly similar and universally adopt a stepwise approach to treatment; 1.Two doses of benzodiazepine; 2.Second line anticonvulsant, with all recommending phenytoin or fosphenytoin; and 3.Final termination of CSE with RSI intubation with thiopentone and ICU admission. While there is reasonable evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in CSE there is a paucity of evidence concerning the type and efficacy of second line anticonvulsant medication used with management guidelines based only on expert opinion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The aetiology and outcomes of CSE in children is different to that of adults, thus adult evidence cannot be expected to be directly applicable to paediatric practice. A large population based study of CSE reported that less than a quarter of the children had a previous history of CSE. Of those with a first presentation of CSE over half were previously neurologically normal, a third of episodes were due to prolonged febrile convulsions, 17% of episodes were due to central nervous system (CNS) infection or acute metabolic derangement, with the remainder of episodes idiopathic or associated with a pre-existing CNS abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The term CSE was traditionally defined as 30&#x000a0;min of a continuous generalised tonic-clonic convulsion or recurrent tonic-clonic convulsions without recovery of consciousness between each convulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently a revised operational definition based on the indication to commence treatment has defined CSE as seizures of a duration of five minutes or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This shortening of seizure duration for CSE definition is due to evidence that the natural history for typical generalised convulsive seizures is to resolve spontaneously by 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min, with those not doing so requiring medication for termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This revised definition has been adopted by recent trials on paediatric CSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Early medication use and cessation of seizures in CSE is important. There is a wealth of animal evidence suggesting that longer seizures are harmful and result in irreversible brain damage and poorer outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">A survey of attending Paediatric Emergency Physicians in Australia and New Zealand confirmed that benzodiazepines are universally recommended for first line treatment in CSE and that 88% would use phenytoin as a second line agent, in keeping with guideline recommendations. However there was a large variation in third line agents, reflecting that the majority of consultants (68%) would try another agent prior to RSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A retrospective review of CSE management at eight large paediatric emergency departments (EDs) in New Zealand and Australia over five years identified 542 patients with CSE and found phenytoin resulted in cessation of seizures in only 60% of the 315 patients who received it as a second line anticonvulsant for CSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This success rate is comparable with other reported series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">In addition to its less than optimal effectiveness, phenytoin has a number of features that make it less than ideal to be used in CSE. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic enzymes resulting in reduced levels of a number of other anticonvulsants and non-anticonvulsant drugs. Its adverse events include hepatotoxicity, pancytopenia and Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome. Phenytoin can cause cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, phlebitis, and severe soft tissue injury from extravasation and purple glove syndrome. Because of its cardiotoxicity it has to be given slowly (1&#x000a0;mg/kg/min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, phenytoin cannot be mixed with dextrose, a common component of paediatric intravenous (IV) fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">In North America fosphenytoin, the prodrug of phenytoin, is increasingly used instead of phenytoin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although fosphenytoin can be administered more rapidly, the additional requirement to be metabolised into the active phenytoin means that it does not offer any true time advantages over phenytoin. However, fosphenytoin has a number of other advantages such as the ability to be administered intramuscularly and decreased infusion related adverse events, although deaths due to fosphenytoin infusions have been reported. Furthermore, there are no data to show that fosphenytoin is more effective than phenytoin in stopping seizures. Importantly, for the purposes of this study, fosphenytoin is neither available nor approved for use in New Zealand and Australia.</p><p id="Par31">Newer antiepileptic drugs such as levetiracetam, valproate and lacosamide have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and have been reported as effective in case reports and small case series in adults and in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The most promising, Levetiracetam, a broad spectrum, antiepileptic drug has been approved for use for over a decade and is widely used internationally for maintenance seizure prophylaxis for both focal and generalised seizure disorders in both children and adults. An IV formulation of levetiracetam is available for those unable to take oral preparations and appears to have an excellent safety profile including rapid IV use in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In adults, IV infusions of levetiracetam have been well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], including at dosages and rates of infusion greater than recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Levetiracetam has the following potential advantages when compared to phenytoin for use in CSE. Levetiracetam is easy to administer and can be given as a five-minute infusion into a peripheral IV cannula without the increased risk of serious adverse events (including hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, extravasation or death). Furthermore, levetiracetam is compatible with both dextrose and normal saline infusion and has limited drug interactions.</p><p id="Par33">On the basis of efficacy from the limited cohort data with levetiracetam, and concerns around low phenytoin efficacy and serious adverse events, IV levetiracetam is being increasingly used as a second line anticonvulsant in CSE in children.

While it is possible that a number of participants may have the &#x0201c;termination of seizure status&#x0201d; misclassified following the study infusion the primary end-point of the study is a pragmatic end-point and reflective of the real clinical world practice and clinical decision points. EEG confirmation of seizure activity is not routinely available in any of the study sites&#x02019; EDs, or indeed internationally in EDs.</p><p id="Par66">In addition, the lack of EEG confirmation of seizure activity may possibly result in some pseudo seizures or seizure mimics enrolled in the study. In reality this is very unlikely and if such conditions were to be enrolled the presence of randomisation will make the effect minimal on the overall study results.</p><p id="Par67">Those assessing the primary end-point are not blinded to the assigned intervention group and it is possible that this lack of blinding could introduce bias. As the two study interventions have different optimal infusion times, manufacturing presentations (vials and ampoules), and due to manufacturing technical difficulties related to phenytoin&#x02019;s high pH we could not instigate a blinded study. However, due to the life threatening nature of CSE it is unlikely that a physician would report that seizure activity had terminated when in fact it had not. Furthermore, the independent video confirmation of the primary outcome assessment will also reduce this possible bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Time line</title><p id="Par68">The study commenced recruitment in March 2015, with the first patient enrolled on the 19th March 2015.
