the outpatients allotted to two of us for examination (SD/SB). With
informed consent, all subjects were subjected for disc evaluation
with the Optical Coherence Tomograph (Stratus OCT&#x02122;<sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, Carl
Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). All patients who met the inclusion
criteria described below were enrolled in this study.</p><p>Each study participant underwent complete ophthalmologic
examination including a medical history review, best-
corrected visual acuity (Snellen&#x02032;s visual acuity), slit-lamp
examination, intraocular pressure measurement (non-contact
pneumotonometry) and dilated fundus examination.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were refraction within &#x000b1;5.0 diopters
of spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure &#x02264;21 mm Hg, no
family history of glaucoma, no systemic illnesses, no anterior
or posterior segment pathology and no history of lasers or
intraocular surgery.</p><p>Normal-appearing disc, cup and neuroretinal rim (disc
anomalies, features of glaucomatous disc and other pathologies
of the disc were excluded) on careful examination of
the optic disc with 90D-aided stereoscopic slit-lamp indirect
ophthalmoscopy, intraocular pressure of &#x02264;21 mm Hg and best-
corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or more were the criteria for
classifying the optic disc to be normal.</p><p>The images were selected on the basis of image quality. Six
subjects were excluded from the study due to poor resolution
in six eyes produced by the OCT machine (the OCT image poor
in red and yellow color).</p><p>After making the above exclusions, 150 eyes of 150 subjects
(15 to 67 years) consisting of 68 males and 82 females selected
randomly using the simple random numbers table, were
stratified for sex, age and refractive error.</p><p>On the day of the hospital visit, the randomly selected
eyes underwent optic disc imaging with the Stratus OCT&#x02122;
(Software version 4.0.1) using the fast optic disc protocol. This
protocol acquires six 4.0 mm radial scans. These line scans are
arranged like the spokes of a wheel centered in the middle of
the disc. For all scans, internal fixation was used as it provides
a higher degree of reproducibility.</p><p>Images were automatically analyzed by the software. The
OCT imaging and quality assessment of the scans were done
by one examiner (SD). Focused ocular fundus video image,
an adequate signal strength (&#x0003e;7) and the presence of linear
scans centered on the disc were requirements for acceptable
quality.</p><p>The Stratus OCT extrapolates between the scans to provide
measurements throughout the optic nerve head. For optic disc
topography, the automated determination of the disc margin as
the end of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was used for this
analysis. The straight blue line which connects the edges of the
RPE represents the disc diameter. The cup diameter is denoted
by a parallel red line constructed 150 &#x000b5;m anterior to the disc
diameter. Structures below the red line are defined as the cup
and structures above the red line, the neuroretinal rim [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports estimate the mean morphometric optic disc
size of 2.58 &#x000b1; 0.65 mm<sup>2</sup> in the Indian population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Expecting
to get optic disc area results with significant difference (d) of
0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, power of 80% (Z<sub>b</sub> = 0.842) and significance level of 0.01
(Z<sub>a</sub> = 2.576) was used to determine the sample size. The sample
size was determined using the formula n = 2(Z<sub>a</sub> + Z<sub>b</sub>)<sup>2</sup> S<sup>2</sup>/d<sup>2</sup>.
Considering the standard deviation (S) of 0.65, the minimum
sample size calculated was 40.</p><p>Student&#x02032;s t test for independent variables was used to
compare the results of different sex. Descriptive analyses
including mean values and standard deviation (SD) of the
optic disc parameters were performed. Ninety-five per cent
confidence intervals for each optic disc parameter were
calculated. Pearson&#x02032;s correlation coefficient and linear regression
analysis was done to determine the effect of age on optic disc
parameters. Statistical significance was shown if <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.
Statistical analyses were done using SPSS Version 10.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and fifty eyes of 150 subjects were studied with
respect to their sex, age and refractive error. There were 68
(45.3%) males and 82 (54.7%) female subjects with mean age
of 32.09 &#x000b1; 11.54 years (range, 15 to 67). There were 81 (54.0%)
myopic, 47 (31.3%) emmetropic and 22 (14.7%) hypermetropic
eyes with refraction ranging from -5.0 to +3.0 diopters of
spherical equivalent. The mean optic disc parameters are
detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. There was no statistical difference regarding
the sex [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. However, there was statistical correlation
between the age and some optic disc parameters [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. There
was no statistical difference between the refractive errors for
the various optic disc parameters [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p><bold>Optic disc:</bold> Mean optic disc area was 2.63 &#x000b1; 0.55 mm<sup>2</sup>. Mean
horizontal disc diameter (1.66 &#x000b1; 0.24 mm) was significantly
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) smaller than the mean vertical disc diameter
(2.04 &#x000b1; 0.32 mm). The shape of the optic disc was vertically oval
in the majority of eyes, with the vertical disc diameter being
greater than the horizontal disc diameter in 132 eyes (88.0%).
The horizontal disc diameter was greater than the vertical disc
diameter in 15 eyes (10.0%). In three eyes (2.0%), the vertical
disc diameter and the horizontal disc diameter were equal.</p><p><bold>Neuroretinal rim:</bold> Mean neuroretinal rim area was
1.78 &#x000b1; 0.55 mm<sup>2</sup>. It was significantly and positively correlated
with the size of the disc (<italic>r</italic> = 0.64, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). There was a
significant negative correlation between the rim area and cup
area (<italic>r</italic> = -0.42, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Mean vertical rim width (1.11 &#x000b1; 0.41
mm) was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) greater than the mean
horizontal rim width (0.67 &#x000b1; 0.33 mm).</p><p><bold>Optic cup:</bold> Mean cup area was 0.87 &#x000b1; 0.45 mm<sup>2</sup>. It had
significant positive correlation with the optic disc size (<italic>r</italic> = 0.41,
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The horizontal cup diameter was greater than the
vertical cup diameter, indicating a horizontally oval shape of the
cup. However, there was no statistically significant difference
between the horizontal cup diameter and the vertical cup
diameter (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12)</p><p><bold>Cup to disc ratio:</bold> The mean horizontal cup/disc ratio was
0.59 &#x000b1; 0.16 and mean vertical cup/disc ratio was 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.14.
The mean cup/disc area ratio was 0.33 &#x000b1; 0.15. The cup/disc area
ratio had significant positive correlation with the optic disc area
(<italic>r</italic> = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Currently, there are several instruments available for the analysis
of the optic nerve head, in order to detect early glaucomatous
damage, even before functional field loss is detectable. The OCT
provides an assessment of the optic nerve head by passing a
near - infrared illumination (840 nm) beam into the eye and
studying its reflectivity patterns by computer-assisted software.
Although OCT has been introduced in India, the normative
profile of various disc parameters is not established for the
Indian population.</p><p>In the present study, we found no significant difference
between males and females with respect to the various optic
disc parameters. Males had a larger, however not significantly
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.67) larger, disc area than females. Similar findings have
been reported by Jonas <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The Rotterdam study, one of
the largest epidemiological studies on the morphology of the
optic nerve head in white people, had demonstrated that the
mean optic disc area is on an average 3.2% larger in men than
in women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>The optic disc area measurement in this study was larger
than the optic disc measurements reported by Ramakrishnan <italic>et
al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
who like us had used the Stratus
OCT to assess the optic disc topography. The statistically
significant difference in measurements may be attributed to
the larger sample size of our study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Discrepancy in
measurements could also be due to the fact that in our study, the
analysis was done entirely by the software, whereas in the study
by Ramakrishnan <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> the end of the RPE/choriocapillaries
reflection was detected manually in certain cases.</p><p>A linear correlation between the disc size and the cup to disc
area ratio has been reported earlier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> The increase in the cup to
disc area ratio for each millimeter increase in the disc diameter
was 0.27 in the Blue Mountain Eye Study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> In the current study,
the increase in the cup to disc area ratio for each millimeter
increase in the disc diameter was 0.08.</p><p>Decline in RNFL thickness owing to the loss of ganglion cells
with age has been demonstrated with the help of OCT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> and
histopathological studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> With this RNFL loss, one expects the
neuroretinal rim area to decrease and the cup area to increase,
as confirmed in this study.</p><p>In our study, the spherical equivalent of refraction ranged
from -5.0 to +3.0 diopters. For this range of refraction, we found
no significant difference in the various optic disc parameters.
This finding was also seen in the study by Jonas <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> where the
range of refraction was -4.5 to +2.5 diopters. Jonas has shown
that the optic disc size depends on the refractive error with
an increase in highly myopic eyes beyond - 8 diopters and a
decrease in highly hyperopic eyes beyond +4 diopters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>The normative database commercially available with the
Stratus OCT neither provides information on ethnic differences
within its data groups nor does it provide information with
numerical data. Our study therefore provides a normative
database for the various optic disc topographic measurements
and its variations with sex, age and refractive error in normal
Indian eyes using OCT.</p><p>However, the limitation of this study is that it is biased
towards the younger age group. Further investigation with a
larger sample size and an older age group who are more prone
to disc changes may be required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides a normative database for the various optic
disc topographic measurements and its variations with sex,
age and refractive error in normal Indian eyes using OCT. The
development of the three-dimensional Spectral Domain (Fourier
Domain) OCT which gives faster and more accurate results
could be used to substantiate these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mr. R. Ezhil for his assistance
