In developing countries, the death rate from sepsis is extremely high due to poverty and malnutrition, among others.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The pathogenesis of sepsis is complicated, and studies have shown that some organs and tissues are damaged in the early stage of sepsis, whereas severe sepsis, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs during later stages of sepsis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Critically ill patients may suffer an acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI), in which the patient's acute disease causes gastrointestinal dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Research has shown that the gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in the progression of sepsis. The gastrointestinal mucosal barrier is damaged by septic inflammation. A large number of toxins and bacteria are then translocated through the blood through the portal vein and lymphatic system, ultimately resulting in MODS.</p><p>Recent studies investigating the pathogenesis of sepsis have demonstrated that excessive levels of cytokines and inflammatory mediators are released, establishing a foundation for sepsis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Therapies for sepsis typically include the control of infection, improved organ perfusion, and immunomodulation. Among all therapeutic strategies, immunomodulation through the use of omega-3 fish oil (FO) has received increasing attention. FO modulates the immunological response to sepsis through several pathways. It may also decrease the expression of inflammatory factors.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] FO can inhibit Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to block the TLR signaling pathway,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and it can also block the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. Tsou <italic>et al</italic>. have confirmed that the number of CD4 lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells increased in response to FO pretreatment in a rat model of sepsis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] FO may also have organ-protective functions. FO has been shown to diminish the requirement for renal replacement and to improve the function of the liver and pancreas.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In 2012, a working guideline was developed by the Working Group of Abdominal Problem (WGAP) to define and grade AGI.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In the ICU, the mortality rate of septic patients with intestinal dysfunction (AGI Grade III) is extremely high. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid can decrease the mortality of patients suffering from severe sepsis with AGI Grade III.

Furthermore, the condition of the patient could not be improved despite general interventions. Patients are presented as intolerant to enteral nutrition, which can induce continued or even complete deterioration of MODS. Septic shock is defined as severe sepsis plus persistently low blood pressure (BP) despite the administration of intravenous fluids. Low BP was defined as follows: (1) systolic BP (SBP) &#x0003c;90 mm of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic BP &#x0003c;60 mmHg; (2) mean BP &#x0003c;70 mmHg; (3) a reduction of SBP &#x0003e;40 mmHg, or a decrease of &#x0003e;2 standard deviation (SD) by age; and (4) exclusion of the other causes of low BP.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Catheter-related infection (CRI) included definitive diagnosis, clinical diagnosis, and suspected diagnosis, according to the prevention and treatment guidelines of the inter-vessel CRI of China.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The criteria for definitive diagnosis included the following: (1) positive results for semi-quantitative blood cultures from the central venous catheter; (2) both positive blood cultures from the central venous and peripheral catheters, with a positive central venous catheter blood culture obtained at least 2 h before the peripheral blood culture; and (3) the presence of the same microorganisms in both blood cultures. The criteria for the clinical diagnosis included the following: (1) a positive result for the catheter blood culture with a negative result for the peripheral blood culture and (2) the disappearance of infection symptoms 48 h after catheter removal without the use of additional antibiotics. A suspected diagnosis was defined as new symptoms of infection that disappeared after catheter removal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment protocols and intervention</title><p>All patients received early goal-directed fluid resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and carbapenem medication. Antibiotics were adjusted according to the drug resistance test results. Carbapenems included imipenem/cilastatin (1.0 g, q8h), meropenem (2 g, q8h), or biapenem (0.3 g q6h). Glycopeptides included vancomycin (1.0 g, q12h), teicoplanin (initial dose of 0.4 g, q12h &#x000d7; 2 times, followed by 0.4 g, qd; or linezolid 600 mg, q12h).

Sepsis is a specific kind of SIRS that is induced in response to severe infection. When SIRS is uncontrolled, abnormal tissue perfusion occurs, which ultimately leads to MODS. Data have shown that MODS scores parallel the severity of SIRS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Previous research has also demonstrated that thrombus embolism in the gastrointestinal microcirculation can be induced by endotoxemia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In return, AGI can result in deterioration of the ectopic intestinal flora and lymphocyte apoptosis, inhibiting the immune functions of lymphocytes.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>FO contains abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. It is a nutritional substrate and also an important inhibitor of inflammation. FO can modify membrane lipid rafts by replacing <italic>n</italic> = 6 with <italic>n</italic> = 3 PUFA in the cell membrane, which in turn reduces the production of the <italic>n</italic> = 6 PUFA source to alkanoic acid. Thus, the fluidity of the lymphocyte membrane is protected and stabilized. A certain proportion of <italic>n</italic> = 3 and <italic>n</italic> = 6 is considered to be anti-inflammatory. Previous research has suggested that 1:2 ~ 1:4 would be a better proportion for preventing inflammatory reactions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, a proportion of 1:5 was used. A positive clinical effect has also been reported in patients with severe sepsis with AGI Grade III. However, there is no evidence demonstrating that enteral supplements of FO improve the prognosis of severe inflammatory reactions.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Because of the design of our study, parenteral nutrition was the only choice to supply calories, and therefore, we estimated the effects of the FO supplied by parenteral supplementation. The results obtained for the FO group revealed a better 60-day mortality rate compared with the control group. Patients, who are suffering from high IAP combined with abdominal infection, may obtain a greater benefit from the addition of FO parenteral therapy. Recent animal experiments have demonstrated that FO parenteral supplementation reduces Bax mRNA expression, increases Bcl<sub>2</sub> mRNA expression, promotes the proliferation of intestinal epidermal cells, lengthens the villus, and inhibits apoptosis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Thus, among all administration routes, patients are most likely to benefit from parenteral supplementation with FO.</p><p>In the present study, we observed a better 28- and 60-day mortality rate in the subgroup with abdominal infection that received FO. On day 7, the Marshall score was also lower in the FO group. These findings suggested that FO could either prevent organ failure or protect organs against failure. This result is consistent with the findings of a previous study.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Different degrees of abnormal T-lymphocytes were observed before FO supplementation, but the difference between the FO and control groups disappeared on day 7, which suggested that FO could improve the function of T-lymphocytes, potentially by modifying lipid rafts and affecting the fluidity of the lymphocyte plasma membrane.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] FO supplementation has demonstrated negative clinical outcomes in previous cohort studies, but the gastrointestinal functions were not clearly graded,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which could have a significant influence on prognosis according to our previous study.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that FO can reduce the levels of some inflammatory factors; however, we did not detect significant differences in leukocytes, hsCRP, or PCT between the two groups. Serum PCT levels have also been shown to be reduced by FO in children who underwent cardiac surgery or esophageal carcinoma surgery. This finding indicates that FO may have a beneficial effect on the control of infection and reduce CRP and the sequential organ failure assessment score[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in patients with severe sepsis. However, a meta-analysis did not demonstrate an effect of FO on the levels of interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, both of which are overexpressed during sepsis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Thus, additional trials are needed to confirm whether FO can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, we discovered that omega-3 FO fatty acid can improve the long-term prognosis of patients suffering from severe sepsis with AGI Grade III. Patients with high IAP and abdominal infection might obtain a greater benefit from FO. The effects of FO may be due, in part, to the modulation of immune functions.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Angus</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Linde-Zwirble</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name><name><surname>Lidicker</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Clermont</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Carcillo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinsky</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of severe sepsis in the United States: Analysis of incidence, outcome, and associated costs of care</article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>1303</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11445675</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jastrzebski</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zlotorowicz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Severe sepsis and septic shock</article-title><source>Przegl Epidemiol</source><year>2001</year><volume>55</volume><issue>Suppl 3</issue><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11984934</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lameire</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bagga</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>De Maeseneer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Endre</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Kellum</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Acute kidney injury: An increasing global concern</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2013</year><volume>382</volume><fpage>170</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23727171</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adib-Conquy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavaillon</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stress molecules in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome</article-title><source>FEBS Lett</source><year>2007</year><volume>581</volume><fpage>3723</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17428476</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Puleo</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Arvanitakis</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Gossum</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Preiser</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gut failure in the ICU</article-title><source>Semin Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2011</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>626</fpage><lpage>38</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21989698</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reintam Blaser</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Malbrain</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Starkopf</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fruhwald</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jakob</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>De Waele</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Gastrointestinal function in intensive care patients: Terminology, definitions and management.
