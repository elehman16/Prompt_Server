Therefore, innovative interventions for balance improvement in this population are greatly needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new virtual-reality system (the Balance Rehabilitation Unit [BRU]) on balance, falls, and fear of falling in a population of community-dwelling older subjects with a known history of falls. In this study, 60 community-dwelling older subjects were recruited after being diagnosed with poor balance at the Falls and Fractures Clinic, Nepean Hospital (Penrith, NSW, Australia). Subjects were randomly assigned to either the BRU-training or control groups. Both groups received the usual falls prevention care. The BRU-training group attended balance training (two sessions/week for 6 weeks) using an established protocol. Change in balance parameters was assessed in the BRU-training group at the end of their 6-week training program. Both groups were assessed 9 months after their initial assessment (month 0). Adherence to the BRU-training program was 97%. Balance parameters were significantly improved in the BRU-training group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). This effect was also associated with a significant reduction in falls and lower levels of fear of falling (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Some components of balance that were improved by BRU training showed a decline after 9 months post-training. In conclusion, BRU training is an effective and well-accepted intervention to improve balance, increase confidence, and prevent falls in the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>falls</kwd><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>postural instability</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd>elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Falls in older persons are associated with fear of falling, lack of confidence, injuries, hospitalizations and, in some cases, death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cia-8-257">1</xref> Although broadly implemented, falls prevention programs are a major burden to health care budgets worldwide.

Participants (65 years and older) were recruited at the Falls and Fractures Clinic, Nepean Hospital in Penrith (NSW, Australia). Subjects attended the clinic after suffering at least one fall within 6 months prior to the assessment. All subjects were included in the study after showing poor performance in their balance, which was assessed using the accepted parameters of normality reported by the posturography component of the BRU.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-8-257">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-257">15</xref> These parameters included limits of stability (LOS), interpreted as the maximum sway on the platform before losing stability, and area of the ellipse of confidence (CE) for the center of pressure (COP) at six different conditions: open eyes and eyes closed on hard surface, eyes closed on foam, and several different visual stimuli (saccadic condition combined with optokinetic bars in four different directions and visual-vestibular conditions) using the 3D virtual-reality goggles. Inclusion criteria were: LOS lower than 170 cm<sup>2</sup> and COP &#x0003e; 20 cm<sup>2</sup> in at least three of six different conditions. Exclusion criteria were: (a) severe visual impairment, (b) inability to ambulate independently with a cane or walker, (c) inability to stand unaided for 60 seconds, (d) score of &#x0003c;22/30 in the Mini-Mental State Examination,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cia-8-257">16</xref> (e) Parkinson&#x02019;s disease or any neuromuscular conditions, (f) Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) &#x0003e; 8/15,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cia-8-257">17</xref> and (g) inability to understand or answer the study questionnaires. After agreeing to be part of the study and after informed consent was obtained, participants went through a comprehensive assessment that included structured questionnaires, information about chronic diseases, physical examination and anthropometric measurements. Subjects were then randomly assigned to either BRU-training or control groups. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki (1983). The local ethics committee at Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District approved the project.</p></sec><sec><title>Postural assessment</title><p>BRU is a recently validated and reliable method that combines variable somatosensory, visual and vestibular conditions, which are used to assess and train balance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-8-257">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-257">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cia-8-257">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-8-257">20</xref> The assessment component of the BRU (posturography) evaluates postural control responses to different types of visual and visual-vestibular stimulation on standing surfaces of different firmness. The posturography report is automatically generated by the software integrated in the BRU system and includes LOS and COP under several different conditions. The assessment takes about 30 minutes to perform. To avoid any bias in the assessment, a physiotherapist performed all the posturography assessments at time 0, at week 6 in the BRU-training group, and at month 9 in both groups. The same physiotherapist was responsible for asking the subjects about new falls and assisting them to perform the fear of falling questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of falls</title><p>Falls were defined as &#x0201c;an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-8-257">21</xref> The occurrence of falls was retrospectively assessed by asking the participant (1) whether they have suffered a fall and, (2) the number of falls during the 6 months prior to the assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Gait assessment</title><p>A GAIT Rite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (CIR Systems Inc, Havertown, PA, USA) instrumented walkway (810 cm &#x000d7; 89 cm &#x000d7; 0.625 cm, sample rate = 80 Hz) was positioned along a straight section of the walkway to record spatiotemporal gait data.</p></sec><sec><title>Grip strength</title><p>Grip strength was measured following the Groningen Elderly Test using a Smedley Hand Dynamometer (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cia-8-257">22</xref> The best of three attempts (with 30 seconds rest between them) was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum measurements</title><p>Venous blood was collected from resting subjects for the measurement of serum 25(OH)D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, creatinine, and albumin.

Because of the high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in older adults, the serum concentration of albumin and calcium were used to correct the calcium value (calcium-corrected value = Ca + 0.8 [40 &#x02212; albumin]). The calcium-corrected value was used in the subsequent analysis. The clearance of creatinine was calculated from the Cockcroft formula ([(140 &#x02013; age in years) &#x000d7; weight (kg)/ 72 &#x000d7; creatinine mol/L]).

Participants in the BRU-training group were scheduled for two sessions of balance training per week for 6 weeks under the guidance of a physiotherapist other than the one performing the assessments. Each training session lasted 30 minutes and consisted of a combination of visual-vestibular rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-8-257">Figure 2A</xref>) and postural training virtual reality exercises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-8-257">Figure 2B</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-8-257">14</xref> The rehabilitation exercises included saccadic, optokinetic stimulation, vestibular optokinetic and vestibular-ocular reflex exercises performed while standing. In addition, postural training virtual reality exercises were also used to improve balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-8-257">Figure 2B</xref>). These exercises consisted of three different postural training games with increasing levels of complexity (maximum of 15 levels), with the goal of reaching at least level 10 in every game by the end of the training period. The levels of complexity were progressively increased as the individual reported higher confidence and demonstrated learning of the correct postural control techniques required to pass to a higher level. After completing their 6 weeks of BRU training, our assessment physiotherapist obtained a new posturography report, which was then compared with the initial report (time 0).</p></sec><sec><title>Falls prevention recommendations and interventions (usual care)</title><p>After their initial assessment, all participants were given general recommendations and an evidence-based care plan on falls prevention (usual care).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cia-8-257">25</xref> This usual care included an invitation to join an exercise program (following the Otago protocol),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-cia-8-257">26</xref> medication review, home visit by an occupational therapist (if more than 60% of the falls occurred at home), hearing and visual assessment, nutritional supplements (when nutritional risk was identified by the MNA tool), vitamin D supplementation (1,000 IU/day independently of their serum levels), and education materials on falls prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The LOS measure was selected for calculation of sample size, based on our previous preliminary results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-257">15</xref> Expecting a post-training improvement of 10%, a sample size of 30 participants per group was required (80% power, alpha of 0.05).

Our system was expected to stress their balance and visio-vestibular pathways while offering them a safe and closely supervised environment, which involves less physical effort than the usual balance exercise programs. An additional advantage of this system was a higher adherence that could be due to the level of physical effort involved and to the simplicity of the BRU-training protocol, which includes easy-to-follow instructions and a closer interaction between the health professional and the subject.</p><p>After completing their BRU-training protocol, participants showed a significant improvement in their LOS and COP. In addition, 9 months after their initial assessment, the BRU-training group showed a significant reduction in both the incidence of falls and in their levels of fear of falling. As expected, the subjects in the usual-care group showed a reduction in the number of falls; however, this reduction was significantly higher in the BRU-training group, which indicates an additive and beneficial effect of this intervention on fall prevention in this population. Interestingly, the positive effects of BRU training on balance seem to reduce with time as indicated by the results of our assessment at month 9. Nevertheless, long-term studies looking at the maintenance of the beneficial effect of BRU training on these parameters are still required.</p><p>Although virtual reality has been used to rehabilitate subjects suffering from stroke,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-8-257">27</xref> cerebral palsy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-8-257">28</xref> and brain injury,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cia-8-257">29</xref> the use of this technology in falls prevention has been limited. Indeed, apart from the studies using the BRU in younger populations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cia-8-257">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-8-257">20</xref> there are no reports in the literature of the use of virtual reality to train balance and prevent falls in older subjects. The only related evidence came from a recent study that tested the Nintendo Wii&#x02122; Fit Plus in 26 young participants (aged 43 &#x000b1; 14 years) suffering from balance impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cia-8-257">30</xref> Participants interacted with a television screen and no virtual reality was used. Although no data on change in balance parameters was provided, trained participants reported more enjoyment and motivation than usual physiotherapy, which coincides with the findings of the present study.</p><p>Our study has some strengths and limitations. The major strength of this study is that this is the first demonstration of the beneficial effect of balance training on balance parameters and falls in older adults using a novel, accurate, safe and effective virtual reality method. In terms of cost, with the exception of the initial investment on the BRU equipment and software, this intervention involves similar costing to any other falls prevention intervention that requires regular physiotherapy sessions. Another strength is the use of computerized posturography to document changes in balance parameters, which could be performed using the same BRU system. Although this method has the same sensitivity and specificity as the usual clinical balance tests,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cia-8-257">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cia-8-257">32</xref> computerized posturography has major advantages such as a more precise determination of changes in balance parameters, no additional effort from the participant, and a more accurate inter- and intrarater reliability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cia-8-257">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cia-8-257">32</xref></p><p>In terms of the weaknesses of this study, performing a double-blind, controlled trial to test this system is clearly unfeasible, therefore we decided to use an open approach in which both the participants at the medical team were aware of the interventions. However, to prevent any assessment bias, different physiotherapists with no access to the subjects&#x02019; data were specifically assigned to perform either assessment or training. Furthermore, the evidence that both groups are similar is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-8-257">Table 1</xref> and is demonstrated by similar involvement of the participants in our usual-care program.</p><p>Another potential limitation of the study is the use of self-reports for the falls data episodes, which could be inaccurate. However, excluding subjects with reported cognitive impairment could partially solve this limitation. Nevertheless, and although this study was not powered to assess its effect on falls prevention due to the small sample and the use of self-report, our finding that BRU training had a significantly higher effect on falls prevention deserves further exploration in future clinical trials.</p><p>A final limitation of this study could be that the control group was not exposed to the BRU equipment as often as the trained group, which could affect their performance at their second assessment. This is a very unlikely possibility since the posturography assessment, which is clearly different from the training component of BRU, is a very objective measurement that is independent of the subject&#x02019;s familiarity with the system.</p><p>In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated that the novel BRU training is an effective method to offer balance training to community-dwelling older fallers. Although it is not intended to replace, but rather to complement, other falls prevention intervention programs, BRU training offers a safe and well-accepted intervention with high levels of effectiveness and adherence that could become a successful treatment for falls prevention in older adults in the near future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a research grant from the Nepean Medical Research Foundation and by the Department of Geriatric Medicine at Nepean Hospital.
