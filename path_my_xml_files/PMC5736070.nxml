The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of using moxibustion for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. <italic>Methods</italic>. We conducted a randomized sham-controlled trial of moxibustion. Sixteen patients with metastatic cancer were recruited from Daejeon, South Korea. The patients were randomly placed into a true or a sham moxibustion group and received 10 true or sham moxibustion treatments administered to the abdomen (CV12, CV8, CV4) and legs (ST36) over a 2-week period. Outcome measures included interest in participating in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and compliance with the treatment plan (ie, attendance at treatment sessions). Clinical outcomes included results of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT), answers on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item core quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires, scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the results from blood tests and a safety evaluation. <italic>Results</italic>. Moxibustion was an acceptable intervention in patients with metastatic cancer. Compliance with the treatment protocol was high, with 11 patients completing all 10 treatments. No serious adverse events related to moxibustion occurred, but 4 patients in the true moxibustion group reported mild rubefaction, which disappeared in a few hours. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. This study suggests that moxibustion may be safely used to treat anorexia and improve quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm this result.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>moxibustion</kwd><kwd>metastatic cancer</kwd><kwd>anorexia</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>feasibility study</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1534735416654762"><funding-source id="funding1-1534735416654762"><institution-wrap><institution>Korean Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1534735416654762">CIMI-14-01-23</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735416654762"><title>Introduction</title><p>Moxibustion is a noninvasive procedure that involves burning moxa, the herb <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic>, on or above the skin at acupoints so as to warm the acupoints in order to alleviate symptoms.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The therapeutic components of moxibustion are assumed to be heat, tar, aroma, psychological stress, and combinations thereof.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Among them, heat stimulation and the chemical action of the ignited moxa are the most important variables for moxibustion.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Moxibustion has been widely used for various reasons, including the treatments of cancer, ulcerative colitis, constipation, hypertension, and pain, as well as, stroke rehabilitation and facilitation of breech presentation.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with cancer require support to cope with the disease, its symptoms, and the side effects of treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

questionnaire (version 4).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The FAACT questionnaire was designed to complement the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#x02013;General (FACT-G) by addressing anorexia/cachexia-related concerns. The FACT-G is a validated 27-item, patient-rated measure of quality of life for patients with cancer of any type. It covers the areas of physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), and functional well-being (7 items). In addition to the FACT-G items, the FAACT has 12 additional items under the anorexia/cachexia subscale (ACS) category. All FAACT items are scored from 0 = &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to 4 = &#x0201c;very much,&#x0201d; so the total score ranges from 0 to 156. Higher scores imply a better state of the patient. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (version 3) was used.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status/QOL scale, and 6 single items. The EORTC QLQ-C-30 assesses global quality of life, functional domains (physical, emotional, social, role, and cognitive) and symptoms (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty), which commonly occur in patients with cancer. All of the scales and the single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score on a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of function, and a high score for global health status/quality of life represents a high quality of life, but a high score on the symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology. The score on the VAS anorexia scale, which ranged from 0 mm = normal appetite to 100 mm = no food intake possible, was also used.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Moxibustion acceptability was evaluated by using the answers to brief questions to determine the patients&#x02019; likes or dislikes concerning both the moxibustion treatment and the study. The safety of this study was determined by using the numbers and the types of adverse events, such as burns and infections at the moxibustion site, coughing, headaches, allergic reactions related to the moxa or the moxibustion smoke, and so on, at each visit. Also, blood tests, including white blood cells, neutrophils, platelets, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen, were done to ensure safety. Blood test results were collected at baseline (visit 1) and after the 10th moxibustion treatment (visit 11) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534735416654762">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section8-1534735416654762"><title>Study Size and Statistical Analysis</title><p>Our initial aim was to recruit 20 patients for this study: 10 patients in the true moxibustion group and 10 patients in the sham moxibustion group. However, we only managed to recruit 16; 9 in the true moxibustion group and 7 in the sham moxibustion group. No power analysis was undertaken for this feasibility study. The purpose of this study was not to establish efficacy, but to carefully measure the effect of moxibustion in a small sample and to test the safety, feasibility and acceptability of using moxibustion to treat anorexia in patients with metastatic cancer. The data analysis was blind to the study group. The outcome analysis was based mainly on the intention to treat (ITT) and was undertaken per-protocol (PP). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized, and comparisons of the clinical endpoints were made between groups by using nonparametric statistics.

These 16 patients had already had experience with acupuncture and moxibustion treatment and had been subjected to 2 screenings: a prescreening with short questions and answers and a more thorough and comprehensive main screening. The patients were randomized into either the true moxibustion group (n = 9) or the sham moxibustion group (n = 7). Compliance with the treatment protocol was relatively high (75.625%), with 11 of the 16 patients completing all treatments.

Most patients stated that moxibustion might have helped improve their anorexia to some degree while other answered that they were uncertain of its effect. During the study period, some patients felt uncomfortable due to the moxa smoke, and some patients complained of redness of the skin although that disappeared in a few hours. Some patients complained about the uncomfortable posture during treatment because lying on their backs for 40 minutes without movement caused back pain and muscle tension. Another thing that bothered the patients was the tight schedule. In this study, patients were required to visit the hospital 5 times a week for 2 weeks (total 10 times) because of the short study period. We were concerned that the patients might tire of the treatment or have trouble meeting the treatment schedule, and actually, 1 patient did drop out due to commuting difficulties.</p><p>Preliminary data from this study indicated that moxibustion was potentially effective for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. After 10 sessions of treatment, the patients in the true moxibustion group showed lesser degrees of anorexia and appetite loss on the anorexia-cachexia subscale of the FAACT questionnaire and on the EORTC QLQ questionnaire, respectively. Additionally, the true moxibustion group showed less fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain, and lower diarrhea scores on the EORTC QLQ questionnaire. No remarkable changes were noted in the scores on the VAS and the results of the blood tests.</p><p>No serious adverse events related to moxibustion occurred during study. Four patients in the true moxibustion group reported mild rubefaction, but the symptom quickly disappeared within 1 or 2 hours after moxibustion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section11-1534735416654762"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this feasibility study, we found that moxibustion was an acceptable intervention for treating anorexia in patients with metastatic cancer. However, recruitment of patients was not successful (only 16 were recruited vs the original goal of 20), which might have been caused by the lack of recruitment strategies, including social and multimedia approaches. When planning a future study of moxibustion for treating anorexia in patients with cancer, various recruitment methods, such as newspaper advertising, referrals from health professionals, contact with patient community groups, and so on, should be used. In addition, future studies should be multicenter trials when possible.</p><p>Despite an intensive moxibustion treatment schedule requiring attendance 10 times over 2 weeks and 40 minutes for each treatment, compliance with the study protocol was relatively good, and the patients faithfully completed the questionnaires during the study period. We originally planned a total of 10 moxibustion treatments of 40 minutes each so that we could compare our conclusion with that of an earlier study, which found that increasing the amount of burning moxa per unit time could significantly improve lingering effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Because this study had to be completed within 8 months and because the patients were to undergo treatment individually, the treatment protocol called for 5 treatments per week for 2 weeks per patients. Based on patient input, we found that the treatment schedule (5 times a week for 2 weeks) was too tight and was a contributing factor in the dropout rate. We also found that the long treatment time (40 minutes per session) imposed a heavy strain on the patients&#x02019; body, especially patients who had thin body shapes or chest/abdominal discomfort. When planning a future study of moxibustion for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer, the treatment time should be less than 40 minutes if possible, and a less restrictive schedule of treatments should be considered. Additionally this study was a feasibility study and lacked follow-up. Future trials to investigate the efficacy of moxibustion for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patient with metastatic cancer should include follow-up.</p><p>Although moxibustion was acceptable to the patients who participated in this study, 5 patients dropped out. We think that was due to the short recruitment and treatment schedules. Also, when we recruited and enrolled patients at the baseline, our exclusion criteria did not include personal reasons, such as (busy schedule, commuting time, personal problems, unstable and moody personalities, etc) or health problems necessitating simultaneous treatments at other hospitals. We included any patient with cancer-related symptoms such as mild fatigue, ennui, indigestion, and so on. During the study, 2 patients stopped treatment reportedly for reasons of poor physical condition (not feeling good today). This &#x0201c;not feeling good today&#x0201d; might have 2 origins: Patients with cancer-related symptoms might feel too tired when trying to keep the tight treatment schedule and might be influenced by mood swings. A further analysis of the dropout rate found that patients who dropped out had personal reasons or other scheduled hospital treatment schedule, not that they felt uncomfortable or dissatisfied with the moxibustion treatment. Unfortunately, the high dropout rate occurred in the true moxibustion group. Thus, future studies should consider these factors during the planning stage.</p><p>Evidence from sham-controlled trials of moxibustion for treating the symptoms of cancer is very important.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Sham moxibustion devices can be divided into 2 categories: those for treatment at non-acupuncture points and those for preventing heat stimulation of acupuncture points, each having its pros and cons. Recent studies on sham moxibustion<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> used the latter category of device and successfully validated it use. Thus, in this study, we used a sham moxibustion device that blocked heat stimulation in a similar way. Also, sham moxibustion was used only after practitioners had confirmed that sufficient insulation was present. The moxa device is safe because the heat is moderated by bamboo salt and the heat in the bottom of the moxa is not high enough to affect the polystyrene surface. More studies to develop a convenient, effective, and safe sham moxibustion method are needed.</p><p>No serious adverse events related to moxibustion treatment occurred during this study. Though four patients reported mild rubefaction, they recovered rapidly in a matter of a few hours. Park et al<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported burns, allergic reactions, and infections as potential adverse events of moxibustion. However, in our opinion, these can be avoided by using indirect moxibustion and careful observation by the practitioner.</p><p>At present, treatment guidelines and pilot studies on the use of moxibustion for treating patients with cancer-related anorexia do not exist. In this study, we used moxibustion at the CV4, CV8, CV12, and ST36 acupoints, which are frequently used clinically in Korea to reduce dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, general body weakness, and anorexia, to treat patients with metastatic cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Regarding acupoints for the treatment of anorexia, one report indicated that moxibustion at ST21 and ST36 significantly decreased gastric injury and apoptosis of gastric mucosal cells in rats with stress-induced ulcers<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and that moxibustion at CV8 reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma or gastric cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Also, moxibustion at ST36 and CV4 has been reported to improve cancer-related fatigue.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Aung et al recommended moxibustion at PC6, ST34, ST36, and CV12 to prevent nausea and vomiting, moxibustion at CV4 to improve general condition, energy and wellness, and moxibustion at ST36 to reduce general fatigue in patients with cancer. Also, moxibustion at CV12 is useful for treating generalized Fu organ dysfunction, and moxibustion at ST36 is useful for treating chronic stomach disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> More discussion on the selection of acupoints when using moxibustion to treat patients with metastatic-cancer-related anorexia is encouraged.</p><p>Interestingly, the cancer-related symptoms of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, and diarrhea, as well as cancer-related anorexia, were alleviated after 10 true moxibustion treatments, but the same effects were not observed in the sham moxibustion group. These results are similar to those of preceding studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In this feasibility study, we did not aim to evaluate the effect of moxibustion for treating anorexia, improving the quality of life, and alleviating the symptoms in patient with metastatic cancer; neither did we aim to determine the mechanisms behind the effects of moxibustion. Thus, further studies of these topics are necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-1534735416654762"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Anorexia is common in patients with metastatic cancer and is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
