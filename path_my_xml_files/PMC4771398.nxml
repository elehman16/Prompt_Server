Guidance regarding the use of opioids for chronic low back pain is provided by the interdisciplinary evidence- and consensus-based recommendations of the German LONTS (long-term use of opioids for non-tumor pain) guideline which states that opioids can be offered for a period of 4&#x02013;12 weeks and for longer periods for treatment responders experiencing good tolerability.<xref rid="b10-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It should, however, be complemented by nonpharmacological measures. Based on a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials,<xref rid="b11-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the guideline concludes that there is no rationale for preference of one opioid and/or administration route (oral/transdermal) over another in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain.</p><p>We recently compared the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone/naloxone with oxycodone and morphine (all prolonged-release preparations) in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe nonmalignant chronic low back pain under clinical practice conditions. Oxycodone/naloxone had been developed as a strategy to prevent/treat opioid-induced constipation (and bowel dysfunction in general),<xref rid="b12-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> experienced by ~40% of patients under opioid treatment.<xref rid="b13-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The administration of oxycodone/naloxone improved bowel dysfunction compared with oxycodone without compromise of analgesia in several randomized controlled trials.<xref rid="b14-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The present study was initiated to obtain real-life data regarding the benefits of oxycodone/naloxone vs a conventional opioid therapy with laxatives, as reimbursement authorities, health insurance companies, and physician organizations in Germany were not satisfied with the available data to recommend oxycodone/naloxone as a first-line opioid. Data of the intent-to-treat population of the study (for whom the randomized treatment recommendation was accepted) have been published<xref rid="b17-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and showed that 62% of the patients experienced a clinically relevant pain reduction of at least 50% accompanied by markedly improved functionality at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Stratification by opioid showed significantly better analgesic efficacy and gastrointestinal tolerability of oxycodone/naloxone compared to oxycodone and morphine. The study also obtained data regarding the quality of life under treatment with the different opioids, which are presented in this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>The study conformed to relevant national and local ethical and regulatory requirements. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice on behalf of the German Pain Association and the German Pain League by O.Meany MD&#x00026;PM GmbH (N&#x000fc;rnberg, Germany) in 88 medical centers in Germany. Patients were enrolled between April and August 2013; all gave written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study is registered with the German pain study registry (DGS: 2012-0012-05) and with the European Medicines Agency (ENCEPP/SDPP/11035).</p><p>The study design has been described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="b17-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Briefly, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point (PROBE) design was used where physicians and patients were aware of the study medication but were blinded to the study end points. This design reflects routine clinical practice conditions (a heterogeneous patient population, open-label dose adjustments, use of concomitant medications for opioid side effects as needed) with improved data analysis due to randomization and blinded end points. The collected data can be described as randomized real-life data. The study included adult patients in need of around-the-clock pain treatment with either morphine, oxycodone, or oxycodone/naloxone because of an insufficient response and/or unacceptable side effects to previous treatment with non-opioids or weak opioids for moderate-to-severe nonmalignant chronic low back pain. Detailed exclusion criteria have been published<xref rid="b17-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and include contraindications listed in the German prescribing information for the three opioids. Following baseline evaluation, patients were randomized using a computer-generated randomization scheme to receive prolonged-release preparations of either oxycodone/naloxone, oxycodone, or morphine (1:1:1) for 12 weeks. Physicians were not required to follow this recommendation; they were permitted to change the allocated medication twice (to each of the other two opioid options) in case of side effects, lack of efficacy, or economic reasons, before a patient was withdrawn from the study. Only data from the treatment period with the finally administered opioid were included in the study. All treatment decisions were made under routine clinical practice conditions solely by the participating physicians. All three opioids were prescribed according to the respective German summary of product characteristics; dose adjustments, prescriptions of analgesic co-medication, rescue medication, or laxatives were given according to the individual requirements of the patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The participating physicians collected data at baseline, week 4, and week 12 (end of observation) using a web application providing standardized case report forms. They rated quality of life with an eleven-point numerical rating scale (NRS<sub>11</sub>) from 0= best possible to 10= worst possible quality of life, and a six-point numerical rating scale (NRS<sub>6</sub>) from 1= very good to 6= insufficient. The latter scale was also used to grade tolerability of the medication and patients&#x02019; compliance. Patients assessed their state of health with the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) which includes the five dimensions mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression rated as &#x0201c;no problems&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;some problems&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;extreme problems&#x0201d;.<xref rid="b19-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The ratings were then converted to a weighted EQ-5D index score from 0= worst possible state of health to 1= best possible state of health. Patients also rated their health on the EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS) from 100 mm &#x0201c;best imaginable health state&#x0201d; to 0 mm &#x0201c;worst imaginable health state&#x0201d;. Additionally, physicians rated changes in the overall condition of the patients with the clinical global impression of change (CGI) seven-point scale from +3= very much better to &#x02212;3= very much worse.<xref rid="b20-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Patient data were collected using conventional paper&#x02013;pencil pain questionnaires from the German Pain Association.<xref rid="b21-ijgm-9-039" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Patients independently answered these questionnaires without any influence from the treating physicians. At baseline evaluation (pretreatment documentation before randomization), patients completed the German Pain Questionnaire; thereafter, they received German Pain Diaries for documentation of weekly treatment-associated changes at the end of each week (12 diaries per patient). Both questionnaires contain validated instruments for the assessment of pain and pain-related impairments in daily activities and quality of life; data obtained from the following instruments are presented in this article:

Moreover, the open-label design in our study allowed individualized dose titrations to optimize the analgesic effect and to address tolerability and safety issues.
