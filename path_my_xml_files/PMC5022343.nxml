The strongest predictor of HBeAg seroconversion to conventional and PegIFN-alfa is the pretreatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Other factors include high histologic activity index and low HBV DNA level, and some studies have suggested that persons infected with HBV genotypes A and B respond better than those with genotypes C and D.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Results from Fried <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] study suggested that quantitative HBeAg is a useful measurement for predicting HBeAg seroconversion in patients treated with PegIFN.

Our previous study showed that quantitative serum HBsAg and HBeAg were strong predictors of sustained HBeAg seroconversion to PegIFN alfa-2b in HBeAg-positive patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Recently a new quantitative assay, the HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) assay, has been developed. It measures serum HBV core, e, and precore (also referred to as p22cr) antigens simultaneously using the monoclonal antibodies that recognize the common epitopes of these three denatured antigens.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Because all of the antigens are transcribed from the precore/core gene, they are regarded as the HBcrAg.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Okuhara <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] study demonstrated that HBcrAg is a predictive marker of the virological response (VR) to entecavir therapy in CHB patients. Before treatment, elevated interleukin (IL)-22 and lower HBsAg and HBcrAg, but not HBV DNA, were associated with a favorable treatment outcome. The levels of IL-22, HBsAg, and HBcrAg all decreased from baseline to 24 months of treatment in virological responders. Rokuhara <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] study suggests that HBcrAg assay is a sensitive and useful test for the assessment of a patient's HBV load. When monitoring the antiviral effect of lamivudine (LAM), HBcrAg provided a viral marker that was independent of HBV DNA. Chuaypen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] study demonstrated that the quantitative HBcrAg represents a reliable marker of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Monitoring HBcrAg levels during PegIFN therapy might help to identify patients with a very low probability of response comparable to, if not better than, quantitative HBsAg.</p><p>One of our aims was to investigate the usefulness of HBcrAg for predicting HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with PegIFN or conventional IFN alfa-2b.

HBcrAg in patients without HBeAg seroconversion, however, experienced a slight decrease during therapy and rebounded when the treatment was discontinued. Thus, effective antiviral treatment can decrease HBcrAg levels in serum, which was consistent with the findings of Okuhara <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Chuaypen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Kimura <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that HBcrAg levels correlated well with HBV DNA levels.

Our result showed that HBcrAg levels correlated very well with HBeAg at different time points [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], indicating that the majority of the serum HBcrAg in the HBeAg-positive patients was HBeAg and that HBcrAg might have similar predictive values as the HBeAg. Therefore, the predictive values of the HBeAg were also assessed in our study.</p><p>Chuaypen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that serum HBcrAg at week 12 was identified as a predictor of VR. The optimal cutoff value for HBcrAg (log<sub>10</sub>8.0 U/ml) provided NPVs of achieving VR at weeks 12 and 24 of 94.4% and 100%, respectively. We found that the HBcrAg cutoff value of 19,565 kU/ml at week 24 had a PPV of 36.36% and an NPV of 100% for predicting the HBeAg seroconversion of week 48. The cutoff value of 34,225 kU/ml at 12-week follow-up (week 36) had a PPV of 40% and an NPV of 100% for predicting the HBeAg seroconversion of week 48. This result suggests that physicians should pay close attention to the patients who fail to achieve HBeAg seroconversion at the 12-week follow-up. If their serum HBcrAg level is &#x0003c;34,225 kU/ml, they have a 40% possibility of gaining HBeAg seroconversion at the 24-week follow-up even without any additional antiviral treatment. Moreover, the NPV of the cutoff value at week 24 or the 12-week follow-up were both 100% and could help to guide physicians to stop PegIFN alfa-2b at week 24 or switch to other treatment regimens at the 12-week follow-up.</p><p>We also found that the cutoff value HBeAg of 2.695 PEI-U/ml at 12-week follow-up had a PPV of 57.14% and an NPV of 100% for predicting the HBeAg seroconversion of week 48. The area under the curve was 0.958. Therefore, the cutoff value HBeAg 2.695 PEI-U/ml at 12-week follow-up had a slightly higher predictive value than the cutoff value HBcrAg 34,225 kU/ml at 12-week follow-up.</p><p>Moucari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that a decrease of 0.5 and 1 log<sub>10</sub> IU/ml in serum HBsAg levels at weeks 12 and 24 of therapy, respectively, had high predictive values of sustained VR (SVR). Thus, early serum HBsAg drop had high predictive values of SVR to PegIFN 2a in HBeAg-negative CHB patients. We found that HBcrAg decrease &#x02265;0.565 log<sub>10</sub> kU/ml from the baseline to 24 weeks of therapy showed the strong potential of HBeAg seroconversion at the end of the follow-up (PPV of 30.77%, NPV of 100%). We also found that HBsAg decrease &#x02265;0.825 log<sub>10</sub> IU/ml from the baseline to 24 weeks of therapy showed the strong potential of HBeAg seroconversion at the end of the follow-up (PPV of 50%, NPV of 100%). Thus, compared with serum HBcrAg drop, serum HBsAg drop at the EOT had higher PPV.</p><p>We enrolled an additional 29 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with PegIFN alfa-2b for further validation. We found that in the validating group, the NPVs of HBcrAg for predicting HBeAg seroconversion was 100%, which was equal to those of the HBeAg and higher than that of the HBsAg; however, the PPVs of the HBcrAg were all &#x0003c;31%, which were lower than those of the serum HBeAg and that of serum HBsAg.</p><p>In our LTFU study, we found that patients with HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 maintained negative HBeAg at 9-year follow-up. Thus, HBeAg seroconversion after treatment with PegIFN alfa-2b was sustained, and their serum HBcrAg levels steadily declined or even became undetectable during the LTFU (0&#x02013;2.1 kU/ml). Two additional patients with positive HBeAg at the end of the 24-week follow-up achieved HBeAg seroconversion during LTFU although neither of them received any antiviral treatment; therefore, they achieved a delayed response, both having a very low level of serum HBcrAg, ranging from 2.1 to 3.2 kU/ml. The remaining 11 patients with positive HBeAg at the end of the 24-week follow-up received other antiviral treatment regimens during the LTFU. Three patients progressed to cirrhosis. It should be noted that their serum HBcrAg levels were high, ranging from 250 to 71,990 kU/ml.</p><p>The limitations of this study should be considered. It is a retrospective study. Approximately a decade ago, we enrolled the CHB patients from the real-world practice.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Considering the high cost and potential adverse events of pegylated and conventional IFN, we initially chose a lower dose than usual dose (3.0 MIU three times weekly versus 5.0 MIU three times weekly for conventional IFN, and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg once a week versus 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg once a week for PegIFN, respectively), as well as a shorter duration of treatment (24 weeks vs. 48 weeks). We acknowledged that the heterogeneity of the subjects remains an issue although the validating results were highly consistent.</p><p>In conclusion, our study found that effective antiviral treatment can decrease HBcrAg levels in serum. HBcrAg at week 24 and at 12-week follow-up can predict HBeAg seroconversion at 24-week follow-up. The NPVs of HBcrAg for predicting HBeAg seroconversion was 100%, but the PPVs were not so satisfactory. Therefore, we suggest that the HBcrAg is more useful for identifying the HBeAg-positive patients without the chance of achieving HBeAg seroconversion under IFN treatment. HBeAg seroconversion after treatment with PegIFN alfa-2b is sustained during LTFU, during which time their serum HBcrAg levels steadily declined or even became undetectable.</p><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>The work was supported by grants from the Key Project of Beijing Science and Technology Commission (No. D161100002716003), and the National Science and Technology Major Project for Infectious Diseases Control during the 12<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan Period (No. 2012ZX10002003).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Peng Lyu</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Groeger</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiersma</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection: New estimates of age-specific HBsAg seroprevalence and endemicity</article-title><source>Vaccine</source><year>2012</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>2212</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><comment>doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.116</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22273662</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beasley</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatitis B virus.
