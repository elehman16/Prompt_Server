As a valuable marker of CD activity, CRP levels correlate with mucosal inflammation and higher probability of clinical relapse.</p><p>In addition, low serum infliximab trough levels are one contributing factor that may explain the loss of primary response followed by the need for dose escalation. Limited data are available on the long-term management and outcome of dose escalation after the loss of primary response to infliximab due to decreasing infliximab trough levels in patients with CD. Although trough levels have been correlated with response,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> it is still unknown if higher sustained serum infliximab trough levels from the end of induction treatment predict better long-term outcomes than those resulting from dose escalation after loss of response. Furthermore, if detectable early infliximab trough levels after induction treatment result in better long-term clinical outcomes, then a target threshold or concentration range may potentially be identified.</p><p>We hypothesised that patients with CD with durable sustained long-term response to infliximab without dose escalation would have higher serum infliximab trough levels after induction and that those serum levels would stay above a certain therapeutic threshold during response. We examined the subgroup of patients with and without durable sustained response to the scheduled maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005; and 10&#x02005;mg/kg treatment in A Crohn's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New Long-term Treatment Regimen I (ACCENT I), a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled study.

After full induction with 5&#x02005;mg/kg infusions, 192 patients were assigned to scheduled maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg treatment at week 14. Nearly half the patients (44% (85/192)) completed the 52-week maintenance treatment with scheduled infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg infusions, while 30% (58/192) of patients lost response and crossed over to episodic treatment with infliximab 10&#x02005;mg/kg, and another 26% (49/192) of patients discontinued treatment for various reasons. In this maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg group, 75% (144/192) of patients had baseline and week 14 CRP values and week 14 serum infliximab levels.

At week 14 in ACCENT I, patients were randomised to receive every-8-weeks maintenance infliximab treatment with a 5&#x02005; or 10&#x02005;mg/kg dose. Both the 5&#x02005; and 10&#x02005;mg/kg maintenance arms thus received the same induction treatment with 5&#x02005;mg/kg doses given at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Week 14 infliximab trough levels and percentage decrease of CRP from baseline to week 14 (CRP decrease) in patients with raised baseline CRP levels (&#x0003e;8.0&#x02005;mg/L) were assessed as potentially meaningful parameters for predicting sustained response. In ACCENT I, serum infliximab levels were measured at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54; ATIs were assessed at weeks 0, 14, 22 and 54. Serum infliximab levels were measured with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Charles River Laboratories, Inc (formerly Tektagen, Inc), Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA); ATIs were measured with a double-antigen ELISA (Janssen Biotech, Inc (formerly Centocor, Inc), Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA), as previously described.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Because ATIs cannot be reliably measured with ELISA in the presence of serum infliximab, samples with measurable serum infliximab were deemed inconclusive for ATIs.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for the sensitivity and specificity analyses of week 14 serum infliximab levels and CRP decrease. Optimal cut-off values for the CRP decrease and absolute week 14 serum infliximab trough level (&#x000b5;g/mL), used to discriminate between patients with and without sustained response, were determined by ROC curves; sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV, respectively) of the cut-off values and their combined associations were analysed. Using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, the proportions of patients achieving sustained response were compared between the patients who reached the optimal cut-off point of the week 14 serum infliximab trough level and those who did not. Median (IQR) serum infliximab trough levels were compared between patients with and without sustained response using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test. A logistic regression model with forward-step selection, including three dichotomous parameters (week 14 serum infliximab trough level, CRP decrease above or below the selected cut-off point and baseline immunomodulator use) and three continuous variables (week 14 CRP level, week 14 serum infliximab trough level and CRP decrease), was used to select the best-fit parameters predicting sustained response to infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg through 54&#x02005;weeks. Change of CDAI score from baseline to week 14 was not entered into this model because the definition of sustained response was defined by the CDAI score change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Baseline demographic characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="GUTJNL2012304094TB1">table 1</xref>.

The optimal cut-off points were identified as a &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL week 14 infliximab trough level and &#x02265;60% CRP decrease for predicting sustained response to scheduled maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg through 54&#x02005;weeks. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012304094F3">figure 3</xref>, the serum infliximab trough levels overlap considerably between patients with and without sustained response at all time points. Median infliximab trough levels are different, however, at weeks 6, 14 and 22 in the 5&#x02005;mg/kg maintenance group and at weeks 22 and 38 in the 10 mg/kg maintenance group.</p><p>Patients who lost response after week 14 had their dose increased (from 5 to 10&#x02005;mg/kg or from 10 to 15&#x02005;mg/kg) and were treated episodically from that point onward in both maintenance arms. In this analysis, all patients who lost response at any time after week 14 were recorded in the group of patients without sustained response, and they were eligible for a dose increase. Infliximab pharmacokinetics are linear, and a higher dose results in higher serum infliximab levels (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012304094F3">figure 3</xref> comparing panels A and B). Serum infliximab trough levels at weeks 2, 6 and 14, however, are comparable between the 5 and 10&#x02005;mg/kg maintenance groups because both groups received the same induction schedule with 5&#x02005;mg/kg infusions given at weeks 0, 2 and 6.</p><p>The value of CRP for monitoring CD treatment with infliximab is well established. Raised baseline CRP and early CRP normalisation (by weeks 4 or 10) have shown significant correlation with sustained clinical benefit in another ACCENT I post hoc analysis<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and in a large single-centre cohort of patients.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While Reinisch <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in a previous ACCENT I subanalysis, did not identify an optimum cut-off CRP level at baseline or week 14 in order to predict sustained response to infliximab, patients with raised baseline CRP (&#x0003e;5.0&#x02005;mg/L) demonstrated CRP normalisation as a significant predictor of sustained response. This post hoc analysis confirmed that while week 14 CRP levels were not a significant predictor of sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg, a &#x02265;60% CRP decrease was a significant predictor. Interestingly, the ROC area under the curve analysis results, using the percentage CRP change from baseline to week 14 and week 14 serum infliximab levels, were the same (0.75). The inverse relationship between week 14 serum infliximab (quartile) levels and proportion of ACCENT I patients with normalisation of (baseline-raised) CRP at week 14 is an important finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012304094F2">figure 2</xref>). Considerably small Pearson correlation coefficients for both the 5 and 10&#x02005;mg/kg arms (&#x02212;0.020 and 0.025, respectively) indicate the independence of week 14 serum infliximab level and CRP change at week 14 in this analysis. Combining a &#x02265;60% CRP decrease or a &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL week 14 serum infliximab trough level as predictors increased the sensitivity and NPV of the prediction model. This analysis thus confirmed that a 50% or 60% decrease and normalisation of CRP are useful predictors of treatment benefit in CD treatment with infliximab.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

This subanalysis of week 14 infliximab levels in patients with sustained response to infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg and with or without immunomodulator use may not have had the statistical power to reveal all possible differences.

These findings may have established that combining infliximab with an immunomodulator, as seen in SONIC,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> may be efficacious owing to increased trough levels rather than any synergistic mechanisms. If confirmed, then prospectively using infliximab trough level to guide dosing may be a means of maintaining higher trough levels with infliximab without immunomodulator use.</p><p>Only 25% (37/147) and 33% (47/144) of patients receiving scheduled maintenance infliximab 5 or 10&#x02005;mg/kg, respectively, sustained week 14 response through week 54 in the ACCENT I study. As ACCENT I criteria for sustained response were stricter than the endpoints of most clinical trials, the number of patients with sustained response reported here was smaller than the number of patients in remission (39% and 45%) reported in the scheduled maintenance infliximab 5 and 10&#x02005;mg/kg groups, respectively, at week 30 in ACCENT I.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite the 58% response rate to a single infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg dose in ACCENT I, the data suggest that for the CD inflammatory burden, dose escalation may be required to sustain trough levels and response as early as week 14 in some patients. This was supported by the observation that no difference in week 14 serum infliximab trough levels was found between patients treated with scheduled maintenance infliximab 10&#x02005;mg/kg with or without baseline immunomodulator use.</p><p>This ACCENT I post hoc analysis has some limitations. First, although all data and samples were prospectively collected during ACCENT I, this analysis was not prespecified and, therefore, cannot be considered conclusive. Second, we used sustained response (as defined by the ACCENT I protocol) and not sustained remission as an outcome measure for this analysis. Although clinical response is a less stringent outcome measure than remission in CD, we wanted to assess the effect of sustained benefit since this may reflect a more routine practice approach. We also did not assess corticosteroid-free remission as an outcome measure. This outcome measure was the primary endpoint in the more recent SONIC trial but has not yet been used in analyses of ACCENT I data. Third, our definition of the week 14 infliximab cut-off value and of CRP change is based on only 49% (71/144) of patients included in this analysis and on 37% (71/192) of patients in the overall 5&#x02005;mg/kg arm in ACCENT I. In addition, interindividual variation of serum infliximab trough levels is large (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012304094F3">figure 3</xref>A,B, the median (IQR) box-and-whisker plots), and although a low (&#x0003c;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL) week 14 infliximab trough level may be found in most patients without sustained response with NPV of 0.83 in ACCENT I, the predictive value of a single (week 14) infliximab trough level in individual patients with CD will need additional research. The ACCENT I design did not include early dose optimisation during the induction phase until week 14. We do not know whether early dose optimisation, targeting a &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL serum infliximab level by week 14, might improve long-term clinical outcome. We therefore cannot recommend early dose adjustment in patients with asymptomatic CD receiving infliximab treatment without a prospective trial.</p><p>Our data indicate that the long-term benefit of a 5&#x02005;mg/kg infliximab dose in CD may depend on an early postinduction serum infliximab level &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL. We do not know whether this cut-off level of &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL for week 14 serum infliximab trough levels can be applied to other assay formats; however, we conclude that a measurable postinduction serum infliximab trough level is predictive of long-term sustained response without the need for dose increase. Because of the high NPV of the &#x0003c;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL serum trough level at week 14 in patients with CD, the risk of ATI development and the clinical benefit of preventing CD symptom recurrence, we suggest that serum infliximab levels should be raised from the beginning and throughout the course of CD treatment.</p><p>Antibodies to infliximab develop in a significant number of patients treated episodically and soon after the initial infusion.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Episodic treatment cannot maintain measurable serum infliximab levels and may thus induce ATI formation. Episodic treatment of patients with CD has been mostly abandoned because relapsing patients suffer from symptoms and complications. The association of early week 14 serum infliximab levels &#x02265;3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL with sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg given every 8&#x02005;weeks seen in these results supports the proposed role that detectable infliximab trough levels may prevent ATI formation.</p><p>In summary, early serum infliximab trough levels in association with a decrease in CRP predict the long-term clinical outcome in patients with CD. Our data confirm that maintaining raised serum infliximab trough levels from the start of treatment results in a sustained benefit. We defined the 3.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL trough level as a useful postinduction cut-off point for induction and maintenance infliximab 5&#x02005;mg/kg treatment. Our post hoc analysis thus adds important clinical information for the understanding and practical use of serum infliximab trough levels.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lyn Lai and Gianna Paone of Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, for editorial assistance, manuscript preparation and submission support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FC conceived the study and drafted the manuscript.
