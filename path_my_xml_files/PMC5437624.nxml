The study additionally explores whether men and women have different perceptions of treatment effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a secondary analysis from SALOME, a double-blind, phase III, randomized controlled trial testing the non-inferiorirty of injectable hydromorphone to injectable diacetylmorphine among 202 long-term street opioid injectors in Vancouver (Canada). Given this was a secondary analysis, no a priori power calaculation was conducted. Differences in baseline characteristics and six-month treatment outcomes (illicit heroin use, opioid use, crack cocaine use, non-legal activities, physical and psychological health scores, urine positive for street heroin markers, and retention) were analysed by gender using fitted models. Responses to an open ended question on reasons for treatment effectiveness were explored with a thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Men and women differed significantly on a number of characteristics at baseline. For example, women were significantly younger, presented to treatment with significantly higher rates of prior month sex work (31.5% vs. 0%), and used significantly more crack cocaine (14.71 vs. 8.38&#x000a0;days). After six-months of treatment there were no significant differences in treatment outcomes by gender, after adjusting for baseline values. For both men and women, improved health and quality of life were the most common reasons provided for treatment effectiveness, however women were more specific in the types of health improvements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite presenting to treatment with vulnerabilities not faced to the same extent by men, at six-months women did not differ significantly from men in tested trial efficacy outcomes. While the primary outcome in the trial was the reduction of illicit opioid use, in the open-ended responses both men and women focused their comments on improvement in health and quality of life as reasons for treatment effectiveness. The supervised model of care with injectable medications provides a particularly suitable framework for providing care to opioid-dependent men and women not attracted or retained by other treatments. The absence of statistical differences reported in this secondary analysis may be due to lack of adequate statistical power to detect meaningful effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01447212) Registered: October 4, 2011 at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01447212">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01447212</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Opioid-dependence</kwd><kwd>Gender</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Patient perceptions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CA)</institution></funding-source><award-id>MCT - 103817</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oviedo-Joekes</surname><given-names>Eugenia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Providence Health Care</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>InnerChange Foundation </institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>St. Paul's Foundation (CA)</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute (CA)</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000245</institution-id><institution>Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002784</institution-id><institution>Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Opioid-use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by patterns of continued illicit drug use, periods of treatment, abstinence from street opioids, and relapse, with a number of associated harms to the individual and to the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Data on opioid use disorder has shown this chronic condition to be more prevalent among men than among women, and as such, conclusions derived primarily from the experiences of men are often extrapolated to women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies of opioid-dependence consistently suggest that there are few (although inconsistent) or no gender differences in treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, in studies of opioid use disorder, women are consistently found to be faced with elevated exposure to social and medical vulnerabilities associated with their substance use, suffering more severe emotional and physical symptoms as compared to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The concept of gender refers to the socially constructed bounds of being a &#x0201c;female&#x0201d; or a &#x0201c;male&#x0201d; in a society, and is linked to the social and political context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These socially constructed conceptions of gender and gender roles influence human interactions, behaviours, and conceptions of the physical body, ultimately producing gender identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Gender based analyses aim to assess potential differences in treatment outcomes for men and women, and to identify the possible impact of policies and programs in relation to these differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Studies that have investigated gender differences in substance use treatment outcomes such as retention suggest few or no differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, gender based analysis of outcomes among patients receiving injectable treatments are limited, with only two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, the North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI) clinical trial compared supervised injectable diacetylmorphine (pharmaceutical grade heroin) (DAM) with oral methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among long-term opioid injectors in Vancouver and Montreal (Canada). In NAOMI, overall treatment retention rates did not differ for women (64.8%) and men (75.4%). Further, among participants receiving DAM there were no significant gender differences in drug use or illegal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These findings indicated that among long-term opioid dependent women not benefiting from available treatments, DAM was more effective than MMT.</p><p>It is pivotal to ground a discussion of men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s experiences of injectable opioid assisted treatment in the broader literature on structural vulnerability. Structural vulnerability refers to an individual&#x02019;s condition of being at risk of negative outcomes, through their position in relation to socioeconomic, political, and cultural normative hierarchies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Women present to opioid assisted treatment with a number of vulnerabilities, for example, lower rates of education, more prevalent histories of sexual abuse, higher rates of infectious disease, higher suicide rates, higher rates of crack cocaine use, sex work, and mental distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These vulnerabilities are a product of a number of attributes, including gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The present study was conducted with a sample of long-term opioid dependent women and men who were enrolled in a unique model of care, receiving injectable opioid assisted treatment. Under this model of care, participants received injectable medications under the supervision of registered nurses. This daily contact allows the opportunity for comprehensive care, attending to the many complex needs of the patients, thereby optimizing the provision of services that are in line with the construct of patient centered care, where the needs of the patients are prioritized. A patient centered approach allows for the social positions of patients to be recognized, and for the promotion of cultural safety, both of which are more recent dimensions of patient centered care being considered in the delivery of services for marginalized groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Such an approach accounts for components of a patient&#x02019;s position, including race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status, so that treatments are responsive to the unique circumstances with which patients experience care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In most clinical trials, patient outcome assessments are developed by clinicians and researchers and tend to neglect the perspectives of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is of concern, given the evidence suggesting that among patients receiving treatments for substance dependence, conceptions of treatment effectiveness may differ greatly from those of clinicians and researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As such, there has been an increasing interest in collecting patient perceptions of treatment outcomes. The present study aims to 1) determine whether men and women differ in their response to treatment and; 2) to explore men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s perceptions of treatment effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting, participants, study design</title><p>The Study to Assess Longer Term Opioid Medication Effectiveness (SALOME) was a phase III, double blind clinical trial testing the non-inferiority of hydromorphone (HDM) to diacetylmorphine (DAM) for the treatment of long-term opioid-dependence. Long-term injection opioid users who were not sufficiently benefitting from available treatments (i.e. continuing to inject illicit opioids) were recruited from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, with most residing in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. Applicants were excluded if they were pregnant, or planning on becoming pregnant, had an imminent period of extended incarceration, or had severe medical conditions contraindicated for treatment with DAM or HDM (e.g. respiratory problems).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive injectable diacetylmorphine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;102) or hydromorphone (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) for six months. These medications were delivered under a &#x0201c;supervised model of care&#x0201d;, whereby registered nurses supervised participants&#x02019; self-administration of injectable opioids at the study site up to three times per day. The supervised model of care operates with three main objectives: 1) keeping patients and the community safe by providing pharmaceutical-grade injectable opioids under supervision (e.g. for prompt response in case of an overdose) and keeping the medications onsite (to minimize the potential risk to others); 2) Building relationships with patients that foster trust through daily interactions; and 3) providing opportunities for comprehensive care. In SALOME, medications were provided at up to 400&#x000a0;mg per dose, and up to 1000&#x000a0;mg per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Participants could adjust the dose and frequency of sessions in consultation with their physician. Doses were titrated individually in order to achieve a safe and effective dose for each participant. Doses were determined over a 3-day titration phase by the participant and the nurse. In rare cases a slower titration process was used based on the participant prior clinical experience or medical history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In consultation with the study physician, participants could add oral methadone to their care at any time. Additional details on the participant profile, screening procedures, study design and main results have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study measures</title><p>At baseline, prior to randomization, participants completed questions on a series of standardized instruments on topics such as drug use, and physical and psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Treatment outcomes were self-reported with the exception of urinalyses, and were collected at 6&#x000a0;months. Outcomes assessed included days of illicit heroin use, days of any illicit opioid use, days of non-legal activities, days of crack cocaine use, the proportion of urine samples positive for street heroin markers, the proportion of participants receiving treatment 28&#x000a0;days or more in the prior month (retention), and measures of physical and psychological health collected with the Maudsley Addiction Profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Adverse events were recorded as described in further detail in the main SALOME trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and classified with MedDRA codes. Given this is a secondary analysis from a non-inferiority clinical trial testing two medications in double blind conditions, there was no a priori power calculation for the present analysis testing differences in outcomes by gender.</p><p>Data on perceptions of why the treatment is effective come from one interviewer-administered questionnaire conducted in reference to the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment. As part of the questionnaire assessing blinding, participants were first asked: &#x0201c;Do you think this treatment was effective?&#x0201d; Participants could respond, &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;unsure&#x0201d;. Participants then provided open-ended responses to the question &#x0201c;why do you think this treatment was/was not effective?&#x0201d; In a clinical trial, protection of the blinding, and the collection of primary outcome data are prioritized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, as to not interfere with the clinical trial findings participants were not prompted to provide an in-depth response. Instead, the interviewer posed the question and then recorded the participant&#x02019;s verbatim response. Responses ranged from a few words to a few sentences. While this does not provide in-depth qualitative data, it provides novel information, and a perspective on treatment effectiveness not typically captured in the context of stringent randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline characteristics were tested by gender using Chi-Square tests and Student&#x02019;s t tests. At six months, differences between men and women were tested on eight outcome variables. Outcome variables were continuous (number of days in the prior month for illicit heroin use, any illicit opioid use, involvement in non-legal activity, crack cocaine use; MAP physical health score, and MAP psychological health score) and as proportions (urine positive for street heroin markers, and at least 28&#x000a0;days retention in treatment in the prior 30&#x000a0;days).</p><p>A separate model was fitted for each outcome, as dependent variables, for the differences between women and men. At six-months, there were a high proportion of participants reporting zero days in reference to prior 30&#x000a0;day illicit heroin use, illicit opioid use, non-legal activity, and crack cocaine use. As such, zero inflated poisson regression was used for these outcomes, given this model allows for the excess zeros, which cannot be predicted by the standard poisson model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These data are presented as the mean difference (with confidence interval) in the number of days at six-months. Linear regression was performed for the physical and psychological health variables, showing mean difference with confidence intervals. Finally, odd ratios were calculated using a logistic regression for the urine positive markers and retention variables.</p><p>All models were adjusted for treatment arm and the average daily dose. Models were also adjusted for baseline values using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to account for gender difference at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This is with the exception of the retention variable, and urine positive for street heroin markers (there is no baseline value for retention, and as per inclusion criteria all patients had urine positive for street opioids at baseline). For zero-inflated Poisson models, we compared the model fit with ordinary Poisson regression. For the logistic regression model and multiple regression models, goodness-of-fit was assessed by comparing to the null model. Residuals were also examined to identify potential outliers or misspecified models.</p><p>There were 4 missed assessments at 6&#x000a0;months (2 deceased, 1 missed visit, and 1 lost to follow-up). Missing values were imputed with multiple imputation, except when data were missing due to death, thus avoiding assigning a score to a deceased participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Types of non-legal activities and sources of income, for men and women at baseline and at six-months were explored using descriptive analysis. At each time point, differences between men and women in prior month legal, non-legal, and total sources of income were tested using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests. Differences in the proportion and days of non-legal activities were tested by gender using Chi-Square tests and Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests. These descriptive data are presented in Tables <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

Two-sided tests were used with a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Thematic analysis of open-ended comments</title><p>Thematic analysis of participant perceptions of treatment effectiveness was conducted. Two of the authors independently coded the transcripts (HP and KM). An inductive approach was taken with each comment assigned a code based on its semantic content. Themes and relationships across all participants&#x02019; comments were developed using the strategy of constant comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. After initial independent coding, the authors (HP and KM) met to discuss and review the initial list of themes. Themes were then further refined to ensure congruency between the content and the assigned theme (HP, KM, and EOJ). Analysis of open-ended comments was conducted using NVivo software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Women&#x02019;s and men&#x02019;s perceptions of treatment effectiveness were analysed together, rather than separately. Coders were blinded as to the gender of participants. Once the stages of coding were complete the number of women and number of men making a reference to each theme was recorded. It is possible that one participant made more than one reference at a given theme. As such, data presented are the number of participants that have at least one reference coded in a given category. This ensures themes are not overinflated by one particular participant&#x02019;s references, and allows for the comparison of the total number of women compared to men that made a reference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 202 SALOME participants, 62 self-identified as women (including 3 transgender participants identifying as women), and 140 self-identified as men.

There were a significantly higher proportion of women self-identifying as Indigenous, and a significantly higher proportion of women compared to men that had ever been paid in exchange for sex. Men reported significantly more months incarcerated in lifetime. Women reported significantly higher symptoms on the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP) physical and psychological health scores, indicating poorer baseline health compared to men.

While men and women referenced improved financial situation, men tended to make more comments on spending money on things other than drugs as compared to women. Comments made included statements like: &#x0201c;<italic>I still have money at the end of the month</italic>&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;<italic>I own things again, I am not spending it all on dope.&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Hardly spend money on drugs, spend it all on food&#x0201d;.</italic>
</p><p>Men and women had similar descriptions surrounding the model of care as a reason for treatment effectiveness. These comments reflect that the model allowed for individualized care, that it provided structure and security, and it is less stigmatizing than other models.<disp-quote><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings of the present study were consistent with the existing literature on treatment outcomes among men and women receiving injectable opioid assisted treatments for severe opioid use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Overall, no significant differences were found by gender in the tested efficacy outcomes. This finding is particularly relevant considering women presented to treatment with vulnerabilities not faced to the same extent by men. The supervised model of care with medically-prescribed injectable opioids aims to reach and treat individuals that, despite other options being available, continue injecting opioids in the street. The study participants presented to treatment after many years of injecting street opioids, with more than half of them reporting having a chronic condition that interferes with their daily lives, as well as histories of incarceration, sex work, and homelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. While SALOME participants represent the most vulnerable population of long-term street opioid-injection users, women face particular vulnerabilities and as such, it is important to determine whether this treatment engages and retains them into treatment as well as men.</p><p>After six months of treatment, no significant differences between men and women were found in days of illicit heroin use, illicit opioid use, nor proportion of urine positive for street heroin markers. A similar proportion of men and women were retained at six-months (approximately 80% had received treatment at least 28&#x000a0;days in the prior 30). Men and women reported a similar number of days using crack cocaine and involved in non-legal activity. While there were no significant differences in physical health scores, women&#x02019;s psychological health scores were significantly better than men&#x02019;s, after adjusting for baseline values, dose, and treatment arm. This is similar to findings in the NAOMI trial, where women in the DAM arm had significantly better psychological health scores than women in the methadone maintenance treatment arm, yet this difference was not seen in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>While men and women did not differ in terms of days of overall involvement in non-legal activities, there were gender differences when looking into the specific types of activities. For example, at both baseline and six-months significantly more women were involved in sex work as compared to men. Interestingly, the proportion of women engaged in sex work was not reduced significantly from baseline to six-months. While we are limited in our analysis and conclusions due to the small sample size, continued involvement in sex work presents a particular vulnerability, with potential implications for patterns of street drug use and health outcomes. In a prior clinical trial with a similar population, women engaged in sex work were more likely to continue injecting in the street and using cocaine. Also, women who were retained were less likely to be involved in sex work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>With such a high retention rate at six months for women receiving injectable treatment in SALOME (83%), there is a compelling case to make to offer this treatment to women that continue injecting in the street despite other treatment options being available. Access to injectable medications can provide a starting point to reconnect with the health care system, and work with patients to meet their individual needs. The supervised model of care is a bundle, meaning that every participant is offered all services available at the clinic. Participants are connected with services inside and outside of the clinic, based on their needs and willingness. Engaging with the clinic services up to three times a day for the medication provides nurses and health care allies opportunities to engage with the patients, to meet them where they are at, and to respond to particular vulnerabilities faced by patients in a timely manner.</p><p>This study also investigated participants&#x02019; reasons for treatment effectiveness. Prior studies suggest that distinct perceptions of treatment outcomes and effectiveness can be determined with gender-specific analyses. For example, a study of treatment outcomes among offenders in a residential substance use treatment program showed that men and women had differing perceptions of treatment, and emphasized the importance of considering perceptions of outcomes to best understand treatment needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Further, among a sample of long-term opioid dependent men and women in Vancouver, Canada, it was found that despite reporting similar treatment satisfaction scores, men and women had distinct perceptions of the positive aspects of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This evidence supports the added value of including open-ended questions to complement quantitative outcomes in studies of treatment effectiveness.</p><p>Our study found seven major themes. A similar proportion of men and women made references to each of these themes. There were however, particular nuances in the way in which men and women spoke about each of the themes. For example, women&#x02019;s comments surrounding improvements in health and quality of life were much more descriptive than men&#x02019;s. Women&#x02019;s comments ranged from references to personal growth and stability, to physical well-being and improvements in their social lives. Better health for women meant rebuilding relationships with family members, stronger self-connection, and better self-care in ways in which they saw tangible improvements (e.g. better nutrition leading to weight gain). These descriptions suggest that this treatment is particularly impactful for women&#x02019;s health.</p><p>Men made comments about reducing or stopping non-legal activities while receiving the treatment. A significant reduction in non-legal activities is a consistent outcome among studies of injectable opioid assisted treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This positive outcome is evident in the men&#x02019;s comments surrounding reductions in crime, describing reduced worry about arrest, no longer having the difficulty of engaging in the daily &#x0201c;hustle&#x0201d; to attain drugs, and freeing time in their day to engage in other meaningful activities. Although men and women had no differences in the reduction in the number of days engaged in non-legal activities, this study shows this outcome to be particularly relevant for men, according to their comments.</p><p>Before starting treatment with injectable opioids, it is possible that the medication itself (i.e. pharmaceutical grade heroin) is the most attractive component of care for the participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In a prior clinical trial it was found that many participants were drawn to the treatment just because of the possibility of receiving pharmaceutical grade heroin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, in the present study, when participants were asked why the treatment was effective for them, there was not a strong emphasis on the medication itself as a reason for treatment effectiveness. When participants made comments about the medication they were general (e.g. &#x0201c;I am not dope sick&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no withdrawal&#x0201d;). Instead, statements surrounding treatment effectiveness were primarily derived from comments about improvements made in various aspects of the participants&#x02019; lives that have been positively impacted by the treatment and services they had received. These descriptions were about health and quality of life, areas that participants were able to focus on given access to an effective medication.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those of The Experimental Narcotics Prescription Programme in Andalusia (PEPSA), a clinical trial of heroin-assisted treatment in Spain. This study found that when heroin, a substance typically obtained non-legally was medically prescribed there was a shift in the significance given to the substance itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Once the program took care of the injectable medication, many other needs beyond the medication became evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] allowing for participants to focus on improvements in physical and mental health, family relations, and employment.</p><p>In the present study, the men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s accounts of reasons for treatment effectiveness are in line with the idea that once participants were provided with access to the medication they were dependent on (i.e. physical treatment needs were met), they regained meaningful space and time to focus on other aspects of their lives. The recognition that patients&#x02019; needs may broaden throughout the course of treatment suggests that the treatment system must be prepared to respond to these needs, in a way that is flexible and reactive to the patient and their progress. Prior studies on patients receiving injectable opioids under supervision suggest that engaging patients in research regarding their perceptions of treatment (e.g. treatment expectations, treatment effectiveness) can provide a comprehensive assessment of treatment challenges and treatment needs in order to optimize the treatment received as they progress through treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, participants were asked to share their perceptions of treatment effectiveness. Evidence suggests that providing patients with the opportunity to discuss and share their perceptions of their treatment outcomes and effectiveness can serve as a source of empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This is particularly relevant to shifting away from traditional paternalistic approaches to the provision of health care services, to a system more focused on patient autonomy, shared decision making and patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Involving patients in the stages of outcomes research can work to enrich the scope with which researchers assess outcomes, can promote patient knowledge, and can contribute to an informed dialogue between patients and their health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Future clinical trials should consider the integration of similar open-ended questions on patient perceptions of treatment effectiveness to achieve these benefits.</p><p>There are several limitations that must be recognized. Given the nature of the study design, we are limited in our ability to observe more gender specific aspects of treatment beyond that of efficacy. Although we found that women in the DAM arm used a daily and average dose significantly lower than men, none of the potential explanatory factors tested were significant, nor provided explanation for this difference. It is important to note that doses were individually titrated, that overall there were no gender differences in treatment outcomes and that women were not more likely than men to correctly guess the treatment assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As such, it is possible that there is some unobserved variable driving this difference in dose, or that the sample size is too small to detect an effect. Data on participant perceptions of treatment effectiveness were collected while participants continued to receive blinded medication. This limited the depth of qualitative data that could be collected on perceptions of treatment effectiveness, as the collection of primary outcome data and protection of the blinding had to be prioritized. Finally, three participants self-identified as transgender women, and were included in the analysis as women. We recognize that transgender people face unique structural vulnerabilities, however with such a small sample we were not able to conduct separate meaningful analysis. The present study is a secondary analysis of data from the SALOME clinical trial. No a priori power calculations were conducted before performing the analyses reported herein. Hence, the analyses presented may be statistically under powered to detect clinically meaningful differences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The supervised model of care with injectable medications provides a particularly suitable framework for providing care to opioid-dependent men and women not attracted or retained by other treatments. Regardless of presenting to treatment with particular vulnerabilities not reported to the same extent by men, women achieved similar outcomes. As such, there is an important case to be made to make this treatment available to women. In the present clinical trial treatment effectiveness was meaningfully explained when participant perceptions were accounted for. Descriptions were centered on health and quality of life, areas that participants were able to focus on given access to a reliable and stable effective medication. Building on prior findings, this study adds evidence to support the provision of supervised injectable diacetylmorphine or hydromorphone to the most vulnerable men and women that inject street opiates and are not attracted or reached by other treatments.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DAM</term><def><p>Diacetylmorphine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDM</term><def><p>Hydromorphone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Maudsley addiction profile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMT</term><def><p>Methadone maintenance therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SALOME</term><def><p>Study to assess longer term opioid medication effectiveness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>First and foremost, we would like to acknowledge the contribution and commitment of the study participants who made it possible to continue advancing this research while overcoming its many challenges.
