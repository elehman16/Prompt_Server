Due to an aging population, the decline in CVD incidence observed during the past decades has not led to a decrease in hospital admissions and health-related costs due to CVDs. The size of the Danish population is about 5.5 million, and approximately 14,000 people die annually from CVDs, compared to 16,000 deaths caused by cancer, the most common cause of death. The annual CVD-attributable costs of hospital admissions amount to DKK 4.6 billion, while pharmaceuticals amount to DKK 2.4 billion. In addition, an unknown number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) occur.</p><p>Screening for CVD has been discussed intensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ultrasound-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) seems to reduce mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], while evidence supporting screening for ischemic heart disease is lacking. Population-based screening of high-risk individuals with the intention to initiate preventive treatment has not been associated with a reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>To assess the risk and target preventive interventions, global risk scores, such as the HeartScore and the Framingham Risk Score, are recommended. These scores are useful for combining individual risk factors (age, gender, diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels) into a single quantitative risk estimate. In Europe, individuals with a 10-year risk of CVD death &#x02265;5&#x000a0;% qualify for primary prevention, including lifestyle intervention and, in some cases, drug treatment. In individuals with a CVD death risk &#x02265;10&#x000a0;%, drug treatment is more frequently recommended. However, in individuals older than 65&#x000a0;years, the risk scores should be interpreted more leniently due to a lack of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Guideline-based recommendations on interventions for the elderly population are lacking despite the fact that more than 95&#x000a0;% of CVD deaths occur in people more than 65&#x000a0;years old. The European Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention 2012 acknowledge that &#x0201c;Prevention of CVD ideally starts during pregnancy and lasts until the end of life&#x0201d;, and states that &#x0201c;Studies have shown that preventive measures (i.e. BP lowering and smoking cessation) are beneficial up to advanced age.&#x0201d; However, elderly people have an increased risk of non-cardiovascular disease and all-cause death, and the guideline states &#x0201c;In persons older than 60, these thresholds should be interpreted more leniently, because their age-specific risk is normally around these levels, even when other cardiovascular risk factor levels are &#x02018;normal&#x02019;.&#x0201d;</p><p>Consequently, the primary aim of this so far stand-alone population-based, randomized trial will be to evaluate the health benefits and costeffectiveness of using non-contrast full truncus computer tomography (CT) scans (to measure coronary artery calcification (CAC) and identify aortic/iliac aneurysms) and measurements of the ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABI) as part of a multifocal screening and intervention program for CVD in men aged 65&#x02013;74. Secondary aims will be the prospective observational studies of the prognostic importance of the calcification scores of the carotid, aorta, iliac, and femoral arteries, as well as the pathophysiological and translational biomarker studies that are made possible by biobanking.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Calcified arteries: carotid, coronary, aortic, iliac, and femoral arteries</title><p>A low-dose CT scan without contrast can visualize calcifications of any artery. This technology was especially developed to evaluate for CAC, and several studies have demonstrated that the CAC scores improve the discrimination and reclassification of CAD above and beyond the traditional risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The prognostic value of grading calcifications of the carotid, aortic, iliac, and common femoral arteries is unknown. A few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of statin treatment in asymptomatic patients with CAC, but the results are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aneurysms</title><p>Level A evidence has shown that ultrasound-based screening for AAA in men aged 65&#x02013;74 years in Denmark reduces AAA mortality by 66&#x000a0;% at a cost of DKK 1,500 to 5,500 per life-year gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the procedure is being implemented in the UK, USA, and Sweden. By extending a non-contrast CT screening for CAC to include the abdominal aorta, the screening for AAA will incur a small additional cost, but it will also uncover thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and iliac aneurysms (IAs). Modern endovascular treatment may provide a low-risk intervention for these aneurysms. AAA, TAA, and IA will be diagnosed with close to 100&#x000a0;% sensitivity and specificity by the extended use of a non-contrast CT scan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)</title><p>Studies indicate that approximately 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% of men above 60&#x000a0;years old show signs of PAD and the proportion increases with age. Although three of four patients are asymptomatic, approximately 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of the patients with PAD will die from CVD within a 5-year period regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms or not. An even higher proportion will need hospitalization due to CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Efficient prevention of CVD-specific deaths, amputations, and other CVD events can be achieved through smoking cessation, exercise, a healthful diet, aspirin, lipid-lowering treatment, and treatment of elevated blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>The primary hypothesis is that the offer of an extensive cardiovascular screening and intervention program fulfills the WHO criteria for screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], especially concerning the significance of the diseases, the treatment benefits, and the cost effectiveness from a national health care system perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to establish the health effect and the second is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of an advanced cardiovascular screening and intervention program for men aged 65&#x02013;74 years in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a population-based randomized clinically controlled screening trial, randomizing two thirds of the study participants to usual care without any screening (<italic>control group</italic>), while one third of the participants are invited to screening of CAC, aneurysms, PAD, atrial fibrillation, and traditional risk factors (<italic>screening group</italic>). The control group will not be informed about the trial.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Power calculations</title><p>A total of 45,000 (about 3x14,647) men are needed to detect a 5&#x000a0;% reduction in overall mortality (hazard ratio (HR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95) with the risk for a type 1 error&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x000a0;% and the risk for a type II error&#x02009;=&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%.

HbA1c, lipid parameters, hemoglobin, creatinine kinase (CK), and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) are measured and biobank blood samples are stored. Bilateral blood pressure will be recorded three times after 5&#x000a0;minutes of supine rest. The ankle blood pressure will be measured concurrently with the brachial blood. The CT scan will cover the area from the mandibular bone distally to the proximal third of the femur. Calcium scores for the coronaries will be calculated.

If no dilation is found, the AP diameter will be measured at five sites (ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, abdominal aorta just above the bifurcation, and iliac artery). The heart rhythm shown by the telemetry of the CT scanner is noted. Data is entered in a web database at the screening site.</p><p>Two days later the blood tests are loaded to the web-based database.

However, several large epidemiological studies do suggest that radiation exposure is associated with a slightly increased risk of cancer. The best-studied cohort is the Japanese atomic bomb survivor cohort. In a group exposed to radiation doses of 5 &#x02013; 100&#x000a0;mSv (a mean dose of 29&#x000a0;mSv), 4,406 solid cancers were observed between 1958 and 1998, an excess of 81 solid cancers over the expected cancer rates. This finding corresponds to an excess relative risk of 2&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. No large studies involving medically exposed adult cohorts are available, but a linear no-threshold model has been considered. Thus, there may be no minimal radiation dose for an increased cancer risk, and the risk increases linearly with the radiation dose. The average dose in our pilot study was 1&#x000a0;mSv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For comparison, a typical dose of a mammogram is 0.2&#x000a0;mSv, the annual background radiation dose in Denmark is 3&#x000a0;mSv, and the average annual limit for radiation workers is 20&#x000a0;mSv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According to the Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics, a radiation dose of 0.1&#x02013;1&#x000a0;mSv to subjects under 50&#x000a0;year of age is associated with an overall cancer risk in the magnitude of 1 in 100,000, and to subjects older than 50&#x000a0;years, the radiation dose can be increased by a factor of 5 to 10.</p><p>An offer for screening is known to reduce the quality of life in the period leading up to the examination, but the effect fades out in the absence of a positive finding. It is unclear if a sustained reduction in the quality of life is caused by the diagnosis itself or by comorbidity, but the reduction is modest. Such &#x0201c;secondary side effects&#x0201d; should be weighed against the prophylactic benefits that might be achieved. A more serious problem in connection with the detection of aneurysms is the risk of death caused by rupture of the aneurysm in conservatively treated cases and perioperative deaths in cases where the AAA might not have otherwise ruptured. This serious ethical problem has no solution at present. We hope that the studies with the planned biobank will facilitate the development of a prognostic model.</p><p>Participants are mature men who are fully capable of deciding whether to accept or reject the invitation, and efforts have been made to provide a comprehensive explanation of the study in the invitation.</p><p>Participants will be given time to consider their participation before deciding and are informed that they may bring a companion, preferably a spouse/partner. In case of a positive finding, all participants will be offered an in-depth outpatient interview as soon as possible. At the consultation, information will be given concerning the prognosis of the positive finding and the need and benefit of prophylactic measures. Statin treatment may increase the risk of diabetes mellitus by 9&#x000a0;% (from 1.12&#x000a0;% to 1.22&#x000a0;% per year, adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). However, this risk is outperformed by the decreased risk of development of ischemic heart disease and stroke by 30&#x000a0;% and 19&#x000a0;%, respectively (from 1.29&#x000a0;% to 1.00&#x000a0;% per year, and 0.55&#x000a0;% to 0.45&#x000a0;%, respectively, adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Aspirin increases the risk of hemorrhage (from 0.07&#x000a0;% to 0.10&#x000a0;% per year) while decreasing the risk of CVD (from 0.57&#x000a0;% to 0.51&#x000a0;% per year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The side effects should be weighed against the risk reduction achieved. A specific dilemma is the situations in which AAA is diagnosed and requires surgery, which carries a 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;% mortality risk, which should be weighed against the mortality risk of approximately 90&#x000a0;% in AAA ruptures. When there is an AAA surgery indication, the patient is informed of the surgical risks and the risks of conservative treatment, and a surgery date is set. One of the project managers has experience in performing this function.</p><p>As a part of the study, a biobank will be organized. This will be maintained for a 15-year period, and data will subsequently be anonymous.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee for Southern Denmark (S-20140028) and the Data Protection Agency. It is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The target group was determined by cynical considerations of where the benefit was most likely to be highest and most cost effective. Younger men were excluded, as 85&#x000a0;% of all cardiovascular deaths in Denmark occur after the age of 65, the CAC scores, prevalences of aneurysms and PAD increase rapidly after the age of 65, and screening for AAA has proven beneficial and cost effective in men aged 65&#x02013;74.</p><p>Women were excluded, as although they increasingly die of CVD, it happens in general much later in life. Thus CVD-related morbidity and mortality in this age group is much higher in men &#x02014; at least in Denmark &#x02014; and screening for AAA is cost effective in men in this age group, while the prevalence in Danish women is 1&#x02013;2 out of 1,000 and thus most likely to be cost ineffective. However, the decision was difficult, and random samples of women aged 65&#x02013;74 and men aged 60&#x02013;64 will be invited in order to be able to estimate the benefit and cost-effectiveness by modeling<italic>.</italic></p><p>The trial compares active systematic preventive action based upon finding of subclinical arterial lesions in the coronary and lower limb arteries and the aortoiliacal vessels as well as classic risk factor management. If some are started by GPs without DANCAVAS criteria fulfilled, we consider that to be similar to what is happening in the control group. Consequently, it seems difficult to identify others in high risk without expensive angiographic examinations. Consequently, it could be questioned whether if no lesions were diagnosed, that existing preventive medication could be stopped. However, we decided on a pragmatic approach, as the patient could be worried if preventive actions were taken away, and his GP could become hostile for DANCAVAS recommendation concerning other patients of the GP.</p><p>We decided to define hypercholesterolemia as&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;mmol/L, which is relatively high. However, if any lesion was detected, statins were recommended regardless of plasma cholesterol. If no lesion is observed when a patient has very high cholesterol at the age of 70, it could be debated whether they should be treated at all, so we chose this high level.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Financial and budgetary administration</title><p>The participating sites will fund the CT scans and room facilities, while the study organization will cover the costs for the study staff, hemoglobin, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid, CK, and ALAT measurements, as well as biobanking.

This might be superfluous, because these individuals have documented CVD, and preventive care should have already been established. However, these patients do have an increased prevalence of aneurysms and may therefore benefit from the screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This possible benefit will be explored in detail in subgroup analyses. Another limitation is the lack of a non-imaging experimental group. Thus, in case there are benefits to the screening, we will be unable to differentiate whether the benefit was due to the imaging findings or due to treatment of classical risk factors, such as hypertension. However, in many of these elderly subjects, primary medical intervention is controversial, and the decision is left to the individual subjects with the GP minimizing the difference from the usual care. Additionally, in this study of males aged 65&#x02013;74 years, the major problem of unexpected sudden deaths among young men is not addressed. However, as the population gets older, this study will provide important knowledge about initiating prevention among retired men.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Feasibility</title><p>The two executive committee members, Axel Diederichsen and Jes Lindholt, have previously organized and implemented similar population studies concerning CAC, AAA, and PAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>In addition, several experts assist the members of the executive committee: Michael Hecht Olsen has experience investigating risk factors in large clinical trials and population-based studies.
