Prior chemotherapy was not allowed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-one patients were included, after signing an informed consent. Median age was 47.07 years, and 100% had stage IV. A total of 373 cycles was administrated. Main grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia in 1.1 %, anaemia in 0.5% and thrombopenia grade 2 in 1.1%. Nausea and vomiting grade 2&#x02013;3 occurred in 17.4%. Regarding efficacy, 49 out of 51 patients achieved four cycles. The overall response rate was in 84.1%, with complete response in 58.8% and partial response in 25.3%. Progression of disease occurred in 2.4%. Surgery was performed in 30 patients, and 13 had histological response (43.2%), with complete histological response in 36.6% and partial histological response in 6.6 %. The median time to progression was 13.3 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of DXR with GMZ in MBC appears to be an active regimen with a favourable toxicity profile. It is well tolerated and achieved encouraging pathological response rates.</p></sec></body></article>
