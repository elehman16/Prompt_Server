By wk208, following golimumab therapy for 3.5&#x02013;4&#x02005;years, mean changes in mSASSS were 2.1&#x000b1;5.2 for placebo crossover, 1.3&#x000b1;4.1 for 50&#x02005;mg and 2.0&#x000b1;5.6 for 100&#x02005;mg.

Golimumab-treated AS patients with no syndesmophytes and less systemic inflammation at baseline had considerably less radiographic progression.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ankylosing Spondylitis</kwd><kwd>TNF-alpha</kwd><kwd>Anti-TNF</kwd><kwd>Spondyloarthritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton characterised by spinal inflammation and new bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes and ankylosis. Inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and the spine can be identified by MRI at early and advanced stages of the disease. Both conventional radiographs and MRI are critical for classification and diagnosis of AS. Radiographic spinal changes in AS are quantified by the modified Stoke AS Spine Score (mSASSS). Such changes are largely of osteoproliferative nature and, in comparison with rheumatoid arthritis, they occur rather slowly, in some cases requiring up to 10&#x02005;years to become visible on plain radiographs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Radiographic damage in AS is associated with impaired physical function&#x02014;independent of patient-reported disease activity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of AS, and therapies that inhibit TNF have been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of this disorder.

Investigational study site and screening C-reactive protein (CRP) level (&#x02264;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl, &#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl) were included as balancing factors in the minimisation algorithm. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in the USA, Canada, Europe and Asia.</p><p>Patients eligible for enrolment must have had &#x02018;definite&#x02019; AS according to the modified New York criteria<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and symptoms of active disease (Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02265;4 and total back pain visual analogue scale score &#x02265;4, each on a scale of 0&#x02013;10&#x02005;cm); patients with complete ankylosis were excluded. Stable doses of methotrexate, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine were permitted until week 24, after which doses of these medications could be adjusted.</p><p>At week 16, patients who had &#x0003c;20% improvement from baseline in total back pain and morning stiffness entered double-blind early escape, such that patients in the placebo group began receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg and those in the golimumab 50-mg group had their dose increased to 100&#x02005;mg. Patients who were initially assigned to receive golimumab 100&#x02005;mg did not have any change in treatment regardless of whether they met the early escape criteria. At week 24, all patients who were still receiving placebo crossed over to receive golimumab 50&#x02005;mg. All patients continued their treatment regimen through week 100 in a double-blinded manner.</p><p>The GO-RAISE long-term extension (LTE) started with the week-104 administration of golimumab. The blind was maintained during the LTE until the last patient completed week-104 evaluations and the week-104 database was locked. Patients received golimumab every 4&#x02005;weeks for approximately 5&#x02005;years (final injection at week 252) from the initial (week 0) administration of study agent. After the week-104 study unblinding and at the investigator's discretion, patients receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg every 4&#x02005;weeks could increase their golimumab dose to 100&#x02005;mg every 4&#x02005;weeks. Patients receiving golimumab 100&#x02005;mg every 4&#x02005;weeks maintained this dose. A protocol amendment also allowed the golimumab dose to be decreased from 100 to 50&#x02005;mg after unblinding. Through week 256, 12 placebo and 19 50-mg patients increased the golimumab dose from 50 to 100&#x02005;mg, and four placebo, 12 50-mg and 22 100-mg patients decreased the golimumab dose from 100 to 50-mg (following escalation to 100&#x02005;mg in the case of placebo and 50&#x02005;mg patients). Also, beginning at week 104, concomitant disease modifying antirheumatic drug, corticosteroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy could be adjusted.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Radiographic assessments</title><p>Lateral view radiographs of the cervical and lumbar spine were performed at baseline, week 104, and week 208 and scored using the mSASSS scoring method<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> as follows: 0=normal; 1=erosion, sclerosis or squaring; 2=syndesmophyte; 3=bridging syndesmophyte (range: 0&#x02013;72). Scoring was conducted by two, centrally trained, independent readers who were blinded to treatment information and radiograph sequence, and scores were averaged between the two readers for analysis. The annual rate of progression during the trial was calculated as the change in observed (at week 104) or linearly extrapolated (at week 208) mSASSS score from baseline divided by the elapsed time in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses of imaging data collected through week 104 employed observed data; missing data were not imputed. Missing radiographic data at week 208 were replaced via linear extrapolation for 8.7% (26/299) of patients. Only patients with baseline and &#x02265;1 post-baseline score within an analytical window were included in the specific analysis. Radiographic data were summarised through the use of descriptive statistics according to randomised treatment group for all patients included in the radiographic substudy, as well as for patients with or without syndesmophytes at baseline. The presence of syndesmophytes was defined as &#x02265;1 level of spine with a score of &#x02265;2 (syndesmophytes) at baseline for &#x02265;1 reader. Fewer than 20% of patients with baseline syndesmophytes had them evaluated as such by only one reader.</p><p>In general, no statistical comparisons were conducted for week 104 or week 208 data, because all patients received golimumab from week 16 or week 24 onward. However, analyses of variance were employed to compare the mSASSS change from baseline between the golimumab 50-mg vs 100-mg groups, patients with baseline CRP &#x02264;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl vs &#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl, and patients with versus without baseline syndesmophytes. The proportion of patients with a definite change in radiographic progression, defined as mSASSS change &#x0003e;2,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> was also assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The GO-RAISE patient population has been described previously. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally similar across randomised treatment groups.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Of the 356 randomised patients, 299 (84.0%) had pre- and post-treatment data obtained for the GO-RAISE radiographic substudy. Among these patients, baseline mSASSS was numerically higher in placebo patients than in either golimumab group.

It should be noted that direct statistical testing comparing progression rates at the two time points is not appropriate due to different analytical rules that were applied for week 104 (observed) and week 208 (linearly extrapolated) data.</p><p>This is the first study to evaluate different doses of an anti-TNF agent in patients with established AS. The findings indicate no observable differences in mSASSS change between the 50&#x02005;mg and 100&#x02005;mg doses. This is in line with the GO-RAISE clinical findings through 2&#x02005;years that demonstrated no difference in clinical efficacy between the two doses.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> At the same time, these findings do not support the hypothesis that blocking TNF may have stimulatory effects on new bone formation over time.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Anti-TNF therapy has been shown to reduce both serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and spinal inflammation evaluated by MRI.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, decreased serum levels of interleukin-6 have demonstrated an association with later improvements in spinal inflammation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the relationship between spinal inflammation and radiographic damage is unclear,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the lack of inhibition of radiographic progression following anti-TNF therapy suggests that bone formation in AS is at least partly dissociated from inflammation.</p><p>Interestingly, mSASSS scores at both week 104 and week 208 indicated significantly less radiographic progression from baseline in patients with no baseline syndesmophytes when compared with patients who did have syndesmophytes at baseline. These data confirm earlier findings indicating that the presence of syndesmophytes at baseline predicts a greater rate of spinal radiographic progression.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Despite the current findings, there remains a potential role for anti-TNF therapy to prevent structural changes when given at much earlier time points in the course of axial spondyloarthritis corresponding to an inhibition of development of structural changes in AS. This hypothesis, however, needs to be tested. As suggested by MRI findings related to the phenomenon of fatty degeneration,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> the lack of effect on new bone formation in patients with more advanced AS may be because inflammatory lesions have already reached a more mature stage. Similarly, significantly less radiographic progression was observed in patients with baseline serum levels CRP&#x02264;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl, that is, those with less systemic inflammation, than in patients with more extensive baseline inflammation (CRP&#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;mg/dl). To determine whether baseline syndesmophytes and elevated CRP interact to have a combined effect on radiographic progression, and if so, whether an anti-TNF agent disrupts the synergistic interaction, further investigation is required.</p><p>The current analyses of radiographic data in the GO-RAISE trial are limited by the lack of placebo control past the initial 24&#x02005;weeks of the 208-week study period for radiographic progression. That 8.7% of patients were missing radiographic data through 4&#x02005;years of therapy also limits interpretation of these data.</p><p>In summary, results of this first report on the effects of long-term golimumab therapy on radiographic progression in AS suggest that neither dose of this TNF-antagonist inhibits structural progression in afflicted patients. Further, the findings suggest no acceleration of new bone formation over time in patients treated with golimumab for 4&#x02005;years. Longer-term follow-up studies will be necessary to further evaluate the effects of this treatment on radiographic progression in patients with AS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients, the investigators and the study personnel who made this trial possible.
