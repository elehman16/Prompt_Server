the deep abdominal muscles (SEDA) and lumbar stabilization exercise (LSE) on the thickness
of the transversus abdominis and postural maintenance on an unstable base of support.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were 20 male and 10 female adults in
their 20s without lumbar pain. They were equally and randomly assigned to a SEDA group and
a LSE group. The thickness of the transversus abdominis was measured using ultrasound
imaging during rest and drawing-in. The thickness of the transversus abdominis was
measured when subjects raised their right and left legs while lying on a Swiss ball.
[Results] Initially, there were no differences between the two groups. After the
intervention, significant differences were observed in all parameters. A significant
interaction between group and period was not found for any parameters. [Conclusion] In
conclusion, both SEDA and LSE thickened the transversus abdominis, which is a deep
abdominal muscle, thereby adjusting posture, and stabilizing the trunk. These exercises
increased the thickness of the deep abdominal muscles. They are important exercises for
improving the stability of athletes or patients who need postural adjustment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transversus abdominis</kwd><kwd>Selective exercise</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Training of trunk muscle control has been found to be effective at improving muscle
activity. Although there are many training methods, they can largely be divided into two
types of exercise: isolated voluntary contraction, and non-isolated voluntary contraction
that also includes co-activation of all trunk muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Selective exercise for the deep abdominal muscles (SEDA) is an
isolated voluntary contraction exercise. It generates smooth voluntary contraction of the
lower abdominal wall surface by pulling the muscle upward and medially without movements of
the pelvis, thorax, or vertebrae<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The abdominal drawing-in exercise, a SEDA, thickens and voluntarily activates the
transversus abdominis while leaving the externus obliquus abdominis and the internus
obliquus abdominis relatively unchanged<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The abdominal drawing-in exercise is often used as a stabilization technique to recover the
neuromuscular control of athletes whose trunk stability muscles have been damaged, and it is
widely known to reduce the pain of low-back pain patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Lumbar stabilization exercise (LSE) is a non-isolated voluntary contraction exercises.
It elicits postural adjustment and production of optimal power, coordinated movement of the
pelvis and trunk, and the ability to adjust the power and movement of the final phase of
integrated task activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. All muscles,
including the back muscles and abdominal muscles, contribute to trunk stability, and
exercise programs aimed at trunk stability include co-activation of the trunk flexor and
extensor muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Suni et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that LSE aligned the vertebrae the
neutral position. According to the results of their study, lumbar pain decreased and task
ability increased when the vertebrae were aligned in the neutral position as a result of
LSE, that also elicits co-contraction of the muscles. There have been many studies of
exercises that isolate certain muscles, but research on exercises using multiple muscles is
lacking. Accordingly, this study was conducted to examine the effects of SEDA and LSE
performed by adults on the thickness of the transversus abdominis and postural maintenance
on an unstable base of support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects provided their informed consent before participating in this study. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Daegu University, following
the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects of this study were 30 healthy adults in their 20s (males: 20, females: 10)
from B University, which is located in Daegu Metropolitan City. The criteria for the
exclusion were: a history of lumbar pain in the past six months, 2) congenital
malformation of the limbs, or orthopedic or neurological disease.</p><p>The subjects equally and randomly assigned to a SEDA group and a LSE groups, and they
performed their respective exercises in 30 minute sessions four times per week for five
weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The SEDA group received training on abdominal drawing-in using a pressure biofeedback
device. The abdominal drawing-in exercise was conducted lying down, and the knee joints
were flexed at 90&#x000b0;. The pressure biofeedback device was located under the lumbar vertebrae
of the subjects during the abdominal drawing-in exercise. The subjects watched the
pressure gauge connected to the pressure biofeedback device and were trained to increase
the pressure from 40 mmHg to 50 mmHg and then to maintain the pressure at 50 mmHg. Then,
the examiner instructed the subjects to maintain the position by pulling the navel upward
and posteriorly (in the direction of the lumbar vertebrae) so that the abdominal area was
slightly hollow during expiration. They were instructed to maintain the abdominal
drawing-in for 10 seconds. They rested for five seconds after each trunk. One set
consisted of 10 repetitions and 5&#x02013;7 set were performed in each session.</p><p>The LSE consisted of curl-up (raising the head and the thorax), side bridge (raising the
trunk in a side-lying position), and bird-dog (alternately raising one hand and one leg in
a quadruped position) exercise.</p><p>For the curl-up, the subjects lay in a supine position with their left knee joints flexed
at 90&#x000b0;, and they placed both hands behind their head. Then they raised their head and
their shoulders from the mat, maintained the position for 10 seconds, and then rested for
five seconds. They repeated this motion five times<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. They conducted this exercise for both sides performing three to
four sets in 10 minutes on each side.</p><p>For the side bridge, the subjects adopted a side-lying position on their left side on the
mat, supporting their weight with the left elbow and leg and then raising the hips. They
maintained this posture for 12 seconds and rested for five seconds. They repeated this
motion five times. They were then instructed to repeat the motion in a side-lying position
on their right side. They conducted the exercise on both sides, performing two to three
sets in 10 minutes fon each side<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the bird-dog, the subjects adopted a quadruped position, and maintained a drawing-in
position. Then they raised the left arm and the right leg until they were parallel with
the floor and held this position for 12 seconds. After the task, they rested for five
seconds. They repeated this task five times. Then they repeated the task, raising the
right arm and the left leg. They performed the alternately, performing two to three sets
within 10 minutes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ultrasound equipment (Achievo CST, KOASTRON Co., Singapore) with a 7.5&#x02005;MHz ultrasound
transducer were used for measurement. Ultrasound gel was applied between ultrasound probe
and the skin. The abdominal muscles were identified using ultrasound imaging. The
thickness of the transversus abdominis, internus obliquus abdominis, and externus obliquus
abdominis were measured 1&#x02005;cm from the boundary delineated by the fascia in the direction
of the central area of the muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
thickness of the transversus abdominis was measured during rest and drawing-in.
Measurements were taken three times, and the average value was used in the analysis.</p><p>For the measurement of the posture maintenance time, the motionless time was measured
while the subjects raised one leg in a supine position on a Swiss ball without support. In
order to exclude a carry-over effect, the order was randomly determined. Prior to the
experiment, the subjects were trained to sufficiently understand the content of the
exercises. The subjects repeated each exercise three times, and the average value was used
in the analysis. In order to minimize any muscle fatigue that might have occurred due to
repeated measurement, the subjects rested for one minute after each exercise.</p><p>SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical processing. Differences in the general characteristics
between the two groups were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed as a normality test for the measured values.
ICC<sub>(3.1)</sub> was used to derive the intra-rater reliability of ultrasound
measurements. Two-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in the
thickness of the transversus abdominis and the time taken to maintain the postures between
the two groups and period. The significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the SEDA group, the subjects&#x02019; average height was 169.8&#x02005;cm, and their average weight was

examined changes in the thickness of the transversus abdominis in order to verify changes in
the deep abdominal muscles associated with postural maintenance and adjustment, and how the
thickness affects postural adjustment.</p><p>Drysdale et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
muscle activity of the rectus abdominis and the obliquus externus abdominis decreased more
when subjects performed an abdominal hollowing exercise than when they performed a pelvic
tilt exercise. They indicated that the reason for this was that when the exercise was
properly performed, inducing contraction of local deep muscles, the transversus abdominis
was selectively contracted, while the global muscles of the surface, such as the rectus
abdominis, obliquus internus abdominis, and obliquus externus abdominis, were contracted
less<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, there were no differences in the two groups, characteristics and the
thickness of the transversus abdominis during the drawing-in maneuver increased after the
intervention. The transversus abdominis of the SEDA group became thicker than that of the
LSE group, because SEDA selectively and more effectively contracts the transversus
abdominis. Both the SEDA and the LSE are considered to elicit contraction of the transversus
abdominis and to thicken it. Kim et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that abdominal drawing-in exercise increased the thickness of the deep abdominal
muscles, significantly increased the thickness of the deep abdominal muscles of patients
with low back pain. Park et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that trunk stabilization exercise improved balance ability and postural
adjustment.</p><p>Hides et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
transversus abdominis, internus obliquus abdominis, and externus obliquus abdominis
stabilize the trunk and also play important role in postural adjustment, and in particular,
the transversus abdominis plays a major role, in stabilizing the lumbar region together with
the multifidus.</p><p>Ainscough-Potts et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
when the subjects sat on a ball supported by both legs, there was no change in the
transversus abdominis activity. However, when subjects sat on a ball supported by one leg,
the activity of transverse abdominis increased.</p><p>In this study, the transversus abdominis became thicker, and the time which subjects could
maintain posture on the ball increased of significantly after both interventions. Postural
adjustment was achieved and the trunk was stabilized by thickening of the transversus
abdominis as assessed by the maintenance of posture on an unstable base of support.
Moreover, it was reprted that more co-contraction of the abdominal muscles occurred when the
left leg was raised than when the right leg was raised, even though the base of support was
the same. This indicates that it is more difficult to maintain posture when the left leg is
raised<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the
subjects also reported that raising and maintaining their right leg was relatively more
comfortable than raising and maintaining their left leg after the transversus abdominis has
been thickened through exercise (when performing other exercises, they usually made the
first step with their right leg and mostly used their right leg).</p><p>In conclusion, both the SEDA and the LSE exhibited thickening of the transversus abdominis,
which is a deep abdominal muscle, thereby helping to adjust posture, and to stabilize the
lumbar region. These exercises increased the thickness of the deep abdominal muscles. They
are important exercises for improving the stability of athletes or patients who need
postural adjustment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tsao</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Hodges</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Persistence of improvements in postural strategies
