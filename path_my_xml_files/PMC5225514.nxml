It is therefore not known if treadmill exercise is an adequate form of airway clearance that could replace established airway clearance techniques, such as the Flutter&#x000ae;. The aim of this study was to evaluate respiratory flow, sputum properties and subjective responses of treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy, compared to resting breathing (control).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-four adults with mild to severe CF lung disease (FEV<sub>1</sub> 28&#x02013;86% predicted) completed a three-day randomised, controlled, cross-over study. Interventions consisted of 20&#x000a0;min of resting breathing (control), treadmill exercise at 60% of the participant&#x02019;s peak oxygen consumption and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy. Respiratory flow was measured during the interventions. Sputum properties (solids content and mechanical impedance) and subjective responses (ease of expectoration and sense of chest congestion) were measured before, immediately after the interventions and after 20&#x000a0;min of recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; resulted in similar significant increases in peak expiratory flow, but only Flutter&#x000ae; created an expiratory airflow bias (i.e. peak expiratory flow was at least 10% higher than peak inspiratory flow). Treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy resulted in similar significant reductions in sputum mechanical impedance, but only treadmill exercise caused a transient increase in sputum hydration. Treadmill exercise improved ease of expectoration and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy improved subjective sense of chest congestion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single bout of treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy were equally effective in augmenting mucus clearance mechanisms in adults with CF.

Interventions to improve mucus clearance are integral to the respiratory management of CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Most therapies are required daily and adults with CF report spending an average of 108&#x000a0;min on treatment activities each day, the majority of that time performing airway clearance and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Strategies to combine effective interventions to minimise treatment time are needed. Exercise improves physical fitness and may also improve lung function and quality of life in people with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If exercise also aids mucus clearance, it would reduce treatment time, as exercise could substitute airway clearance interventions, while gaining the other known benefits of exercise.</p><p>Airway clearance or physiotherapy techniques aim to improve mucus clearance by the following mechanisms: altering airflow (increasing the peak expiratory flow and creating an expiratory airflow bias, with the ratio of peak expiratory to peak inspiratory flow, PEF:PIF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.10); [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] improving the physical properties of the mucus; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] potentially increasing airway surface hydration; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and coughing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Treadmill exercise improves mucus clearance mechanisms in CF by increasing PEF and reducing sputum mechanical impedance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Physiotherapy with a device creating oscillating positive expiratory pressure, the Flutter&#x000ae;, is an established form of airway clearance in CF and is equally effective to other airway clearance techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Flutter&#x000ae; improves mucus clearance mechanisms in CF by increasing PEF and creating an expiratory airflow bias, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as well as reducing sputum mechanical impedance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Exercise and Flutter&#x000ae;, however, have not been compared. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy, compared to resting breathing (control), on respiratory flow (including airflow bias), sputum properties and subjective responses in adults with CF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Adult CF Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 17&#x000a0;years old, had a confirmed diagnosis of CF (genetic testing and/or previous positive sweat test results) and their treating physician deemed them to be clinically stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients were excluded if they had received a lung transplant, were infected with <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex or were pregnant. Potential participants were volunteers or personally approached by one of the researchers (TJD) at either a routine clinic visit or at the end of a hospital admission. Research procedures were approved by the Sydney South West Area Health Service Ethics Committee (Protocol X08-0175) and participants provided written informed consent prior to trial enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial was a randomised, cross-over design, registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12609000168257">ACTRN12609000168257</ext-link>). The study involved four visits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). On Visit 1, participants&#x02019; spirometry and lung volumes (via body plethysmograpy) (VMax229, SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, USA) were measured according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Participants then completed an incremental peak treadmill exercise test, according to a modified Balke protocol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with breath-by-breath measurement of ventilatory and metabolic variables (VMax229 system) and pulse oximetry (Radical<sup>TM</sup>, Masimo, Irvine, USA). All exercise tests were classified as maximal effort according to the criteria outlined in the CF exercise testing guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Participants were taught to use the Flutter&#x000ae; device (Flutter VRP1 valve&#x000ae;; Axcan Scandipharm Inc., Birmingham, USA) by a senior physiotherapist. If participants were using the Flutter&#x000ae; on a regular basis, any corrections to their technique were made if necessary. After completion of all study procedures on Visit 1, participants were randomised to the order of interventions for the following three sessions (Visits 2, 3 and 4). Intervention order was determined by computer-generated randomisation (with a random integer generator on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/">www.random.org</ext-link>). Randomisation was performed by a person not involved in the interventions on Visits 2, 3 and 4 and stored in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow during the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12890_2016_360_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Visits 2, 3 and 4 were scheduled at the same time in the morning within a one-week period (during which medication, airway clearance and exercise regimens were unchanged). Participants were also asked to withhold routine mucolytic therapy, airway clearance and exercise on the morning of a trial visit. On each Visit 2, 3 and 4, sputum samples were collected immediately before (pre) and after (post&#x02009;+&#x02009;0) a 20-min intervention, and after a further 20&#x000a0;min of resting breathing/recovery (post&#x02009;+&#x02009;20). If participants spontaneously expectorated a sputum sample in the five minutes following the intervention (i.e. they were not requested to do so), this was also collected (post&#x02009;+&#x02009;5).

</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment interventions</title><p>For the control intervention, participants sat quietly for 20&#x000a0;min. For the exercise intervention, participants exercised on the treadmill for 20&#x000a0;min at a constant work rate equivalent to 60% of the peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) achieved in the incremental peak treadmill test on Visit 1. This intensity and duration were chosen to replicate a typical prescription used for exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Flutter&#x000ae; therapy intervention consisted of breathing through the Flutter&#x000ae; for 15 breaths, followed by relaxed and deep breathing, huffing and coughing, according to the FET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This cycle was repeated six times. The Flutter&#x000ae; angle/inclination was chosen for each participant that maximised the sensation of vibrations within the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and held in a constant position with a clamp during the intervention. The Flutter&#x000ae; angle was measured with an inclinometer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Respiratory flow</title><p>During each 20-min intervention, respiratory flow was measured with a heated pneumotachograph (Hans Rudolf model 3813, Hans Rudolf Inc., Kansas City, USA), calibrated on each occasion, where scaling factors were pre-determined by a rotameter (Model 2000 Fisher Controls, Croydon, England). The Flutter&#x000ae; was attached to the expiratory port of a two-way non-rebreathing valve (2700 series, Hans Rudolf Inc.) in order to collect inspiratory and expiratory flow (i.e. the participant inspired through the pneumotachograph and expired through the pneumotachograph and Flutter&#x000ae;). Data were collected at 125&#x000a0;Hz and flow signals were later analysed by a blinded assessor using custom-made software (PhysioDAQxs v3.0 and Breathalyser v1.0, University of Sydney, Australia) to determine PEF and airflow bias (PEF:PIF) for all interventions, and oscillation frequency during the Flutter&#x000ae; intervention. For the Flutter&#x000ae; intervention, respiratory flow was measured only whilst participants breathed in and out through the Flutter&#x000ae; (i.e. not during the FET component of the intervention).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sputum properties</title><p>Sputum samples were manually separated from saliva and stored in 1.2&#x000a0;mL tubes in a &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C freezer. The storage tubes were coded, to ensure de-identification at later analysis when measured by a blinded assessor. Sputum analysis procedures were followed as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The sputum solids content percentage, from which inferences of airway hydration are made, was estimated by measuring the weight of a 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L aliquot of sputum before and after lyophilisation to dryness for 24&#x000a0;h using a freeze dryer (Kinetics, Stone Ridge, USA). Sputum elasticity (dynamic G&#x000b4;) and viscosity (dynamic G&#x000b4;&#x000b4;) were measured using a 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L aliquot of sputum and a controlled stress rheometer with geometry 20&#x000a0;mm, 0.5&#x000b0; aluminium cone and plate over the frequency of 1&#x02013;100&#x000a0;rad/s (AR2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, USA). The results were reported as sputum mechanical impedance (G*), also known as rigidity factor, which is the vector sum of viscosity and elasticity. Sputum mechanical impedance values at 1&#x000a0;rad/s represent sputum properties during resting breathing and mucociliary clearance, values at 100&#x000a0;rad/s represent those during cough and cough clearance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cough</title><p>All coughs (spontaneous and those directed, according to the FET) were manually counted during each 20-min intervention and recovery period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Subjective responses</title><p>For each requested sputum sample, participants recorded on a 10&#x000a0;cm visual analogue scale the subjective sense of chest congestion (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;very congested, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;very clear) and ease of expectoration (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;very difficult to expectorate, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;very easy to expectorate).

The main findings were that both treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; resulted in similar significant increases in PEF, but only Flutter&#x000ae; created an expiratory airflow bias. In addition both treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy resulted in similar significant reductions in sputum mechanical impedance, but only treadmill exercise caused a transient increase in sputum hydration.</p><p>The PEF and airflow bias measured during treadmill exercise was similar to that reported by our group previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The PEF and oscillation frequency measured during Flutter were higher than previously reported by our group (1.53&#x000a0;L/s v 1.13&#x000a0;L/s and 17.5&#x000a0;Hz v 11.3&#x000a0;Hz respectively), yet the airflow bias was similar (1.13 v 1.15), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and above the 1.10 threshold proposed to augment annular flow of mucus towards the oropharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The higher PEF and oscillation frequency with Flutter&#x000ae; in this study compared to our earlier work may be explained by the Flutter&#x000ae; position. In the earlier study the Flutter&#x000ae; was used in the horizontal position for all participants, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] however in the current study the Flutter&#x000ae; inclination was individually determined (with an average angle 7.3&#x000b0; above the horizontal). Holding the Flutter&#x000ae; at higher inclinations results in higher oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The reductions in sputum mechanical impedance following treadmill exercise were similar to those reported previously by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Different techniques to measure sputum viscosity and elasticity prevented comparing the changes following Flutter&#x000ae; therapy in this study to those reported by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our study found no significant difference between treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy in the reductions in sputum mechanical impedance, suggesting that the combined effects of shearing forces and airway oscillations with the two interventions were similar.</p><p>There was no change in sputum hydration immediately following treadmill exercise or after 20&#x000a0;min of recovery, similar to our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, we found a significant reduction in sputum solids content in the five minutes following treadmill exercise but not after Flutter&#x000ae; therapy. Previously researchers have shown an inhibition of sodium conductance channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and altered ion regulation with submaximal cycle exercise in adults with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], suggesting improved airway hydration or airway surface liquid, however these changes only lasted for four minutes after ceasing exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our study provides some evidence to support the proposed increase in mucus water content with exercise in CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The 1.2% reduction in sputum solids content that we observed is likely to be clinically significant as it is similar to that achieved with mannitol in people with CF, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] which results in significant improvements in mucus clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and lung function in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the improved changes in sputum properties, participants reported significant improvements in ease of expectoration following treadmill exercise but not following Flutter&#x000ae; therapy. Alternately, participants reported significant improvements in subjective sense of chest congestion following Flutter&#x000ae; therapy but not following treadmill exercise. We did not measure the amount of sputum expectorated, as this would have interfered with sputum rheology and solids content measurements. Perhaps treadmill exercise facilitated sputum expectoration (due to increased PEF and reduced sputum mechanical impedance), but participants did not spontaneously expectorate sufficient sputum to feel less chest congestion. Also, potentially the format of the FET during Flutter&#x000ae; treatment (18 directed coughs in 20&#x000a0;min) increased the amount of sputum expectorated (and hence sensation of less chest congestion), but it was a taxing treatment and so participants did not consider it easier to expectorate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single bout of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy improved mucus clearance mechanisms in adults with CF. Both treatments increased PEF, but only Flutter&#x000ae; created an expiratory airflow bias. Both treatments resulted in similar significant reductions in sputum mechanical impedance, however only treadmill exercise created a significant transient reduction in sputum solids content. It would therefore appear that treadmill exercise and Flutter&#x000ae; therapy are equally effective in augmenting mucus clearance mechanisms in adults with CF. Physiological or mechanistic findings on their own, however, are insufficient to implement changes to clinical practice. Studies that directly measure mucus and mucociliary clearance or longer term studies with clinically important outcomes (such as exacerbation frequency, antibiotic use, quality of life and lung function) are required to ascertain the relative merit of these interventions and to determine if people with CF can use exercise alone as an adequate form of airway clearance therapy.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p>
