Synergistic and competitive interactions can occur between parasite species, which can influence the likelihood of their successful transmission to other hosts and increase or decrease their overall pathogenic impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that over a third of the world's population are infected with helminths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or one or more of the <italic>Plasmodium </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Populations infected with helminths and <italic>Plasmodium </italic>are mainly confined to the tropics and subtropics and this results in high rates of co-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that helminth infections can impact on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and alter susceptibility to clinical malaria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Helminth-malaria interactions have been studied in animals models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date human studies investigating helminth-malaria interactions have been carried out in older age groups with contrasting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In 2001, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution urging member states to control the morbidity of soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections through large-scale use of anthelminthic drugs for school-aged children in less developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has also been recommended that preschool children should be included in these deworming programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given that preschool children, defined as aged less than five years, make up between 10%-20% of the two billion people worldwide who are infected with STHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and young children are a high risk group for malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is essential to determine whether or not deworming programs have the potential to significantly impact on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections in preschool children.</p><p>The need for well-designed longitudinal intervention studies to examine the relationship between helminths and malaria has been acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To date, two intervention studies in the published literature have investigated the relationship between <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>and malaria, both of which have included school age children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We therefore conducted the first double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial to establish the effect of repeated four-monthly anthelminthic treatments for 14 months on the prevalence of Plasmodium infection and Plasmodium parasite density in preschool children living in four semi-urban communities in Nigeria where STH prevalence is high.</p><p>We have previously reported that 50% of the preschool children recruited into this trial were infected by one or more helminths, the most prevalent STH being <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>(47.6%), and that repeated four-monthly treatments were successful in significantly reducing the prevalence and intensity of <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This paper investigates the potential impact of anthelminthic treatment on Plasmodium infection in the same cohort of children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study area and participants</title><p>The study was carried out between May 2006, and August 2007, in four semi-urban villages, Akinlalu, Ipetumodu, Moro and Edunabon, situated near Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. The dry season extends from November to March while the rainy season occurs from April to October [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. STHs and malaria are endemic in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Malaria transmission is intense, occurring all year round, with a major peak during the rainy season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>P. falciparum </italic>is the predominant species, present in the majority (99.5%) of Plasmodial infections, while <italic>P. malariae </italic>and <italic>P. ovale </italic>are present in 17% and 9.8% of infections respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The study area, participants, enrolment, study design, randomization and sample size estimate have been previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Informed consent was obtained from each mother to enroll their child. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals' Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial. Children aged 12-59 months were randomly assigned to receive either albendazole or placebo every four months for 12 months with a follow-up at 14 months. Children who complied with all the assessments received either treatment (albendazole) or placebo tablets on four occasions. Children aged one year received 200 mg of albendazole (1 tablet) and children aged &#x02265; 2 years received 400 mg (2 tablets) of albendazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Children in the placebo group were treated with albendazole at the end of the study. This trial is reported in accordance with the CONSORT guide-lines for randomised studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Children were screened for STHs and Plasmodium at baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 14 months. Stool samples were obtained before treatment was provided and stools were processed by formol-ether concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To maintain consistency all stool samples (one per child per time point) were examined by PK. The primary outcomes were infection with <italic>Plasmodium </italic>spp., <italic>Plasmodium </italic>density, and malaria attacks. The secondary outcomes were haemoglobin concentration and nutritional status. Finger-prick blood samples were used to undertake a malaria rapid test and make thick and thin blood smears for each child. <italic>Plasmodium </italic>was diagnosed using Parascreen rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs; Zephyr Biomedicals, Verna Industrial Estate, Verna Goa, India). In line with local practice, on the day of the assessment, an 'uncomplicated' malaria attack was defined as a positive RDT and a fever (&#x0003e; 37.5&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Children suffering a malaria attack were treated with Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Data from Parascreen RDTs are not presented in this paper. For the purpose of analysis, malaria attacks were defined retrospectively as children with a fever (&#x0003e; 37.5&#x000b0;C) who were diagnosed with <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasites by microscopy of blood slides. Due to the overwhelming prevalence of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>in this region, the infections were not further divided into those with <italic>P. malariae </italic>or other species for the analysis. Slides were stained with a 3% Giemsa solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and examined using a &#x000d7; 1000 oil immersion magnification by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). Total <italic>Plasmodium </italic>density was measured by counting the number of asexual parasites against 200 leucocytes in the thick blood film and assuming an average of 8000 leucocytes/&#x003bc;L of blood.</p><p>Anthropometric measurements (height and weight) and nutritional assessments have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Haemoglobin (g/dl) was measured with a haemoglobinometer (Accuscience, Ireland) from a finger prick blood sample. The haemoglobinometer was calibrated daily prior to fieldwork. Auxillary temperature was taken with a digital thermometer. All children received 10 ml of oral multivitamins (over two days) as an incentive at each time point. Each 5 ml of multivitamin contained: Vitamin A 3000 IU, Vitamin B2 2.0 mg, Nicotinamide 15.0 mg, Vitamin B1 1.5 mg, Vitamin B6 2.0 mg, Vitamin D2 400 IU, D panthenol 1.0 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out in SPSS 14.01 and R v2.6.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Socio-economic status (SES) was calculated as a score based on the number of key possessions (type of toilet facilities, generator, fridge, television, radio, mobile phone) in each child's household. A measure of household income was also included in the index calculation.</p><p>Children in the treatment and placebo groups were compared on the basis of their baseline characteristics: age, sex, village, SES, parasitic infections and clinical indicators (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A similar analysis was also undertaken to compare the characteristics of children that were lost to follow-up and children that were included in the analyses. Children were included in the analyses if they complied with the four assessments and follow up at 14 months. Statistical analyses were carried out using Chi-squared tests for proportions (or Fisher's exact test when more than 20% of the cells had expected counts &#x0003c;5), two-sample t-tests to test eggs per gram (epg) and SES and Mann Whitney U tests to test continuous variables that were non normally distributed.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics - comparing individuals who did not fully comply and individuals who were analysed and individuals in the treatment and placebo groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Individuals who did not comply<break/>(N = 908)</th><th align="left">Analysed individuals<break/>(N = 320)</th><th align="center">P-value</th><th align="left">Treatment Group<break/>(N = 158)</th><th align="left">Placebo Group<break/>(N = 162)</th><th align="center">P-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Characteristic</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Age (years)</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;1</td><td align="left">314 (34.6%)</td><td align="left">108 (33.8%)</td><td align="center">0.137<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">59 (37.3%)</td><td align="left">49 (30.2%)</td><td align="center">0.085<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;2</td><td align="left">202 (22.2%)</td><td align="left">86 (26.9%)</td><td/><td align="left">38 (24.1%)</td><td align="left">48 (29.6%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;3</td><td align="left">204 (22.5%)</td><td align="left">76 (23.8%)</td><td/><td align="left">31 (19.6%)</td><td align="left">45 (27.8%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;4</td><td align="left">188 (20.7%)</td><td align="left">50 (15.6%)</td><td/><td align="left">30 (19%)</td><td align="left">20 (12.3%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Male</td><td align="left">475 (52.3%)</td><td align="left">159 (49.7)</td><td align="center">0.419<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">85 (53.8%)</td><td align="left">74 (45.7%)</td><td align="center">0.146<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Female</td><td align="left">433 (47.7%)</td><td align="left">161 (50.3)</td><td/><td align="left">73 (46.2%)</td><td align="left">88 (54.3%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Village</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Akinlalu</td><td align="left">112 (12.3%)</td><td align="left">73 (22.8%)</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;

The Plasmodium prevalence data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model using a logit function with the assumption that the observed data were binomially distributed. The analyses were run in R v2.6.2 using the function <italic>lmer </italic>contained in the package <italic>lme4</italic>. A random effect for each individual was included to take account of the nested data structure (multiple observations made on each child). The effect of treatment (treatment or placebo), village and sex were included as fixed factors, and time as a linear covariate. Data were analyzed initially for all age groups combined (1-4 year olds at enrolment) and then identical analyses were performed on each separate age group (1, 2, 3 and 4 years). Parameter effects in the linear mixed effects models are estimated on a linear scale as log(<italic>odds</italic>), their effects are correspondingly additive with respect to their intercept, and the presented standard errors of the estimates are symmetrical. In order to determine the proportional change in <italic>odds </italic>referred to in the text, we calculate exp(log(<italic>odds</italic>)) so that the effects on the odds scale are correspondingly multiplicative with respect to their intercept.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite density was measured at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 14 months. <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite density at baseline was subtracted from the densities at 4, 8, 12 and 14 months to provide a measurement for the rate of change in malaria parasite density. Since the data were not independent it was analysed by repeated measures rmANOVA (General Linear Model) with the different time points as a within-subject factor. Group, village, age and sex were chosen as the between-subject factors. The distribution of <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite density was not normal and therefore was log-transformed for the purposes of statistical analysis. The malaria attack data was not analyzed because the data were sparse and over-dispersed.</p><p>Haemoglobin concentration was measured at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 14 months from the same individuals and was analysed using rmANOVA using the same procedure as for the <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite density.

This suggests that when children of this age group become infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, infection with <italic>Ascaris </italic>could potentially influence the ability of the child's immune response to clear the <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection. The immunological mechanism of action that underlines helminth/malaria interactions has been discussed and some authors suggest that helminths can contribute to the slow acquisition of immunity to malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The greater increase in <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasite density in the placebo group further supports the evidence that suggests that <italic>Ascaris </italic>can leave children aged 1 to 4 years less able to control <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection although this was not statistically significant. This potential positive impact of anthelminthic treatment on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections in pre-school children contrasts with the results of other studies investigating the relationship between <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>and malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Two studies using an intervention have been undertaken in the Comoros islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Madagascar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Both studies have included subjects with a wide age range, 2-14 yrs and 0 - &#x0003e;15 yrs, respectively. In the Comoros study, children with heavy <italic>Ascaris </italic>infections demonstrated an increase in clinical malaria cases with anthelmintic treatment. In the present study, the significant effect of anthelmintic treatment on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections was demonstrated in a group of children where the majority (85.9%) had light <italic>Ascaris </italic>infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The Comoro study had limitations and has been criticized for its small sample size (112), short follow-up (20 days) and severely malnourished study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In Madagascar, Brutus and colleagues revealed that while there was no effect of levamisole treatment on <italic>P. falciparum </italic>parasite density in children aged &#x0003c; 5 years, subjects more than five years of age had a significant increase in their <italic>P. falciparum </italic>parasitaemia compared with untreated controls[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The small sample size (n = 67) in the six month to four year age group may not have been sufficient to detect an effect of anthelmintic treatment on <italic>P. falciparum </italic>parasitaemia. Furthermore, the prevalence of <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>in this age group may have been very low in comparison to these Nigerian children considering that the prevalence in the treatment (26.2%) and placebo (27.4%) groups was moderate at entry into the study. Differences in acquired malaria immunity, owing to different transmission settings, in the Nigerian and Madagascan population may also have contributed to the contrasting results.</p><p>An observational field-based, case-control study in rural Senegal investigated the relationship between <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>and severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrating that children infected with <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>had an increased risk of severe malaria. This is in line with the results of the present study which demonstrate that children infected with <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>are apparently less able to control their malaria infections, albeit uncomplicated malaria infections. Other studies investigating the relationship between helminths and malaria, not differentiating between helminth species, have also shown comparable results to this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, as expected haemoglobin levels increased over the study period as the children increased in age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, There was a steeper increase in the change in haemoglobin level among children in the treatment group when compared to the placebo group. This trend corresponds with the lower increase in prevalence of malaria infections associated with the transmission season in the treatment group. Malaria infection is associated with a reduction in haemoglobin levels and can frequently lead to anaemia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], especially in younger children and infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite the fact that the trend in haemoglobin level was not statistically significant, the observations further support the evidence that <italic>Ascaris </italic>can leave these preschool children less able to control their <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections.</p><p>The study may have some potential limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the findings. <italic>Plasmodium </italic>prevalence and parasite densities were significantly lower in the placebo group at baseline and thus it could be argued that that the placebo group had more potential for increasing <italic>Plasmodium </italic>prevalence and parasite densities than the treatment group. However, <italic>Plasmodium </italic>prevalence was comparable in the treatment and placebo groups at 8 months and while prevalence increased in the placebo group from the dry to the wet season, when malaria transmission was likely to be low, the prevalence reached a plateau in the treatment group. This trend does not support the theory that the faster increase in <italic>Plasmodium </italic>prevalence in the placebo group was due to differences in <italic>Plasmodium </italic>prevalence at baseline. Participants were not randomly selected from the community. Achieving a random sample of study participants in this field setting would prove very difficult owing to the widely dispersed nature of these semi-urban communities, and to the restricted age group being studied. Nevertheless, we believe that the moderate sample size, small age range and randomised design may compensate for the non-random selection of study participants. The majority of children (74%) were lost to follow-up. This high attrition rate may be attributed to the difficulty in retaining the participation of such young children particularly because they are not of school-going age. School-based studies provide a better infrastructure and can improve compliance considerably[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Bias caused by such losses was probably minor because those lost were similar with respect to important characteristics to those that were analyzed, apart from village and weight. Akinlalu is less widely dispersed than the other villages and this may account for the higher compliance shown in Akinlalu and any potential bias owing to this was taken into account by adjusting for village in the analyses. We do not believe that the intake of Coartem had any effect on the results because few treatments (98) were given during the study period and there was no significant difference in the intake of Coartem between the two groups. Information on whether the children received treatment for malaria prior to the assessments was not recorded. The inhabitants of these semi-urban villages have poor access to healthcare. The Primary Health Care centres have inadequate medical supplies and the staff are often poorly trained. Although malaria is hyperendemic in Osun state, the authors believe that the children did not receive appropriate treatment for malaria outside of the study setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated that the odds of having <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection increased over time for children who received both treatment and placebo, however this increase was significantly slower in the treatment group. This observation therefore provides some evidence to suggest that infection with <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>leaves these preschool children less able to control their <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection.</p><p>Previous research has shown that repeated two-monthly anthelminthic treatments can have a significant impact on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and the present study suggests that longer intervals of treatment can also have a beneficial effect. The four-monthly treatments used here are also a better representation of the delivery frequency of anthelminthics in deworming control programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The potential impact of anthelminthic treatment on <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections demonstrated in these preschool children implies that large-scale deworming programmes may have a protective effect on malaria morbidity in these children in this particular setting.</p><p>Recently, the potential opportunities for combined control of malaria and helminths have been recognised[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Efforts are already underway in central Nigeria where the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets has been combined with mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis and STHs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Treating children and adults concurrently for helminth and <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections may be prudent as interactions may vary with helminth species which is plausible as different helminths and protozoa have synergistic and antagonistic interactions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The integrated management of <italic>Plasmodium </italic>and helminth infection could avoid possible unforseen effects of mass distribution of anthelminthic drugs on malaria. There is still much we do not know about helminth-malaria interactions. While the results of this study provide some illumination of potential interactions between <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>and malaria in children aged 1-4 years, we do not know what the outcome of these interactions will be in populations from different geographical settings in areas of low malaria transmission. It is crucial that this topic receives more attention, in light of a renewed emphasis on deworming and the fact that integrated control programs for malaria and helminths are not yet widespread.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>GlaxoSmithKline sponsored the drug albendazole which was used in the study.
