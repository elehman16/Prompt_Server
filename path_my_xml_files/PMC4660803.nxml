Childhood obesity is one of the main predictor factors of adult obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with a high risk that an obese adolescent has 80&#x000a0;% chance of becoming an obese adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a country with an emerging economy, data from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) show that 4&#x000a0;% of female and 5.9&#x000a0;% of male adolescents are obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is characterized by excess body fat accumulation resulting from genetic and behavioral factors that lead to chronic positive energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Adipose tissue is metabolically active that contributes significantly to the overall homeostasis by secreting inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that may have a causal role in the development of several diseases. This inflammation is directly related to excess body fat, especially visceral fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This inflammatory milieu has direct influence on high concentrations of lipid and glucose profiles and the insulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thus impacting major organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.</p><p>Physical activity, particularly exercise training, remains to be a cornerstone of pediatric obesity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Some main objectives of exercise for the treatment and prevention of obesity are: to reduce body fat, stabilize concentrations lipids, glycemic, and hormones such as insulin and cytokines produced by adipose tissue. In addition, an increase in fat-free body mass, mediated by physical exercise, may be beneficial to energy metabolism and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Aerobic exercise is a commonly recommended model for obese individuals, with beneficial effects on body composition, lipid profile, blood pressure, glycemic control and cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In comparison, resistance training increases muscle mass, strength, and endurance, and increased bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Concurrent training, designed to activate two different metabolic pathways (aerobic and anaerobic) thus is thought to enhance the effects of both aerobic and resistance training models.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to compare the effects aerobic and concurrent on body composition and metabolic profile in obese adolescents in a randomized control trial. Our primary hypothesis was that the concurrent training would significantly decrease total percent fat (% fat) in comparison to the control group in 20&#x000a0;weeks. Our explorative hypotheses were that, standard aerobic training, if matched for training frequency and volume, would have comparable effects as compared to the concurrent training group, and that individual baseline metabolic profiles could contribute to the effectiveness of training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>This research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the <italic>Universidade Estadual Paulista</italic>, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil (protocol number 07/2009).

Thus, the practice of regular exercise is seen as an important part in this process. There are divergences in the literature regarding various training models on reducing body fat in obese youth. Our study compared the effects of two types of exercise training modalities (aerobic and concurrent) for 20&#x000a0;weeks to a placebo control group in obese adolescents.</p><p>Our primary finding was that a significant decrease in total %BF was achieved in both training modalities as compared to the control group. The magnitude of %BF reduction in our study (&#x02212;2.9&#x000a0;% and &#x02212;3.6&#x000a0;% by concurrent and aerobic training) was comparable to Lee et al. (&#x02212;2.6&#x000a0;% and &#x02212;2.5&#x000a0;% by aerobic and resistance training groups) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but greater than the aerobic and resistance-only training groups in a recent study by Sigal et al. (&#x02212;1.1&#x000a0;% to &#x02212;1.6&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lee and colleagues only studied male adolescents, and the aerobic training frequency and intensities were similar to ours, and achieved the reduction in %BF in three months (12&#x000a0;weeks) while on a weight maintenance diet. The sample size (11&#x02013;16 subjects per group) was also similar to ours, but the compliance of their study was around 99&#x000a0;% as compare to ours. Sigal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] had a much larger sample size (about 75 subjects per group, about 2:1 ratio of girls to boys) and the intervention was six months. Yet, despite of a prescribed &#x02212;250&#x000a0;kcal/day energy deficit diet, only a moderate reduction in %BF (about &#x02212;1&#x000a0;%) was observed in the aerobic group. Several possible factors could be contributing to this, such as that their exercise training was performed at gymnasiums perhaps with less personal monitoring as compared to ours.</p><p>The reductions in % AF (&#x02212;3.5&#x000a0;% and &#x02212;3.9&#x000a0;% by concurrent and aerobic training) were also significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) when compared to the control group, suggesting that this effect could be beneficial to their metabolic profiles associated with abdominal obesity. Waist circumferences and visceral fat, as measured by abdominal ultrasound, decreased only in the aerobic training and was trending towards a decrease in concurrent training compared to the control group. The location of excess %BF is to be taken into consideration, because have a location more active metabolically and relation to chronic disease than total BF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this sense, as in other studies in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">28</xref>], aerobic training shown to be more effective in treating and preventing chronic diseases associated with obesity, such as cardiovascular disorders and liver fat accumulation.</p><p>According Schranz N et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], concurrent exercise promotes better results in body composition when compared to the resistance training and aerobic training alone. However, most previous studies did not match training volumes of concurrent versus other training modalities. Special efforts were made to our study design to carefully match the volume and the training intensity, which may have led to the similar training effects.</p><p>To our surprise, resistance exercises which were performed as part of the concurrent training in our study did not result in changes in FFM that increased, but not significantly, in all three groups of obese adolescents. In our control group, FFM increased as well as FM with time, which is likely due to normal growth and/or unhealthy weight gain. Both intervention groups gained FFM and lost fat mass. An increase in FFM in aerobic training group has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], likely due to weight bearing exercises help build muscle in addition to normal growth. We also know that resistance training can further promote an increase in FFM, and when combined with aerobic training, the benefits tend to be potentiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We did not find a group difference which could be due to small sample size. Interestingly, Sigal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] also did not detect any differences in total FFM amongst training groups and controls when combined with dietary restriction.</p><p>Compared to the control group, adolescents who underwent intervention with exercise, both had an overall improved lipid profile with decreased concentrations of triacylglycerol and VLDL and an increase in HDL (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Exercise training has been shown to decreased concentration of triacylglycerol plasma and VLDL in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Exercise increases HDL levels in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The contribution by the changes in total fat mass in our study is interesting, as the exercise types did not change the outcomes in HDL independently. This could be due a small sample size. Realizing that obesity is a chronic inflammatory state, we also explored the baseline and post-intervention levels of cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and PAI-1. As expected, there were not group differences neither at baseline nor the changes after intervention (data not shown). It has been shown that these markers have link in adults, and limited data in obese adolescents are available, especially the changes after interventions.</p><p>We also measured fasting serum glucose and insulin as exploratory outcomes. Because none of the adolescents were diabetic, the glucose levels did not differ at baseline between groups, and did not change significantly after 20&#x000a0;weeks (data not shown). It is possible that, because they are going through a transient insulin resistance stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the levels of glucose and insulin can be highly variable, and our study did not have the power to detect any meaningful changes.</p><p>To separate the potential confounding variables such as sexual maturation, gender, and even the presence of some metabolic disorders to the effect of interventions on BF, we have shown (through multiple regression analysis) that the only independent factor capable of producing the observed changes in %BF and VLDL was exercise training. Interestingly, the presence of hepatic steatosis at baseline independently predicted the changes in IAAT, such that adolescents who had steatosis lost more intra-abdominal fat in both exercise groups. This preliminary evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of exercise in adolescents with hepatic steatosis may involve the changes in visceral fat, which has been implicated with worse metabolic conditions such as diabetes.</p><p>Overall, the advantages of our study were: [1] the controlled interventions performed at a designated center with trained staff led to significant fat loss in obese adolescents receiving both exercise training; [2] we matched training volume between aerobic and concurrent sessions; [3] we measured clinical parameters such as lipids, IAAT and steatosis together with our primary outcomes of body composition; [4] we further explored what contributed to the individual changes in %BF from potential confounders; and [5] we used a rigorous statistical analysis of Intent-to-treat.</p><p>However, the limitations were: [1] we had small number of adolescents in each arm, although due to the rigor of this study, such numbers were not uncommon and was statistically valid as designed; [2] we did not have a homogeneous population due to the location of our study; [3] we did not control energy intake during the study, which is well-recognized factor for adiposity development. However, we did not want to confound the potential impacts of exercise training on body composition by intervening dietary intake [4]. The control group was not randomized in the same fashion as the two exercise group due to the consideration of higher dropout rates in the control group, which despite of our efforts, we still incurred a dropout rate of 25-30&#x000a0;%, And [5] we did not directly measure the oxygen maximum consumption(VO<sub>2max</sub>) which would have been good to design individual adaptive exercise levels during the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, both the aerobic and concurrent training reduced total body fat percent in obese Brazilian adolescents as compared to the control group. These trainings also resulted in improvements of their lipid profiles (increased HDL and reduced triglycerides and VLDL). With matched training volume, the effects on %BF and FFM, and other metabolic parameters were similar between the two modes of exercise, suggesting that the benefits of exercise can be achieved by performing either type of training.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The author have proclaimed that no existing competing interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Conception of research idea and Secure funding: PAM, IFFJ; Study Design: PAM, IFFJ, EZC; Implementation (training; Data collection): PAM, BMMA, BTCS; Study coordination and management: PAM, FSL; Data management: PAM, FSL, KYC; Data analysis and drafting paper: PAM, KYC.
