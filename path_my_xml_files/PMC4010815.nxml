Hyperosmolar agents have been used as the medical treatment for this condition. Measurement and estimation of serum osmolality during hyperosmolar agent infusion is of clinical importance to evaluate clinical efficacy, adjust dosage and avoid side effects. However, several studies have shown that calculated serum osmolality may lead to a systematic bias compared with direct measurement. In the present study, mannitol or hypertonic saline (HS) will be used in patients after elective craniotomy. We aim to determine the accuracy of serum osmolality estimation during the application of hyperosmolar agent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, controlled, parallel-group design. Adult patients requiring the use of hyperosmolar agents for the prevention or treatment of postoperative brain oedema are enrolled and assigned randomly to one of the two treatment study groups, labelled as &#x02018;M group&#x02019; and &#x02018;HS group&#x02019;. Patients in the M and HS groups receive intravenous infusion of 125&#x02005;mL of either 20% mannitol or 3.1% sodium chloride solution, respectively. Data will be collected immediately before the infusion of study agents, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360&#x02005;min after the start of infusion of experimental agents, which includes serum osmolality, concentration of serum sodium, potassium, urea and glucose. Serum osmolality will be measured by means of freezing point depression. Estimated serum osmolality will also be calculated by using four formulas published previously. Osmole gap is calculated as the difference between the measured and the estimated values. The primary endpoint is the correlation of measured and estimated serum osmolality during hyperosmolar agent infusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the International Review Board (IRB) of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hyperosmolar agents have been used to ameliorate brain oedema and intracranial hypertension during and after craniotomy, and mannitol and hypertonic saline (HS) are the two most extensively studied and most frequently used in the clinical practice.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref> Although recent meta-analyses suggested that HS might be more effective than mannitol in controlling intracranial hypertension, no significant differences have been found in the neurological outcome and side effects between the two agents.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref></p><p>The primary mechanism of hyperosmolar agents to control brain oedema is based on the increased osmotic gradient across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier during drug infusion, and this helps in the removal of water from brain tissue to the vascular space.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Clinical studies showed that an osmotic gradient between blood and brain of just above 10 mOsmol/kg was effective in reducing ICP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In clinical practice, serum osmolality can be used as a surrogate measure of the effect of hyperosmolar agents, with either mannitol or HS. The initial target of serum osmolality is often set at 300&#x02013;320 mOsmol/kg.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Acute renal failure might develop when serum osmolality exceeds 320&#x02005;mOsmol/kg during mannitol infusion.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, measurement of serum osmolality during hyperosmolar agent infusion is of clinical importance to determine clinical efficacy, adjust dosage and avoid side effects.</p><p>Serum osmolality is often measured in laboratory by cryoscopic technique as the reference method.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, in a clinical setting, routine measurement of serum osmolality is not feasible at bedside, neither in the intensive care unit (ICU) nor in the neurosurgical ward. In this situation, clinicians usually estimate serum osmolality by using formulas derived from serum osmoles that can be measured by bedside blood gas analysis or routine laboratory chemical analysis, such as serum sodium, potassium, urea and glucose.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, several studies have shown that during mannitol infusion, calculated serum osmolality may lead to a systematic bias compared to direct measurement.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> This poor correlation of calculated and measured osmolality during mannitol infusion might be due to the osmole gap, which is the difference between the two values. Up to now, few studies have been carried out to determine the accuracy of estimation of serum osmolality during HS infusion.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In the present study, mannitol or HS will be used in patients after elective craniotomy. Serum osmolality will be measured and calculated during drug infusion. The aim is to determine the accuracy of serum osmolality estimation during the application of hyperosmolar agents. We hypothesise that the correlation of measured and calculated serum osmolality during infusion of HS is better than mannitol.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design overview</title><p>The present study is a prospective, single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, two-arm trial in patients after elective craniotomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting and population</title><p>The study setting is neurosurgical ICU (30 beds), Beijing Tiantan Hospital (1100 beds), Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.</p><p>All patients after elective intracranial surgery admitted to our ICU are screened daily for study eligibility.</p><p>Inclusion criteria are:

Hyperosmolar agents (20% mannitol or 3.1% sodium chloride solution) are routinely used in our clinical practice for the prevention and treatment of postoperative brain oedema in patients after craniotomy. Indications include ICP above 25&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, brain oedema shown by CT, poor neurological status due to brain oedema and bulging of brain during operation. Hyperosmolar agents are initiated in some cases because of clinical decline or elevated ICP, but in many others they are instituted based on CT results or empirically.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation, allocation concealment and blind</title><p>The study has a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, controlled, parallel-group design. Consecutive patients are randomly assigned 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to one of the two treatment groups, labelled as &#x02018;M group&#x02019; and &#x02018;HS group&#x02019;. Randomisation is based on a computer generated random digits table and follows a concealed process using sealed and numbered envelopes that allocate the patient to either of the two arms of the study. Patients may be randomised into this study only once, unless they were discharged from the hospital and were readmitted beyond 180&#x02005;days of the first enrollment.</p><p>Twenty per cent mannitol (1098 mOsmol/kg) and 3.1% sodium chloride solution (1054 mOsmol/kg) are nearly equal in osmolality. This enables us to perform blind during the study. After enrollment of the patient, 125&#x02005;mL 20% mannitol or 3.1% sodium chloride solution will be filled into a sterile 250&#x02005;mL glass bottle by a pharmacist. Patients and all study personnel except the investigative pharmacist are blind to treatment assignment. The details of the series are unknown to any of the investigators and are contained in a set of opaque and sealed envelopes, each bearing on the outside only the number.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data collection and trial intervention</title><p>At study entry, data on demography, body mass index, history of illness, diagnoses of the patients and the reason for use of hyperosmolar agents are collected. The surgical site, operation time, type and amount of hyperosmolar agents used during 24&#x02005;h before the study drug infusion are recorded. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II) is calculated. Venous blood sample (3&#x02005;mL) is obtained and concentrations of serum glucose, triglyceride, cholesterase, albumin, globulins, total serum protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are measured by standard central laboratory device.</p><p>All enrolled patients are randomised 1:1 to receive 125&#x02005;mL of either 20% mannitol (M group) or 3.1% sodium chloride solution (HS group). Both fluids are infused via central venous line in 15&#x02005;min by using an infusion pump. Vital signs, which include heart rate , respiratory rate, non-invasive BP and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) are continuously monitored. Type of fluid intake, cumulative fluid intake, cumulative urine output and cumulative fluid balance are documented immediately before the infusion of study agents (T0), 15&#x02005;min (T1), 30&#x02005;min (T2), 60&#x02005;min (T3), 120&#x02005;min (T4), 240&#x02005;min (T5) and 360&#x02005;min (T6) after the start of infusion of experimental agents. At the same time points, 3&#x02005;mL arterial blood sample and 10&#x02005;mL urine sample are collected. Serum and urine osmolality are measured by means of freezing point depression.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Blood values of sodium, potassium, glucose and lactate are measured using an ICU bedside blood gas analyser.

The differences between the measured and each of the calculated values from different formulas are compared. Other endpoints include changes in the following values during the infusion of experimental agents: serum and urine osmolality, serum and urine sodium concentration, urine specific gravity, and haemodynamic and fluid balance variables. Changes in haemodynamic and fluid balance variables will elucidate the influence of these two agents on status of circulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Current sample size justification</title><p>Primarily, we hypothesise that the peak serum osmole gap during HS infusion would be lower than that during mannitol infusion. Previous investigation showed that by using the formula 2 listed above, the peak serum osmole gap during mannitol infusion was 25&#x02005;mOsmol/kg in patients with brain injury.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It is expected that the serum peak osmole gap would decrease to 15&#x02005;mOsmol/kg during the infusion of 3.1% sodium chloride solution. Using the Power and Sample Size Calculation program, we will need to enrol 15 patients in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the mean peak serum osmole gap of the two experimental groups is equal with a probability (power) of 0.8. The type I error probability with testing this null hypothesis is 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses will be according to the intention-to-treat principle, that is, all randomised patients will be analysed in the groups to which they were originally allocated and will be blinded to treatment assignment.</p><p>Categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages and analysed by the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Continuous variables will be checked for normal distribution and presented as mean and SD or median and IQR as appropriate. Comparison of continuous variables will be performed by using Student t test for normally distributed variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables.</p><p>We will use Bland and Altman's<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> limits of agreement analysis to clarify the accuracy of estimated serum osmolality calculated by each of the four formulas listed above. Bias is defined as the mean of the difference between measured and calculated values (measured minus calculated). Upper and lower limits of agreement are defined as bias&#x000b1;1.96 SD of the mean bias. The relationship between measured and calculated serum osmolality is also determined with linear regression analysis, and to visualise the results, calculated values are plotted against measured values.</p><p>We use repeated measures of analysis of variance for comparing serum osmole gap, serum and urine osmolality, serum and urine sodium concentration, urine specific gravity and haemodynamic and fluid balance variables across different time points (T0&#x02013;T6) between the two groups (M and HS groups).</p><p>All tests of significance will be at the 5% significance level.
