The Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) defines a medication review as &#x0201c;a structured evaluation of patients&#x02019; medicines with the aim of optimizing medicine use and improving health outcomes. This entails detecting drug-related problems and recommending interventions&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various studies and reviews have shown the benefit of medication reviews in enhancing the quality of therapy and in reducing costs [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Through these medication reviews, a reduction in the number of drug-related problems (DRPs) was demonstrated in specific diseases and settings [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Improvements in the reduction of LDL-cholesterol, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and blood pressure could be attained, as well as enhanced medication adherence and quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To date, the selection of patients for a medication review is primarily conducted on assumptions, through certain diagnosis, polymedication or predetermined by third-party payers, such as health insurers [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A study by Isaksen et al. tried to identify risk factors for drug related problems for prioritization of pharmaceutical services [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Medication reviews became the most prominent pharmaceutical patient oriented service in many countries [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several national health care systems are considering their implementation or have already done so [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Patient selection for a medication review is done mainly by the pharmacist (&#x0201c;pull referral&#x0201d;) or by the health insurances (&#x0201c;push referral&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Switzerland and Australia, a medication review is typically initiated by the pharmacist, whenever drug related problems are detected [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The Australian Residential Medication Management Review (RMMR) on the other hand needs to be initiated by a physician for reimbursement [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the United States (US) patients are referred to a medication review mainly through insurance companies [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Medication review programs in the US vary and health expenditure might be an unpretentious criterion for patient selection [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Great Britain patients are eligible for a Medicines Use Review (MUR) if they have been prescribed two or more medicines and are regular users of the pharmacy [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the limited resources in health care, an important consideration is whether there are certain patients who might benefit more from a medication review than others, and to whom such a service should preferentially be offered. Interventions recommended by pharmacists can only reach the patient if they are approved by the decision maker, the physician. A consensus between all health care providers is likely to support therapy [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A study by Doucette et al. examining physicians&#x02019; acceptance of recommendations made by pharmacists through a medication review found a prescriber response rate of 47.4% over all suggestions in a community setting in the US [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Chau et al. obtained an implementation of 46.2% of interprofessional recommendations in a recent study also undertaken in a community setting, this time in the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In nursing-home or hospital settings a higher implementation rate of 75.6% and 90.0% respectively could be reached [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Objective</title><p>The main research question was to provide data to identify eligible patients for a medication review. Therefore, the correlation between patient parameters and the individual performance in a medication review was analyzed. Since acceptance rates may differ with the setting of the national health care system as well as with the primary diagnosis, it was also aimed to generate data on the acceptance of interprofessional collaboration and to assess the acceptance of the pharmaceutical recommendations by the general practitioners (GPs). Furthermore, a closer look at potential influential factors and an in-depth analysis of the accepted interventions might help to recognize and overcome professional barriers. The results of this study could support health care professionals and health insurers to identify patients who are likely to carry a major benefit from a medication review and tailor such a service to achieve optimal outcomes. Findings could exemplify to health care stakeholders how to create an interprofessional, patient-oriented team with minimized medication risks and an improved efficacy of therapy by optimizing medication reviews through prespecified criteria and collaboration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Design</title><p>This analysis was performed as part of a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (WestGem study), which was conducted from 2012 to 2015 under outpatient care conditions in Northwest Germany in order to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive medication review.

Patients with an insufficient ability to speak or read German, participation in other studies or with severe, end-stage diseases (e.g. end-stage cancer or end-stage kidney disease) that would likely lead to death within 12 months, as based on the physician&#x02019;s estimation, were excluded from the study. The number of patients was calculated according to Woertman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Based on a power of 1-&#x003b2; = 80%, a two-sided significance level &#x003b1; = 5%, an effect size of Cohens d = 0.25 and regarding further parameters (ICC = 0.05), recruitment of 240 patients was planned [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Practices were allocated to medication reviews using a stepped wedged design. A cluster randomization was performed on the level of the primary care units. Accordingly, all GPs were initially assigned to the control group. After a 6-month observation period, GPs randomly entered one of three groups, representing the three clusters. Physicians of cluster one switched to the intervention phase in January 2014 with their patients, the remaining physicians of cluster two and three stayed in the control phase. Three months later the physicians of cluster two left the control phase and entered the intervention phase. Cluster three followed with a lag of another three months. The intervention phase with the first medication reviews was implemented between January and September 2014. A biometrician who was not involved in the field work, randomly selected the clinics. To avoid changes in physician&#x02019;s prescription behavior, random lists remained concealed until each allocation date. Patients recruited by the GPs received standard care during the control period. At intervention time, the first comprehensive medication review was performed by the blinded pharmacists based on the medical records and the results of a standardized, comprehensive patient interview. The results of the medication review were provided to the GP in a SOAP-based protocol. The patient interview and the medication review were repeated after 6 months between June 2014 and March 2015. The GP was free to accept or refuse any suggestions and kept unrestricted individual freedom of choice at all times during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention consisted of a collaborative, comprehensive medication management and involved the three professions: physicians, home care specialists and pharmacists. The participating 12 physicians were individual GPs in their own clinic and had no former experience with comprehensive medication reviews. The three home care specialists worked for the county or for an organization that was responsible for the county&#x02019;s obligation to provide independent health care consulting. Six study pharmacists, all specialized in clinical pharmacy and pharmacotherapy, appeared as researchers independent from a pharmacy. Study patients were recruited in the GPs&#x02019; practices. The GPs provided all medical data to the home care specialists who visited the patients at home, performed their assessments and acquired the required data for the pharmacists&#x02019; medication review according to a standardized questionnaire. All medical and drug-related data was anonymized and provided to the blinded pharmacists who conducted a repeated comprehensive medication review (Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe medication review &#x0201c;type 3&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;advanced medication review&#x0201d;), which was supplied to the GPs for decision-making and potential therapeutic changes [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. According to the PCNE definition, an advanced medication review is based on medication history, patient information and clinical information [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It was performed by a minimum of two study pharmacists and consisted of medication reconciliation, a drug-drug interaction check, an assessment on pharmacotherapy and current medical treatment guidelines, considerations of potential adverse drug reactions, medical goals, patient goals and drug safety aspects (as correct drug administration, handling, timing and dosing). Treatment costs were considered. The patient&#x02019;s medical history and current laboratory data were assessed by the pharmacists. Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) in the elderly was identified using the PRISCUS list [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recommendations on therapeutic monitoring and a new medication plan were provided. Suggested interventions were numbered and mentioned again at the end of the SOAP-based review. The medication review was repeated after six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcome: priority setting</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Endpoint</title><p>To search for patient characteristics that might allow for priority setting in medication reviews, the potential to have a major benefit from a medication review must be defined as preexisting criteria with a definite cutoff. The MAI score was calculated for all study patients. There are indeed several studies utilizing the MAI score as an endpoint; however, to our knowledge, no randomized controlled study has defined a major or modest benefit from a medication review. MAI scores vary widely with diagnosis and setting. The level of the baseline MAI score determines a potential reduction through a medication review [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To avoid a mere arbitrary MAI score cutoff number in defining a major benefit, we chose a Cochrane Review by Patterson et al. as a benchmark, which identified 5 studies of medication reviews as being of better quality [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The analysis found a mean reduction in the MAI score of 3.88 points for these studies. As the included studies carry a high relevance, we defined patients of our study with a reduction of &#x02265;3.88 points in the MAI score as having a major benefit from the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Influential factors</title><p>To analyze whether certain patient groups in our study population had a major benefit from the medication review and hence might be prioritized, we tested several patient parameters and searched for suitable indicators. The influence of the parameters on receiving a greater benefit status was analyzed in a univariate logistic regression followed by a multiple logistic regression model with backward selection (LR method). Possible cutoff values for quantitative parameters were computed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The glomerular filtration rate of all patients at baseline was calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation. For patients with a BMI of &#x02265; 30 kg/m&#x000b2;, body weight was corrected and the lean body mass was used [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The study-population for this assessment consisted of all patients, for whom a MAI score at study entry (T0) and at the end of the study (T6) was available and hence differed from the original ITT population (comprising of patients with a MAI score at study entry and at least 2 MAI scores after the intervention was performed). The odds ratio was calculated. In a first approach, explicit baseline characteristics were analyzed that can be obtained early in the medication review process at the time of data collection and the initial patient interview. These parameters were gender, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), number of drugs in use at baseline, number of differences between the prescribed and used drugs, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) severity index, number of diagnoses, number of responsible health care providers (specialists and hospitals) and the number of visits to the general practitioner [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Results here could lead to a fast selection of eligible patients by the pharmacist or health care professional.</p><p>In a second approach, the implicit parameters baseline MAI score and the length of the medication and therapy services (length of the intervention) were tested along with gender, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate and the number of drugs at baseline as prediction factors. Data on the MAI score and the longitudinal service was generated later in the pharmaceutical work up during a medication review.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Outcome: acceptance analysis</title><p>The acceptance of the pharmaceutical recommendations in the medication review was analyzed based on the GPs appraisal on the feedback form, which included a table enabling the GP to respond to every single recommendation made by the pharmacists. GPs could rate their acceptance in 3 categories of approval: partial/complete, no action/refusal or further information requested. We excluded forms without any feedback and requests for further information and accepted that this might reduce the number of considered patients in this assessment. The feedback was subsequently allocated to one of the three domains of stopping an existing drug, starting a new drug or changing an existing drug&#x02019;s dose. To identify influential factors of the prescriber&#x02019;s acceptance of the recommendations, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with the approval rate as the dependent variable was conducted. In a first approach, we performed univariate analyses and then considered all influential factors within one model. We clustered the standard error at practice level to adjust for correlations within physicians. To find out whether certain influential factors might lead to a higher or lower frequency in the physician&#x02019;s acceptance of a suggested intervention, influential factors of patient baselines, morbidity, drug therapy and patient-prescriber relation were considered.</p><p>In detail, the 3 categories of starting a drug, stopping a drug or changing the dose of a drug were correlated versus the patient&#x02019;s age, gender, education level, body mass index (BMI), Morbidity (CIRS-G), number of prescribed drugs, number of drug-related events, number of patient-reported adverse events, number of potentially inadequate medications (PIM), number of patient visits to the GP per quarter (3 months), patient reported health (visual analog scale, VAS), social support (FSozu14), cognitive impairment (MMSE), mobility (Tinetti test), daily functioning (activities of daily living, ADL and iADL), and adherence (Morisky score) in an multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.</p><p>Statistical analysis in this study was performed using Stata<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> statistical software, version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Priority setting</title><p>129 patients of the intention to treat (ITT) population of 142 patients met the criterion with a baseline MAI score at T0 and a MAI score at T6, and were included in the analysis.

On changing the dose of an existing drug, 104 (63.4%) recommendations were implemented and 60 refused (36.6%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0156304.t005">Table 5</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0156304.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156304.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Acceptance analysis of pharmacists&#x02019; recommendations.</title><p>Data is presented as n (%).</p></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0156304.t005g" xlink:href="pone.0156304.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Suggestions for interventions in pharmacotherapy</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Implemented by physicians</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Refused by physicians</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>To stop prescribing an existing drug</bold></td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">133 (53.4)</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121 (47.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>To start prescribing a new drug</bold></td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">129 (51.8)</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120 (48.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>To change the dose of an existing drug</bold></td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">104 (63.4)</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 (36.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">366 (54.9)</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">301 (45.1)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>The chance that a GP accepts recommendations to change a drug&#x02019;s dose was significantly more likely than to start a new drug (p = 0.041). The difference in accepting recommendations on changing a drug`s dose and stopping a drug in contrast was not significant (p = 0.085). The test of patient baseline characteristics that might influence the GPs acceptance of pharmaceutical suggestions showed that in patients with a lower education level, cognitive impairment and good mobility, the GPs were more likely to stop a drug. In female patients, the GPs were more likely to accept a recommendation to start a new drug and in patients with less GP visits they were less likely to stop a drug. GPs implemented more recommendations on changing a dose if the patient had a high BMI, manifold drug-related problems, good social support, good daily functioning or cognitive impairment. They implemented fewer recommendations on changing a dose as patient age increased and in patients with a good self-reported health status (all parameters p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to search for patient baseline parameters that help to identify patients who receive a major benefit from a medication review. The patient population of the WestGem study included multimorbid patients with a focus on cardiovascular diseases aged 65 or older with 5 or more drugs in use (polymedication). The inclusion criteria might already narrow down the eligible patients for a medication review and all results must be seen in this context. The cutoff level of a reduction in the MAI score of 3.88 for a major benefit from a medication review cannot be seen as a definite number and might vary with the setting. The effects of a medication review are dependent on the acceptance of the pharmaceutical suggestions by GPs. The results of the acceptance of the collaborative medication review by the physicians derive from quantitative analyses only; a qualitative approach was not analyzed here. Some of the participating 12 physicians responded poorly on the feedback forms of the suggested interventions. The study was conducted as a regional project in two model regions in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The acceptance and effects of a collaborative medication review need to be studied also in different jurisdictions and settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>Among the parameters that are initially available from the medical record or the laboratory data or that are obtainable by a patient interview, the number of drugs in use and a high discrepancy between drugs prescribed compared to the drugs actually taken at home could be identified as determining factors in having a special benefit from a medication review. Therefore, the number of drugs in use could be a valid and easily accessible criterion in selecting patients for a medication review. In addition, medication reconciliation could be a reasonable first step in a medication review and a high discrepancy could be another decision criterion to initiate longitudinal patient care. To benefit from a medication review patient age, gender, eGFR, CIRS-G severity index, number of diagnoses, number of health care providers and the number of visits to the GP during the last 6 months were not identified as covariates. These parameters should not be considered as useful patient selection criteria for a medication review. The results are quite surprising as morbidity (CIRS-G severity index) and kidney function (eGFR) were regarded as potential risk factors for drug-related problems in a recent qualitative research and thus could be expected to have a correlation to the outcome of a medication review [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The absence of other defined patient baseline parameters shows that all elderly patients with cardiovascular disease using 5 or more drugs are eligible for a medication review. Patients in our analysis experienced a major benefit from the medication review if the quality of therapy was very low at baseline (as indicated by a high baseline MAI score) or if they received longitudinal care with repeated medication reviews. Unfortunately, the calculation of the MAI score is very time consuming, and might be regarded as a medication review in itself and hence is not useful for identifying eligible patients in routine care [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Otherwise, a MAI score of &#x02265;24 could be suggested for the selection of eligible elderly patients with cardiovascular disease and similar inclusion criteria for a medication review. The effect of the medication review on the quality of therapy increased with the duration that the patient care was performed. Physicians tended to implement pharmaceutical implementations over time. Future medication reviews should emphasize the aspects of longitudinal patient care with repeated rather than on confined pharmaceutical activities. These findings are in contrast to a study by Chinthammit et al. which favors shorter and less comprehensive reviews regarding the cost-effectiveness of a medication review [<xref rid="pone.0156304.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>With 54.9% of the suggested interventions on pharmacotherapy being implemented, both, physicians and pharmacists showed a relatively high level of appreciation for the interprofessional and collaborative medication review in an ambulatory setting. As acceptance increases over time, a longitudinal patient service could be more effective with growing confidence between the professions. Reasons not to implement the therapeutic suggestions were mainly due to the patient&#x02019;s personal treatment history, which was unknown to the pharmacist. Further communication thus could increase the acceptance. The creditable results in interprofessional collaboration implicates that professional barriers can be overcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Besides the number of drugs in use and the discrepancies between prescribed and actually taken medications, the results of our study indicate that no early obtainable parameters based on medical records or patient interviews can be identified during the initial steps of a medication review in order to predict whether the patient might particularly benefit from the service. Using the number of drugs in use as a criterion in patient selection for a medication review has proven to be significant and is accessible for all health care professionals. Medication reconciliation could be another first step in identifying patients with special circumstances. Otherwise, all elderly multimorbid patients with polymedication and a cardiovascular disease experience a similar chance of receiving a profound benefit from a medication review, whereas morbidity and kidney function are not helpful in predetermining the outcome.</p><p>Compared to a single medication review, longitudinal patient care with repeated reviews shows both higher interprofessional acceptance and a superior patient benefit and thus should be preferred by patients and health care stakeholders. The high acceptance of medication reviews by physicians supports the implementation of a collaborative approach into health care systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156304.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Statement</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156304.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156304.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Data set on the MAI score.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156304.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156304.s003"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Data set on the GPs&#x02019; acceptance of the intervention.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156304.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156304.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol publication.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156304.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156304.s005"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol German, approved by ethics committee.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156304.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Martina Henrichsmann, Jutta Storck, Elisabeth Pfister and Kara O&#x02019;Keefe for their help during the study and the participating physicians and home care specialists for their contribution.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0156304.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization and International Pharmaceutical Federation 2006 (2006) Developing pharmacy practice-A focus on patient care, Handbook 2006 Edition.
