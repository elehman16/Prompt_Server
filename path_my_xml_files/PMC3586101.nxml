GABAB receptor agonists such as lesogaberan (AZD3355) have been shown to inhibit TLESRs in healthy subjects and patients with GERD, and, therefore, offer a novel therapeutic add-on strategy to acid suppression for the management of GERD. As lesogaberan is being developed as an add-on treatment for the management of patients with GERD who have a partial response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, it is important to rule out any clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between lesogaberan and PPIs.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the effect of esomeprazole on the pharmacokinetics and safety of lesogaberan and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p><bold>Study Design:</bold> This was an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study.

The 95% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of lesogaberan and esomeprazole administered alone and concomitantly were within the recognized boundaries of bioequivalence (0.8&#x02013;1.25). No new safety concerns were raised during this study. The number of patients with adverse events during treatment with lesogaberan alone (n = 17) and concomitantly with esomeprazole (n = 18) were comparable but higher than with esomeprazole alone (n = 10).

The potential for lesogaberan to induce CYP3A4 was measured by the analysis of plasma 4-&#x003b2;-hydroxy-cholesterol (4-&#x003b2;OH-cholesterol) concentrations.

Overall, findings were consistent with no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction when the drugs were coadministered at doses of 150 mg (dosing interval 12 hours) and 40 mg once daily. Furthermore, repeated coadministration was well tolerated with no new safety concerns.</p><p>The choice of a crossover study design, the selection of the chosen range for the 95% CI intervals for bioequivalence, and the methods of pharmacokinetic analysis are standard for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies. It is also standard in drug interaction studies to select high enough doses to ensure that any possible pharmacokinetic interactions are detected. For this reason, the maximal approved dose of esomeprazole (40 mg) was utilized, while the dose of lesogaberan (150 mg; dosing interval 12 hours) was selected because it was in the upper range of the expected therapeutic dose with favorable safety. Although this study could recruit both healthy male and female subjects, the frequency of healthy female subjects meeting the inclusion criterion of being surgically sterilized and aged 18&#x02013;45 years was low; consequently, only male subjects were recruited. Although there have been slight differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of esomeprazole between male and female subjects (greater systemic exposure in females), these differences have been shown to be statistically insignificant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p><p>Comparisons of the 95% CIs of the geometric mean ratios of systemic exposure (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>) for lesogaberan and esomeprazole when administered alone and concomitantly were within the standard limits of bioequivalence. Therefore, comparisons indicate that no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs following repeated coadministration of lesogaberan and esomeprazole in healthy subjects.</p><p>However, the majority of the study volunteers (&#x0003e;96%) were Caucasian and, as such, the generalizability of these results to other populations where variable CYP genetic expression is more important is limited. Although pharmacogenetic data were not collected in this study, CYP2C19 polymorphism has been shown to have minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole in homozygous and heterozygous CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the pharmacokinetic parameters of esomeprazole dosed alone in this study are similar to those previously reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Furthermore, the ratio and 95% CI of 4-&#x003b2;OH-cholesterol concentrations before and after treatment with lesogaberan indicated that lesogaberan does not induce CYP3A4. This finding is congruent with preclinical studies that show that HepaRG cell CYP3A4, 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 messenger RNA levels are not increased following cellular incubation with lesogaberan at concentrations of up to 30 &#x003bc;mol/L.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Furthermore, additional preclinical studies have shown that lesogaberan does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>Although esomeprazole is representative of other PPIs in so far as its metabolism is via CYP3A4 and 2C19, the fractional dependence on these enzymes for the metabolism of other PPIs and the effects of genetic enzyme variability on the metabolism of other PPIs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] imply that caution is required when expanding these results to the potential interaction between lesogaberan and other PPIs.</p><p>No new safety concerns were raised during this study. The most common adverse events in this study (transient paresthesia, pharyngitis, and flatulence) corresponded to those reported in other clinical studies with lesogaberan.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Furthermore, the large number of adverse events occurring during treatment with lesogaberan alone or concomitantly with esomeprazole may, in part, be explained by the reporting of paresthesia as multiple events when it occurred at the same time but in different body parts. Although the orthostatic effects that were observed in this study were not of great medical significance in a population of this age, these effects may have a greater impact in elderly patients who may have hypertension.</p><p>Although this study was performed using standard methods and analyses, there are some limitations. These include a male and Caucasian study population that limits the generalizability of these findings to the wider public, and the lack of pharmacodynamic data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No pharmacokinetic interaction was seen between lesogaberan (150 mg; dosing interval 12 hours) and esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) following repeated coadministration in healthy subjects. Furthermore, repeated coadministration was well tolerated. Therefore, lesogaberan may be used concomitantly in patients receiving esomeprazole, without the risk of pharmacokinetic interaction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge Jan Vouis, MD (Principal Investigator) and the research team of Quintiles AB Phase I Unit (Uppsala, Sweden) for conducting the study and the statistical analyses; PRA International &#x02013; Early Development Services (Assen, the Netherlands) for the analyses of biological samples; and Andrew Stead and Simon Lancaster, from <italic>in</italic>Science Communications, who provided medical writing support funded by AstraZeneca.</p><p>The study was funded by AstraZeneca R&#x00026;D, M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden, the manufacturer of esomeprazole and lesogaberan.
