Repairing massive skin deficiencies remains as a major clinical challenge, due to lack of suitable cutaneous tissue. Mechanical stretch is a stimulus that can initiate both in vivo and in vitro cell proliferation and regeneration (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Mihic et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The clinical application of mechanical stretch, skin expansion, is a reliable reconstructive method for complex wounds. Constant mechanical stretch induced by inflating silicone expander stimulates in vivo skin regeneration (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Handschel et al., 2013</xref>) that creates additional well-vascularized cutaneous tissue that is well-matched to the color, texture and contour of surrounding skin (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Often times in large area of tissue reconstruction, more skin is needed for reconstruction than tissue expansion can provide, because skin does not have the growth capacity to be expanded beyond two to three times its original area. Overexpansion results in thin, poorly vascularized tissue, which leads to skin necrosis and reconstructive failure (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Elshahat, 2011</xref>). Bone marrow stem cell therapies have showed promise in promoting tissue regeneration, as applications have been reported in wound healing, critical limb ischemia, bone growth and cardiac tissue remodelling (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Backly and Cancedda, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We proposed the hypothesis that the transplantation of stem cells could possibly promote mechanical stretch induced skin regeneration and mitigate traditional limitations of skin expansion. Our recent preclinical findings supported this hypothesis (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, combining mechanical stretch and stem cell transplantation for skin regeneration may wider the clinical implications for other types of in vivo tissue regeneration.</p><p>In this phase 1/2 trial, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intradermal injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) in promoting mechanical stretch-induced skin regeneration in adult patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design</title><p>This 2-year study was a parallel, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.</p><p>The study consisted of two phases.

Eligible patients were 18 to 60&#x000a0;years of age, had received surgical placement of an expander on the face, neck, anterior chest wall, abdominal wall or back that had been inflated to volumes of 80 to 600&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients had deterioration in expanded skin texture and thin/papery skin overlying the expander that did not improve after a 2&#x000a0;weeks' suspension of expansion, had elevated pressures in the tissue expander for at least 2&#x000a0;weeks, and needed further skin expansion to complete reconstruction.

MNCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation (COBE 2991 Cell Processor, Gambro BCT, Lakewood, CO). An automated haemocytometer was used to confirm uniform cell counts in each MNC preparation; nucleated cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion. The cell suspension including a total of 2.4&#x02013;12.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>7</sup> cells was adjusted to a final volume of 6&#x02013;20&#x000a0;ml with saline. The flow cytometry analysis showed that MNCs samples contained an average of 2.37% CD34 cells, 0.92% CD90 cells, 3.51% CD105 cells and 0.95% CD133 cells. Approximately 0.1&#x000a0;ml cell suspension was injected intradermally into per cm<sup>2</sup> expanded skin via a 27-gauge needle (approximately 0.5&#x02013;1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;cells/cm<sup>2</sup>). An equal volume of saline was injected in the control group.</p><p>All patients continued with expander inflation immediately after cell transplantation, every three days to a target inner pressure of 100&#x000a0;mmHg. The inner pressure of the tissue expander was measured during each inflation, with the inner pressure meter reported previously (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Sheng et al., 2013</xref>). The inflation stopped while the inner pressure of expander reached 100&#x000a0;mmHg. Inflation continued for at least 8&#x000a0;weeks, until sufficient tissue for reconstruction was obtained, or until skin had reached its maximal regenerative capacity. At that point, the expanded flap was surgically transferred to the recipient site.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Assessment and End Points</title><p>Outcomes were assessed at baseline (immediately before treatment) and 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and two years after treatment.

Our trial is to synergistically combine two methods of regenerative tissue stimuli, stem cells and mechanical stretch, to overcome the limitations of stretch-induced regeneration and create autologous tissue.</p><p>Mechanical stretch via tissue expanders stimulates proliferation and maturation in both embryonic and adult cells (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Mihic et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>). In adult skin, mechanical tension induces fibroblasts proliferation and collagen synthesis (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>) while mechanotransduction can induce epithelial morphogenesis and wound healing (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Skin expanders use mechanical stretch to stimulate cell proliferation and activate fibrin and collagen synthesis to achieve in vivo regeneration of overlaying skin (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Zollner et al., 2013</xref>). However, the regenerative capacity of skin is limited. Mechanism for regenerative exhaustion in skin is still debated and previous attempts to sustain in vivo tissue regeneration using single growth factors have been ineffective (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Recent findings suggest that stem cell deregulation or insufficiency is involved (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Pellettieri and Sanchez, 2007</xref>). Our recent preclinical studies showed that mechanical stretch in skin can recruit circulating bone marrow-derived stem cells migrating and participating in skin regeneration (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Results also proved intradermal transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells to stretched rat skin effectively enhances skin growth (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>MNC is a group of cells including multiple kinds of stem/progenitor cells, including bone marrow mesenchymal cells and epithelial progenitor cells, which have demonstrated a regenerative promoting effect (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Assmus et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Tateishi-Yuyama et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Perin et al., 2012</xref>).

Moreover, the safety of MNC transplantation has been verified in these clinical trials, making MNCs transplantation a reliable option for clinical application. The minimal ex vivo manipulation of MNCs separation makes it feasible for use. In this trial, we discussed the application of MNCs transplantation in stimulating autologous tissue regeneration under mechanical stretch.</p><p>Results from this study indicate that intradermal transplantation of MNCs in humans can promote sustainable regeneration of mechanically stretched skin that had previously shown signs of regenerative exhaustion. The MNC group showed statistically significant improvement versus both controls and baseline for all primary and secondary outcomes. Surface area of expanded skin in the treatment group grew 48% from baseline, which was twice as much as controls. Our evidence showed that intradermal MNC injections reverse the trajectory of skin thinning and deteriorating texture while continuing skin expansion in patients who had reached regenerative exhaustion.</p><p>Though several experimental approaches have explored suitable biomaterials and tissue-engineering technologies for full-thickness skin reconstruction, limited clinical successes have been achieved (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Russell, 2014</xref>). Our attempt to conjunct stem cell with in vivo mechanical stretch has broad implications for safer, larger-scale skin reconstruction. Mechanical stretch during tissue expansion creates a unique microenvironment (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Zollner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) for skin regeneration. With the assist of MNCs, stretched skins are endorsed accelerated angiogenesis (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Sheng et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2008</xref>) and growth factor secretion (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Stappenbeck and Miyoshi, 2009</xref>). Histological results of the present trial showed that there was a durable increase in the number of proliferating cells in the expanded skin after MNC transplantation (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). Further investigations are required to understand the therapeutic mechanism by which MNCs promote cell proliferation and regeneration. Limitations of our study include the small sample size, as larger, multi-center trials are warranted. While the safety of MNC transplantation has been verified in clinical trials (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Assmus et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Assmus et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Perin et al., 2011</xref>), longer-term follow-up in our cohort is needed and underway to assess safety and long-term results. More accessible autologous stem cells are needed; as such, we are currently evaluating the efficacy of more readily harvested stem cells, such as adipose derived stem cells. Defining contraindications for this type of therapy are important for translational purposes. Cancer patients comprise an important subset of patients requiring large-scale reconstruction; the safety of using stem cells in close proximity to a previously cancerous area must be investigated. Finally, the cellular mechanism by which the transplanted MNCs accelerate skin regeneration under stretch must be further explored. Our histological results showed significantly more proliferating cells and angiogenesis in the treatment group, but we could not track transplanted stem cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that intradermally transplanted MNCs in mechanical stretched skin is a safe and feasible clinical application that can overcome the regenerative limitations of skin to provide significant amounts tissue for surgical reconstruction. We believe that synergistically integrating stem cells and mechanical stretch stimuli will engender further advances in in vivo tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s0130"><title>Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest</title><p>We indicate no potential conflicts of interest.
