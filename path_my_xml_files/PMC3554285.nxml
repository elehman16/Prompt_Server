There are many reasons for this, among which increased life span, increased obesity, and increased urbanization with reduced physical activity levels are seen as key components (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Physical activity is a first-line treatment in type 2 diabetes, and the effect of physical activity on glycemic control and body composition is well documented (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Most physical activity interventions have used supervised training regimes. When considering the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, fully supervised training programs are not feasible for primary-care exercise implementation. A need for training methods that can be implemented and sustained in a free-living environment is evident.</p><p>Physical fitness level and physical inactivity are strong predictors for all-cause mortality (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), also in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A training program should therefore increase physical fitness level and physical activity. High-intensity training favors improvements in physical fitness level (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but more intense training programs are associated with decreased training adherence (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and the overall impact of exercise intensity in type 2 diabetic patients is still unclear (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Walking is feasible for most individuals, and walking training programs have been evaluated extensively in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These studies indicate that walking training can be implemented in type 2 diabetic patients, but only minor or no beneficial effects have been shown, potentially indicating that the intensity of normal walking is insufficient. Recently, high-intensity interval training protocols have been evaluated in subjects with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These studies have shown drastic improvements in glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors, and although the high exercise intensity used may limit the feasibility under free-living and nonsupervised conditions, it highlights the potential of interval training modalities in type 2 diabetic patients.</p><p>Interval-walking training (IWT) has been developed as a novel free-living training modality that improves physical fitness and cardiovascular risk factors in older subjects (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). IWT is implemented using a triaxial accelerometer training device (JD Mate; Kissei Comtec, Matsumoto, Japan) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and consists of repeated cycles of slow and fast walking. These cycles are controlled by the JD Mate, which audibly signals to subjects. IWT has been successfully implemented and sustained in large populations, but it has never been tested in a group with disease.</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to test the feasibility of free-living walking training in patients with type 2 diabetes, using a randomized, controlled design. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy of IWT with energy expenditure&#x02013;matched continuous-walking training (CWT) with regards to changes in fitness level, body composition, and glycemic control. We hypothesized that walking training could be successfully implemented and that IWT would be superior to CWT with regards to improvements in physical fitness and glycemic control, despite expected equal improvements in body composition.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) were recruited by advertisements in newspapers and by contacting local diabetes patient organizations. All volunteers underwent medical screening, including a health status interview, physical exam, blood chemistry analysis, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Exclusion criteria included the use of exogenous insulin, weight instability (&#x0003e;2 kg/6 months), physical activity (&#x0003e;150 min/week), and evidence of liver, renal, and cardiopulmonary disease and diseases contraindicating physical activity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>A priori power calculations indicated that <italic>n</italic> = 12 in each training group would be sufficient to detect significant changes in glycemic control. Initially, <italic>n</italic> = 24 subjects were included in the study and randomized to three groups: control (CON; <italic>n</italic> = 8), CWT (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and IWT (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Two subjects dropped out (one CWT subject due to a knee injury and one IWT subject due to new-onset asthmatic symptoms). Subjects in the CON group were offered rerandomization into a training group after the CON period. Five subjects accepted, adding <italic>n</italic> = 3 to the CWT group and <italic>n</italic> = 2 to the IWT group. To meet the planned sample size, an additional five subjects were included and randomized to one of the training groups, adding <italic>n</italic> = 2 to the CWT group and <italic>n</italic> = 3 to the IWT group. The final study population consisted of <italic>n</italic> = 27 subjects undergoing the intervention, of whom <italic>n</italic> = 5 underwent both CON and either CWT or IWT. Therefore, <italic>n</italic> = 32 pre- and posttrials were included for statistical analysis (CON, <italic>n</italic> = 8; CWT, <italic>n</italic> = 12; IWT, <italic>n</italic> = 12).</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the ethical committee of the Capital Region of Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Interventions</title><p>All subjects received a JD Mate, which was worn as a pedometer throughout the study. In addition to this, subjects randomized to a training group used the JD Mate&#x02019;s training function, which, based on triaxial accelerometry, estimates training energy expenditure. Initially, training subjects performed a graded walking VO<sub>2</sub> peak test, from which peak energy-expenditure rate was obtained (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The test was repeated monthly to ensure that relative workload was consistent with changes in aerobic fitness. Subjects in the CWT group had the target energy-expenditure rate set for 55% of the peak energy-expenditure rate and were instructed to perform CWT above the target. Subjects in the IWT group had the target energy-expenditure rate set for 70% of the peak energy-expenditure rate and were instructed to perform IWT consisting of cycles of 3 min of fast walking (above the target) and 3 min of slow walking (below the target) according to a protocol described earlier (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The aim was to match CWT and IWT by overall energy expenditure and mean training intensity. All training subjects were prescribed five training sessions per week, 60 min/session for 4 months, and training effort was monitored by data upload every second week. At these sessions, feedback of the training achievements was provided. Furthermore, all training sessions were performed with a heart rate monitor (Polar RS400, Polar, Kempele, Finland) as an additional measurement of training intensity. Subjects in the CON group were instructed to continue their habitual lifestyle for 4 months and had their JD Mate pedometer data uploaded monthly.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Investigations</title><p>Prior to pre- and postintervention tests, subjects abstained from their antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs for 5 days.</p><p>On day 1, a triaxial accelerometer (Actiheart; CamNtech, Cambridge, U.K.) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) was provided to the subjects for continuous monitoring of basal physical activity over the following 6 days. A Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire was completed to assess habitual activity habits over the previous 4 months (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A diet record was started and continued for the following 3 days. A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system (Guardian Real-Time; Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) was installed by insertion of a glucose sensor (Sof-Sensor; Medtronic) in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue. The CGM system was calibrated three times per day using a point-of-care glucose monitor (Contour Link; Bayer, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland). CGM continued for the following 3 days, and data from 2 full days (days 2 and 3) were used for analyses.</p><p>On day 4, after an overnight fast (&#x02265;8 h), an antecubital venous catheter was placed, and baseline blood samples were collected for determination of plasma glucose, lipids, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and serum insulin. A 3-h, 75-g OGTT was then performed with blood collection every 20 min. Blood was collected into tubes containing the following coagulation inhibitors: sodium fluoride tubes for glucose analyses, lithium-heparin tubes for cholesterol and triglyceride analyses, EDTA tubes for HbA<sub>1c</sub> analyses, and serum tubes (no inhibitors) for insulin analyses. Blood samples for plasma collection were immediately placed on ice and subsequently centrifuged (2,000<italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4&#x000b0;C). Samples for serum collection were left at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged. Samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>On day 6 or 7, subjects came in for measurement of anthropometrical variables (weight and hip and waist circumference). Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI). After 10 min of supine resting, blood pressure was measured. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) was measured by indirect calorimetry during an incremental exhaustive treadmill (Technogym Runrace, Gambettola, Italy) walking test. The test consisted of a 5-min warm-up (individually determined moderate walking pace, 0% incline) followed by 2-min stages of increasing inclines (2% per stage) at individually determined brisk walking pace until the following criteria were met: plateauing of heart rate and VO<sub>2</sub> with incremental workloads, respiratory exchange ratio &#x0003e;1.1, or volitional exhaustion. VO<sub>2</sub>max is reported as the mean of the two highest consecutive measurements (10 s per measurement). Finally, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (Siemens Magnetom, 3 tesla, Erlangen, Germany) of the abdominal region was performed. After a localization scan, a transversal, multislice, T1-weighted scan was executed with 0.5 cm between slices.</p><p>A repeated measure of all tests was conducted 4 months later, after subjects had completed their randomized intervention. Posttraining CGM measurements commenced 48&#x02013;72 h after the final exercise bout, and fasting blood samples and OGTTs were performed 96&#x02013;120 h after the last exercise bout.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Analyses</title><p>Diet records were analyzed using Dankost Slank version 2.0 (Danish Catering Centre, Herlev, Denmark).</p><p>Plasma glucose, cholesterol fractions, and triglycerides were determined by an enzymatic colorimetric assay (P-Modular; Roche, Stockholm, Switzerland), HbA<sub>1c</sub> by high-performance liquid chromatography (Tosoh G7 Analyzer, San Francisco, CA), and serum insulin by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (E-Modular; Roche).</p><p>MRI scans were analyzed using Mango version 2.5 (Research Imaging Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas). The abdominal region was defined as delimited of the diaphragm muscle proximally and a horizontal level of the upper part of the sacral bone distally. After manual exclusion of subcutaneous and large-vessel fat tissue, a semiautomatic segmentation that included the remaining (visceral) fat tissue was performed. Volume was calculated by voxel summation. All analyses were performed by the same blinded observer.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Results are reported as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Baseline differences were compared using Fischer exact test for nonparametric variables (sex and medication) and one-way ANOVA for parametric variables. Since baseline systolic blood pressure differed between CWT and IWT, systolic blood pressure was used as a covariate in ANOVA analyses. Furthermore, other potentially confounding variables (sex, age, time since diagnosis, and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>) were also used as covariates. Of these baseline variables, only HbA<sub>1c</sub> was related to intervention-induced changes in our outcome variables of interest. Two-way (group &#x000d7; time) repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare pre- to postintervention changes within and between groups. One-way (group) ANOVA of &#x00394; (post &#x02212; preintervention) values was used to compare intervention-induced differences between groups. For all ANOVAs, Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to examine the difference between means in the event of a significant finding. Training variables were compared using unpaired, two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test. Regression analyses were performed using changes in relative (mL/min/kg) and absolute (mL/min) VO<sub>2</sub>max and body mass as independent parameters. All analyses were repeated excluding rerandomized subjects, which, although resulting in underpowered comparisons, did not change the pattern of any results. Fischer exact test was performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). All other analyses were performed using Prism version 4 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) or SPSS version 20 (IBM, Armonk, NY).

Our study design included careful and successful matching of the training energy expenditure and mean intensity of the training groups, despite the free-living nature of the intervention. This justifies comparisons between IWT and CWT.</p><p>Despite the free-living nature and the large amount of intended training in the intervention (5 h/week), we experienced high adherence and low dropout rates. Other studies investigating walking training programs in type 2 diabetic patients have, in general, reported lower adherence rates (&#x0223c;60%) to the training (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Morikawa et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) previously described excellent adherence to IWT in a very large population. They speculated that the individualization of training intensity and the regular feedback and instructions given to subjects played a role in the high adherence (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, the use of a device (the JD Mate) has proven important for maintaining adherence to training interventions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>As hypothesized, we found a difference in the physical fitness level changes between the training groups, with an increase in VO<sub>2</sub>max in the IWT group and no increase in the CWT group. Furthermore, subjects in the CWT group did not show any significant improvements in body composition or glycemic control. Type 2 diabetic patients&#x02019; self-paced walking speed is low, and potentially too low to improve health-related outcome (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and previous studies using CWT interventions report only modest improvements in health-related parameters (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, it is likely that walking speed in our CWT group was close to the subjects&#x02019; normal walking speed, possibly explaining the apparent lack of effect.</p><p>Since overall energy expenditure was matched between the training groups, and no evidence of different dietary intake within or between any of the groups was found, we expected that body composition would change equally (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We found that IWT led to a greater reduction in body weight, fat mass, and abdominal visceral adiposity than CWT. Irving et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) described similar findings, with a greater loss of fat mass, including visceral fat mass, after higher-intensity training. Our results indicate that fluctuations in training intensity may have greater influence on body composition than average training intensity. Postexercise O<sub>2</sub> consumption has been shown to correlate exponentially with training intensity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although there are no published studies examining this concept in our study design, we speculate that postexercise O<sub>2</sub> consumption was greater in the IWT group, leading to a greater overall energy expenditure during the intervention and thereby inducing greater weight loss than CWT. Further studies, where food intake is strictly controlled and standardized, are necessary to prove this speculation.</p><p>Over the 4-month period, the glycemic control of CON group subjects deteriorated. This deterioration was prevented in subjects who undertook CWT. Subjects who undertook IWT showed significant improvements in some parameters of glycemic control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The fact that IWT reduced hyperglycemic episodes without leading to hypoglycemic episodes is also a very important finding. Glycemic excursions cause oxidative stress and cardiovascular complications in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and glycemic spikes are related to atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Manders et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) showed that a single low-intensity exercise bout was able to reduce free-living hyperglycemic episodes measured by CGM the 24 h after the exercise, but to our knowledge, no studies have previously described a long-term exercise intervention&#x02019;s ability to reduce free-living hyperglycemia. Recently, however, Mikus et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) showed that 7 days of aerobic exercise with strict dietary control reduces postprandial glucose and glycemic variability in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our results are in line with these previous findings, and extend them to a longer-term training intervention with free-living dietary intake. Whether or not this reduction in hyperglycemic episodes after training improves cardiovascular outcome in subjects with type 2 diabetes is unknown.</p><p>We did not find significant changes in most of the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; glycemic control variables (e.g., fasting glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>), whereas significant changes in CGM were apparent. This divergence may be explained by several points. First, fasting glucose is primarily dependent on endogenous glucose production (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Whether or not endogenous glucose production is altered in response to training is controversial (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), but at least fasting glucose seems unaffected by training (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Second, we experienced large variability in HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes in the IWT group (mean &#x00394; values &#x000b1; SEM, &#x02212;0.09 &#x000b1; 0.17%). If a single subject with rapidly progressing (3 years since diagnosis), severe disease (fasting glucose = 16.3 mmol/L; HbA<sub>1c</sub> = 8.2%), who experienced serious deterioration in classical glycemic control variables after the training intervention (fasting glucose = 18.3 mmol/L; HbA<sub>1c</sub> = 9.8%), was removed from the statistical analysis, significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were encountered in the IWT group (&#x00394;HbA<sub>1c</sub> = &#x02212;0.25 &#x000b1; 0.08%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This may indicate a potential interaction between the stage of disease and the response to exercise training. Indeed, Dela et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) previously showed that type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control had poor responsiveness to exercise training. In support of this, regression analyses of our data indicate that in type 2 diabetic patients, a higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> is associated with a smaller training-induced reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> vs. &#x00394;HbA<sub>1c</sub> in training groups; <italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), evidence that exercise responsiveness may be influenced by the underlying state of glycemic control.</p><p>Even though divergence between changes in OGTT- and CGM-derived parameters has recently been described (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we did expect that changes in 2-h and maximum OGTT glucose would be in line with changes in mean CGM glucose. As a result, we were surprised that these OGTT-derived parameters did not improve in the IWT group, especially when considering the drop in maximum CGM glucose values after the intervention. A possible explanation for this discrepancy would be that dietary intake changed pre to post in the IWT group, which, however, was not the case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Another explanation could be that the time between the last training session and blood sampling was longer than the duration over which improved glycemic control after exercise persisted (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The last training day of the subjects was at least 48 h before beginning the CGM period and at least 96 h before the blood sampling. Although this explanation is speculative, it highlights the importance of regular physical activity upon sustained improvements in glycemic control.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we experienced a difference in body compositional changes between the training groups. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the improved VO<sub>2</sub>max on its own leads to better glycemic control in the IWT group or if this is solely a result of the improved body composition. Regression analyses, where &#x00394; values (poststudy &#x02212; prestudy) of either body mass or relative VO<sub>2</sub>max (mL/kg/min) were used as the independent variable, indicate that changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max and body mass are both correlated with changes in most of the investigated parameters of glycemic control (data not shown). When absolute changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max (L/min) were used as the independent variable, relationships persisted between changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max and changes in mean 48-h CGM glucose (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.47, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and maximum 48-h CGM glucose (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.53, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Although these are not causative relationships, they indicate that improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max per se are related to changes in glycemic control independent of weight loss. In addition to this, the improvement in body composition seen in the IWT group remains an important clinical finding.</p><p>A further limitation of the study is that postintervention parameters were measured at least 48 h after and up to 8 days after the last training bout (day 7). This duration indeed may result in detraining effects. However, this would elicit equal underestimation of the beneficial effects in both training groups. Furthermore, our design enables us to evaluate the training-induced effects on glycemic control, independent of the acute effects of exercise.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that free-living walking training can be implemented in a population with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we have shown that IWT and CWT counteract deteriorations in glycemic control and that IWT is superior to CWT with regards to improvements in physical fitness, body composition, and glycemic control. IWT may therefore be a good option when considering which type of training type 2 diabetic patients should be offered in primary care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
