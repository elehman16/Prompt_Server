Oxalate-based desensitizing agents act by obliterating the dentinal tubules, with a precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals on the surface and inside the dentinal tubules, and also by depolarizing the nerve endings.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This mechanism explains why these agents usually act in the reduction of short- and long-term evaluation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The obliteration is effective in reducing dentin sensitivity, but the obliteration effects are limited, because the surface crystals can be dissolved or removed by daily brushing.</p><p>The restoration of noncarious cervical lesions is indicated when there is presence of intolerable hypersensitivity; depth next to the pulp; weakening of tooth structure, loss of contour that affects hygiene and periodontal health; and esthetics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Composite resins and glass ionomer materials are the most suitable materials for noncarious cervical lesions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, adhesive resin monomers that are in frequent contact with the dentinal fluid may experience a process of hydrolytic degradation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The association of adhesive restorations and oxalate-based agents could minimize contact of adhesives with the dentinal fluid, thereby reducing bonding degradation and improving the clinical success rate of restorations.</p><p>The application of potassium oxalate salts on dentin surface after acid etching shows similar immediate bond strength to dentin when compared to a no pretreatment with desensitizing agents, not interfering in the process of bond strength.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, it was observed a reduction in the bond strength to the teeth that received oxalic acid after aging.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Taking into consideration the lack of studies that assess the clinical performance of restorative procedures associated with oxalate-based desensitizing agents, the aim of this randomized, double-blind clinical trial was to evaluate the clinical success of restorations in non-carious cervical lesions with or without the application of oxalic acid. The null hypothesis tested was that both techniques have similar effectiveness after one year of clinical service.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of patient and teeth</title><p>Twenty volunteers of both sexes (16 female, 4 male), aged between 24-55-years-old, were properly informed regarding the study and, in agreement, signed a term of acceptance. The present research was reviewed and approved by local Research Ethics Committee under the protocol n&#x000b0; 224/08. The criteria for inclusion in this study were: Appropriate oral hygiene, low decay index, absence of periodontal disease, bruxism, and traumatic occlusion, no wear facets, presence of at least two non-carious cervical lesions with a deep equal or greater than 1 mm, independently of their location in the dental arcade to be restored.</p><p>Anamnesis, photographs and radiographic examination were performed initially. The clinical evaluation was performed using a mouth mirror, an explorer and a periodontal probe.</p><p>The degree of hypersensitivity was determined according to the Verbal Rating Scale &#x02014; VRS from 0-3, in which: 0 = no discomfort, 1 = minimum discomfort, 2 = mild discomfort, and 3 = intense discomfort. Each tooth received air blast stimuli with an air syringe for one second at the distance of 1 cm of the tooth surface and the presence of sensitivity was used to enrol in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Restorative procedures</title><p>A total of 90 restorations were performed by one operator, and in 45 of these were done prior treatment with oxalic acid (Bisblok- BISCOInc.

As well as important clinical trials that use similar methodologies,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] this clinical study was a randomized, double-blind aiming for reliable results.</p><p>Many clinical studies that promote restorations in non-carious cervical lesions are conducted with the use of rubber dam;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] others have promoted that the use of cotton rolls does not diminish the performance of Class V restorations.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This study used cotton rolls and gingival barriers by an operator preference and a greater flexibility of clinical procedures.</p><p>All restorations we replaced with microfilled composites aiming a better performance due to the low elastic modulus of these materials in comparison with hybrid composites, but in fact, the literature has not reached a consensus on whether or not low modulus materials can improve the clinical performance of Class V restorations. Clinical trials of 2-3 years of follow-up showed no difference in retention between retention rates of micro filled/hybrids and flow-able composites.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, Bayne <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have demonstrated that the elasticity modulus is an important property in the retention of restorations placed in non-carious cervical lesions. When a more rigid composite material such as a hybrid is used, the shear stress at the adhesive interface could exceed the compressive stress, thus acting primarily on the bond. The introduction of low modulus resin based materials has been promoted as possibly beneficial for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. In addition, it is suggested that the clinical retention of an adhesive restoration depends not only on the retention capacity of the adhesive system used but also on the viscoelastic properties of the restorative material tested. It has been claimed that flexural deformation of a tooth in the cervical region is at least partly absorbed by restorative material. The materials with a low modulus of elasticity when used in cervical restorations tend to bend more like a tooth structure when subjected to a masticatory load and may flex and be retained.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The combination of these factors may have been responsible for the choice of microfilled composite in the present study.</p><p>Studies have shown that simplified total etching adhesives are considered full-permeable membranes that allow flow of liquids that comes both the external environment as dentinal tubules. This permeability is primarily responsible for the hydrolytic degradation of hybrid layer.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Additionally, XP Bond is a one-bottle etch-and-rinse adhesive, composed of a pre-mixed solution of monomers dissolved in t-butanol. Due to an improved ability to diffuse through partially collapsed demineralized dentin, it is claimed to be less technique sensitive.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, <italic>in vitro</italic> results do not reflect the clinical behavior of the material and clinical studies showed controversial results when XP Bond is used as adhesive system in non-carious cervical lesions.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This way, more clinical evaluations with this adhesive system must be encouraged in order to prove its efficiency.</p><p>Aiming to reduce the effects caused by the permeability of the adhesives, some authors have suggested that the occlusion of dentinal tubules to block the flow of fluids responsible for adhesive failures.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Among the substances for this purpose, the potassium oxalate is one of the most indicated, with excellent results in the reduction of hydraulic conductance <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The potassium oxalate reacts with ionized calcium in dentinal fluid, forming crystals of calcium oxalate that obliterate the tubules, reducing the permeability of dentin,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and can be used before applying the adhesive.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, some studies show that <italic>in vitro</italic> results, unhappily, do not reflect the clinical behavior of the material or technical, turning the clinical evaluations as fundamental method to prove the efficiency.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Although there are clinical studies using Bis-block as desensitizing agents,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] we do not find clinical trials of these substances under restorations in non-carious cervical lesions, making this study relevant to complement and confront some laboratorial findings.</p><p>Analyzing marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, postoperative sensitivity, caries and anatomic form we had 100% of success (Alfa or Bravo scores) at one year, in agreement with other same clinical trials,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but in relation of anatomic form, although the results were clinically acceptable, we had an almost significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.058) values bravo to the experimental group, which allows us to suppose that in longer periods of evaluation, this difference may represent significant results.</p><p>In the recall of 6 months, we reevaluated 17 patients resulting in 80 of the 90 teeth examined in the baseline period. We observed a loss of four restorations, with two of the control group and two in the experimental group, that is less than 5% according to the standards of the ADA.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In recall of one year, we had accumulative loss of 8% for the control group and 18% for the experimental group. The high degree of sclerosis, absence of cervical enamel and exceed of compressive stress are factors that can increase the number of adhesive failures in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Although no statistical difference, the greater degree of loss of retention of the restorations that had Bisblock as pretreatment could be explained by the decrease in permeability caused by desensitizing, which in this case, might compromise the dentin bond, since it is a complex region due to the factors mentioned above. According to the study by Silva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that used the method of microtensile in the laboratory showed that after one year there was a reduction in this bond strength to the teeth that received potassium oxalate after acid etching.</p><p>In respect to marginal integrity, the large number of restorations of resin composite exhibiting a decline in rating (Alfa to Bravo) is probably due to no margins beveled and/or to the small fracture of the cavo-surface margin and material due to stress from polymerization shrinkage. Despite the improved bond strength of the materials, increased tooth flexure may still contribute to localized defects in marginal integrity for both materials.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments; however, both were significantly important in reducing dentin hypersensitivity. Based on this, we can report that the use of oxalic acid in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions may represent an additional clinical step. However, further clinical studies should be performed with different degree of tooth sensitivity, as well as longer terms of recalls to a greater understanding of the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of the current study, it may be concluded that the use of oxalic acid as an agent of dentin pre-treatment did not influence the clinical performance of restorations in non-carious cervical lesions after 1 year.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
