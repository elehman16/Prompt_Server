Atherosclerosis is a common pathogenesis, a diffuse process that affects multiple vessels including the carotid and coronary arteries <xref rid="pone.0090268-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The coexistence rate of these two diseases has been reported at multiple imaging modalities, including digital subtraction angiography (DSA), Doppler ultrasonography (US), and multi-detector CT angiography (CTA) <xref rid="pone.0090268-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090268-Steinvil1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Additionally, CTA has evolved into the modality of choice for anatomic evaluation of the coronary arteries with high sensitivity for the detection of significant coronary artery stenosis <xref rid="pone.0090268-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090268-Weustink1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the benefits of CTA must be weighed against the potential risks associated with radiation exposure. In retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated spiral acquisition mode, radiation doses up to 12 mSv have been reported for coronary CTA (cCTA) <xref rid="pone.0090268-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. If a combined coronary, head, and neck CTA examination is undergone with this protocol, an even higher cumulative radiation dose would be expected. An additional limitation of CTA is the necessary administration of iodinated contrast media, which may contribute to renal impairment <xref rid="pone.0090268-Ardekani1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090268-Tublin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. With a multiple-target, multiple-acquisition examination, the total contrast media dose will be increased significantly.</p><p>The second generation of the dual-source 128-slice CT system (Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Forcheim, Germany) provides a wider coverage of 38.4 mm; this, along with faster gantry rotation, have improved temporal resolution to 75 milliseconds, allowing spiral acquisitions to be performed at a pitch as high as 3.4 <xref rid="pone.0090268-Achenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090268-Sommer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral (Flash mode) scan protocol allows a cCTA to be performed within 270 ms while keeping the effective radiation dose below 1 mSv <xref rid="pone.0090268-Leschka1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090268-Neefjes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The high-pitch Flash mode provides gapless data from the dual-source CT system, reducing motion artifacts over the large scan range. We propose that with a high-pitch protocol, it may be feasible to perform a combined carotid and coronary CTA within a single helical acquisition, utilizing a single contrast media bolus.</p><p>The purpose of this randomized study is to evaluate the image quality and radiation dose of a combined heart, neck, and head CTA using a high-pitch scan protocol with a low contrast media dose in comparison with both coronary-only high-pitch cCTA and prospective ECG-trigger cCTA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by Peking Union Medical College Hospital ethics committee.

Detector collimation is 2&#x000d7;64&#x000d7;0.6 mm. A z-axis flying focal spot is applied with an acquisition of 2&#x000d7;128 slices per rotation. Both tubes were operated at 120 kV. Scout-based automatic tube current modulation (CareDose 4D, Siemens healthcare, Forcheim, Germany) was used with the reference tube current&#x02013;time product set at 320 mAs per rotation. The pitch was 3.2 for group 1, and 3.4 for group 2. For all protocols, patients were positioned supine on the CT table with both arms along the chest. Contrast media (Ultravist 370 mgI/ml, Bayer Schering) and saline chaser were administered at 5 mL/s using a dual-head power injector (Empower, ACIST) into an antecubital vein through an 18-gauge catheter.

Segments were evaluated if luminal diameter met or exceeded 1.5 mm, as judged by two independent observers (each with more than 5 years of CT coronary angiographic experience). For any disagreement in data analysis, a consensus reading was performed. Image quality was semi-quantitatively assessed using a four-point grading scale: (1) excellent (no artifacts, unrestricted evaluation), (2) good (minor artifacts, good diagnostic quality), (3) adequate (moderate artifacts, still acceptable and diagnostic), and (4) not assessable (severe artifacts impairing accurate evaluation). Images with a score of 1&#x02013;3 were considered acceptable for diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0090268-Shuman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Subjective image quality was also evaluated by two independent readers (each with more than 5 years of CT head and neck angiographic experience) for carotid arteries using a four-point scale <xref rid="pone.0090268-Beitzke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>: (1) excellent: excellent image quality enabling sufficient differentiation of even small structures; (2) good quality: good image quality providing all details necessary for an adequate diagnosis; (3) poor-diagnostic: patency or occlusion of the vascular segment can be assessed, but image quality is unsatisfactory; (4) non-diagnostic: vascular segments cannot be assessed because of streak artefacts and graininess of the images. And we used the middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches as an indicator for evaluation of intracranial vessels using a four-point grading system as follows <xref rid="pone.0090268-Fujikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>: grade 1, two or more M2 branches demonstrated; grade 2, only one M2 branch demonstrated; grade 3, complete demonstration of M1 but no demonstration of M2; and grade 4, incomplete demonstration of M1. For any disagreement in data analysis, a consensus reading was performed.</p><p>Objective evaluation of image quality of the coronary arteries was measured as image noise, attenuation (measured in Hounsfield Units, HU), and contrast of the coronary lumen, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) <xref rid="pone.0090268-Austen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090268-Shuman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090268-Ferencik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Image noise was defined as the standard deviation of attenuation in a ROI placed immediately cranial to the left coronary ostium in the aortic root. The ROI was chosen to be as large as possible while carefully avoiding inclusion of the aortic wall to prevent partial volume effects. Attenuation within the lumen of the coronary arteries was measured by placing the ROIs centrally in the LM and proximal RCA. ROIs in the proximal coronaries were as large as possible without including the vessel wall. To determine proximal vessel contrast enhancement, the CT attenuation in the connective tissue was measured by placing the ROI immediately next to the vessel contour and subsequently determining the difference in CT attenuation between vessel lumen and the surrounding tissue. SNR was determined by dividing mean attenuation by image noise. CNR was determined by dividing contrast values by image noise <xref rid="pone.0090268-Ferencik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Quantitative evaluation of carotid artery image quality was likewise evaluated. For each Group 1 examination, attenuation was measured for ROIs placed in the bifurcation of the left and right common carotid arteries (CCA), as well as for ROIs in the internal carotid arteries (ICA) at the level of C7. To determine vessel contrast enhancement, the CT attenuation in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (at the same level of the vessel measurements) was measured. Image noise was defined as the standard deviation of attenuation in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. SNR and CNR were measured at the level of the CCA bifurcation. Attenuation values of the internal jugular veins (IJV) at the level of the CCA bifurcations were also measured for the evaluation of contamination. The area of the ROI was kept constant (0.11&#x02013;0.13 cm<sup>2</sup>) during all measurements.</p><p>Measurements of CNR and SNR were performed in a single session. Readers were blinded to the CT protocol used as the images were read in an anonymized fashion.

Our results confirm that high-pitch CTA can properly assess in a single examination coronary, epiaortic, and intracranial vessels and demonstrate high diagnostic IQ, excellent interreader variability. Most importantly, this protocol used a low dose of contrast media while delivering a minimal amount of radiation. This protocol could be of significant clinical benefit to patients at risk of concomitant coronary and carotid atherosclerosis.</p><p>In the study of Bjerrum<xref rid="pone.0090268-Bjerrum1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, more than half of randomly selected apparently healthy middle aged individuals had subclinical atherosclerosis located in the coronary or carotid arteries. Risk stratification of atherosclerosis based on traditional risk factors is limited. The use of noninvasive imaging for direct visualization of atherosclerotic plaques in both coronary and carotid arteries can help to refine risk stratification in certain patients <xref rid="pone.0090268-Johnson2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The comprehensive assessment of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis has also been evaluated using a whole body CTA approach <xref rid="pone.0090268-Napoli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, which can be helpful in the detection of multivessel atherosclerosis causing significant vascular stenosis especially in high risk population such as in familial hypercolesterolemia <xref rid="pone.0090268-Arca1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, the major drawback have always been high radiation and iodine doses for retrospective ECG-gated coronary CTA with a separate CTA acquisition for extracardiac vasculature. Ultrasound is usually used as the screening modality for atherosclerotic disease of the carotids<xref rid="pone.0090268-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, ultrasound could not detect the lesion of intracranial vessels. Thus, low dose techniques of CTA are necessary for evaluation both coronary and carotid arteries.</p><p>The feasibility of the combined cardiac and carotid CTA has been previously investigated in a similar study conducted on patients with suspected stroke <xref rid="pone.0090268-Furtado1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The study demonstrated a good image quality but used a total contrast media dose of 90 mL, significantly higher than our protocol. More importantly, this study employed retrospective-ECG gating for the cardiac acquisition and a CTA of the carotid and intracranial vessels for an average DLP of 1100 mGy&#x02022;cm&#x02014;compared with our result of just 256.3 mGy&#x02022;cm. Prospective electrocardiographically triggered high-pitch spiral technique, which has recently been introduced into clinical practice. In this technique, data acquisition is prospectively triggered by the electrocardiograph and completed within an approximately 270 ms. The radiation dose of combined coronary and extra-coronary high-pitch CTA was comparable to coronary artery-only prospective ECG-triggered sequential scan, corresponding to an radiation exposure of 1.7 times a high-pitch CCTA without head and neck assessment.</p><p>The extremely fast acquisition provides excellent intravascular enhancement at a contrast media dose of 65 mL. In particular the mean vascular attenuation fulfilled the requisites for diagnostic studies as previously reported for the coronary <xref rid="pone.0090268-Johnson3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and carotid <xref rid="pone.0090268-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, the proper vessel opacification was associated with a good diagnostic quality in all the evaluated regions. In the case of coronary arteries, the overall image quality and number of diagnostic segments was comparable between cardiac high-pitch and sequential-prospective acquisition groups. Regarding carotid arteries, all analyzed segments were also classified as diagnostic and in every case an accurate evaluation of carotid stenosis was possible.</p><p>The major limitation in our study is the lack of a direct comparison with a gold standard, such as invasive angiography, for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy in stenosis detection. However, the performance of high-pitch cCTA has been previously established as reliable in CAD detection <xref rid="pone.0090268-Weustink1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090268-Achenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090268-Neefjes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another limitation is strict heart rate control for high-pitch CTA in this study, and further studies will be required for feasibility of high pitch CTA for the combined evaluation of coronary and carotid arteries in patients with high heart rates.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined heart, neck, and head artery examination using a low contrast, prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch CTA resulted in excellent vessel enhancement for high quality images at a low radiation dose.
