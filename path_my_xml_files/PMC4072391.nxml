Although early systems have been described since 1930s, they only made major impact last decade.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Periodontal disease is a known to be possible risk associated with fixed orthodontic appliances.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In a recent study,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the placement of orthodontic brackets influenced the accumulation and composition of the subgingival microflora, giving rise to inflammation.</p><p>Investigating changes in dental plaque during fixed appliance treatment could lead to improved means of preventing or at least reducing the risks associated with such treatment. Brackets ligated with elastomeric modules are thought to be at more risk of decalcification as reported previously by Forsberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] They showed that the incisor which was attached to the archwire with an elastomeric module exhibited a greater number of micro-organisms in the plaque than the incisor ligated with steel ligatures. In a more recent study[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] it was demonstrated that two archwire ligation methods, namely elastomeric modules and steel ligatures, showed no significant difference in plaque accumulation.</p><p>However, teeth ligated with elastomeric modules were more prone to bleeding and so it was suggested that elastomeric modules should perhaps not be used in patients with poor oral hygiene. Although it has been claimed that one of the advantages of the self-ligating brackets is that they collect less dental plaque,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] there is no substantial evidence to support this. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare changes in the amount and distribution of dental plaque associated with elastomeric modules ligation during orthodontic treatment and to relate these changes to shift in subgingival microorganisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The North Somerset and South Bristol Research Ethics Committee in the United Kingdom granted ethics committee approval for the present study. Twenty-four consecutive patients, aged 11 to 14 years [Mean (SD) age = 12.6 (1.01) years], about to begin orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances were included in the study. The age group was chosen to obtain a homogenous sample of patients likely to have similar oral hygiene practice and no potential age-related differences in oral flora.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were patients requiring arch expansion, or distalization of molars, with auxiliary appliances because these additional appliances could interfere with oral hygiene practices. Patients with systemic diseases and patients on antibiotics for less than 3 months before the start of treatment were excluded to prevent disturbance of the oral flora that may influence the results.</p><p>The selected participants and their parents were given information about the study and informed consent was obtained. The patients then had a cross mouth randomization of self-ligating brackets with or without elastomeric ligatures in the upper arch. All patients had self-ligating Damon 2 brackets (Ormco, Orange, CA, USA) placed and then randomly ascribed the upper lateral incisors to have an elastomeric module placed over the wings of one lateral incisor bracket. They all had the same oral hygiene instructions. The use of self-ligating brackets enables the only experimental variable on the lateral incisors to be the presence or absence of elastomeric ligatures.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Assessment of Bleeding on Probing (BOB), Plaque Accumulation and Probing Depth</title><p>Clinical assessment of periodontal health including the presence of bleeding on probing and probing depths were taken of the upper lateral incisors at T0 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>] and T3 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. Probing depths were recorded at three points (mesial, mid-crown, and distal) on the buccal and palatal surfaces of the upper lateral incisors. In this report, the measures from the buccal surfaces are presented. The three buccal measurements from each tooth were added to give a total value.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical photograph of one of the subjects at (a) T0 (prior to treatment) and (b) T3 (three months after treatment). The elastomeric module was randomized to the upper left lateral incisor for this patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOS-3-7-g001"/></fig><p>In addition, plaque accumulation was scored on the upper lateral incisors using the area measurement method as described previously.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This method was advocated by the authors in the form of an abstract, the actual article was not found by either hand search or electronic search. Briefly, the incisors were disclosed with Butler Red-Cote<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> dental disclosing agent (Gum Butler, Chicago, USA) and photographed in a standard manner using Canon EOS 350 digital camera (Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>The outline of the tooth was digitized and then the area of the plaque was measured using a computer with Orthognathic Planning and Analysis software (OPAL&#x02122;, British Orthodontic Society, London, United Kingdom) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The results were then expressed as a percentage rather than as an absolute area of plaque, to take account of different sizes of teeth and of the potential for different magnifications of the photographic images.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>OPAL screen diagrams showing the marked plaque area for one of the patients at start (left) and 3 months in treatment with a bracket in place</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOS-3-7-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Microbiological Profile</title><p>In addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile paper points from the lateral incisors ligated with and without elastomeric modules. These samples were subsequently transported to laboratory for Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Universal primers allow amplification of the gene from all bacteria. The mixed PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) product may be separated using DGGE, creating a &#x0201c;barcode&#x0201d; of DNA fragments derived from, and representing, different bacteria within the sample. This was done at T0 and T3.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Probing depths for incisors ligated with and without elastomeric modules were analyzed using standard parametric tests (ANOVA and <italic>t</italic>-test). Bleeding on probing results were assessed with non-parametric tests appropriate to the data distribution, i.e. non-normal. Furthermore, intraclass correlation was used to investigate the plaque scores in the area measurement method. The level of significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Bleeding on Probing</title><p>The change in BOP for both incisors, with and without elastomeric modules, is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Clinicians should take any known steps toward preventing the potential risks of decalcification and periodontal disease during orthodontic treatment. In the present study, the number of the lateral incisors that were ligated with elastomeric modules and expressed BOP has increased during treatment [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. It can be argued that the expression of BOP with initiation of fixed appliance treatment is expected, but surprisingly, there was a decrease in the number of incisors without elastomeric modules, which showed BOP [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>Although both changes, i.e. incisors with and without elastomeric modules, were not statistically significant, the decrease in BOP in incisors without elastomeric modules needs further investigation. Both methods of ligation also showed no statistically significant changes in probing depth over this period [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. During fixed appliance treatment, the distribution of plaque can be altered hence the carious lesion development may be changed. In Zachrisson[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] longitudinal study, orthodontic treatment did not increase the prevalence of dental caries. However, the distribution of the carious lesions was significantly altered. In general, orthodontic treatment resulted in a shift in carious lesions from posterior to anterior teeth and from interproximal to facial and lingual aspects.</p><p>In this study, although there was a very significant increase in plaque score for upper lateral incisors in the first 3 months [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], the difference in the mean changes of plaque area of incisors ligated with or without elastomeric modules was also not statistically significant. Therefore, this confirmed the previous finding that there is no difference in plaque accumulation associated with either self-ligating brackets or those with elastomeric modules.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, Forsberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] had shown that the incisors attached with elastomeric modules exhibited a greater number of microorganisms in the plaque after 3 months than incisors ligated with stainless steel ligatures.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mean and 95% confidence interval for plaque accumulation of lateral incisors with an elastomeric module at T0 and T3</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOS-3-7-g006"/></table-wrap><p>This finding would appear to disagree with the current findings, but it raises the question as to whether more microorganisms on the ligatures equates to more plaque on the actual tooth surface or actual damage to that surface or to the adjacent periodontium. In Forsberg's study,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] although the findings are relevant to this investigation, no clinical measurements were recorded; hence no direct clinical comparisons can be made with that particular study.</p><p>Turkkahraman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found that elastomeric modules and steel ligatures showed no significant difference in terms of bonded bracket plaque index, gingival index, and pocket depths, but teeth ligated with elastomeric modules were indeed more prone to bleeding on probing. They hence suggested that elastomeric modules should probably be avoided in patients with poor oral hygiene. The Microbiological results in this study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] indicated some changes in the microflora of the lateral incisors ligated with elastomeric modules and those without. The DGGE method considers the presence of unidentified and difficult to cultivate bacterial species present in subgingival plaque. Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that DGGE analysis has the potential to examine bacterial shift in periodontal disease. It therefore can be concluded that microbial shift has taken place 3 months into treatment; this shift is similar to both sites.</p><p>In support of this current study, an investigation[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] aimed to investigate the effect of bracket type (conventional and self-ligationg) on the levels of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and total bacterial counts in whole saliva of orthodontic patients. It was found that the levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> levels did not differ significantly between the conventional and self-ligating brackets 2-3 months into treatment.</p><p>Therefore, the plaque difference for incisors ligated with and without elastomeric modules was not significant. There are no directly comparable studies in the literature. With the increasing use of self-ligating brackets, comparisons between elastomeric ligation and self-ligation will become of correspondingly increased importance. Meanwhile, there is no evidence from this study that in a short term elastomerics cause more damage to periodontal health than self-ligation.</p><p>In a recent systematic review,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] several aspects were tested between conventional and self-ligating brackets. In terms of plaque retention and periodontal health, it was concluded that only two trials were found. In these two studies, there is no evidence to support the use of self-ligating over conventional brackets or vice versa.</p><p>In support of the current study, an <italic>in vivo</italic> study[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] investigated the influence of the bracket design on microbial and periodontal parameters. It was found that there is no significant difference between self-ligating (Speed), conventional (GAC), and control teeth in terms of bleeding on probing. However, they demonstrated significant higher gingival crevicular flow in the bracket group than in the control group at day 7. Furthermore, interestingly they showed more gingival hypertrophy with the self-ligating than with the conventional brackets.</p><p>In theory, reducing dental plaque during treatment may be of particular benefit especially in some medical conditions where maintaining a good standard of oral hygiene is considered to be essential during treatment.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, interpreting the findings of the study must be done cautiously considering its preliminary and short observation period. Future studies can address these shortcomings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Elastomeric modules were not found to be associated with a greater risk of gingival inflammation when compared to self-ligating brackets 3 months into fixed orthodontic treatment. Further, the microbiological results showed a microbial shift 3 months into treatment, but with no difference in both sites. The longer term results will be of great interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
