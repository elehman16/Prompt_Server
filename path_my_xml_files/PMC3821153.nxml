Background</title><p>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential
tissue damage. Undergoing treatment (such as surgical procedures) may result in the
occurrence of postoperative pain, and this triggers biochemical and physiological stress
responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R1">1</xref>). Pain is a major public health
issue throughout the world and represents a major clinical, social, and economic problem
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R2">2</xref>). Postsurgical pain is normally perceived as
nociceptive pain. Surgical trauma has been known to induce central and peripheral
sensitization and hyperalgesia, which in untreated cases could lead to chronic postoperative
pain after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R3">3</xref>). Proper pain management,
particularly postoperative pain management, is a major concern for clinicians as well as for
patients undergoing surgery. Patients commonly enquire about the level of pain they may
experience after an operation. Postoperative pain not only affects the patients&#x02019;
operative outcome, well-being, and satisfaction from medical care, but also directly affects
the development of tachycardia, hyperventilation, decreases in alveolar ventilation,
transition to chronic pain, poor wound healing, and insomnia, which in turn may impact the
operative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R4">5</xref>). Individual variations in the response to pain are influenced by
the genetic makeup, cultural background, age, and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R6">6</xref>). The practice of modern anesthesiology has been developed from
intraoperative period into perioperative period. Postoperative pain management is one of the
most important components of adequate postsurgical patient&#x02019;s care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R7">7</xref>). Pain during and after surgery can lead to
sensitization and consequently oversensitivity to pain, it can also transform postoperative
acute pain into chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R8">8</xref>). Effective
postoperative pain control is important, especially with the initiation of physiotherapy and
early ambulation, which hastens recovery and reduces hospital length of stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R9">9</xref>). The use of opioid drugs for the pain control
during and after surgery is a common procedure in anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R10">10</xref>). However, the use of these medications is associated with side
effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, and respiratory depression. Prescribed method
for reducing and minimizing opioid side effects is concomitant administration of a nonopioid
analgesic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R11">11</xref>). The decision to mix drugs should
not be made without the knowledge of their compatibility. Incompatibility problems are more
likely to arise when small concentrated volumes are mixed in a syringe rather than in the
large volume of infusion bag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R12">12</xref>). Some of these
medications are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin and Acetaminophen
(Paracetamol). Primary mechanism of these analgesic drugs is to inhibit the cyclooxygenase
and prostaglandin synthesis which is considered as an important environmental factor in the
prevention of hypersensitivity and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R10">10</xref>). To
date, at least two types of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified: Cyclooxygenase1
(COX-1) which is involved in platelet aggregation, hemostasis, and protects the gastric
mucosa, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) which is effective in pain, inflammation, and fever.
Recently discovered COX 3 (COX-3) has been proposed as a central mechanism for the analgesic
effect of acetaminophen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R13">13</xref>). Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs are usually effective for mild to moderate pain control. The
effectiveness of these drugs has been identified as opioids adjuvant for moderate to severe
pain. Recent studies have known that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for
pain control rather alone or combined with opioids, which are more than what has been
assumed so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R15">15</xref>). While Paracetamol has been used for pain control after surgery
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R16">16</xref>), the use of this drug after induction of
anesthesia for the postoperative pain control is the original point of this research that
determined:</p><p>&#x000ab; Whether this drug is effective on opioid consumption in the pain control after
surgery &#x000bb;</p></sec><sec id="sec11510"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the treatment of choice for most patients with
symptomatic cholelithiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R17">17</xref>). We evaluated
the effect of intravenous Paracetamol on postoperative pain and opioid consumption in
patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec11511"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>In this double-blinded, prospective, randomized placebo- controlled trial, after approving
by Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (AJUMS) Ethical Committee, 30 patients
of ASA class I, aged between 18 and 50 years, and scheduled for elective laparoscopic
cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were recruited, and randomly divided into two equal
groups in the specified time period. Simple random sampling was performed. Exclusion
criteria contained the presence of: 1 - operation for less than an hour or greater than
three hours 2- intraoperative bleeding greater than 6 cc / kg of body weight 3 - liver or
kidney disease, 4 - patients with opioid or alcohol addiction 5 &#x02013; patients'
reluctance to participate in the study. The severity of pain was documented based on the
VAS. The VAS is a standard tool like a 10 cm ruler including 10 numbers beginning from 0 (no
pain), and ending at 10 (the most severe pain). The patient was asked to select a number
based on the severity of pain he or she feels. Intravenous Paracetamol (Proparacetamol) was
formulated for using during the anesthesia or immediately after it. However, other
formulations have no high capability. Proparacetamol is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma
esterases to form paracetamol, as if a 1000 mg of Proparacetamol can produce 500 mg
Paracetamol. Parastylaminofenol is the precise chemical formulation of Paracetamol. Through
intravenous administration, the onset of effect is about half an hour, approximately
one-hour half-life, and 6-8 hours effectiveness. The maximum recommended dose for adults is
4 grams in twenty-four hours. In this study, Paracetamol was provided by the COBEL DAROU
pharmaceutical company. Patients were divided into two groups of A and B; and they did not
receive any premedication drug before entering the operating room. After the placement of
routine monitoring in all patients, including Electrocardiomyography and Pulseoximetry,
noninvasive sphygmomanometer, and capnography, they received 5 cc / kg Ringer serum. Both
groups were anesthetized with midazolam 0.03 mg/kg , Propofol 2mg/kg , Remifentanil 1
&#x003bc;g / kg over a minute, and Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, and intubated at minimum possible
time, and connected to a ventilator with % 50 O2, % 50 N2O after ensuring that the tube is
in the trachea. Respiratory parameters were adjusted during the operation; so that oxygen
saturation, end-expiratory carbon dioxide, and end expiratory volume were 96 -100%, 35-45
mmHg, and 10 ml per kg of body weight, respectively. Both cases and controls were the same
as above. During the operation, patients received 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min Remifentanil
intravenous infusion and Isoflurane 1 MAC. In the treatment group, intravenous Paracetamol
was injected 10 minutes after the induction of anesthesia with a bolus over 15 minutes (1gr
Paracetamol in 100ml of 0.9 % NaCl). Intravenous infusion of Remifentanil (0.05 &#x003bc;g /
kg / min or less) was added based on changes in blood pressure and heart rate more than 10%
of base. In the control group, 100 cc 0.9 % NaCl was injected with a bolus over 15 minutes
as placebo. During the operation, a dose of Intravenous Atracurium 0.2 mg/kg was repeated in
both groups for every 30 minutes. Higher maintenance doses of Isoflurane were administered
for increasing the depth of anesthesia, which were continuously controlled with the BIS
(Bispectral index). Remifentanil was reduced (to half - dose) in both groups, on the
extubation time for analgesia. All the operations were performed by the same surgeon.
Laparoscopy was initiated after 15 minutes of anesthesia induction, and gas pressure was
13-15 mmHg all over the operation. At the end of the operation the neuromuscular blocking
action was reversed by using atropine 0.02 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine. At the end, the
patients were extubated and transferred to the post anesthetic care unit. In the recovery
room, oxygen 5 Lit / min with simple mask was administered, and patients were monitored by
pulse oxymetry. The patients were maintained in recovery at least an hour. Postoperative
pain was determined by the VAS for up to six-hour intervals: during extubation, 15 minutes,
30 minutes, one hour, two hours, three hours, four hours, five hours, and six hours after
the extubation, and if the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was more than 3, 0.1mg/kg morphine was
administered intravenously. Total intravenous morphine consumption after the operation, the
VAS and the side effects such as nausea, vomiting, laryngospasm and sedation were recorded
at the time. Persons responsible for medication and follow-up in patients during and after
the operations were unaware of the type of primary drug administered to the patient. All
data were analyzed using the SPSS for Windows (version 12.0). The results of this study were
collected and analyzed by independent sample t- test and Chi-square test. The significance
level was set to P &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec11512"><title>4. Results</title><p>Demographic data in the study including mean age, weight, and duration of operation in the

Discussion</title><p>In a study conducted in 2010 by Memis and colleagues, they reviewed the effect of
intravenous Paracetamol in reducing opioid consumption, time of extubation, and opioid side
effects in intubated patients admitted to the ICU. Ultimately, they concluded that
intravenous Paracetamol reduces opioid consumption, the extubation time, and opioid side
effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and itching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R18">18</xref>). In this study, the same as our study, Paracetamol used for postoperative pain
control had significant difference in the pain control between the groups, but unlike our
study was also effective in reducing opioid consumption. In a study by Brodner and
colleagues on patients undergoing mild to moderate surgery with general anesthesia, it was
concluded that Paracetamol and other nonopioid analgesics have a similar effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R19">19</xref>). Postoperative pain was reduced with
non-narcotic medication in comparison to placebo with no effect on pain control.
Furthermore, in our study, the effect of Paracetamol was significant in the pain control. In
a study conducted in 2009 by Samson and colleagues, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
intravenous Paracetamol were studied in the ICU patients, and found that after
administration of 1 gr intravenous paracetamol four times a day, the optimal therapeutic
dose is not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R20">20</xref>). In our study, the
use of Paracetamol significantly reduced pain, but it had no effect on the opioid
consumption. In another study in 2008 that was performed by Cakan and colleagues,
intravenous Paracetamol improved the quality of postoperative analgesia but did not decrease
the consumption of opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R21">21</xref>). In our study,
pain also was significantly lower than the control group with administration of 1 gr
paracetamol, but there was no significant reduction on the opioid consumption. In a study
conducted in 2007 by Borisov DB and colleagues using 1 g Paracetamol before abdominal
surgery with epidural anesthesia, , did not reduce the pain and consumption of analgesics
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R22">22</xref>). In our study, also similar results were
obtained. According to the results, we found that the intravenous administration of 1 gr
Paracetamol immediately after the induction of anesthesia had no effects on opioid
consumption between the two groups after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In fact,
administration of intravenous Paracetamol 1 gr immediately after the induction of anesthesia
did not cause a decrease in the amount of opioid (morphine) consumption for the pain control
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (P = 0. 24). Because some studies have indicated the
effects of anesthesia and surgery on Paracetamol pharmacokinetic and the time of peak plasma
concentration, and these changes are different in patients who are undergoing surgery and
anesthesia and in patients who are not undergoing surgery and anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9880R23">23</xref>), noneffective intravenous 1 gr Paracetamol in
postoperative opioid consumption reduction is justified to relieve pain. Generally, it can
be seen that the administration of intravenous 1 gr Paracetamol after the induction of
anesthesia, can be used as a complementary therapy for the pain control up to five hours
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but opioid (morphine) consumption for the postoperative
pain control is not resolved. Another study recommended a higher dose of Paracetamol for the
pain control and reduction of the side effects of opioids after laparoscopic cholecystectomy
.Moreover, the use of opioid medications along with 1 gr of intravenous Paracetamol is
recommended for better pain control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research is a result of a residential thesis (Ref No: U-90292). Hereby, we acknowledge
