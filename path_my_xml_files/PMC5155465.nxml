Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, has been used in clinical medicine for more than 45 years and currently is the drug of choice for all anaerobic infections.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Metronidazole administered either orally or topically according to multiple dose regimen has long been established as a standard treatment of BV, with 77.9% cure rate.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, necessity to administer the drug for longer duration potentially reduces compliance, thus increasing the risk of incomplete cure and recurrence of BV.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Tinidazole is a relatively newer nitroimidazole derivative with greater antimicrobial activity than metronidazole which was used for the treatment of <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> infection.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Favorable pharmacokinetic profile and lesser side effects seen with this drug have evolved it as an alternative to metronidazole for BV.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Available data suggest that tinidazole is more beneficial in refractory or relapsing BV cases.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Tinidazole has been tried in 2 g single dose with outcome comparable with metronidazole but not well tolerated due to high dose. The standard dosage regimen for metronidazole is 500 mg twice daily for 7 days for BV. Considering that tinidazole has the potential of being more efficacious drug for BV based on its larger half-life and superior side effect profile as compared to oral metronidazole, we intended to compare the efficacy and tolerability of metronidazole 500 mg twice daily dose with 500 mg single dose of tinidazole for 5 days, as there is no comparison between these two regimens.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a randomized double-blind study, conducted by the Departments of Pharmacology and Gynecology of a tertiary care teaching hospital from April 2013 to May 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (SVMCH/IEC/STS2012/27) and registered in clinical trial registry of India (CTRI/2014/04/004557).</p><p>After obtaining written informed consent, women with abnormal vaginal discharge and diagnosed with BV were recruited into the study. We excluded women with history of active bleeding, genital malignancies, intake of antimicrobials within 14 days, alcohol intake, and smoking. Before recruitment, pregnant and lactating women were excluded. The recruited women were subjected to detailed history taking, pelvic and vaginal examinations by a gynecologist. The patients were explained about the study and procedures involved. A case record form was maintained to collect the demographic data and to assess the clinical progress of the patients. The patients were requested to give their details regarding education, occupation of the family head, and family income per month and were scored according to modified Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic status scale which had maximum score of 29.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Based on the scores, they were divided as upper (26&#x02013;29), upper middle (16&#x02013;25), lower middle (11&#x02013;15), upper lower (5&#x02013;10), and lower (&#x0003c;5). Under Under strict aseptic precaution with cuscus speculum, a high vaginal swab was taken using a sterile swab (sterile swab obtained from the Department of Microbiology).</p><p>The diagnosis of BV was made using Amsel's criteria which included 4 factors: (a) Homogenous milky or creamy white vaginal discharge, (b) pH of vaginal secretion above 4.5, (c) fishy odor with or without addition of 10% KOH solution, and (d) presence of clue cells on microscopic examination.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Vaginal pH</title><p>Vaginal secretions or discharge was collected from the lateral vaginal wall with a cotton swab, and they were then transferred onto strips of pH paper (Qualigens fine chemicals, India).

Patients received either tablet metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 5 days or tablet tinidazole 500 mg once daily + one placebo for 5 days. Both test drugs were powdered and filled into empty capsules, which were sealed in separate packets and assigned specific code number. These packets were dispensed to the patients by a nurse who was unaware of the study protocol. The principal investigator and patients were blinded in the study. Decoding of the numbers was done after the study was completed. Placebo tablets were acquired from Goodman Pharmaceuticals, Puducherry, and test drugs were purchased from similar brand to ensure the uniformity (tinidazole 500 mg from Healthy Life Pharma Pvt., Ltd., metronidazole 500 mg, JB chemical and pharmaceutical limited, Mumbai, India).</p><p>Patients were instructed about the personal hygiene and abstinence from sexual intercourse during the study period. They were also advised not to take any other medications during this period. Patients were instructed to come for follow-up at the 1<sup>st</sup> week and 4<sup>th</sup> week. Detailed vaginal examination was done to look for any vaginal discharge. The patients were examined by the gynecologist and their diagnosis was noted down. Vaginal pH, Whiff test, and Gram stain were done during the follow-up visits.</p><p>Patients were categorized as follows:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cured - If there was no factor positive in Amsel's criteria</p></list-item><list-item><p>Partially cured - If any two of the factors in Amsel's criteria present</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not cured - If 3 or more factors present.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></list-item></list>

Unfortunately, it is associated with only 50%&#x02013;80% cure rates and high recurrence. Tinidazole, which is similar to metronidazole but with a longer half-life and more favorable side effect profile, has been used in BV in the dose of 2 g single dose with better cure rates. In this study, we have used tinidazole in low dose 5 days regimen and compared it with usual regimen of metronidazole. We screened 286 patients for BV, of which 120 were recruited. We observed that most of the patients were from lower socioeconomic class as our tertiary care hospital is situated in rural area. The first follow-up (after 1 week) was to assess the immediate cure and the second (after 4 weeks) to find out the relapse of the disease. The cure rate between metronidazole (91.2%) and tinidazole (96.5%) at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> week was not statistically significant. At 4<sup>th</sup> week, the overall cure rate with metronidazole (75%) was significantly less compared to tinidazole (94.54%). This finding was comparable with some studies which showed cure rate of 95%&#x02013;97% with tinidazole,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and with few other studies, the findings were contrast as they did not find any difference in the cure rates between metronidazole and tinidazole.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This difference could be due to varied hygienic practices followed by the patients. In our study, most of the patients were from upper lower or lower socioeconomic class. Although instruction was given to maintain personal hygiene, there could be deviation particularly for long-term follow-up (4 weeks).</p><p>We observed a lower recurrence rate with tinidazole compared to metronidazole which is comparable with other studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This could be due to tinidazole's wider spectrum of activity and better pharmacokinetic profile. Tinidazole has greater and longer antimicrobial activity compared to metronidazole, which is important in preventing recurrence of BV. The BV is associated with reduction in number of vaginal lactobacilli leading to increase in vaginal pH. After treatment, there was reduction in vaginal pH in both groups but to a greater extent with tinidazole. The vaginal pH being the key factor for increased incidence of BV in reproductive age group is better reduced with tinidazole. Many adjuvant drugs such as ascorbic acid lactobacillus strain and probiotics have been tried to decrease vaginal pH, thereby decreasing the recurrence of BV.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Among the study population, most of the patients had adverse drug reactions, of which majority belonged to metronidazole group and few in tinidazole group. The adverse effects were tolerable in both groups. Tinidazole is known for its better side effect profile compared to metronidazole. Many studies have shown similar finding with very few having contradictory findings where they have reported no difference between the drugs in cure rates and tolerability.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Despite considerable research effort and recent advances, BV remains an enigmatic condition. Molecular tools have revealed the complex microbiology of BV but again have not found a credible single causal pathogen.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Until the pathogenesis of anaerobic vaginosis is completely understood, treatment will remain unsatisfactory. The clinicians use various regimens for treating BV; we have compared the two most commonly used regimens in our setup as the clarity regarding these regimens did not exist. Our study had certain constrains such as inability to do antibiotic culture sensitivity to identify the different species of organisms involved in the pathogenesis of BV in our patients. The number of lactobacilli per colony forming unit and strains was not counted. We did not find the association of BV with hormonal contraceptive use and its association with HIV and other sexually transmitted disease. Nonetheless, this randomized trial showed superiority of tinidazole in efficacy and tolerability with compared to metronidazole.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tinidazole 500 mg once daily orally offers a better efficacy than metronidazole 500 mg twice daily dose in long-term cure rates and in preventing relapses with better side effect profile.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Placebo drug was obtained from Goodman Pharmaceutical Company, Puducherry.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Rajeshwari, Assistant Professor from the Department of Microbiology for her help in diagnosis of the cases based on Amsel's criteria.
