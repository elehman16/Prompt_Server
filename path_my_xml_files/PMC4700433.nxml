This is the first study to describe long-term changes in body weight in smokers invited to quit or reduce smoking by switching to ECs. Conventional cigarettes consumption and body weight were measured prospectively in a randomized controlled trial of smokers invited to switch to ECs. Post cessation weight changes from baseline at week-12, -24 and -52 were compared among 1) high, medium and zero nicotine strength products and 2) pooled continuous smoking failure, smoking reduction and abstinence phenotypes. Saliva cotinine levels and appetite levels were also measured. No significant changes in body weight were observed among high, medium and zero nicotine strength products. Differences among continuous smoking phenotypes were significant only at week-12 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010) and week-24 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012) with quitters gaining 2.4{plus minus}4.3&#x02009;Kg and 2.9{plus minus}4.4&#x02009;Kg respectively. However, weight gain at week-52 (1.5{plus minus}5.0&#x02009;Kg) was no longer significant compared to Failures and Reducers. No confounding factors could explain the significant changes in body weight. Smokers who quit smoking by switching to ECs may limit their post-cessation weight gain, with substantial reversal in weight gain being manifest at late time points.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of avoidable premature mortality in the world and quitting is known to reduce risk of fatal diseases such as lung cancer, acute coronary artery disease, strokes, end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) advises that one of the key actions to reduce health burden associated with combustible tobacco use is to encourage abstinence among smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Current (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy-NRT, bupropion and varenicline) and emerging smoking cessation drugs are known to increase the likelihood of quitting smoking, particularly if combined with counseling programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>However, while stop smoking results in considerable health improvements, it is often accompanied by weight gain. The link between smoking and body weight is well established. Cross sectional studies show that, on average, smokers weigh less than non-smokers, and former smokers weigh more than both smokers and non-smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. A large prospective study has shown that adolescents who initiate smoking gain less weight than their non-smoking peers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Cohort studies also show that people who stop smoking gain weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Nicotine (in tobacco cigarettes) is known to suppress appetite and to increase resting metabolic rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, weight gain in those who quit smoking is probably due to the combination of a decline in resting energy expenditure at a time when appetite is increased.Of note, weight increase after quitting is one of the most important causes for relapse into tobacco smoking, in particular for wome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></p><p>Several strategies have been tested for weight-concerned smokers wanting to stop smoking. A Cochrane review that examined the effectiveness of first line antismoking medications (i.e. NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) on limiting post cessation weight gain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> showed only modest results, with NRT, bupropion, and varenicline reducing weight gain only by 0.5&#x02009;kg, 1.1&#x02009;kg, and 0.4&#x02009;kg, respectively. Moreover, this advantage was soon lost after treatment discontinuation.Although regular diet and physical activity might be effective to prevent post cessation weight gain, recent metaanalyses have shown that dietary strategies or exercise programs have been inconsistent at controlling post cessation weight gain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.Consequently, the need for novel and more efficient approaches is unquestionable.</p><p>The nicotinic and non-nicotinic effects of electronic cigarettes (ECs) might be exploited for weight-concerned smokers wanting to stop smoking. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporise nicotine without burning tobacco. These consumer products share many similarities with smoking in the behavioural aspect of their use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Users are predominantly smokers, who report using them long-term as an alternative for conventional cigarettes, to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking, to relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to continue having a &#x02018;smoking&#x02019; experience<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, but with much reduced health risks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Data from a recent prospective randomized controlled trial have shown that ECs can aid smoking cessation and reduction with long-term quit rates of up to 8.7% in smokers not intending to quit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis including 1,242 smokers with complete data on smoking cessation after switching to ECs for a minimum period of six months reported a 18% quit rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, post cessation weight gain after switching to ECs use has never been investigated. Herein we have used body weight measured at baseline and at 12-, 24- and 52-week study visits from the ECLAT (EffiCiency and safety of an eLectronic cigAreTte)study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>-a prospective 12-month double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical three-arm trial designed to evaluate smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and adverse events in &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; smokers not intending to quit after switching to a popular EC brand (&#x02018;Categoria&#x02019;; Arbi Group Srl, Italy). Body weight changes from baseline were compared amongst 1) high, medium, and zero nicotine strength products and 2) pooled continuous smoking failure, smoking reduction and abstinence phenotypes.</p><p>Our working hypothesis is that substitution of conventional cigarettes with ECs might limit post-cessation weight gain becausethese products- by mimicking the physical, visual, sensorial, and behavioural experience of conventional smoking- can replace the oral satisfaction without which many abstainers would fill their sense of emptiness and hunger with compulsiveeating.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>Details of participants&#x02019; characteristics and study design have been previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

Body weight was measured at baseline and at week-12, week-24 and week-52. Participants were randomized into three study arms to receive EC kits with either&#x0201c;Original 2.4%&#x0201d; cartridges for 12 weeks(Group A), or &#x0201c;Original 2.4%&#x0201d; for 6 weeks and a further 6 weeks with&#x0201c;Categoria 1.8%&#x0201d;(Group B), or&#x0201c;Original 0%&#x0201d; cartridges for 12 weeks(Group C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The randomization sequence was generated using a computer atthe Hospital pharmacy and blinding was ensured by the identical appearance of the cartridges.</p><p>At baseline, socio-demographic factors, smoking history, Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) scores, levels of eCO (Micro CO, Micro Medical Ltd, UK) and withdrawal symptoms by Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) were annotated. The MNWS measures craving, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, depression, insomnia, and increased appetite. The item &#x0201c;increased appetite&#x0201d; is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all present) to 4 (extreme). Body weight and height were also recorded. Participants were then given a free EC kit with a full supply of cartridges, and were trained on how to correctly use the product. They were told to use the study product ad libitum (but up to a maximum of 4 cartridges/day) in the anticipation of reducing cigarette smoking, and to take notes of the daily consumption of conventional cigarettes and cartridge use in their study diaries.</p><p>Participants were then invited to return to the CPCT at follow-up visits a) to receive further free supply of cartridges and study diaries for the residual study periods, b) to record their eCO levels, c) to have their body weight measured (at week-12, week-24 and week-52 only), d) to measure MNWS, and e) to return completed study diaries and unused study products.</p><p>Saliva samples were collected at week-6 (study visit 4) and at week-12 (study visit 7) for cotinine measurement in those who stated they had not smoked (not even a puff) and with an eCO &#x02264;7 ppm.

Increased appetite (MNWS-increased appetite scores &#x02265; 1) was reported in 21.1%, 27.7% and 27.7% of quitters at week-12, -24, and -52, respectively. Similar frequency distribution was also observed at earlier time-points.</p><p>In multiple regression models we evaluated for weight changes (with respect to baseline) at wk-12, -24, and -52 as dependent variable, and age, gender, high FTND at baseline (&#x02265;7), no. of cigarettes smoked at baseline, and BMI at baseline, MNWS appetite score, and phenotype classification as independent variables.A MNWS-increased appetite score &#x02265; 1 showed a significant effect only at week-12 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.036).According to the results provided by repeated measures ANOVA, when corrected for the confounding factors mentioned earlier, multiple regression models showed thatfailure in reducing or quitting tobacco smoking has a protective effect on weight gain compared to successfully quitting at Week-12 and Week-24 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004, respectively). In fact,at both time points, the beta coefficientsfor failures and reducers provided by the multiple regression models (and thus corrected for confounders)are negative and significant with respect to quitters (i.e., the reference group for this analysis). Interestingly, this effect disappears at Week-52, when the previously significant effect of smoking phenotype on weight gain is no longer present.

The problem of post-cessation weight gain can have important health consequences considering that smoking and obesity are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and some cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Furthermore, smoking and obesity are also risk factors for type II diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Consequently, the need for novel and more efficient approaches is unquestionable.</p><p>This is the first study to evaluate post cessation weight gain in smokers who reduced or quit smoking by using ECs in a randomized control trial. Details of quit and reduction (i.e. &#x02265;50% smoking reduction from baseline) rates for this study population have been reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Weight gain is observed in more than 80% of smokers who are successful in quitting smoking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In a meta-analysis of 62 prospective studies recording weight changes in abstinent smokers, the average weight gain at 3, 6, and 12 months after quitting was 2.9, 4.2 and 4.7&#x02009;kg, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In our study, quitters gained on average 2.4&#x02009;Kg and 2.9&#x02009;Kg at Week-12 and Week-24, respectively. Thus, the weight gain we measured after switching was relatively small. This could be due to the small number of women in the study and/or to low incidence of reported increase in appetite. Bearing in mind that women tend to gain more weight than men after smoking cessation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, if the proportion of women who quit in a given study is substantially different from men, the level of post-cessation weight gain will probably reflect the relative contribution of the female population to the overall study sample. Female participation in the ECLAT study was 40.7%; most importantly, amongst the 18 continuous quitters only 4 were women (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Increased appetite was described only in two to three out of ten quitters with a significant effect for post-cessation weight gain only at week-12. It is possible that by providing a coping mechanism for conditioned smoking cues EC use could mitigate hunger associated with smoking abstinence. Moreover, EC use appears to improve cognitive effects during tobacco abstinence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Taken together these mechanisms suggest that EC use may limit post-cessation weight gain.</p><p>Based on the notion that nicotine is a well-known appetite suppressants and increases resting metabolic rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, we expected to see more substantial control of post-cessation weight gain with substitution of conventional cigarettes with ECs. However, it must be noted that saliva cotinine levels in the EC users were well below the concentrations range normally found in regular smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> or experienced EC users<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This is not surprising considering that the model under investigation-equipped with a small 90 mAh lithium-ion battery that allows only about 50&#x02013;70 puffs-is not very efficient at delivering nicotine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Hence, it is likely that the significant (but small) post&#x02013;cessation weight gain observed at Week&#x02013;12 and Week&#x02013;24 after switching is also consequence of the very low nicotine absorption with the product under investigation.</p><p>Although these low nicotine levels were unlikely to allow efficient appetite suppression, the observed weight gain was not consistently related to appetite increase.Moreover, none of the confounding factors included in the multiple regression analysis models (i.e. age, gender, high FTND at baseline, number of cig/die at baseline, and BMI at baseline-<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>) showed a significant effect.</p><p>Despite the significant (but modest) post-cessation weight gain at Week-12 and Week-24, a significant increase in body weight from baseline was no longer observed in those who were abstinent at Week-52. This is unusual and probably specific to quitters of a smoking cessation RCT who have switched to ECs. Our data do not allow us to specify what biobehavioral processes underlying the complex dynamics of these changes in body weight and multiple factors and interactions must be considered. Nonetheless post-cessation weight gain reversal at Week-52 is a key informative finding of the present study and requires explanation.</p><p>Abundance of calorically dense food and being less active during the winter months and winter holyday season can contribute to significant weight gain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Given that more than 70% of study participants were enrolled in autumn (from September to November 2010), it is possible that imbalance in the rate of recruitment could have contributed to post&#x02013;cessation weight gain observed at week&#x02013;12 and week&#x02013;24 (i.e. well into the winter season). The subsequent physiologic reduction in weight gain at week&#x02013;52 could be consequence to returning to a less calorically dense diet and being more active during the summer months.</p><p>Often smokers cope with high stress levels during quitting by substituting their cigarette oral gratification with food. By perpetuating their smoking rituals with EC use, the quitting process for our group of smokers not planning to quit was easy, spontaneous and painless. For these individuals, EC use might have played a role by boosting smokers confidence in their ability to abstain from smoking as well as to lose weight at later time points. Likewise, we can also speculate that the surprisingly modest weight gain at earlier time points might have motivated quitters to pay increasing attention to their weight and eating thus accounting for the observed reversal in post-cessation weight gain at week-52.</p><p>Our RCT has the advantage of an interventional prospective trial approach, which minimizes the possibility of reverse causality of case-control and cross-sectional studies. Smoking abstinence was biochemically verified at each study visit. The effects of specific continuous smoking phenotypes were investigated on body weight gain in the same smokers over several time points for up to one year. Moreover, post-cessation weight gain was tested against a number of confounding factors.</p><p>There are however some limitations. Firstly, participants in this study may represent a self-selected sample (e.g. smokers not intending to quit switching to ECs), which is not representative of all smokers quitting or reducing tobacco smoking, however forms a good cohort of participants to ascertain the effects on post-cessation weight gain. Secondly, sample size was small in some smoking phenotype subgroup cohorts due to high attrition rates (not uncommon in smoking cessation studies), lack of financial incentive to study participants, and use of a continuous smoking phenotype classification for the statistical analyses. Nonetheless, we obtained highly significant results in this study. Thirdly, findings are likely to be product specific and cannot be generalized to the hundreds of other ECs on the market. Additionally, confounding factors (e.g. dietary habits, recreational exercise), which may have had an influence on weight gain were not assessed. Last but not least, the findings reported from this smoking population of Sicilian residents may not be valid for other population samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By substantially reducing tobacco consumption and minimizing post-cessation weight gain, EC-based interventions may improve smokers&#x02019; overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.
