Metabolic profiling allows simultaneous measurement of hundreds of metabolites in urine, the concentrations of which can be affected by food intake. We hypothesised that metabolic profiles of urine samples developed under controlled feeding conditions reflect dietary intake and can be used to model and classify dietary patterns of free-living populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised, controlled, crossover trial, we recruited healthy volunteers (aged 21&#x02013;65 years, BMI 20&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) from a database of a clinical research unit in the UK. We developed four dietary interventions with a stepwise variance in concordance with the WHO healthy eating guidelines that aim to prevent non-communicable diseases (increase fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dietary fibre; decrease fats, sugars, and salt). Participants attended four inpatient stays (72 h each, separated by at least 5 days), during which they were given one dietary intervention. The order of diets was randomly assigned across study visits. Randomisation was done by an independent investigator, with the use of opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes that each contained one of the four dietary interventions in a random order. Participants and investigators were not masked from the dietary intervention, but investigators analysing the data were masked from the randomisation order. During each inpatient period, urine was collected daily over three timed periods: morning (0900&#x02013;1300 h), afternoon (1300&#x02013;1800 h), and evening and overnight (1800&#x02013;0900 h); 24 h urine samples were obtained by pooling these samples. Urine samples were assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopy, and diet-discriminatory metabolites were identified. We developed urinary metabolite models for each diet and identified the associated metabolic profiles, and then validated the models using data and samples from the INTERMAP UK cohort (n=225) and a healthy-eating Danish cohort (n=66). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN43087333.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Aug 13, 2013, and May 18, 2014, we contacted 300 people with a letter of invitation. 78 responded, of whom 26 were eligible and invited to attend a health screening. Of 20 eligible participants who were randomised, 19 completed all four 72 h study stays between Oct 2, 2013, and July 29, 2014, and consumed all the food provided. Analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy data indicated that urinary metabolic profiles of the four diets were distinct. Significant stepwise differences in metabolite concentrations were seen between diets with the lowest and highest metabolic risks. Application of the derived metabolite models to the validation datasets confirmed the association between urinary metabolic and dietary profiles in the INTERMAP UK cohort (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and the Danish cohort (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Urinary metabolite models developed in a highly controlled environment can classify groups of free-living people into consumers of diets associated with lower or higher non-communicable disease risk on the basis of multivariate metabolite patterns.

These policies have a common core goal (reflected in the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>) of decreasing added sugar, sodium, and total fat consumption, and increasing intakes of wholegrain cereals, fruits, vegetables, and fibre. Results from the North Karelia project<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> showed that such dietary change can contribute to decreased coronary heart disease mortality at the population level.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>We searched PubMed for studies published in English from database inception to Oct 6, 2016, using the search terms &#x0201c;metabolomics OR metabonomics OR metabolic profiling OR metabolomic OR metabonomic OR metabolite profiling&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dietary intervention OR dietary intake OR dietary pattern&#x0201d; and excluding non-human studies and review, perspective, opinion, comment, and protocol articles. The search identified 58 studies, of which 45 were related to associations between dietary patterns and metabolite profiles. 27 of these studies were related to consumption of dietary patterns rather than supplementation of a standard diet with a specific food. All 27 studies used self-reported dietary data obtained with instruments such as food frequency questionnaires, dietary recall, and diet diaries, which can be prone to misreporting, with under-reporting biased towards unhealthy foods and over-reporting towards fruits and vegetables. Such inadequate dietary reporting in epidemiological surveys has led to conflicting research findings.</p><p>We did not find any studies that investigated associations between dietary patterns and metabolic profiles in a controlled crossover clinical trial setting. Established dietary biomarkers such as urinary sodium, potassium, and nitrogen track intake of specific nutrients only, and although a few reports have linked specific metabolite profiles to dietary patterns, these studies used self-reported food intake only. Urine and plasma have been shown to contain individual metabolites that are reflective of self-reported food intake data. In this study, we aimed to develop a new approach to assess dietary patterns using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopic profiling of urine.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>We developed a metabolic profiling strategy, using NMR spectroscopy of urine samples, that can objectively assess dietary profiles. We have shown that urinary metabolite models, developed in a highly controlled environment, can be used to classify free-living people into consumers of a dietary profile associated with low or high risk of non-communicable disease. Previous studies that related dietary patterns to metabolic profiles relied on self-reported dietary data or were performed in a non-controlled setting (eg, a home environment), which increases the possibility of misreporting and non-compliance. Our study was performed in a controlled environment to guarantee compliance and eliminate misreporting, and we validated our model using both internal controlled clinical trial data and external cohort data. This approach has the potential to be used to monitor dietary patterns objectively in population settings without the risk of making false inferences based on data prone to misreporting or non-compliance, which can confound the true effect of a diet on health.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Unhealthy dietary patterns are major risk factors of multiple common diseases, and many countries have local and national health policies that encourage dietary change. However, existing dietary tools are inadequate for assessing responses in dietary behaviour that result from policy change. Implementation of our metabolic profiling approach and analyses of dietary patterns based on urine metabolite profiles might not only enhance understanding of the relations between diet and health but also offer an objective method for dietary screening of large numbers of people. Our metabolic profiling strategy could be used to obtain objective information on adherence to healthy eating programmes aimed at combating obesity and common diseases.</p></boxed-text></p><p>A major limitation of nutritional science is the objective assessment of dietary intake in free-living populations.

Volunteers in the database who were aged 21&#x02013;65 years and had a BMI of 20&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were contacted with a letter of invitation, and those who responded with an interest in participation were screened, initially by email or telephone and subsequently at the CRF. Potential participants were excluded if they had clinically significant illnesses, if they reported weight loss or gain of 3 kg or more in the preceding 2 months, if they were taking prescription medication, if they were current smokers or substance abusers, or if they presented any abnormalities on physical examination, electrocardiography, or screening blood tests. Women were ineligible if they were pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>The study was approved by the London&#x02013;Brent Research Ethics Committee and done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (13/LO/0078).

Randomisation was done by an investigator who was not directly involved in the study, with the use of opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes that each contained one of the four dietary interventions in a random order. The envelopes were stored securely, away from the trial site, and opened in sequence by an investigator (ESC) as each participant was enrolled. Although participants and investigators could not be masked from the dietary intervention during the study period, investigators analysing the data were masked from the randomisation order.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participants attended the CRF for a 72 h inpatient period on four occasions, separated by at least 5 days (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). We chose 3 days (72 h) for the inpatient period because most food-derived metabolites are absorbed and eliminated in urine within 48 h, as evidenced in numerous studies (including other studies done in our laboratories) of the kinetics of absorption, bioavailability, and elimination of several food metabolites contributing to the urinary metabolome.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The minimum 5 day gap between dietary intervention periods ensured that any possible carryover was minimised.

The expectation to consume all food provided and not to leave the CRF during each visit was fully explained to potential participants before they provided consent to take part in the study. This adherence was monitored strictly: all food was weighed immediately before being given to the participants, and any uneaten food was weighed. Physical activity was also controlled; participants were allowed to engage in only very light physical activity (no more strenuous than walking from their hospital bed to the toilet).</p><p>During each 3 day inpatient period, urine was collected daily over three timed periods: morning collection (0900&#x02013;1300 h; cumulative sample 1), afternoon collection (1300&#x02013;1800 h; cumulative sample 2), and evening and overnight collection (1800&#x02013;0900 h; cumulative sample 3). 24 h urine samples were obtained by pooling these samples (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>).

However, to provide a basis for sample size calculation, we used data on urinary proline betaine, which we selected as a representative marker for nutritional intake.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Heinzmann and colleagues<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> suggested that urinary concentration of this metabolite would rise by 50 &#x003bc;mol/L with each incremental rise in fruit intake (ie, pieces of fruit) in the experimental setting. With an SD of 40 &#x003bc;mol/L, assuming a power of 0&#x000b7;95 and an alpha of 0&#x000b7;05 to detect a difference of 50 &#x003bc;mol/L, we estimated that we would need 12 volunteers. Because the protocol required a high amount of volunteer time and involvement (12 inpatient days plus travelling time) and volunteers could withdraw from the study, we requested permission to recruit 30 people, with the aim of having a cohort of roughly 20 people. Of note, in two previous dietary studies<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> researchers identified individual biomarkers of food intake after controlled feeding having included fewer than 20 participants in each study. All 19 participants who completed the study were included in the analysis.</p><p><sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra (16&#x02008;000 spectral variables) were manually phased and digitised over the range &#x003b4;0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;9&#x000b7;5 and imported into MATLAB (release 2014a). A combination of data-driven<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and experimental structural elucidation techniques and spiking-in of chemical standards was used to aid structural identification of diet-discriminatory metabolites. We used global urinary <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectral profiles representing diets 1 and 4 to generate representative metabolite patterns relating to each diet. Global metabolic profiling entails using methods that aim to measure all metabolites, or as many as possible with the assay, in a sample, as opposed to targeted analysis, in which only specific compounds are measured. Because this study is the first of its kind, we did not know a priori which compounds were of interest; therefore, we used global metabolic profiling to capture as much information as possible rather than limit our information to a set of targeted compounds.</p><p>We modelled data with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), using Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) to assess model robustness using a total of 1000 individual models; the data were centred and scaled to account for the repeated-measures design. The mean (T<sub>pred</sub>) and variance of each predicted sample were estimated using all MCCV models. We then used this MCCV&#x02013;PLS-DA model to predict 24 h urinary global profiles of volunteers after 3 days of strict adherence to the intermediate diets (ie, diets 2 and 3) without informing the model whether these urinary profiles belonged to diet 2 or diet 3. Day 3 samples were used for modelling because these were timed to be 48 h after starting the dietary intervention and ensured diet homoeostasis. Data from day 1 and day 2 samples served as internal validation data.</p><p>Across the 1000 models the mean prediction (T<sub>pred</sub>) of each sample was calculated from all models in which the sample was part of the validation set. A positive T<sub>pred</sub> indicates that the urinary metabolic profile of the sample resembles more diet 1 than diet 4, and vice versa for a negative T<sub>pred</sub>. The variance of T<sub>pred</sub> was estimated from the same predictions as were used for calculating the mean. We then calculated the Kernel density estimate by summing the resulting Gaussian distributions of all samples within each group. A p value was calculated for each variable on the basis of 25 bootstrap resamplings of the training data in each of 1000 models to estimate the variance and the mean coefficient across the 1000 models.

The INTERMAP study<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> investigated dietary and other factors associated with blood pressure in 4680 men and women aged 40&#x02013;59 years from 17 population samples in four countries (China, Japan, UK, and USA).

This procedure corrects the metabolite concentrations for differences in dilution across samples.

For example, all 19 individuals had consistent, significant changes in excretion of 28 metabolites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>), including metabolites with well known dietary associations&#x02014;hippurate (a urinary marker of fruit and vegetable intake), carnitine (a marker of red meat consumption), and tartrate (a marker of grape intake; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C&#x02013;E</xref>).

The urinary metabolic profiles generated from the urine samples obtained after diet 3 clustered next to those obtained after diet 4, and those from diet 2 clustered adjacent to those from diet 1.

Post-hoc Wilcoxon rank sum test corrected by Hommel's method confirmed that all pairwise comparisons differed significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). In addition to global metabolite profiles, we quantified specific metabolites from the model known to be associated with foods linked to healthy eating&#x02014;ie, hippurate (fruits and vegetables), 4-hydroxyhippurate (fruits), and S-methyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide (cruciferous vegetables)&#x02014;and found that these metabolites were present in significantly higher concentrations in urine samples from INTERMAP participants with high DASH scores than in samples from those with low DASH scores (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). However, S-methyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide (p=0&#x000b7;19) and hippurate (p=0&#x000b7;051) concentrations did not differ significantly between the groups with intermediate DASH scores and high DASH scores; similarly; concentrations of hippurate (p=0&#x000b7;096) and 4-hydroxyhippurate (p=0&#x000b7;15) did not differ significantly between the groups with low DASH scores and intermediate DASH scores. The overall findings indicated that the global urinary metabolic profile measured by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> 24&#x000b7;37, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) was a more accurate predictor of dietary patterns than single markers of individual foods consumed (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> 12&#x000b7;71&#x02013;21&#x000b7;09, p=0&#x000b7;0017 to p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p><p>We classified seven INTERMAP participants as metabolic outliers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>). On detailed examination of their dietary records, one participant (who had low DASH score but positive predicted score) was considered a misreporter because high amounts of proline betaine were found in the urine, but no citrus fruits or other dietary sources of proline betaine were recorded. The urine of another outlier from the group with intermediate DASH scores contained very high amounts of N-methylnicotinate (a vitamin B3 derivative), which contributed greatly to the classification of this sample as close to diet 1. This individual had consumed very high amounts of coffee, which is rich in niacin (vitamin B3), a precursor of N-methylnicotinate, accounting for the high level of urinary excretion. The urine of the remaining five outliers (DASH scores 24, 24, 25, 25, and 30) contained very high amounts of paracetamol, the metabolite signals (specifically sulphate and glucuronide) of which overlap with phenylacetylglutamine signals; the fact that phenylacetylglutamine was associated with diet 4 could help to explain the misclassification.</p><p>For the external validation cohort (ie, the Danish cohort; n=66), the metabolite profiles aligned with those of diets 1 and 2 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>), which was confirmed by the high DASH score of the cohort (median 28&#x000b7;5, range 20&#x02013;36). The urinary metabolic profiles were again associated with the dietary profiles (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Although our method worked best with 24 h urine models (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11, 13</xref>), the model created for spot samples from the Danish cohort based on cumulative urine samples also showed good stratification of metabolic phenotypes according to diet.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this proof-of-principle study, we showed notable differences in urinary metabolic profiles in a controlled feeding condition in which participants consumed four defined diets differing in compliance to the WHO-recommended healthy diet. We then showed, in two independent epidemiological datasets, that these metabolic profile patterns have the potential to classify the dietary intake of free-living individuals. We concluded that this novel application of metabolic phenotyping at the population level has the potential to provide objective measures of adherence to dietary recommendations, without the use of dietary surveys, which are known to be subject to misreporting, incompleteness, and bias.</p><p>We showed that urinary concentrations of biomarkers from individual healthy foods&#x02014;eg, hippurate (a marker of fruit and vegetable consumption), (N-acetyl-)S-methyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide (cruciferous vegetables), dimethylamine and TMAO (fish), and 1-methylhistidine and 3-methylhistidine (oily fish and chicken)&#x02014;were significantly higher after consumption of diet 1 than after diet 4, reflecting increased intakes of fruits, cruciferous vegetables, salmon, and chicken that were provided as part of diet 1. TMAO is a cryoprotectant in freshwater and saltwater fish, and urinary concentrations of TMAO are associated with recent fish intake;<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> therefore, high urinary TMAO concentrations can be associated with healthy diets that are rich in fish. However, gut bacteria can synthesise TMAO from choline and hence high urinary and plasma TMAO concentrations can also originate from red meat consumption, which is generally associated with adverse health outcomes. Indeed, high concentrations of TMAO in plasma and urine have been associated with cardiovascular and renal disease, respectively.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Thus, the global pattern of metabolites, which reflects the totality of the diet, is more important in indicating dietary patterns than are individual biomarkers.</p><p>Although findings from previous studies have shown that metabolic profiling could be used to identify specific dietary biomarkers associated with diet, our new approach allowed differentiation of the dietary interventions on the basis of global urinary metabolic profiles, while also reflecting specific chemicals found in individual foods or beverages. We used the characteristic metabolic profiles of diets 1 and 4 to predict the dietary profiles of individuals consuming diets between these two extremes (ie, diets 2 and 3). A clear separation was seen across the metabolite profiles of the four diets. We also showed significant stepwise differences in metabolite concentrations from diet 1 to diet 4. Changes in individual diet-associated metabolites were consistent across the dietary interventions.</p><p>To assess the feasibility of using metabolic profiling as an objective and unbiased approach to assess dietary patterns in a population setting, we used the INTERMAP UK cohort as a validation dataset to investigate whether free-living individuals with high dietary DASH scores (associated with a reduced risk of non-communicable diseases) and low DASH scores (associated with a high risk of non-communicable diseases<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) could be distinguished by use of the metabolite profiles from the controlled feeding experiment. We showed substantial clustering of predicted scores of the metabolic profiles according to the DASH scores, suggesting that dietary patterns could be predicted by interrogating the whole urinary metabolite profile (not just individual metabolites). This approach was based on the concept that differences in dietary intake are reflected in the relative concentrations of many hundreds of urinary metabolites.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Metabolic analysis revealed that urine from participants with high DASH scores in the INTERMAP cohort contained an increased abundance of biomarkers associated with fruit and vegetable intake&#x02014;including hippurate, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and S-methyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide&#x02014;compared with urine from participants on a diet with low DASH scores. The dietary intervention models were able to predict dietary patterns regardless of the specific dietary components. For example, the citrus fruit marker proline betaine was present in increased abundance in samples from the group with high DASH score (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>) even though citrus fruits were not provided as part of the dietary interventions. This finding suggests that the derived metabolite profiles are reflective of a wider range of healthy diets than those used in our trial.</p><p>Although the energy intakes across the three groups in the INTERMAP cross-sectional study stratified for DASH score did not differ significantly (despite a large spread around the median), the participants with low DASH scores tended to have higher energy intakes than did those with high DASH scores (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). However, the potential confounding effects of energy intake and dilution on the urinary metabolome were attenuated by the normalisation procedure applied.</p><p>Dietary intake data from free-living participants are subject to dietary misreporting; therefore, this challenge had to be addressed in the validation of our model. The INTERMAP epidemiological data have a track record of low misreporting rates,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> thus allowing us to address this limitation by exploring food intake records of so-called metabolic outliers. Because of potential misreporting issues, we used a second cohort (the Danish cohort) to further validate our model. Since only data from spot urine samples after the first void were available for this cohort, we matched the timing of this spot urine with the morning urine collection in our trial. Our analysis showed that the metabolite profiles of the Danish cohort resembled those of our participants after consumption of diets 1 and 2, and concurred with the dietary analysis showing that this healthy-eating population had a high median DASH score (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>). These findings suggest that our model is robust across different populations.</p><p>Although results from several studies<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have shown that the DASH score is positively associated with health, so far the DASH score has not generally been adopted in public health policies. We based our experimental dietary interventions on internationally accepted healthy eating guidelines.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Several other dietary scoring methods&#x02014;such as the alternate healthy eating index<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> and Mediterranean<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> and alternate Mediterranean scores<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref>&#x02014;exist, but we chose to apply the DASH index to all the diets (the ones in our trial and the diets consumed by the INTERMAP and Danish cohorts) to provide a common scale in which the range in absolute numbers is not limited. Additionally, the DASH score has been shown to be associated with cardiac risk.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref></p><p>It is important to understand the difference in use of spot urine samples compared with 24 h urine samples. Although spot urine samples are commonly used in epidemiological studies, they provide only the snapshot of the urinary metabolome for a very specific sampling time, whereas 24 h samples provide a time-averaged window on metabolism encompassing diurnal variation and other lifestyle-related fluctuations. Global metabolic changes are thus more difficult to assess in spot samples; use of the 24 h model to predict spot samples taken 2 h after lunch, 5 h after lunch, and 2 h after dinner showed that variability was greater in the spot sample predictions (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 13</xref>) than in 24 h samples from days 1, 2, and 3 of the trial (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>). Where possible, use of 24 h urine samples rather than spot samples is advised for measurement of metabolic changes, particularly when excretion kinetics are not known a priori, partly because spot urine samples vary more in dilution. However, where only spot urine samples are available because of study limitations, such as in the case of the Danish cohort, we found that the time-matched cumulative sample obtained between meals predicted the spot samples with more accuracy than did the 24 h model (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>), which is consistent with previous work showing accurate quantification of grape intake based on both 24 h samples and cumulative samples matching the excretion kinetics window.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> For this reason, we compared the spot samples, taken after the first morning void in the Danish cohort with the model derived from cumulative sample 1 (after breakfast to before lunch) (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>) rather than the 24 h model, because the sampling time was better matched.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. The metabolic profiling trial and the models derived from it were based on limited types of foods. However, even with this narrow range of foods, the model clearly classified the diets from the corresponding urinary metabolic profiles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to use global urinary metabolic profiles to objectively assess dietary patterns. However, we recognise that our approach will benefit from additional testing in a wider range of populations, including those of disease groups and diverse ethnic origins. Additionally, the likely misclassification of individuals consuming very high amounts of paracetamol and coffee in our model could be addressed in future work by using further analytical chemical profiling methods to avoid peak overlap in the urinary spectra. We anticipate that models built from a dataset based on a wider variety of foods would give more robust predictions. In this first-in-human study, we planned to test the hypothesis that adherence to different dietary intake patterns could be assessed from analysis of the urinary metabolome. With this aim in mind, we considered it was important that our controlled feeding study was done in healthy individuals to minimise the risk that metabolite profiles in urine might be confounded by pre-existing disease or concurrent medications, both of which are known to affect the urinary metabolic profile. The performance of the model in populations with non-communicable diseases would be an obvious follow-up. Despite these limitations, our models were predictive of dietary patterns in two well characterised free-living cohorts, thus providing proof of principle that this new approach has value as an objective means to monitor dietary patterns at the population level. Our model showed a clear separation between diets 1 and 4 in the global urinary metabolic profile and individual food-related metabolites, even though energy provided by the diets was not matched to individual estimated requirements.</p><p>Existing methods for dietary assessment&#x02014;eg, dietary diaries (which require coding and data entry), food frequency questionnaires, and dietary recalls&#x02014;are expensive (our own estimated cost is &#x000a3;60 for the complete analysis, including quality control of a 1 day dietary recall by an experienced nutritionist or dietitian). Accurate reporting assumes knowledge of food ingredients and can involve complex decoding of food product labels. Translating our study method into clinical practice is a cost-effective and time-effective alternative for objective dietary assessment&#x02014;the cost is roughly &#x000a3;20 per sample for robust analysis by NMR, which takes less than 5 min per sample to run (excluding sample preparation). This metabolic phenotyping strategy circumvents bias caused by misreporting and the fact that dietary scoring methods, such as DASH scores, can be based on arbitrary thresholds. Moreover, similar scores can arise from different dietary patterns. The global metabolic profile, consisting of both food-specific and general food-related metabolites, is an unbiased approach and does not rely on arbitrary cutoffs. Additionally, the global metabolic profile also allows testing of whether metabolites associated with reported foods are found in the urine and therefore the accuracy of dietary records.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that urinary metabolic profiles developed in a controlled environment have the potential to be used to assess adherence to dietary patterns in free-living populations without the need to collect dietary data. The extension and application of this strategy at the population level offer a potential step-change for public health nutrition because it provides an objective method to survey dietary intakes. Implementation of this strategy for urine-based dietary pattern analysis might enhance our understanding of the relation between diet and health and might improve clinical nutrition practice by providing health professionals with objective information on adherence to healthy eating guidelines.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
