Non-sick-listed employed women and men, aged 18 to 64&#x000a0;years, who had mental and physical health complaints and sought care at primary health care centers (PHCC) were eligible to participate. At baseline work-related stress was measured by the Work Stress Questionnaire (WSQ), combined with feedback at consultation, at PHCC. The preventive intervention included early identification of work-related stress by the WSQ, GP training in the use of WSQ, GP feedback at consultation and finding suitable preventive measures. A process evaluation was used to explore how to facilitate future implementation and structural use of the WSQ at the PHCC. The primary outcome to compare the preventive sick leave intervention by the general practitioner (GP) versus treatment as usual is sick leave data obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency register.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Early screening for sick leave due to work-related stress makes it possible not only to identify those at risk for sick leave, but also to put focus on the patient&#x02019;s specific work-related stress problems, which can be helpful in finding suitable preventive measures.

A number of organizational and psychosocial work-related factors are found to be associated with stress, which in turn might result in adverse health effects and illness, and a higher risk of sick leave. Work-related factors, such as poor organizational climate, in terms of intolerance at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and injustice at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are associated with stress, poor health and subsequent sick leave. Being engaged in work or committed to work is basically considered to have a positive influence on both the individuals&#x02019; well-being and that of the organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been demonstrated, though, that being too engaged, or over-committed, is a risk factor for sickness presenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and poor health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These organizational and psychosocial working life stressors and strains affect people negatively and result in various mental and physical health complaints, even prior to sick-listing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. People with these complaints often consult their primary health care physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] long before they even contemplate taking sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It may well be that neither the patient, nor the general practitioner (GP) is aware that their symptoms could be caused by organizational and psychosocial factors at work. Because many patients might be at risk of disability and long-term sick leave, it is of immense value to identify these persons early and to take preventive actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Providing sickness certificates is a common task for GPs in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One third of Swedish GPs reported having 1&#x02013;5 consultations each per week concerning sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This indicates that they often deal with assessing level of patients&#x02019; work incapacity in their everyday practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. GPs often found the decision about issuing a sickness certificate difficult, especially if the patients describe symptoms without clinical findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Likewise, GPs stated that they had poor knowledge of the workplace environment and the labor market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and they reported that they barely talked to patients about their work situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Today, GPs have no established practice for early identification of patients at risk for sick leave caused by adverse psychosocial factors.</p><p>The Work Stress Questionnaire (WSQ) has been designed specifically for early identification of people at risk for sick leave due to work-related stress, and was developed in the context of primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The WSQ is based on the idea that personal characteristics and environmental factors are interdependent, and that changes in either of these influences the possibilities for a sustainable work performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Experiences from sick-listed people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] contributed to the questionnaire development, and showed that a poor organizational climate, as exemplified by indistinct leadership and conflicts at work, in combination with high work commitment, such as excessive individual demands and responsibility, was crucial for future sick-listing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A prospective Swedish primary health care study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found that high stress due to poor organizational climate at baseline, measured with the WSQ, more than doubled the risk for sick leave at follow-up. Combined with high stress due to high work commitment the risk for sick leave increased fourfold.</p><p>Early screening makes it possible not only to identify patients at risk for sick leave but also to identify the patient&#x02019;s specific problems, which makes for the use of preventive measures and efficient treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. During the patient&#x02013;GP consultation, tailored preventive measures for work-related stress can be suggested that might lower the risk of future sick leave. Since the WSQ takes both work-related factors and personal characteristics into account, it is possible to identify work-related stress from both an environmental and a personal perspective. Thus, the WSQ gives the GP the opportunity to direct preventive measures towards either the person or the workplace, or both. Therefore, it is important in GP practice to identify the patient&#x02019;s specific problems at work early, to communicate them to the patient, and to recommend suitable preventive measures.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and hypothesis</title><p>The overall aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether systematic use of the WSQ, combined with feedback at consultation, can serve as a method for health care professionals in primary health care centers (PHCCs) to prevent or reduce sick leave due to work-related stress during a 12-month follow-up period. The preventive intervention will be compared versus treatment as usual (TAU). The aim is also to evaluate whether there are differences between the intervention group and the control group in healthcare measures and the prescribed medications at follow-up. In a process evaluation, the systematic use of the WSQ combined with feedback at consultation is examined.</p><p>The hypothesis of this RCT is that patients who answer the WSQ, when combined with feedback at GP consultation, will have fewer sick leave days during the year after intervention compared with those who receive TAU.</p><p>This paper presents the study design, the procedure, the outcome measurements, the allocation and the baseline characteristics of the study population. The project is still ongoing, with follow-up data to be collected and analyzes to be done. The RCT was designed in accordance with CONSORT recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method and design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study context</title><p>In Sweden, the social insurance scheme provides benefits to people who cannot work because of disease or injury. Those gainfully employed are covered for the first 14&#x000a0;days (except for one qualification day) by their employer, and after that period benefits are granted from the Social Insurance Agency. From day 8, a medical certificate is required. Providing sickness certificates is a common task for GPs in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This study is conducted in PHCCs in the V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland region with a population of 1.6 million inhabitants, around 17% of the Swedish population. The region has approximately 200 public and private PHCCs with approximately 800 employed GPs.</p><p>This RCT study is part of the TIDAS project within the New Ways research program at the Section for Epidemiology and Social Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>This study was designed as a two-armed RCT for early identification of people at risk for sick leave due to work-related stress consulting PHCCs. The recruitment of PHCCs took place from May 2015 to November 2015. Out of the V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland region&#x02019;s 200 PHCCs, 51 public and private PHCCs located in rural and urban areas in and around Gothenburg were identified and consecutively invited to participate. In all, seven PHCCs (four public and three private) participated. The PHCCs were economically compensated for each participant recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization</title><p>GPs and residents who worked in the clinic at participating PHCCs at least 50% of the time were randomized to either the intervention or the control group. The names of all GPs at the participating PHCC were written on slips of paper that were folded and then mixed in a non-transparent bowl. Colleagues that were not involved in the RCT drew the names one at a time, and the names were alternately included in the intervention or the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedure</title><p>Prior to the intervention period, the research team visited the participating PHCC and presented the study procedure. The control GPs were instructed to carry on as usual with their consultations. The intervention GPs received a brief training for the intervention, which included knowledge on the relationship between psychosocial factors at work, stress, health and sickness absence. GPs also received instructions on how to use, operationalize and interpret the WSQ, and on how to give feedback to the participants and refer patients at risk. Both oral and written information on the services of the primary health care specialists and occupational healthcare was presented to the GPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Masking (blinding)</title><p>Neither participants nor the GP were blinded to allocation in the RCT because of the nature of the intervention. All participants were given information on the study and signed consent forms before the patient&#x02013;GP consultations. However, the control GPs were not informed when a patient for consultation was a study participant, and the controls filled in the questionnaires after consultation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Eligibility to participate</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Non-sick-listed employed women and men aged 18 to 64&#x000a0;years who saw a GP at the PHCCs in the V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland region for mental and/or physical health complaints, including depression, anxiety, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular symptoms and other stress-related symptoms were invited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients seeking care for diabetes, urinary tract infections, infections, chronic obstructive lung disease, fractures, lump and spots, allergy and psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia, other psychoses or bipolar diagnoses, as well as medical check-ups were excluded.

During data collection, a research assistant was stationed at the PHCC. The research assistant identified and recruited the eligible participants and gave oral and written information on the study. All participants were also asked to provide informed consent for the study, including linking records to registers during follow-up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The procedure of datacollection and follow-ups, TIDAS in New Ways</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3852_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention group</title><p>The intervention consisted of the following components: GPs&#x02019; brief training in the use of the WSQ, participants&#x02019; completion of the WSQ, GP feedback at consultation and finding suitable preventive measures. The WSQ consists of 21 main questions grouped into four categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Two of the categories pertain to perceived stress due to <italic>indistinct organization and conflicts</italic> and perceived stress due to <italic>individual demands and commitment</italic>. Each of these two categories contains seven items.

The reliability and face validity of the WSQ has been tested and found to be good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Before the GP consultation, each participant filled in the WSQ and questions on background characteristics, which took around 15&#x000a0;min. The research assistant computed the WSQ and handed over the result to the GP before consultation. At the patient&#x02013;GP consultation, the GPs were instructed to give feedback to the participant by communicating the results of the WSQ, and discussing possible measures, such as referrals to PHCC&#x02019;s specialists or to the participant&#x02019;s occupational healthcare (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Directly after each patient&#x02013;GP consultation, the GP filled in a questionnaire concerning their adherence to the instructions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Control group</title><p>Control participants received TAU, i.e. an ordinary patient&#x02013;GP consultation.

The group sessions were held at the PHCC and were moderated by a researcher experienced in focus group methodology. The discussions focused on the following key questions: views on the content of the intervention, how to improve the process, views on the readiness to use the WSQ combined with feedback in daily practice, and how to facilitate future implementation and permanent use of the WSQ at the PHCCs.

Major efforts have been made to reduce sickness absence by restricting the sickness insurance scheme, by introducing monetary incentives to health care providers, and by specific recommended interventions, such as multimodal intervention and behavioral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, none of these measures had long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Preventing and reducing sickness absence is challenging, and new measures are needed. Prolonged exposure to adverse psychosocial work conditions can cause stress, which in turn can lead to poor health. This scenario constitutes an obvious risk for people to be sick-listed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. People turn to their PHCCs to get help. The GPs, though, report little knowledge of work-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and rarely talk to their patients about organizational and psychosocial work-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is, however, essential to identify the patient at risk of being sick-listed at an early stage. This enables the GPs to take appropriate measures preventing health problems and subsequent sick leave. To date, no method exists that can be used in primary health care to identify people at risk for sick-listing due to work-related stress.</p><p>Up to now, many interventions have focused on treatment and rehabilitation of individuals already on sick leave. This is very important, but preventing sick leave is better still. Once a person is sick-listed, the return-to-work process is very costly, and this shows that much is to be gained from early identification. The focus of this project very much corresponds to needs expressed by individuals as well as society as a whole. This study is expected to show if early identification of work-related stress, using the WSQ, combined with feedback at consultation, can serve as a method for health care professionals in PHCCs to prevent or reduce sickness absence over a 12-month follow-up.</p><p>Fortunately, we reached our target sample size for participating patients. Also, the fact that few sociodemographic differences were identified between the groups was an advantage. The intervention participants were somewhat older and had a higher rate of musculoskeletal complaints as reasons for consultation. The rates of patients declining and being excluded from participation were low, and no differences concerning gender and age were observed. A limitation is that we did not collect data on non-participation patients&#x02019; reasons for consultation or reasons to decline participation because of ethical considerations.</p><p>The advantages of randomizing at the GP level were considered as twofold: the risk for variations in sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors between participating patients in intervention and controls were reduced, and engaging the whole PHCC to recruit both to intervention and control groups led to more participants attending in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The disadvantage of randomizing at the GP level was the risk for contamination, because the GPs might discuss the study procedure with each other. Because the inclusion period was short, and the intervention was brief and imbedded in ordinary daily practice, the contamination risk was considered rather low.</p><p>A strength of this project is that both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the process evaluation. The focus group methodology involves group discussions and is distinguished from other qualitative group interviews by the explicit use of group interaction to collect data on a specific research topic. Communication between the participating focus group members is decisive for the outcome and the group process encourages the participants to clarify not only what they think, but also how and why they think in a certain way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An experienced group leader was chosen to moderate the sessions because the role of the group leader is essential in creating an open and friendly atmosphere that makes participants feel free to express their views [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition to using the questionnaires on GPs&#x02019; readiness and feasibility in the process evaluation, they will be analyzed in relation to the outcome variables.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Robin Fornazar for help with the data management, and Thorbj&#x000f6;rn Jonsson for linguistic advice.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due ethical grounds but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KH is the principal investigator and in charge of the project.
