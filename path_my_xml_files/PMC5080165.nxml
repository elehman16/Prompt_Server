contracting the musculus transversus abdominis muscle by using basic training, a pressure
biofeedback unit, and real-time ultrasonographic imaging during abdominal hollowing
exercise training. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects in this study were 30 healthy young
students in their twenties. Thirty subjects were divided randomly and equally into the
basic training, the pressure biofeedback unit, and real-time ultrasonographic imaging
groups. All of the subjects received abdominal hollowing exercise training for 15 minutes.
The subjects in the pressure biofeedback unit group were trained by using a pressure
biofeedback unit. Those in the real-time ultrasonographic imaging group received training
with monitoring of possible contraction of their musculus transversus abdominis muscles on
ultrasonography. [Results] In all the three groups, the musculus transversus abdominis
became significantly thicker, but more significantly in the real-time ultrasonographic
imaging group than in the basic training group. [Conclusion] The feedback method using
real-time ultrasonographic imaging may be more effective in thickening the musculus
transversus abdominis muscle during exercise than the traditional feedback method with
manual contact only. However, it is insufficient in terms of overall qualitative
improvement of exercise outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transversus abdominis</kwd><kwd>Real-time ultrasonographic imaging</kwd><kwd>Pressure biofeedback unit</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The musculus transversus abdominis muscle contributes to stabilizing the spine and thoracic

objective numerical values, and thus could not be used to verify whether appropriate
contraction and improvement have occurred. Surface electromyography cannot measure the
musculus transversus abdominis because it exists deep inside the body. Electromyography
using needle electrodes carries the risk of infection and is costly; hence, its utilization
is restricted in the clinical field<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. On
the other hand, a PBU and RUSI are noninvasive methods used widely in the clinical

musculus transversus abdominis is lacking. Accordingly, this study is intended to examine
the most effective feedback method for contracting the musculus transversus abdominis muscle
by using basic training, a PBU, and RUSI during AHE training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in this study were 30 healthy young students in their twenties who were
attending Youngdong University in Chungbuk, South Korea. Subjects were included if they had
no musculoskeletal or neurological disorders affecting the upper or lower extremities,
lesions, or history of surgery of the spine or upper extremities. The subjects were selected
randomly among those who met the above-mentioned criteria. Thirty subjects were divided
randomly and equally into the basic training group (BTG), PBU group (PBUG), and RUSI group
(RUSIG). The mean age, height, and weight of the subjects in each group were as follows,
without significant differences between the groups: in the BTG, 21.1 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;years, 167.4 &#x000b1;
6.5&#x02005;cm, and 57.0 &#x000b1; 7.1&#x02005;kg, respectively; and in the PBUG, 20.7 &#x000b1; 1.3&#x02005;years, 166.9 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm,
and 55.3 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;kg, respectively; in the RUSIG, 20.3 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, 167.6 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm, and 55.9 &#x000b1;
6.7&#x02005;kg, respectively. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the institutional review
board of Youngdong University. All the subjects were fully informed of the objectives and
methods of the study beforehand and provided informed consent to participate in the
experiments.</p><p>All of the subjects received AHE training for 15 minutes. They were in a crooked lying
position with their knees flexed to 90&#x000b0;. While continuing comfortable respiration as usual,
they strained the navel in the direction of the anus and the anus in the direction of the
navel, and slowly moved their lower abdomen inward while pulling the pelvic floor muscle
upward so that the pelvic floor muscle could contract<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. At this time, the subjects in the BTG were trained only with basic
training and manual contact. Those in the PBUG located the PBU (Stabilizer, Chattanooga
Group Inc., USA) on the lumbar region and were told to maintain the manometer at 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg,
starting from 40&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. The subjects in the RUSIG received training with monitoring of
possible contraction of their musculus transversus abdominis muscles on ultrasonography.</p><p>After training for 15 minutes, the thicknesses of the musculus transversus abdominis,
internal oblique abdominal, and external oblique abdominal muscles in all of the subjects
were measured three times when the subjects were at rest in a supine position and performed
the AHE with which they were trained. For measurement, the ultrasonographic probe was placed
in the middle, between the 11th costal cartilage and the iliac crest, and the space where
the musculus transversus abdominis and thoracolumbar fascia met was made to appear at the
right side of the ultrasonographic image<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To examine changes in the thickness of each muscle during rest and AHE in each group, a
paired t-test was conducted. To compare differences in the thickness of each muscle during
rest and during AHE, one-way analysis of variance was performed, and a Bonferroni post hoc
test was performed. The level of statistical significance was set at p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In all the three groups, the musculus transversus abdominis muscle became significantly
thicker, but the thicknesses of the internal oblique abdominal and external oblique
abdominal muscles did not differ significantly during AHE as compared with the rest period
(p&#x0003e;0.05). During AHE, the thickness of the musculus transversus abdominis differed
significantly among the groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the post hoc analysis, no significant
difference was observed between the BTG and the PBUG, and between the PBUG and the RUSIG
(p&#x0003e;0.05). Meanwhile, the musculus transversus abdominis was significantly thicker in the
RUSIG than in the BTG (p&#x0003c;0.05). No significant difference was observed among the three
groups regarding the thicknesses of the internal oblique abdominal and external oblique
abdominal muscles during AHE (p&#x0003e;0.05; <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

the BTG during AHE. Regarding this, Gwon et al. reported that the musculus transversus
abdominis muscles of the subjects who received feedback using RUSI were thicker than those
of the subjects who used a traditional feedback method, which is consistent with the result
of the present study<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Henry and
Westervelt also observed that the subjects who received feedback using RUSI needed less
practice to embody precise AHE than the subjects in the other groups, supporting the results
of the present study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, no
significant difference in the thickness of the musculus transversus abdominis muscle was
observed between the BTG and the PBUG. Regarding this, von Garnier et al. reported that the
interobserver reliability of the PBU was low<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Lima et al. observed that the preciseness of diagnoses made by
using a PBU was doubtful<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rackwitz et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that
selective contraction of the musculus transversus abdominis muscle was necessary to heighten
therapeutic performance, but the muscle is difficult to contract selectively<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The musculus transversus abdominis muscle
became thicker not only in the BTG but also in the PBUG and RUSIG. In addition, during
exercise, a significant difference in the musculus transversus abdominis was observed
between the BTG and the RUSIG, but not between the PBUG and the RUSIG. Given the
above-mentioned findings, the feedback method using RUSI may be more effective than the
traditional feedback method with manual contact only in thickening the musculus transversus
abdominis muscle during exercise. However, RUSI is insufficient in terms of overall
qualitative improvement of exercise outcome. Therefore, development of appropriate oral
commands together with ultrasonography is considered necessary, as is development of
contents equipped with interface and games for children or patients lacking in understanding
of RUSI. In addition, research on selective changes in thickness of the musculus transversus
abdominis muscle when a PBU is used together with certain oral commands and contents should
be conducted. This study was concerned only with healthy subjects in their twenties in a
certain geographic area, and the number of subjects was small. Therefore, in the future, an
experiment with a larger number of subjects with more-diverse diseases should be
conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Snijders</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hides</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The relation between the transversus abdominis muscles,
