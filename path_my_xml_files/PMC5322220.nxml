The prevalence of these types is 10&#x02013;15, 3&#x02013;4, and 1%, respectively (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). All TD are more common in boys than in girls (male/female ratio of approximately 4:1), and the clinical course may be transient or chronic. Typically, tic onset occurs in early childhood (i.e., 4&#x02013;12&#x02009;years), usually at the age of 7&#x02013;8&#x02009;years (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It peaks in severity and prevalence in preadolescence (i.e., 10&#x02013;12&#x02009;years) and begins to decline during adolescence. Approximately, one-half to two-thirds of adolescents with TS have a decrease in tic severity by early adulthood (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is characterized by the presence of sudden, rapid, non-rhythmically repetitive and mainly involuntary body movements (motor tics) and/or vocalizations (phonic tics). TD ranges in location (e.g., face and legs) and complexity (e.g., eye blinks, facial grimacing, jaw, shoulder shrugging, multistep movements, and phrases). Most TS patients also suffer from comorbid conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, or depression.</p><p>At present, the pathogenesis of TD remains unclear. Some scholars have suggested that D2-dopamine receptor dysfunction in the basal ganglia may be the major cause of tics. The principal treatment is pharmacological treatment combined with psychological behavior therapy, and individualization is emphasized (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Many affected children or adolescents do not require pharmacological treatment because their tics do not impair social and academic functioning. When persistent tics impact the quality of life, social and academic functioning and lifetime activities and psychological behavior therapy fails, pharmacological treatment (e.g., D2-dopamine receptor antagonists, selective monoamine antagonists, alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonists, and other drugs) should be considered (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). D2-dopamine receptor antagonists, such as haloperidol and tiapride, are often effective but poorly tolerated, so their use is limited (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Recently, dysregulation of the noradrenoreceptor system has been suggested as the underlying pathophysiology. Exacerbation due to stress is a characteristic of tics (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Clonidine, which acts as an alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been used to treat hypertensive patients. Small doses of clonidine can alleviate tics by activating presynaptic autoreceptors in the locus ceruleus and then reducing norepinephrine release and turnover. Since the early 1980s, it has been reported that clonidine has beneficial effects in the treatment of TD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), especially for patients with ADHD (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>A clonidine transdermal patch is a transdermo-therapeutic system that releases drugs at a constant speed successively for 7&#x02009;days. Compared with the ordinary preparation, a clonidine transdermal patch has no peak or valley plasma concentration, so it can achieve full efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Changing in weekly intervals only vastly improves compliance in children.</p><p>We analyzed the clinical data and follow-up results of 41 patients who were pretreated for more than 2&#x02009;months with D2-dopamine receptor antagonists using a prospective, open, single-group, self-controlled study. This study was undertaken with multiple objectives: (1) to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a clonidine transdermal patch in the treatment of TD and (2) to establish a prediction model for subjects that can provide evidence-based recommendations for appropriately choosing clonidine transdermal patches for treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The inclusive criteria were as follows: (1) between the ages of 6 and 18&#x02009;years, weight more than 20&#x02009;kg, normal intelligence and either sex; (2) met the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) for TD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); (3) received pretreatment for more than 2&#x02009;months with dopamine receptor antagonists but had a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) score-reducing rate of &#x02264;25% (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or was not well tolerated; (4) written informed consent and assent were obtained from patients who were more than 7&#x02009;years old and from their parents.</p><p>Subjects were terminated from participation in the study if they met one or more of the following criteria: (1) in violation of the study protocol during the study period; (2) lost to follow-up during the study period; (3) unused clonidine transdermal patches for more than 2&#x02009;weeks; (4) occurrence of any serious adverse events.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and was conducted in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Study Design and Measurements</title><p>All subjects had a comprehensive and detailed assessment of their current health status, which included pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, height, and weight, before treatment and at 4, 8, and 12&#x02009;weeks after therapy.

The YGTSS is based on the severity of motor and phonic tics in five separate dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. Each of these dimensions is scored on a 0&#x02013;5 scale according to tic severity. The total tic score (range 0&#x02013;50), which consists of the symptoms of tics, is derived by adding the total motor tic Score (range 0&#x02013;25) and the total phonic tic score (range 0&#x02013;25). The YGTSS also includes a separate impairment rating focused on distress and impairment experienced in interpersonal, academic, and occupational realms, the summation of which is the so-called overall impairment rating (range 0&#x02013;50). A global severity score (range 0&#x02013;100) is derived by summing the total motor tic score, the total phonic tic score, and the overall impairment rating. Because the overall impairment rating often remained unchanged over one week, the total tic score is more suitable for assessment of tic symptom severity. Jeon et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) verified that a 25% reduction in the total tic score provided optimal sensitivity (87%) and specificity (84%) for predicting positive responses. Thus, we defined clinical efficacy as a YGTSS score-reducing rate of &#x0003e;25% reduction. We took the score-reducing rate of the total tic score as a judgment standard for a curative effect.</p><p>A dysregulation of neurotransmission and abnormal receptors is believed to be the underlying pathophysiology of tics. It is widely acknowledged that dopamine receptor hypersensitivity in the basal ganglia is the pathogenesis of TD. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist has achieved the most reliable and fastest treatment response compared to other medications and is therefore the mainstay of any pharmacological treatment. Haloperidol, which is a typical dopamine antagonist and is most commonly used, may improve tic symptoms in 70&#x02013;80% of patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and has an A level of evidence (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, this agent may be associated with more and more serious side effects than other neuroleptics. The significant adverse effects, especially extrapyramidal symptoms such as acute dystonia or akathisia, sedation, weight gain, and decline in cognitive functions, have led to its discontinuation. Tiapride, although associated with low side effects, is less effective than haloperidol and has a B level of evidence (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Many studies have suggested that alpha-2 agonists, such as clonidine, are less effective than antipsychotics or atypical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol, aripiprazole, and risperidone (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We found that the effective rates of treatment with a clonidine transdermal patch were 29.27, 53.66, and 63.41% at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively. Compared with the baseline, significant changes were observed at three different observation periods. Because our subjects were unaffected by or not tolerant to dopamine receptor antagonists, it can be speculated that switching to a clonidine transdermal patch may be effective if dopamine antagonists are ineffective or intolerable. The study of Du et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) showed that clonidine improved tic symptoms in 68.31% of patients after 4&#x02009;weeks of treatment and showed a significant change compared with placebo. Zhong et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) reported that there were no significant differences in efficacy between clonidine and tiapride. In our studies, compared with week 4 of treatment with a clonidine transdermal patch, significant changes in the effective rate were observed at weeks 8 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and 12 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). However, there were no significant differences between weeks 8 and 12 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). It was concluded that the onset time of clonidine may be after the first 4&#x02009;weeks, and the peak time may be at 8&#x02013;12&#x02009;weeks. It has been suggested that clonidine needs to be taken for a longer period (3&#x02009;weeks or more) than haloperidol to lead to improvement (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Thus, withdrawal should not be undertaken because of ineffectiveness within a short time. It has been reported that medications for treatment of TD are helpful initially and have a noticeable effect but leave tics unchanged or worsened after approximately a year or 6&#x02009;months (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Our long-term follow-up of 8&#x02013;17&#x02009;months showed that 38.1% (8/21) of patients who were treated with a clonidine transdermal patch achieved complete remission of tics and were relapse free. Thus, clonidine had definite efficacy in the long term.</p><p>Further analysis of all factors of YGTSS score-reducing rates at different periods showed that compared with the level of 25% reduction, there were no significant differences in the score-reducing rate of four factors, including motor tics, phonic tics, total tics, and overall impairment, at 4 and 8&#x02009;weeks. Compared with the level of 25%, there were significant differences in the score-reducing rate of motor tics and total tics at 12&#x02009;weeks. This finding suggested that a clonidine transdermal patch could improve motor tics but had poor efficacy for phonic tics and overall impairment ratings. This finding is similar to the results of studies by Leckman et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and Du et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Clonidine is more effective for motor tics than for phonic tics, which may be because motor tics are less influenced by psychological factors.</p><p>The conditional fluctuation of tics was frequent, and individual differences were remarkable. Treatment protocols should be individualized and analyzed by synthesis according to treatment history, course of the disease, classification, comorbidities, and age (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our model showed that the first three important independent variables affecting treatment were classification (100%), course of the disease (78.1%), and motor tics (40.4%). Hanna (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) suggested that dopamine antagonists should be used in treating severe cases and (or) when other pharmaceutical treatments failed to improve the tics. Clonidine can be used as the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases, especially for children and patients receiving initial treatment. Other studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) have suggested that clonidine can also be used as refractory and (or) in severe cases or cases with co-occurring ADHD. Our forecast analysis showed that there was an efficacy of 100% for treatment with a clonidine transdermal patch if the clinical course was &#x02264;24&#x02009;months and motor tic score was &#x0003c;16. The efficacy was only 57.1% if the clinical course was &#x02264;24&#x02009;months and the motor tic score was &#x0003e;16. There was an efficacy of 62.5% if the clinical course was &#x0003e;24&#x02009;months and clinical classification was CTD. However, 90% of patients who were treated with a clonidine transdermal patch were invalid if the clinical course was &#x0003e;24&#x02009;months and clinical classification was TS. This finding provides the basis for the conditions in which clonidine transdermal patch treatment should be chosen. However, there was a limitation in the predictive value of the model because of the small sample size.</p><p>Haloperidol is often poorly tolerated in TD, with only 20&#x02013;30% of patients continuing to take this medication over time (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) secondary to the serious side effects. Clonidine, however, often has good tolerance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The most common adverse events with clonidine are sedation and dizziness, which often tend to be mild to moderate in severity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) without evidence of other adverse effects, including cardiac toxicity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In our study, the most common adverse events were rash (33.3%, 7/21), slight dizziness and headache (9.5%, 2/21); no patients dropped out of treatment due to adverse effects. In our long-term follow-up of 8&#x02013;17&#x02009;months, 56.7% (21/37) of patients continued to take this medication after the 12-week test. This result implies that clonidine has good tolerance and a high level of safety over time.</p><p>Our study was an open-label trial that was not placebo controlled. It could be argued that the findings were the result of a placebo effect rather than reflecting the intrinsic activity of the study drugs. However, compared with other diseases with a psychological origin, TD intrinsically has a lower placebo effect (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The duration of illness for the enrolled children ranged from 2&#x02009;months to several years or longer, and there were no good responses to D2-dopamine receptor antagonists. Furthermore, placebo effects often do not last long. In our study, clonidine continued to improve the symptoms of TD for the 4&#x02013;12&#x02009;weeks of the study period and maintained its effects in the long-term follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, when patients were pretreated with a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist that was ineffective or not tolerated well, switching to a clonidine transdermal patch treatment was effective and safe. A clonidine transdermal patch could be a first-line medication for mild and moderate TD cases that are characterized by motor tics.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>We confirm that we have read the Journal&#x02019;s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>P-PS conducted the acquisition and interpretation of the data and was involved in drafting the manuscript; YH conceived the study, participated in its design, and helped to draft the manuscript; LJ critically revised the study for important intellectual content; X-jL, S-QH, and S-ZL participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis.
