</p><p>Tissue engineering has been applied in ophthalmology aiming&#x000a0;to develop an optimal human corneal substitute for more than 20 years. However, only one research group has come close to restitute the damaged corneal stroma of several patients by implanting an acellular collagen-based scaffold in a clinical trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> After 4 years of follow-up, the scaffold was innervated and repopulated with corneal cells from the patient. Nevertheless, those patients did not present limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) or corneal neovascularization. Corneal diseases with damaged stroma associated with LSCD require not only replacing the corneal stroma but also repopulating with limbal epithelial stem cells (LESC).</p><p>Different approaches have been proposed to provide LESC in patients suffering LSCD. The most recent techniques used are: transplant of cultured LESC using different substrates (ie, fibrin, amnion, etc),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and simple limbal epithelial transplantation, where small pieces of limbus are placed directly on the corneal surface using amnion and fibrin glue.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> When the LSCD associates a damage of the corneal stroma or the endothelium, a corneal transplant is necessary to be performed in conjunction with those techniques,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> unless a keratoprosthesis is implanted instead.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In this context, the generation of an artificial corneal substitute, mechanically and optically suitable, where corneal stem cells could be cultured and transplanted, could emerge as an ideal therapeutic approach for those patients.</p><p>In this regard, we developed a tissue-engineered scaffold based on a mixture of fibrin and 0.1% agarose, where corneal epithelial cells, corneal fibroblasts and corneal endothelial cells were co-cultured.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Moreover, the human corneal epithelial cells co-cultured on top of the fibrin-agarose scaffold with human corneal fibroblast cultured inside of the biomaterial, promotes corneal differentiation of the epithelium and proper corneal differentiation of the artificial tissue.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Furthermore, we demonstrated that these co-cultured fibrin-agarose scaffolds present optimal mechanical and optical behaviour, similar to a native human cornea, after applying a plastic compression process or <italic>nanostructuration</italic>.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Finally, the high biocompatibility of fibrin-agarose scaffolds was demonstrated in several in vivo models where no signs of rejection or inflammation were found after its implantation in oral mucosa,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> skin<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and peripheral nerve.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

For that purpose, we designed the present phase I - II, randomised, controlled, clinical trial to evaluate its safety and feasibility, as well as evidence of efficacy data in patients suffering from severe trophic corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatments or with sequelae of previous ulcers. Corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatments leave persistent corneal epithelial defects that can lead to excessive stromal degradation. Disease progression may lead to corneal thinning or melting, and eventually, corneal perforation. These disorders are the most serious manifestations of neurotrophic keratopathy and other trophic corneal diseases that require aggressive treatments to prevent loss of visual function and even the eye loss. While the clinical diagnosis is readily oriented from the medical history and clinical findings, treatment of these conditions is one of the most difficult and challenging among all corneal diseases due to the lack of etiologic treatment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Current treatments try to control the symptoms of the patient by improving the lubrication status of the ocular surface (artificial tears, contact lens, punctal occlusion, etc) or by applying part of the missing trophic factors, such us epithelial growth factor or nerve growth factor, that are present in the blood serum.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 25</xref> When conventional treatments fail, corneal melting and perforation can occur in the most advanced stages. In these cases, more aggressive procedures are necessary, such as cyanoacrylate glue, anterior lamellar keratoplasty, conjunctival graft or amniotic membrane (AM) transplants to preserve the anatomical integrity of the cornea.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> We hypothesise that our model of human allogeneic nanostructured lamellar anterior cornea can be safely implanted in these cases, showing at least partial efficacy to reconstruct the corneal ulcer or its sequelae. The bioengineered cornea will provide structural elements (the fibrin-agarose scaffold), cellular content (epithelial cells and keratocytes) and growth factors (mainly those provided by the human plasma that is one of the main compounds used to generate the fibrin-agarose scaffold) to regenerate the damaged corneal tissue. To test this hypothesis, the clinical trial that we describe in this report was designed and conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a phase I - II, randomised, controlled, open label, multicenter clinical trial, assessing safety and feasibility, as well as evidence of clinical efficacy of a bioengineered human allogeneic nanostructured lamellar anterior cornea, in comparison with AM transplant.

Study variables regarding safety, feasibility and efficacy are measured as appropriate during the follow-up visits (figure 2). Safety and feasibility end-points are: adverse events (AEs)&#x000a0;and serious adverse events (SAEs)&#x000a0;causally related with study interventions or procedures (including marked changes of vital signs, ocular and physical examinations and laboratory test results); local, regional or systemic infections related with the implant; induced chronic ocular complications graded as described by Sotozono <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As efficacy end-points: integrity, detachment or reabsorption of the bioengineered cornea/AM implant; ulcer persistency or relapse and corneal stromal repair; visual acuity; corneal transparency; quality of life (EQ-5); tear function (TBUT and Schirmer); SICCA ocular staining score<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and touch corneal sensitivity (Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer). Additionally, the trial includes an in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) analysis of the grafted bioengineered cornea (and AM) using a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph equipped with a Rostock Corneal Module (HRT-RCM) for the micro-characterisation of the epithelium, the stroma and stromal nerves, as well as the corneoscleral limbus.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Random allocation</title><p>As sample size is small, block randomisation is applied to reduce bias and achieve balance in the allocation of participants to treatment arms.

The purpose, procedures and potential risks and benefits of the study are also explained thoroughly to the participants by study practitioners. All patients agreeing to participate in the clinical trial must provide written informed consent before undergoing any study-related procedures. A written approval consent form was also obtained from the legal representatives of the donors according to the applicable regulations. Patients are engaged to complete study follow-up through an optimised medical attention. Trial subjects have the right to withdraw consent for study participation at any time, and for any reason, or for&#x000a0;no reason at all. Furthermore, consent removal is the only withdrawal criteria accepted by the protocol, once the patient has received the implant. In any other case, even if for any reason procedures programmed by the protocol cannot be fulfilled, the patient will complete follow-up visits to meet safety objectives. Withdrawn patients will not be substituted.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data Safety Monitoring Committee</title><p>An independent DSMC was created as an advisory board to guarantee correct patient recruitment and withdrawal, to advice on any safety issues, to evaluate safety and feasibility data of the trial interim analysis (phase I, safety data throughout 3&#x02009;months of follow-up), and to be involved in any decisions ensuring the compliance of Good Clinical Practice (or GCP), the protocol procedures and applicable regulations.

In this context, fibrin-agarose corneal substitutes combining allogeneic stem cells and biomaterials might mimic the human native anterior cornea in terms of optical, mechanical and biological behaviour. To evaluate the safety in humans of this tissue engineered advanced therapy, we designed a phase I &#x02013; II clinical trial recruiting patients suffering from&#x000a0;severe trophic corneal ulcers. The intervention is based on the implantation of a bioengineered human allogeneic nanostructured lamellar anterior cornea after performing an anterior lamellar keratectomy to remove the damaged corneal tissue. Severe trophic corneal ulcers usually require aggressive treatments such as the use of glues, corneal transplants or AM grafts to preserve the anatomical integrity of the cornea.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Thus, fibrin-agarose scaffolds could also&#x000a0;be applied here to preserve the corneal structure, adding growth factors from fibrin, allowing us to evaluate the safety of this new advanced therapy for the first time&#x000a0;in human patients.</p><p>We have designed the trial with wide eligibility criteria for an easier screening and recruitment, making the study more feasible and economical, especially in the context of an investigator-driven, publicly funded clinical trial. Although this strategy may provide a heterogeneous sample, we believe it will not interfere with the comparison of the main safety outcome, as we are measuring important prognostic variables at baseline and throughout follow-up to allow for a precise discrimination of causality of the events. The special characteristics of the trial interventions impeded the possibility of blinding, which is a limitation to the study design. To avoid evaluation bias both allocation groups follow-up procedures schedules are equivalent, standardised grading systems are used when possible for objective outcome measurements and statistical analysis will be performed by blinded data analysts. Moreover, this study has been designed as a small size randomised controlled trial due to limitations in the current expiration period of the investigational product, which restricted site selection process. The reason to use AM as control is that it is commonly applied to treat severe corneal ulcers. Moreover, the implantation technique of AM is based on sutures, similar to the one employed for the fibrin-agarose scaffold implantation, in comparison to the use of glues, such as fibrin-based glue or cyanoacrylate. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing an investigator-driven multicentre randomised clinical trial evaluating bioengineered corneal implants combining two types of allogeneic cells (limbal epithelial cells and corneal fibroblasts). The design, management and coordination efforts invested on this trial may be of special interest to serve as a model for emerging multicentre non-commercial clinical trials on tissue engineered products.</p><p>Once the safety of this advanced therapy is established in humans, the final goal will be to evaluate its efficacy to restore the whole anterior cornea in patients with LSCD that associates a damage in the corneal stroma (ie, corneal scarring). This will be carried out in a future phase III clinical trial, if the current one demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the evaluated treatment. Thus, the results of the present trial are expected to envision a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of severe corneal diseases that require regeneration of the limbal epithelial stem cell population and the corneal stroma, using tissue engineering advanced therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e322" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016487.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e323" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016487.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>To all involved in the trial, the sponsor, the clinical teams in the participating sites, the manufacturer, the Biobank of the Andalusian Public Health System, the investigators, and particularly&#x000a0;the patients.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Participating institutions:</bold> Andalusian Initiative for Advanced Therapies, Seville (Sponsor, coordination and advisory entity); University of Granada (Scientific coordination); Biobank of the Andalusian Public Health System (Supply of cadaveric human scleral-corneal limbus); Cell Production &#x00026; Tissue Engineering in University Hospital Complex of Granada, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital (Manufacturer of investigational medicinal product); Clinical sites (Patient recruitment, follow-up and data collection): University Hospital Complex of Granada, San Cecilio and Virgen de las Nieves Hospitals (Sites 1), Virgen Macarena University Hospital-Seville (Site 2), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital-Seville (Site 3), Puerta del Mar University Hospital-Cadiz (Site 4), Reina Sofia University Hospital-C&#x000f3;rdoba (Site 5), La Arruzafa Hospital-Cordoba (Site 6), Costa del Sol Hospital-Marbella (Site 7), N&#x000aa; S&#x000aa; de Valme Hospital-Seville (Site 8), University Regional Hospital Malaga (Site 9), San Juan de Dios Hospital-Seville (Site 10); Cartuja Vision Clinic (<italic>In vivo</italic> confocal microscopy evaluations).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MGA, MCGG, MA, RM, NC, SM, ARG, LPF, ALM, IG, AC, GC: were involved in conception, investigational product development and trial design.
