capacity and walking ability in subacute stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The
subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=6) or a control group (n=6).
Patients in the experimental group received inspiratory muscle training for 30 minutes
(six sets of five-minutes) and traditional physical therapy once a day, five days a week,
for four weeks. The control group received aerobic exercise for 30 minutes and traditional
physical therapy for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, for four weeks. [Results] After
the intervention, both groups showed significant improvements in the forced vital
capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, 10-meter walking test, and six-minute
walking test over the baseline results. There were significant between-group differences
for the forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, and six-minute
walking test. No statistically significant differences were observed for measures of
saturation pulse oximetry oxygen and 10-meter walking test between the groups.
[Conclusion] These findings gave some indications that inspiratory muscle training may
benefit in patients with subacute stroke, and it is feasible to be included in
rehabilitation program with this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Inspiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke can lead to recurrent lower respiratory functions and worsening pulmonary fucntion,

better tolerance to exercise associated with better capacity to perform activities of daily
livings (ADLs). These results suggest IMT can have a positive effect on respirtory muscle
function and ADLs in people with central nervous system disorders.</p><p>The systemtic review<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that IMT
could improve patitnet&#x02019;s respiratory capacity and walking ability. However, relatively
little is known about the effects of subacute stroke on respiratory muscle function or
effective rehabilitation strategy to improve muscle function and walking ability. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IMT on respiratory capacity and
walking ability of subacute stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 12 post-stroke individuals admitted to a rehabilitation center in the
Republic of Korea. The inclusion criteria were (1) history and clinical presentation
(hemiparesis) of stroke (first hemorrhage or infarction), (2) event occurring&#x0003c;six months
previously, (3) ability to use a cycle ergometer, (4) no restriction in lung function and no
neurologic, orthopedic, or unstable cardiac condition, and (5) ability to walk a distance of
100 meters with or without assistance. The exclusion criteria were: (1) the presence of any
comorbidity or disability other than stroke that would preclude study, and (2) any
uncontrolled health condition for which exercise is contraindicated. Participation in the
study was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood the contents of this study. An
explanation of the study purpose and the experimental method and processes was provided to
patients, and written consent from all of the subjects was obtained. The study was approved
by the institutional review board and followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki. The participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group (n=6) or
control group (n=6). The intervention was comprised of four weeks of inpatient treatment.
The randomization was performed by selection from opaque, closed envelopes containing the
group assignment. The participants of the experimental group received IMT 6 series of 5
minutes each for 30 minutes a day, five times a week, for four weeks. We used the training
program method of Larson et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The IMT
with the Threshold regulated at 30% of participant&#x02019;s maximal inspiratory pressure values.
The participants of the control group received a self-selective intensity exercise with an
ergonomic cycle for 30 minutes a day, five times a week, for four weeks. In addition, all of
the participants of this study received traditional physical therapy and occupational
therapy.</p><p>The spirometer (Sensormedics Vmax, Sensormedics, USA) was used to assess the forced vital
capacity (FVC) and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants were instructed to inhale to
total lung capacity and then breathe out as hard and fast as possible for 6 to 7 seconds. At
least three blows were required. The FVC was the volume change of the lung between a full
inspiration to total lung capacity and a maximal expiration to residual volume. The
FEV<sub>1</sub> was the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory
maneuver started at the level of the total lung capacity.</p><p>A hand-held pulse oximeter (MP110Plus, Mekic Co., Korea) was used to assess the saturation
pulse oximetry oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
SpO<sub>2</sub> stands for peripheral capillary oxygen saturation and estimation of the
amount of oxygen in the blood. This value is represented by a percentage. Normal
SpO<sub>2</sub> values vary between 95 and 100%.</p><p>A walk test (10-meter walking test [10MWT]) was performed by having the patient walk 10
meter for the gait speed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The six-minute walking test (6MWT) was used as an endurance test<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All analysis were carried out using SPSS 16.0 version for Windows software by an
independent physical therapist who also was unware of assignment. Descriptive statistics
were used to summarize baseline data. Category variables were compared between the groups
using the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics were
performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Within-group comparisons of pre- and posttest
values in each group were made using Wilcoxon signed rank test and between-group comparison
for posttest values was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance level was set
at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were 12 patitents admitted during the study period. All the participants completed

patients with subacute stroke. Both groups showed significant changes after the
intervention, and the experimental group showed more significant changes than the control
group in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and 6MWT. However, there was no significant change in
SpO<sub>2</sub> and 10MWT. These results partically supported the hypothesis that IMT
would be beneficial for stroke survivors. The findings of this study show that IMT improved
the respiratory capacity and waking endurance of subacute stroke patients.</p><p>In general, our findings are consistent with the previous studies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is difficult to compare the results from present study
with other research findings because our study was conducted within 6 months of the stroke.
Although muscle weakness is often present in the acute stages of stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, a means of improving respiratory muscle strength may be
beneficial for stroke patients.</p><p>Respiratory capacity depends on persistent cardiopulmonary organ and neuromuscular system
interaction, and is crucial for stroke patients because of decreased physical condition<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the IMT with the Threshold
and the use of cycle ergometry for exercise may improve respiratory capacity and walking
endurance in both groups. However, the IMT with Threshold group showed more significant
differences in respiratory capacity (FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>) and walking endurance (6MWT)
than the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In a study by Sutbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, found
significant effects of IMT on several outcomes in subjects with subacute stroke. They
reported improvements in inspiratory muscular function that were associated with increases
in lung volume and exercise capacity, sensation of dyspnea, and quality of life compared
with the group that received breathing retraining, diaphragmatic breathing, and pursed-lip
breathing, as well as the control group. The results of this study are similar to the above
results. In this study, the experimental group showed better improvement in the FVC,
FEV<sub>1</sub>, and 6MWT than the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, this study explored the effect of IMT on respiratory capacity and walking
ability in subacute stroke patients using FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, SpO<sub>2</sub>, 10MWT, and
6MWT. It revealed that IMT positively affected the FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and 6MWT that are
respiratory capacity and walking endurance measurement. Thus, IMT is effective for the
improvement of respiratory capacity and walking endurance in subacute stroke patients.</p><p>This study has several limitations that can be improved by future studies. The small sample
size may limit the generalization of the finding of this study, and the absence of a
follow-up period hinders the effects of this study.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial,
