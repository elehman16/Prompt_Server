Twelve patients with advanced head and neck cancer were injected with BoNT into the submandibular glands prior to primary radiochemotherapy. Six patients received BoNT/A and 6 patients BoNT/A and B, half of each subgroup into their left and the other half into their right gland. As an internal control, sodium chloride was injected into the respective contralateral gland (placebo). For the evaluation of the salivary gland function, technetium pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy was performed before and after the end of radiotherapy. BoNT/A and B were well tolerated. Analysis of the scintigraphic data revealed no statistically significant difference between BoNT and placebo regarding the scintigraphic uptake difference (pBoNT/A = 0.84 and pBoNT/A-B = 0.56 for BoNT/A vs. placebo and BoNT/A-B vs. placebo, respectively). We also found no significant difference in treatment between BoNT and placebo in terms of salivary excretion fraction (pBoNT/A = 0.44; pBoNT/A-B = 0.44). This study demonstrates that BoNT can be safely combined with radiochemotherapy. Dosing and timing of BoNT injection should be further investigated for efficacy analysis.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>German Registry for Clinical Trails <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004595">DRKS00004595</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the Von-Behring-R&#x000f6;ntgen Foundation, Marburg, Germany, Grant No. 57-0011.

Radiotherapy in curative intent conventionally involves the administration of a total dose of 60&#x02013;70 Gy in daily fractions of 1.8&#x02013;2 Gy over 6&#x02013;7 weeks. Locoregional control might be further improved by hyperfractionated and/or accelerated radiotherapy regimes (HART) in comparison to the conventional fractionation. Chemotherapy combinations such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, given concurrently with radiation, have demonstrated improvements in both locoregional control and survival [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>A clinically very relevant side effect of radiotherapy to the head and neck region, however, is damage of the salivary glands. Radiation doses as necessary for curative treatments of HNSCC lead to a significant and often permanent decrease of salivary flow [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Radiation-induced sialadenitis can cause dysphagia, impaired sense of taste, infectious diseases of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, and dental and periodontal disease. Such salivary gland dysfunction, associated with irreversible xerostomia, is a very serious clinical problem, which significantly impairs quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Because of the high clinical relevance of radiation-induced sialadenitis, research is ongoing to develop and test radioprotective agents for salivary glands. Despite many attempts and efforts in studies on human salivary glands and in animal models, relevant progress in preventing or treating irradiation-induced sialadenitis could not be achieved so far. Some preventive interventions were reported in the literature including salivary gland transfer and application of cytoprotectants, such as amifostine, and pilocarpine as a parasympathomimetic agent administered during radiation therapy [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These studies, however, have found varied success rates with a significant proportion of patients who continue to experience xerostomia and who suffer from potential adverse effects [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus none of those approaches are established in clinical setting.</p><p>Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is an established agent in the treatment of different neurologic disorders and is increasingly used for the treatment of salivary gland diseases such as sialorrhea [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, we could show in a preliminary study in rats that intraglandular injection of BoNT performed prior to radiation significantly reduced radiation-induced toxicity of the glandular tissue [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The aim of the present study was therefore to analyze safety and efficacy of BoNT, injected into the submandibular glands prior to radiochemotherapy for HNSCC to preserve the gland function.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design and quality assurance</title><p>The study was designed as a four-armed randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded single-center study (German Clinical Trials Register ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004595">DRKS00004595</ext-link>; European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) No.: 2009-014576-22; Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) No.: 4035548). The primary objectives of the study were safety, tolerability, and effect of BoNT in preserving salivary gland function of patients with HNSCC after radiotherapy. The study was carried out in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines, national laws, and the Declaration of Helsinki in the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Philipp University, Marburg, Germany. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the medical faculty, Philipp University, on 11. September 2009 (No: 115/09). All patients gave written informed consent prior to their inclusion. Quality control included data source verification by monitoring, double data entry and in-house monitoring in the central study office. A trial description can be found on the website of the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004595">https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004595</ext-link>. The study registration was performed in delay after enrolment of the first patient. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for the study drug are registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Due to the phase I nature of the study, the number of recruited patients was kept to a minimum. Twelve patients with advanced HNSCC were aimed to be recruited to the study. Depending on the true effect size, this phase I clinical trial with a limited number of patients might not have sufficient power to detect a treatment effect of BoNT (for more details about the power calculation please see subsection statistical analysis of scintigraphic data). Patients were included in the study only if they had normal and symmetric salivary gland function in salivary gland scintigraphy at baseline examination prior to BoNT injection and prior to radiochemotherapy. Exclusion criteria were: extirpation of the submandibular gland, diseases of the salivary gland, medication that might influence the salivary function, thyreostatic drugs, previous radiotherapy and pregnancy. Patients were recruited between July 2010 and October 2011 at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Philipp University, Marburg, Germany. The trial ended in October 2012 after the last patient had been examined in the follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Radiochemotherapy</title><p>Protocol treatment included radiochemotherapy in a hyperfractionated accelerated regime, performed in an intensity modulated technique (IMRT) to a total absorbed dose of 72 Gy (HART-B). Simultaneous chemotherapy with 5-fluoruracil (5FU) (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 1&#x02013;5) and cisplatin (once weekly, 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was scheduled for all patients. The described tumor spread requires irradiation of a target volume that includes the submandibular region without the possibility to spare the submandibular glands.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Treatment with botulinum toxin and randomization</title><p>All patients were treated either with 15 U BoNT/A (Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Ireland) or 15 U BoNT/A and 750 U BoNT/B (Eisai Manufacturing Knowledge Centre, United Kingdom). The treatment with a mixture of BoNT/A and B was based on the results of our previous study, with the most prominent morphological effect after the combined injection of BoNT/A and B [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A randomization list was created prior to recruitment of patients to contain a random sequence of length 12 with assignments 1, 2, 3, and 4, such that each of the four assignments occurred three times, corresponding to three patients per subgroup. This list was created by the responsible biometrician (KS) prior to patient recruitment, and the assignment of patients to treatments was done by the Coordination Center for Clinical Trials according to this randomization list. Patients were randomized into one of the following 4 treatment groups:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>BoNT/A injected in the right gland, NaCl (0.9%) in the left gland;</p></list-item><list-item><p>BoNT/A in the left gland, NaCl (0.9%) in the right gland;</p></list-item><list-item><p>BoNT/A and B in the right gland, NaCl (0.9%) in the left gland;</p></list-item><list-item><p>BoNT/A and B in the left gland, NaCl (0.9%) in the right gland.</p></list-item></list><p>This procedure resulted in a balanced allocation of 3 patients to each of the 4 treatment groups so that 6 patients received either BoNT/A or BoNT/A and B each. The BoNT or NaCl was injected into the submandibular glands by ultrasound guidance 14&#x02013;21 days before starting radiochemotherapy. The choice of this time interval was based on the effects seen in rats after radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the reduction of salivary flow with BoNT for treatment of hypersalivation reaches its full extent 2&#x02013;3 weeks after intraglandular injection [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To achieve double-blindness, the medication was provided to the clinician with coded numbers by the pharmacy of the University Hospital Marburg without revealing the assignment of BoNT or placebo. The pharmacy received an identification list from the Coordination Center for Clinical Trials, which allocated 4-digit coding numbers to the four treatment groups. After randomization of a patient, the pharmacist was informed about the assigned 4-digit coding number by the Coordination Center for Clinical Trials and labelled the injections with the particular side (left and right) according to the identification list. The assignment was neither known to the treating physician nor to the patient nor to the evaluator. The assignment was only known to the Coordination Center for Clinical Trials and to the pharmacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>In accordance with the national law, a pharmacovigilance system was established to record and assess any adverse events (AEs) related to BoNT application as study medication. Serious AEs were reported to the sponsor immediately. In case of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), these cases were reported to the respective authorities according to applicable law. In case of severe AEs, the investigator decided case by case whether to terminate the individual treatment or not. The incidence and severity of all AEs were graded according to the EMA's note for guidance on clinical safety data management, ICH E2A.</p><p>Changes in vital signs, routine laboratory parameters, physical examination findings, electrocardiography, and medical conditions during and after radiochemotherapy were assessed throughout the study with a minimum follow-up of six months (6&#x02013;13 months, mean 8.3 months). Patients were monitored for radiochemotherapy related toxicities according to NCI common toxicity criteria (CTC). AEs were recorded since randomization until 30 days after the last regular study visit of each patient. Patients with AEs were treated accordingly and ongoing AEs at the end of the individual study treatment were followed and treated until resolution. The stopping criteria comprised occurrences of AEs and serious AEs that did not allow the continuation of the treatment according to the study protocol. In addition, the principal investigator could discontinue the study for medical reasons in a patient&#x02019;s interest and also in cases of non-compliance of the patient. A patient&#x02019;s own volition to discontinue the study and pregnancy were other stopping criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Quantitative scintigraphic studies</title><p>In addition to safety and tolerability, another primary outcome measure of the study was defined as the difference between the scintigraphically assessed radionuclide uptakes of the BoNT/A or BoNT/A and B treated gland and the placebo (NaCl) treated contralateral gland for each patient (side difference) before and after BoNT injection and radiochemotherapy (pre-post side difference). The secondary outcome was the salivary excretion fraction (SEF), which was defined as the ratio between excreted radioactivity triggered by drinking lemon juice and the total amount of radioactivity within the gland before drinking.</p><p>Taking the uptake difference between the two glands for each patient reduces the within-patient variability due to situation-dependent parasympathetic stimulation, which affects both glands in the same way (e.g., just thinking of lemon juice could cause salivation before drinking it). Because gland functionality may already differ between patients at baseline, the evaluation of the pre-post side difference instead of the side difference after radiation therapy alone reduces the between-patient variability of the treatment effect. The information contributed by the patients can hence be exploited more efficiently.</p><p>After injection of 74 MBq <sup>99m</sup> Tc-pertechnetate, scans were acquired during 45 min using a digital gamma camera (Symbia, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany, lateral resolution: 128x128 pixels) equipped with a Low Energy High Resolution (LEHR) collimator. Raw data were processed using the software Syngo (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Uptake of the salivary glands was determined by the region of interest (ROI) technique and was calculated as percentage of the total amount of administered radionuclide that was taken up by the respective salivary gland. All ROIs and the submandibular gland region were defined manually for each patient individually. In order to account for the background activity, which was measured in the supraclavicular area, the difference between the accumulation in the gland ROI and the accumulation in the background ROI was used. For evaluation of SEF, 4 ml of lemon juice were administered orally 15 min after injection of <sup>99m</sup> Tc-pertechnetate. Scintigraphic studies, i.e., assessment of uptake and SEF, were performed before radiotherapy (baseline) and 4&#x02013;6 months after the end of the radiotherapy (follow-up). It has been shown that patients&#x02019; salivary function declines significantly 3&#x02013;4 months after the end of radiotherapy and the late phase of radiation damage starts after 4 months [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analysis of scintigraphic data</title><p>Differences between outcome and baseline values are referred to as change scores, the analysis of which is defined as &#x0201c;simple analysis of change scores (SACS)&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The uptake and SEF pre-post side differences are such change scores and were hence analyzed using SACS.</p><p>As each patient served as his/her own control, the data were matched and, hence, analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The alternative two-sided hypothesis for each of the two treatment groups (BoNT/A as well as BoNT/A-B) corresponds to a difference in primary outcome measure, i.e., the uptake pre-post side difference, between treated and untreated glands different from 0. An expected value of 0 corresponds to no treatment effect of BoNT, i.e., the null hypothesis, which is equivalent to no difference in treatment effects between BoNT and placebo. P-values &#x02264; 0.05 were considered nominally significant. Power calculations assumed a mean treatment effect between the verum-treated and placebo-treated glands of 2 standard deviation (SD) units as had been observed in studies with rats [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, assuming a mean treatment effect of 2 SD units, normally distributed data, a sample size of 6 patients, and a type I error rate of 5%, the Wilcoxon signed rank test has a power of 87%. As a result, 6 patients were recruited for each dose group, leading to a combined sample size of 12 patients for both treatments. The sample size of the present study was large enough to also allow for the side-adjusted testing for differences in treatment effects between BoNT/A vs. BoNT/A-B by the van-Elteren test [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The two-sided null hypothesis of each stratum (right verum-treated and left verum-treated) corresponds to: values of both treatment groups are drawn from the same distribution, i.e., treatment effects are the same for BoNT/A and BoNT/A-B. The combined alternative hypothesis corresponds to a difference in treatment effects across the strata.</p><p>All analyses for the uptake difference, as described above, were repeated for the SEF difference.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Additional, non-confirmatory statistical analyses</title><p>Generally, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that includes baseline values as a covariate is the preferred approach to maintain precision of the treatment effect estimate as well as to control type I error and power of the test [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, this method is not applicable in case of small sample sizes, such as the treatment groups with only 6 patients in the current study. ANCOVA can also be used to assess the strength of correlation between baseline and outcome values in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient &#x003c1; estimated by r. This is important because the power of SACS crucially depends on a sufficiently high positive correlation between baseline and outcome values. Accordingly, further analyses were run (i) to assess the strength of correlation between baseline and outcome values in terms of the correlation coefficient r, (ii) to test for treatment effects within each treatment group based on unadjusted outcome values, i.e., without subtracting baseline values, and (iii) to test for treatment differences between the two treatment groups based on unadjusted outcome values while taking a potential effect of the side (right/left) of verum and placebo application into account. Specifically, we used (i) ANCOVA with baseline values as the only covariate in the model, (ii) the Wilcoxon signed rank test on unadjusted outcomes in each treatment group, and (iii) the van-Elteren test to compare unadjusted outcome values between the BoNT/A and BoNT/A-B treatment groups. The test results of the additional analyses are not interpreted in a confirmatory manner but are meant to explore the data regarding baseline-outcome correlations and differences in the unadjusted outcome values.</p><p>All analyses were carried out using the package <italic>coin</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] of the statistical software <italic>R</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to calculate Wilcoxon signed rank and van-Elteren tests, which yield exact p-values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Twelve patients (2 females, 10 males; mean age at diagnosis: 55.4 years, range: 45&#x02013;66 years) with stage III and IV HNSCC were included in the analysis of the study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g001">Fig 1</xref> for a chart of the participant flow).

The most frequently reported AEs were: leukopenia in 4, symptoms of dehydration, general physical health deterioration, radiation skin injury in 2, and two times bleeding from the tracheostoma after changing of tracheal cannula in 1 patient. All AEs, except the above-mentioned metastases, were classified as mild or moderate.

The mucin-rich saliva of the submandibular gland serves as mucosal lubricant that mainly contributes to the patient&#x02019;s subjective sense of moisture [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Depending on tumor location and location of involved nodal metastases, modern high precision radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated (IMRT) and image guided techniques enable substantial sparing of normal tissues, e.g. (parts of the) parotid glands, in many cases. On the contrary, due to the close proximity of the submandibular glands to the jugulodigastric nodes, which are the first echelon nodes in most head and neck cancers [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the submandibular glands can rarely be spared from the irradiation but they receive a relevant or even the prescribed irradiation dose. Based on this background, our previous experiments about radioprotective agents and the present study focus on the submandibular glands.</p><p>Application of BoNT as an established agent for different diseases has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypersalivation [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Intraglandular injection of BoNT causes inhibition of acetylcholine release at the neuroglandular junction and leads to a transitory pharmacological denervation of the salivary glands associated with reduced salivary secretion [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We recently analyzed the effect of locally injected BoNT in salivary glands of the rat at the cellular and ultrastructural level. We found that intraglandular application of BoNT induces morphological and functional changes, indicated by temporary glandular atrophy with reduced amounts of secretory granules of the acinar cells [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These effects may be due to glandular denervation induced by the inhibition of the SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors) involved in the acetylcholine release at the neuroglandular junction, especially by inhibition of those involved in exocytosis of the granula of the acinar cells.</p><p>Temporary acinar atrophy in conjunction with chemical denervation of the salivary glands could be of interest for prevention of radiation-induced sialadenitis. The decisive pathogenic factor in irradiation-induced sialadenitis is a direct radiation effect on the glandular tissue. The radiation dose and the dose distribution are directly related to the severity of the glandular damage [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The quantity of secretory granules of the acinar cells also counts as an important pathogenic factor [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, intraglandular application of BoNT prior to radiation could lead to glandular atrophy with reduction of acinar granules during the time of irradiation, which might significantly reduce the radiation sensitivity of the glandular acini.</p><p>For in vivo verification of the mentioned hypothesis of preservation of acinar cells during radiotherapy, we previously established a rat model for functional studies on salivary glands. Scintigraphy with <sup>99m</sup> Tc-pertechnetate was shown to be appropriate for functional studies of salivary glands of rats [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using this animal model of radiation-induced sialadenitis, we have shown by salivary scintigraphic measurements and histomorphological studies that the intraglandular injection of BoNT prior to irradiation significantly reduces functional and structural radiation-induced damage of salivary glands [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Based on this previous work, the present study provided the first clinical experience of the safety profile and the potential function preserving effect of BoNT after irradiation of submandibular glands in humans. This study revealed that BoNT can be safely combined with radiochemotherapy. We did not set any prior condition regarding the maximal rate of toxicity of BoNT/A and B as a criterion for good safety. However, since none of the observed adverse events are likely to be due to the study medication, it is warranted to proceed to a phase II clinical trial as the next step.</p><p>Analysis of the treatment groups did not show a significant difference in the salivary function after injection of BoNT or placebo in terms of uptake or SEF difference. Only in one patient we observed a substantial uptake and SEF difference. This patient was treated with a combination of BoNT/A and B. The previously mentioned animal study revealed that most significant morphological changes occurred in glands treated with both BoNT/A and B [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. BoNT/A cleaves SNAP-23(25) (synaptosomal-associated protein) and BoNT/B VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein, synaptobrevin), enzymes involved in the release of acetylcholine at the presynaptic membrane of parasympathetic nerves. In this way, a temporary chemical denervation of the target organ is established. The cleavage of different SNAREs in the presynaptic and acinar cell membrane might be responsible for the more pronounced effects of the combination of BoNT/A and B.</p><p>Comparison of the evaluated data of this patient with others revealed that the time period between BoNT injection and start of radiotherapy was 6 weeks in that patient compared to 2&#x02013;3 weeks in all other cases, which might be the reason for the appreciable effect in that case. Other clinical and treatment differences or study protocol violations than those described in this paper (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g001">Fig 1</xref>) did not exist.</p><p>Admittedly, the trial was limited by the small number of patients under study. However, in consideration of the above-mentioned findings in rats, we expected a comparable large effect in humans and hence did not intend to enroll more patients in this phase I clinical trial than required. Prior to this trial, sample size calculations were performed, based on the effect size found in previous work with rats [<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To exploit the data on the small number of patients more efficiently, we used an elaborate study design in which each patient served as its own control in order to reduce variability in outcome measures within and between patients. This study design, which is similar to the classical cross-over design, proved to be appropriate in our study. Yet, our findings neither showed a significant effect with regard to the uptake nor the SEF difference. This might be due to the reduced precision of the scintigraphic measurements in humans as compared to the measurements in rats. In addition, the applied simple analysis of change scores (SACS), i.e., subtracting the baseline values from those measured after treatment, may not always be the best option. This is due to the fact that SACS is only superior in terms of power to an analysis of raw outcome values if the correlation between baseline and outcome values is larger than 0.5 (see Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g004">4</xref>). An ANCOVA, as shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151316.g004">4</xref> for the joint treatment effect of BoNT/A and BoNT/A-B, could be applied instead to overcome this problem. In addition, it is conceivable that findings and effect sizes from studies with rats might not be completely transferable to humans, which calls for further investigation of the mode of action of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, respectively.</p><p>Our study provided the first clinical experience of the effect of BoNT injected in salivary glands prior to combined radiochemotherapy in patients with HNSCC. While the study proved excellent tolerability, the effect on organ function preservation could not be demonstrated with our sample of 12 patients. There are hints pointing at an improved efficacy with a modified timing and possibly dosing schedule of BoNT/A and B, which should be further evaluated in future studies.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Von-Behring-R&#x000f6;ntgen Foundation, Marburg, Germany, Grant No. 57&#x02013;0011.
