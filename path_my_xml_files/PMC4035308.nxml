Studies have indicated that there may be differences in the causative pathogens and outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ventilator-associated pneumonia (NV-HAP). However, with limited NV-HAP-specific data available, treatment is generally based on data from studies of VAP. The Phase 3 Assessment of Telavancin for Treatment of Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (ATTAIN) studies were two double-blind randomized controlled trials that demonstrated the non-inferiority of telavancin to vancomycin for treatment of Gram-positive HAP. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients enrolled in the ATTAIN studies who had NV-HAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data from the two ATTAIN studies were pooled, and patients with NV-HAP were analyzed. The all-treated (AT) population consisted of all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication, and the clinically evaluable (CE) population consisted of AT patients who were protocol-adherent or who died on or after study day 3, where death was attributable to the HAP episode under study. The primary endpoint was clinical response (cure, failure, or indeterminate) at the follow-up/test of cure visit, conducted 7&#x02013;14 days after the end of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1,076 patients (71.6% of overall ATTAIN AT population) had NV-HAP (533 and 543 patients in the telavancin and vancomycin treatment groups, respectively). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were similar for patients with NV-HAP treated with telavancin and vancomycin (83.1% [201/242] and 84.1% [233/277], respectively). In patients with methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolated at baseline, cure rates in the CE population were 74.8% (77/103) for telavancin and 79.3% (96/121) for vancomycin. The incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and deaths in patients with NV-HAP was similar whether patients received telavancin or vancomycin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This post hoc subgroup analysis of the ATTAIN studies demonstrated similar cure rates for telavancin and vancomycin for treatment of NV-HAP.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nosocomial pneumonia</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), defined as pneumonia occurring at least 48 hours after admission to a health care facility (which was not incubating at admission), is the most common health care-associated infection contributing to death.<xref rid="b1-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The treatment of HAP is complicated by the frequent involvement of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA).<xref rid="b1-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Mechanical ventilation is the primary risk factor for HAP, with mechanically ventilated patients up to 21 times more likely to develop HAP than non-ventilated patients.<xref rid="b1-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As such, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), defined as pneumonia occurring at least 48&#x02013;72 hours after endotracheal intubation, has been the focus of the majority of HAP research to date.<xref rid="b1-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Although there is a paucity of data on patients with non-ventilator-associated pneumonia (NV-HAP), recent reports suggest that it may be worthy of greater attention.

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had pneumonia acquired after 48 hours in an inpatient acute or chronic care facility, or that developed within 7 days after being discharged. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either telavancin 10 mg/kg intravenously every 24 hours or vancomycin 1 g intravenously every 12 hours for 7&#x02013;21 days. Vancomycin dosage could be modified per site-specific guidelines based on weight, renal function, and/or vancomycin serum level determinations as long as the study blind was maintained. Respiratory samples (invasive or noninvasive) and two blood culture specimens were obtained at baseline for Gram stain and culture in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.<xref rid="b1-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Isolated pathogens were submitted to a central laboratory for confirmation of identity and susceptibility testing, per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidance.<xref rid="b18-idr-7-129" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the present analysis, data from the two ATTAIN studies were pooled. Patients with NV-HAP were patients with HAP who had never been ventilated, plus those who developed pneumonia after at least 48 hours of hospitalization (HAP) and then went on to require mechanical ventilator support (and so were deemed to have developed their pneumonia prior to being ventilated).</p><p>The analysis populations were defined as follows: the safety population included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication (according to the treatment received). The all-treated (AT) population included all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication (according to the randomized treatment). The &#x0201c;modified AT&#x0201d; population consisted of patients in the AT population who had a respiratory pathogen identified from baseline samples, or from blood cultures if no respiratory sample was positive. The clinically evaluable (CE) population consisted of patients in the AT population who were protocol-adherent or who died on or after study day 3, where death was attributable to the HAP episode under study. The microbiologically evaluable (ME) population consisted of CE patients who had a Gram-positive respiratory pathogen recovered from baseline respiratory specimens or blood cultures.</p><p>One of the stratification factors at randomization was ventilatory status (in addition to geographic region and the presence or absence of diabetes). Patient demographics, pathogens, clinical response, adverse events (AEs), and mortality were evaluated by treatment group (telavancin or vancomycin). The primary endpoint was clinical response in the AT and CE populations at the follow-up/test of cure (FU/TOC) visit, which was conducted 7&#x02013;14 days after the end of therapy (EOT). Clinical response was classified as cure, failure, or indeterminate. &#x0201c;Cure&#x0201d; was defined as improvement or lack of progression of baseline radiographic findings at EOT and resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia at FU/TOC. &#x0201c;Failure&#x0201d; was defined as at least one of: persistence or progression of signs and symptoms, or progression of radiological signs of pneumonia at EOT; termination of study medications due to &#x0201c;lack of efficacy&#x0201d; and initiation within 2 calendar days of a different potentially effective antistaphylococcal medication; death on or after day 3 attributable to primary infection; or relapsed infection at TOC after termination of study medications. &#x0201c;Indeterminate&#x0201d; was defined as inability to determine outcome. Failure at EOT was carried forward to FU/TOC. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the difference in response rate; pooled-study CIs were stratified by study.</p><p>Survival over the 28-day period was summarized using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographics and patient disposition</title><p>The NV-HAP AT population constituted 71.6% (1,076/1,503) of the overall ATTAIN AT population (533 and 543 patients in the telavancin and vancomycin treatment groups, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-idr-7-129">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The demographic and baseline characteristics of the telavancin- and vancomycin-treated patients in the NV-HAP AT population were generally similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-idr-7-129">Table 1</xref>).
