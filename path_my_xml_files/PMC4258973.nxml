Thereafter the patients received injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 min patients were induced with injection propofol (2 mg/kg). Endotracheal intubation was facilitated following a paralyzing dose of injection succinylcholine (2 mg/kg) IV maintenance of anesthesia was carried out with inhalation anesthetics (sevofluran) and nitrous oxide: Oxygen (60:40). Intraoperative relaxation was maintained with injection atracurium 0.5 mg/kg (bolus dose) followed by 0.1 mg/kg incremental doses on return of respiration. On the conclusion of surgery, patients were reversed with an injection neostigmine (50 &#x003bc;g/kg) and injection glycopyrrolate (10 &#x003bc;g/kg) and extubated.

However, there was no comparative study. The present study is an attempt to fill that gap.</p><p>A total of 75 patients were recruited in three groups of 25 each. Group C &#x02013; 25 patients received placebo (0.9% NS) infused over a period of 10 min; Group D &#x02013; 25 patients received dexmetodimine (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) infused over a period of 10 min and Group P &#x02013; 25 patients received clonidine (3 &#x003bc;g/kg) infused over a period of 10 min. The baseline parameters for demography and hemodynamic variables were matched in the three group.</p><p>It was observed that mean SBP, DBP and MAP in the dexmedetomidine group remained close to the baseline throughout the study period showing a significant difference from both the placebo and clonidine groups throughout the study period following the induction interval. Clonidine group too showed significantly lower mean values for SBP and DBP as compared to placebo the group at all-time intervals, however, the extent of the difference between placebo and dexmedetomidine group was higher as compared to that of the clonidine group. Similar trends were obtained for HR too. Oxygen saturation was maintained between 98% and 100% in all the cases throughout.</p><p>One of the interesting findings was the relatively higher efficacy of dexmedetomidine group to show minimal changes from baseline. In the placebo and clonidine groups, a steep increase in all the hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP and HR) was observed between induction to intubation intervals, however, no such change was observed in the dexmedetomidine group. It was observed that the changes in all the parameters in dexmedetomidine groups were consistent and did not show a steep rise or fall at any time interval. Although as compared to the placebo and controlled groups, the mean MA<italic>P</italic> values in dexmedetomidine groups were significantly lower for all the measurements following infusion yet at none of the times the mean values were below the threshold level of 60 mm of Hg.</p><p>In the placebo group, maximum mean SBP was observed to be 153.76 &#x000b1; 12.82 mm of Hg at after intubation interval which was significantly higher to both clonidine as well as dexmedetomidine group at the corresponding time interval. In the placebo group, the minimum mean SBP at any postintubation interval was 136.32 &#x000b1; 9.29 mm of Hg at 10 min whereas the corresponding values for clonidine and dexmedetomidine groups were 119.56 &#x000b1; 9.87 and 111.52 &#x000b1; 11.28 mm of Hg respectively. In dexmedetomidine group, the minimum mean SBP was observed at 8 min postintubation interval (110.96 &#x000b1; 12.02 mm Hg), whereas the corresponding values in placebo and clonidine groups were 140.40 &#x000b1; 9.31 and 119.48 &#x000b1; 9.64 mm Hg respectively. As regards the hike in mean SBP between induction to intubation intervals, the change was distinctly sharp in the placebo group (from 115.36 &#x000b1; 12.82 to 153.76 &#x000b1; 12.82 mm of Hg) as compared to clonidine group (115.40 &#x000b1; 10.70 to 138.88 &#x000b1; 9.23 mm of Hg) and dexmedetomidine group (123.20 &#x000b1; 10.16 to 125.96 &#x000b1; 8.67 mm of Hg). The minimum to a maximum range of SBP was between 115.36 &#x000b1; 12.38 and 153.75 &#x000b1; 12.82 mm of Hg in the placebo group, from 115.40 &#x000b1; 10.70 to 138.88 mm Hg in clonidine group and from 110.96 &#x000b1; 12.02 to 131.28 mm of Hg in the dexmedetomidine group. It was observed that in the placebo group at none of the time intervals the mean SBP was below the baseline value whereas in the clonidine group too, the mean SBP was higher as compared to baseline at after intubation and 2 min after intubation intervals. However, in the dexmedetomidine group, at none of the postinduction intervals the mean value of SBP was higher as compared to the baseline value.</p><p>Study of pattern of these relative changes gives the idea of the hemodynamic stability brought in by dexmedetomidine as compared to placebo and clonidine group. Similar trends were obtained for DBP, MAP and HR too.</p><p>Taittonen <italic>et al</italic>. (1997)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have also shown similar response patterns while comparing clonidine, dexmedetomidine and placebo and attributed this to be the distinguishing feature of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, including clonidine and dexmedetomidine. They reported that use of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists improves the oxygen saturation and reduces tachycardia, hypertension and sympathetic activity.</p><p>In all groups, blood pressure and HR increased after tracheal intubation; both were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine and clonidine groups than in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). A similar observation was made by Yildiz <italic>et al</italic>. (2006).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In some studies, it is observed that MAP was decreased by low dosage of dexmedetomidine (0.25 &#x003bc;g/kg) and MAP was increased transiently, and HR was decreased significantly by high dosage of (1&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;g/kg) dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Scheinin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that the use of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonist leads to bradycardia. Belleville <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that the dexmedetomidine given in 2 min in the doses of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg causes irregular ventilation and apnea episodes. Ebert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] did not observe any episode of apnea, airway obstruction and hypoxemia with bolus doses of dexmedetomidine in their study, and they reported that the depression of respiration may be seen due to deep sedation, for the reason that the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists don&#x02019;t have an active role on the respiration center. However, in the present study a transient rise of MAP and HR was observed immediately following dexmedetomidine infusion. In another study in which the infusion of opioid and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists were compared, it was concluded that dexmedetomidine doesn&#x02019;t cause significant respiratory depression, and it decreases the risk of apnea.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Carabine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that 0.625 and 1.25 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine IV 15 min prior to induction of anesthesia attenuates the pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation. In contrast, Wright <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed in noncardiac ASA physical status I patients that under almost identical conditions 1.25 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine IV was not effective. In the present study, we achieved a reasonable attenuation effect of clonidine using a dose of 3 &#x003bc;g/kg infused over a period of 10 min.</p><p>A number of studies have indicated the oral premedication of clonidine to achieve the attenuating effect of clonidine before laryngoscopy intubation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, as the bioavailability after oral intake varies between 70% and 90%, we chose the IV route of administration to relate pharmacodynamic effects more precisely to a certain dose. The infusion time was also spanned over 10 min in order to ascertain the maximum bioavailability. The IV infusion of clonidine was demonstrated to be safe in our patients. In early investigations the fast injection of clonidine increases blood pressure and as a consequence, decreases cardiac index.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These effects can be attributed to peripheral &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> stimulation by high clonidine plasma levels. Despite the lack of adverse effects, even this slow IV infusion obviously affected peripheral &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -adrenoceptors because blood pressure increased slightly, but significantly during the 10 min after the start of infusion.</p><p>There are only limited studies in the literature that have followed a design similar to that reported in the present study, where a single dose schedule for both clonidine and dexmedetomidine groups led to promising attenuating effects during intubation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
