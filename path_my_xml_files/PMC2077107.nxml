The anti-emetic treatment included ondansetron combined with dexamethasone or placebo. After chemotherapy all patients received ondansetron only for 5 days. Two categories of tumour burden (TB) were formed according to the diameter of the greatest residual tumour (&#x0003c; 2 cm = minimal TB and &#x0003e; or = 2 cm = large TB). Self-reports of nausea and vomiting were obtained for 15 days. Other potential predictor variables were assessed and included in multivariate analyses. Patients with large compared with minimal TB had more delayed emesis, especially on days 2-7. They also had more acute nausea. The aggravating effect associated with large residual TB was more evident in patients &#x0003e; or = 55 years. During the second week after the chemotherapy the occurrence of nausea was higher in patients &#x0003e; or = 55 years than in those &#x0003c; 55 years. This was seen primarily in patients with large residual TB. Predictors for no delayed emesis at all were anti-emetic treatment with dexamethasone, minimal tumour burden, low neuroticism and no history of motion sickness. The increased risk of "persistent' delayed nausea and vomiting seen in older patients with large tumour burden may have important clinical implications and warrants further attention.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1114" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1115" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1116" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1117" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1118" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1119" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
