The participants were randomly assigned to four groups: Control (C), LRS, RT, and the combined RT plus LRS (RT-LRS). Participants in the LRS and RT-LRS groups consumed two capsules of LRS (250 mg/capsule) daily for 8 weeks. Participants in the C and RT groups consumed placebo capsules daily for 8 weeks. The RT program which has ten different types of exercises involving the muscles of the upper and lower limbs was conducted 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Before the experimental period, pretest was carried out to measure anthropometric measurements, isokinetic muscular strength and power, and anaerobic and aerobic fitness. The same tests were carried out after 8 weeks of experimental period. The Human Research Ethics Committee, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedures and variable assessments</title><p>Participants&#x02019; muscular strength and power were determined via an isokinetic dynamometer (System 3 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, New York, USA).

These parameters include peak torque of shoulder extension at 60&#x000b0;/s, average power of shoulder extension and flexion at 300&#x000b0;/s, peak torque of knee flexion at 60&#x000b0;/s, and average power of knee extension and flexion at 300&#x000b0;/s. Similarly, in the RT alone group, significant positive effects were observed in isokinetic muscular strength and average power in the 5 out of the 8 measured parameters following 8 weeks of intervention. These parameters include average power of shoulder flexion at 300&#x000b0;/s, peak torque of knee extension at 60&#x000b0;/s, peak torque of knee flexion at 60&#x000b0;/s, average power of knee extension at 300&#x000b0;/s, and average power of knee flexion at 300&#x000b0;/s.</p><p>One of the factors associated with improvement in muscular strength and power from RT was postulated to be muscle hypertrophy. Muscular stress on the components of muscular system triggers the protein signaling to activate and stimulate synthesis muscle protein and lead to increased muscle size.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The present findings imply that both 8 weeks of combined RT with 500 mg/day of LRS consumption and 8 weeks of RT alone was able to elicit beneficial effects on isokinetic strength and power. These results also showed that combining LRS supplementation with RT may not elicit additional benefits on isokinetic muscular strength and power compared to performing RT alone.</p><p>LRS supplements do not seem to cause any toxicity effect as a study has shown that 28-day oral administration of 1000 mg/kg of sclerotial powder had no adverse effect on the growth rate, hematological, and renal and liver function parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In addition, we found that after 8 weeks of LRS supplementation, there were some minor changes in some of the parameters in the liver and renal function tests of the participants, but they were all within the normal range. Hence, we conclude that there was no adverse effect even in humans, with LRS consumption at the dosage given in this study.</p><p>Following 8 weeks of intervention, participants in both RT and combined RT-LRS groups showed significant improvements in Wingate anaerobic power and anaerobic capacity from pre- to post-test. However, no significant changes in Wingate anaerobic parameters were observed in LRS alone group and control group from pre- to post-test. The significant improvement in anaerobic capacity and power with physical training in the present study was in line with the findings of Kraemer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who reported a significant increase in peak power after 4-6 months of RT. It was speculated that the increment in anaerobic capacity and power to be attributed to the intramuscular high-energy phosphates adaptation from the RT and lactate generating capacity[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in the present study.</p><p>Consistent with the findings on muscular performance and Wingate anaerobic power and capacity of this study, it also found that the participants&#x02019; estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max), an indicator of aerobic fitness was found to be significantly higher in the posttest compared to pretest in both RT and combined RT-LRS groups.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that 8 weeks of combined RT-LRS supplementation, RT alone, and LRS supplementation alone did not give any significant changes in white blood cells, basophil, eosinophil, and neutrophil counts from pre- to post-test. It was speculated that the exercise duration and intensity and the dosage of the LRS supplementation prescribed in the present study may not be adequate to elicit beneficial effects on these few measured immune parameters.</p><p>Another notable finding in this study was that there were significant increases in total lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes counts in RT alone group but not in other experimental groups at postexercise compared to pre-exercise. These findings imply that LRS supplementation alone, and supplementation with LRS during RT may not provide additive benefits on these few immune parameters. The positive effects of RT on lymphocytes of the present study were contrary to the findings of Natale <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who reported no significant effects on total lymphocyte counts in all experimental groups after 8 weeks of three different types of exercise intervention. It was postulated that duration and intensity of training may have contributed to this contradictory findings. The positive findings of the present study in total lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes counts in RT alone group reflect that the prescribed exercise intensity and duration in the present study were appropriate for enhancing immune functions in the participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Combined RT with LRS supplementation (500 mg/day for 8 weeks) and RT alone elicited beneficial effects on isokinetic strength and power. Both combined RT with LRS supplementation and RT alone also showed positive effects in anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, and aerobic fitness parameters. For immune parameters, only RT alone showed a significant improvement in total lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes levels but not the other experimental groups. These findings imply that combining LRS supplementation with RT may not elicit additional beneficial effects on isokinetic muscular strength and power, anaerobic and aerobic fitness, and immune parameters compared to RT alone.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to extend our sincere gratitude to all the participants who have participated in this study.
