Periodontitis starts with inflammatory lesions of the gingiva, which, if left untreated, may progress and eventually involve and compromise the entire periodontal apparatus of the affected teeth. Dental plaque is the primary etiologic factor in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The onset or progression of periodontal disease can be controlled by regular plaque control practices. Mechanical plaque control is the most dependable oral hygiene measure, but mechanical oral hygiene methods of plaque removal require time, motivation and manual dexterity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Oral hygiene routines (daily toothbrushing and flossing) are neither practiced consistently nor are they done for an adequate amount of time to thoroughly remove plaque and also they are not 100% successful because of various anatomic features, crowding and tooth alignment in the arch. These limitations on home oral care practices suggest the need for other strategies.</p><p>Many of the chemical antiplaque agents in various formulations have been tried as adjunct to mechanical measures for improving oral health. Many of the reviews have supported the feasibility of chemical approach in the control of plaque formation, thereby aiding individuals in achieving acceptable gingival status.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] These antiplaque agents can be delivered in the form of mouthwashes, dentifrices, chewing gums, gels and chips. Mouthwashes, a safe and effective delivery system for antimicrobials, can play an important role in plaque reduction.</p><p>Out of all the antiplaque agents, chlorhexidine is considered the gold standard agent for its clinical efficacy in chemical plaque control.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It has broad antibacterial activity, with very low toxicity and strong affinity for epithelial tissue and mucous membranes. Besides its antiplaque effect, chlorhexidine is substantive, thus reducing levels of microorganisms in saliva up to 90% for several hours. The use of chlorhexidine is burdened by some side-effects that could affect patient compliance. The most notable of these is the staining it produces,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] others being the alteration in taste and mucosal erosions, but these are less common.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Essential oil rinses have also been evaluated and shown to be of value as an adjunct to mechanical oral procedures. However, the alcohol content of essential oil rinses and their unpleasant taste is unacceptable to some patients. Thus none of these chemical agents is without shortcomings. So the search for an ideal and safe antiplaque agent continues.</p><p>An increasing number of people all around the world are turning to the nature by using the natural herbal products in both prophylaxis and treatment of different diseases. Plants are the source of more than 25% of prescription and over-the-counter preparations and the potential of natural agents for oral prophylaxis should therefore be considered. Green tea is one of these. Green tea is made solely with the leaves of <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. The most abundant components in green tea are polyphenols, in particular flavonoids such as the catechins, catechin gallates (Cg) and proanthocyanidins.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Many of the biological properties of green tea have been ascribed to the catechin fraction, which constitutes up to 30% of the dry leaf weight. These potent antioxidants comprise free catechins such as (+)-catechin, (+)-gallocatechin, (&#x02212;)-epicatechin and (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin and the galloyl catechins such as (&#x02212;)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), (&#x02212;)-Cg and (&#x02212;)-gallocatechin gallate. Green tea also contains carotenoids, tocopherols, ascorbic acid, minerals such as Cr, Mn, Se or Zn and certain phytochemical compounds. Various reported therapeutic and biological activities of catechin are lower incidences of various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease, strokes, obesity and cancer. These effects have been attributed, in part, to the antioxidative and free radical scavenging activities of the polyphenolic components of green tea.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Studies conducted in the past have shown that the green tea poly phenolic catechins, in particular (&#x02212;)-(EGCg) and (&#x02212;)-(ECg), can inhibit the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species with moderate potency. Evidence is emerging that these molecules may be useful in the control of common oral infections, such as dental caries and periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>A modest inverse association between the intake of green tea and periodontal disease has also been shown and the authors suggested that the application of concentrated green tea components, such as catechin may have a more beneficial effect on the periodontal condition.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Though the literature shows the biological activities of green tea, much research has not been cited regarding its use as an antiplaque agent and the data regarding comparative efficacy to chlorhexidine gluconate (the gold standard) is also not available. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine whether daily mouth rinsing with green tea catechin could have an effect as an antiplaque agent and to compare the antiplaque effectiveness of green tea catechin mouthwash with 0.12% of chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A single blinded cross-over study was conducted among 30 participants (students) of GND Dental College, Sunam from 1<sup>st</sup> March&#x02019; 2012 to 10<sup>th</sup> June&#x02019; 2012.

Scaling and root planning are effective in altering the flora and the green tea catechin has also been shown to be effective in altering the flora and acting as an adjunct to scaling and root planning.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, as well as many other disorders and it is believed that antioxidants can defend against inflammatory diseases.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similar mechanisms might be involved in the effects of the intake of green tea. Numerous health benefits of green tea and its constituents have been reported. It is a powerful antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory properties. Catechin was found to have antiplaque and antibacterial properties and contributed in caries prevention and gingival enhancement. Rasheed and Haider described the antibacterial effect of green tea catechins against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> bacteria and stated that catechins were of great value in reduction of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and caries prevalence.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The present study dealt with the antiplaque efficacy of 0.25% green tea catechin mouthwash and 0.12% chlorhexidine served as comparison. It was a short time study for 7 days only which was according to the studies done by Lotufo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Quirynen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who studied the efficacy of mouthrinses on <italic>de novo</italic> plaque formation over a period of 7 days and 11 days respectively. In this study, subjects were refrained from all types of adjunctive mechanical oral hygiene practices and only above two mouthwashes were used. To eliminate bias, a crossover design was planned between the subjects. The results of the present study as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>, showed that the green tea mouthwash has a comparable antiplaque effect over a 7 day period with gold standard chlorhexidine, which cannot be given for extended periods due to certain side effects. The plaque inhibitory effects can be attributed to the ability to remove dental plaque bacteria from teeth. Many of the biological properties of green tea have been ascribed to the catechin fraction, which is having certain therapeutic and biological properties. Cgs suchas ECg intercalate into phospholipid bilayers and it is likely that they effect both virulence and antibiotic resistance by perturbing the function of key processes associated with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It exerts inhibitory effect on <italic>S. mutans</italic> growth, which are mainly responsible for caries and gingivitis. Catechins found in green tea have marked effect on pH value of saliva and dental plaque and preserve it in normal range (7.2-7.4), which is not a favorable condition for <italic>S. mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] According to a pilot study conducted by Awadalla <italic>et al</italic>. in 2011, green tea has inhibitory effect on <italic>S. mutans</italic> count, gingival bleeding and acidic plaque.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A 4-week regimen of mouth washing with a dilute catechin solution reduced the mouth odor (halitosis) associated with periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It was subsequently established that tea catechins deodorized methyl mercaptan, the main cause of halitosis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The property of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> to adhere onto oral epithelial cells is strongly correlated with the cause of periodontal disease. In a study conducted by Sakanaka <italic>et al</italic>. in 1996, Cgs, especially EGCg (active at 250-500 &#x003bc;g/ml), inhibited growth and adherence of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> to buccal epithelial cells.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The number of adherent bacterial cells decreased in a dose dependent manner. They postulated that the underlying mechanism of adherence inhibition by tea polyphenols is the result of the binding of tea poluphenols to fimbria of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Hirasawa <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated bactericidal activity of green tea catechins at 1 mg/ml against species of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and found a significant reduction in markers of gingivitis after the use of a slow-release buccal delivery system applied over a period of 8 weeks.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Green tea catechin also has an inhibitory effect on collagenase activity, thus limiting tissue destruction. It significantly reduces the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in osteoblasts and also inhibits the formation of osteoclasts. Thus, EGCg may prevent alveolar bone resorption that occurs in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>A study by Kudva <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010 on local drug delivery of green tea catechin showed that there was significant reduction in pocket probing depth and reduction in the number of various periodontopathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium species</italic> and <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Green tea extract has numerous effects on periodontal pathogens and periodontal tissues. Greater the concentration of catechins better the health benefits. Hence the consumption of green tea in comparison to other beverages may be widely recommended.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] During this study, no side-effects were observed in any of the patient.</p><p>This is the study in which the antiplaque efficacy of a green tea catechin mouthwash has been tested and compared to chlorhexidine gluconate over a 7 day period. One shortcoming of this study is small sample size.
