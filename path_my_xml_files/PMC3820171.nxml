resistance training (PRT) integrated with foot and ankle compression on the gait ability
of post-stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Participants were randomly allocated to
two groups: the PRT group (n=14) and the control group (n=14). Subjects in the PRT group
received training for 30 minutes, five days per week, for a period of six weeks. Gait
ability was evaluated using the RsScan system. [Results] Use of PRT integrated with foot
and ankle compression resulted in significant improvements in temporal parameters (gait
velocity, step time, and double limb support) and spatial parameters (step length, stride
length, and heel-to- heel base of support). [Conclusion] Progressive resistance training
integrated with foot and ankle compression improved the gait ability of stroke patients.
These results suggest the feasibility and suitability of integration of PRT with foot and
ankle compression for individuals with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Progressive resistance training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hemiparesis, one of the most common impairments after stroke, contributes to limitation of

many patients cannot walk with sufficient speed, have to use a walking aid, or are

independence of daily living, has been reported by patients to be the most important goal
for rehabilitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, progressive resistance training (PRT) has been shown to be an effective way of
increasing strength in the neutrally-intact muscles of able-bodied individuals, provided
that training is performed with sufficient resistance, and it is appropriately
progressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the benefits
of PRT integrated with foot and ankle compression are becoming increasingly accepted and
employed in clinical settings. PRT exercises are typically performed with the feet fixed on
a stable object to generate compressive forces on the hip, knee, and ankle joints. PRT
integrated with foot and ankle compression has been shown to increase neuromuscular control
of the lower extremities of young athletes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many previous studies have investigated the effect of PRT on muscle activation of the lower
limbs of orthopedic patients, however, no study on the effects of integration of PRT with
foot and ankle compression on hemiplegic gait has been reported. The aim of this study was
to determine whether rehabilitation, delivered as PRT integrated with foot and ankle
compression, would increase the walking performance of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Baseline characteristics of each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PRT group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.3&#x000b1;7.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.1&#x000b1;8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since stroke onset (month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.2&#x000b1;5.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.3&#x000b1;6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.4&#x000b1;4.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.3&#x000b1;6.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.1&#x000b1;10.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.5&#x000b1;10.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>This study recruited 28 patients who were admitted to K hospital in Korea after being
diagnosed with stroke (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The subjects
understood the contents of the study and agreed to participation. The inclusion criteria
were as follows: a Brunnstrom stage higher or equal to stage 3; presence of hemiparesis
resulting from a single stroke that had occurred in the past six months; ability to
communicate and understand with a Mini-Mental Status Examination score of over 24 points; no
known musculoskeletal conditions that might have affected patients ability to walk safely
and repeatedly; and ability to walk 10 m, independently, with or without use of an assistive
device. All of the participants understood the purpose of this study and gave their written
informed consent before experimental involvement. The study was performed in compliance with
the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the local committee of the Institutional
Review Board of a university hospital.</p><p>PRT integrated with foot and ankle compression was performed in a sitting position, with
the paretic foot fixed on the pedal of a Leg Press Rehap exercise machine with pneumatic
resistance (pressure resistance 10 bar) (HUR, Finland). Participants were asked to fully
extend the paretic leg and then slowly flex the knee joint to 90 degrees of knee flexion.
Then they were asked to extend and slowly flex the knee joint to the starting position. PRT
integrated with foot and ankle compression was performed five times per week for six weeks.
Participants in the control group maintained routine activities, but did not participate in
any regular exercise programs. Training sessions started with a warm-up of four repetitions
of 25% of their individual 1-repetition maximum (1RM), followed by three sets (eight to 10
repetitions per set) performed at 70% of 1RM. Training intensity was adjusted weekly with
reassessments of 1RM. All exercise was performed individually and supervised by a physical
therapist. Prior to each session, participants' feedback regarding adverse effects, such as
post exercise pain and stiffness, were also considered in the progression of the
exercise.</p><p>Gait abilities were measured using an electrical walkway system (RsScan Ltd., German). The
system, which captures temporal and spatial gait parameters, consists of an 1.95 &#x000d7; 0.32&#x02005;m
instrumented mat with 16,384 embedded pressure sensitive sensors, arranged in a 48 &#x000d7; 576
grid, evenly spaced at 2.6-cm intervals. The data sampling rate was 500&#x02005;Hz. Data were input
to a computer and analyzed using gait analysis software (RsScan International). Subjects
were instructed to walk at a comfortable gait speed in all three trials. In order to
maintain gait speed on the mat, subjects initiated and terminated walking at a minimum of
3&#x02005;m from the start and end of the walkway. A verbal command was given to initiate walking
and one of the examiners accompanied the subject in order to prevent a fall during walking.
Step length, stride length, heel-to-heel base of support (H-H BOS), step time, double
support period, and gait velocity of the paretic leg were measured.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software. Tests for normality
were performed for all continuous variables. Pre- and post-intervention data were examined
using the paired t-test within each group of subjects and the independent t-test was used
for between-group comparisons. The level of statistical significance was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of the gait abilities of the PRT and control groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">PRT group</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step length (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.4&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.2&#x000b1;2.0*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.0&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.8&#x000b1;2.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stride length (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.0&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.1&#x000b1;1.2*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.5&#x000b1;1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.9&#x000b1;1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">H-H BOS (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.6&#x000b1;0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.3&#x000b1;0.6*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.8&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4&#x000b1;0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step time (sec) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.98&#x000b1;0.28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.83&#x000b1;0.07*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.06&#x000b1;0.06</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00&#x000b1;0.07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Double support (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.4&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.4&#x000b1;1.1*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.6&#x000b1;0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.3&#x000b1;0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gait velocity (m/s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.64&#x000b1;0.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.81&#x000b1;0.03*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.67&#x000b1;0.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.70&#x000b1;0.07</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* significant difference between pre- and post-test (p&#x0003c;0.05), &#x02020; significant

ankle compression on the gait ability of stroke patients. Our results demonstrate that PRT
integrated with foot and ankle compression is an effective form of training that improves
the functional mobility of stroke patients by improving their gait abilities. This type of
training can be actively utilized in physical therapy clinics.</p><p>Stroke patients have a characteristic gait pattern which shows a slow gait cycle and gait
speed, short stride length and stance phase on the affected side, and a relatively long
swing phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. During abnormal walking, a
shortened weight-supporting time of the lower extremity is usually seen on the affected
side, and balance control during gait becomes difficult due to a prolonged period of double
limb support, leading to a decline in energy efficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, regarding temporal parameters, significant
decreases in step time and double support time were observed in patients in the PRT group,
compared to the control group, and the gait velocity increased following training. Regarding
the spatial parameters, patients in the PRT group showed significant increases in step
length and stride length after the exercise, while the heel-to-heel base of support showed a
significant decrease.</p><p>It is possible that PRT integrated with foot and ankle compression helps to strengthen
lower limb muscles while simultaneously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
using the hip, knee, and ankle joints. This would therefore provide feedback from the entire
lower extremity, and increase stimulation of the mechanoreceptors around the joint and
firing of muscle spindles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, increased neuroplasticity and brain
reorganization in response to repeated PRT integrated with foot and ankle compression would
improve the gait function of stroke patients through motor re-learning.</p><p>PRT integrated with foot and ankle compression is one of the most important treatment
methods for enhancement functional ability. A limitation of this study was that subjects
with very good gait abilities and very bad gait abilities were excluded; therefore, its
results cannot be generalized to all stroke patients. In addition, the subjects' daily
living activities were not completely limited during the study period; therefore, the effect
of daily living activities on the change in gait ability observed cannot be completely
excluded.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Flansbjer</surname><given-names>UB</given-names></name><name><surname>Downham</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lexell</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Knee muscle strength, gait performance, and perceived
