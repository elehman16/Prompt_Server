This study examined whether participation in an online module on the differential diagnosis of dyspnoea impacts on student performance in a multiple choice examination of factual knowledge in cardiology and pneumology. A virtual problem-based learning environment for medical students supervised by postgraduate teachers was created. Seventy-four out of 183 fourth-year medical students volunteered to use the online module while attending a 6-week cardio-respiratory curriculum in summer 2007. Of these, 40 were randomly selected to be included (intervention group); the remaining 34 served as an internal control group. Analysis of all written exams taken during the preceding term showed that both groups were comparable (86.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1 vs. 85.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.751). Students in the intervention group scored significantly higher in the final course assessment than students allocated to the control group (84.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3 vs. 79.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006; effect size 0.67). Thus, additional problem-based learning with an online module as part of an undergraduate cardio-respiratory curriculum lead to higher students&#x02019; scores in an exam testing factual knowledge. Whether using this teaching format increases overall student motivation to engage in the learning process needs to be further investigated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Factual knowledge</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Multiple choice questions</kwd><kwd>Problem-based learning</kwd><kwd>Web-based learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The use of computers was introduced in medical education more than 40&#x000a0;years ago (Lipkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1961</xref>). Although computer-assisted instruction (CAI) would naturally lend itself to a more complex presentation of content matter (Tegtmeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>), early attempts mainly aimed at a linear transmission of knowledge. Since then, the developmental focus has moved from mere technical aspects to the design of software solutions suited for specific teaching objectives (Valcke and De Wever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to web-based learning (WBL) due to its flexible scheduling, economies of scale, ease in updating, and the potential for the delivery of individualized teaching using novel instructional methods (Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>).</p><p>The combination of WBL with a problem-based teaching format results in a virtual learning environment which can be expected to foster the structured acquisition of both knowledge and skills related to clinical reasoning (Hammoud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Kamin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>). Although WBL cannot replace bed-side teaching, the case studies presented in a WBL module should resemble real clinical settings as far as possible (Glick and Moore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>). A small number of studies suggest that collaborative learning via the internet is feasible and might yield advantages depending on the circumstances under which it is implemented (De Wever et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Kamin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>; Nathoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Stromso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2004</xref>; Taradi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Wehrs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). Regarding the acquisition of factual knowledge, previous studies did not detect an advantage of CAI over traditional teaching formats (Schwartz and Griffin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1993</xref>). However, the impact of participating in a problem-based WBL module on students&#x02019; gain of factual knowledge has not been studied in great detail.</p><p>This article describes students&#x02019; enrolment in and satisfaction with a newly set-up online module on the differential diagnosis of chronic shortness of breath. In addition, the students&#x02019; achievements in a multiple choice examination of factual knowledge were assessed with regard to their interest and participation in this online module.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of the online module</title><p>In summer 2007, 183 fourth-year medical students were given the opportunity to sign up for using and evaluating a collaborative online module while attending the six-week cardio-respiratory curriculum (blended learning) at G&#x000f6;ttingen University Hospital (Germany). A web-based learning management system (Clix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Information Multimedia Communication AG, Saarbr&#x000fc;cken, Germany) was used in order to facilitate asynchronous group discussions and the exchange of documents as suggested by previous studies (Spinello and Fischbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>). The module was created according to criteria outlined by Hilty et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>) and Greenhalgh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>). Postgraduate teachers who were specifically trained to assist the students using the module served as online tutors. Course content and the didactic concept underlying the online module were developed by the first author of this manuscript and subsequently discussed with respiratory specialists and faculty staff as recommended (Hudson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>); During the online module, students were asked to diagnose a 64-year old man who presented to his general practitioner with chronic shortness of breath. The differential diagnosis of shortness of breath is one of the learning objectives to be covered in the six-week cardio-respiratory curriculum. In order to find the correct diagnosis, students needed to have diagnostic procedures carried out on their virtual patient, the results of which were provided by their online tutors. In this regard, the online module did not represent true &#x0201c;problem-based learning&#x0201d; as defined by Barrows and Mitchell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1975</xref>). However, the module did comprise distinct steps towards the diagnosis: 
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>Step (1)</label><p>Information on the presenting complaint and past medical history of the patient was provided along with a table indicating costs for 46 standard diagnostic procedures in internal medicine. Students were asked to discuss the value of these procedures in the management of &#x0201c;their&#x0201d; patient and to choose three initial tests they thought most helpful for finding the correct diagnosis.

Due to a limitation of resources, participation in the module could only be offered to 40 students. Students who responded to the invitation were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (participation in the online module) or the control group (interest in the online module but no participation possible).</p><p>Students&#x02019; performance levels before entering the study were determined on the basis of scores achieved in written multiple choice exams taken in their previous semester (winter term 2006/07). For each student, an individual percent score (total number of correct answers/total number of questions asked in all written exams&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;100) was computed. On the last day of the six-week cardio-respiratory curriculum, all 183 students took a summative examination containing 68 multiple-choice questions assessing factual knowledge. These questions covered the whole range of cardiology and pneumology while the online module was focused on the differential diagnosis of chronic shortness of breath. Student achievements in the final multiple choice examination were compared between students in the intervention and the control group.</p><p>Students who had been assigned a place in the online module were asked to complete online questionnaires (EvaSys<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, ElectricPaper, L&#x000fc;neburg, Germany) on subject characteristics and attitudes towards computer-based learning in general and the new online module in particular. Personal agreement with specific statements was assessed using six-point Likert scales anchored by 1 (&#x0201c;fully agree&#x0201d;) and 6 (&#x0201c;completely disagree&#x0201d;) on the first and the last day of the six-week curriculum.</p><p>Data are presented as median&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SE of the mean.

While problem-based learning is primarily effective in promoting skills related to clinical reasoning (Norman and Schmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1992</xref>), it is also capable of imparting factual knowledge as has been shown in large cohort studies (Van der Vleuten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>). The present study investigated whether this effect of the teaching format is preserved when problem-based learning is transferred to a virtual environment. The two main findings were that students on a higher achievement level were more willing to explore innovative teaching formats and that students randomly allocated to using the online module scored significantly higher in a final multiple choice test than those who signed up but could not be allocated due to a lack of resources. Importantly, there was no difference in achievement level between the two groups before entering the study.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis reviewing a total of 201 published articles on the effectiveness of internet-based learning for students, postgraduate trainees and practitioners in a profession directly related to human or animal health concluded that, when compared to no intervention, internet-based interventions have large and significant effects on the acquisition of knowledge, skills and behaviours (Cook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). The effect size of 0.67 between achievements in the intervention and the control group found in our study population is well within the range of studies included in this systematic review. The primary outcome of most of these studies was matched to the original learning objective underlying the teaching intervention (Kern et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>); for examples see (Pederson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Sisson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>; Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>); thus the finding of a significant effect of internet-based learning over no intervention is not surprising. However, in our study we found a significant effect in knowledge increase even though final exam questions were not closely matched to the content of the online module, i.e., the module did not specifically prepare students for the final exam. Instead, it might have increased students&#x02019; motivation to learn about cardiology and pneumology in general since shortness of breath is a common presenting complaint in both disciplines.</p><p>Interestingly, motivation to use innovative teaching and learning formats has been identified as an important confounder in non-randomized trials (Hallgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). All 74 students signing up for the online module expressed their motivation by responding to the mailed invitation to participate. Thus it can be assumed that &#x02018;baseline motivation&#x02019; was comparable in the two groups. Although motivation was not formally assessed, it can be hypothesized that participation in the online module <italic>further</italic> increased student motivation to learn. This notion is corroborated by the fact that students in the intervention group spent an extra amount of time (almost 3&#x000a0;h per week) on the online module. This increase in learning time is within the range of findings from comparable WBL projects (Nathoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). The impact of web-assisted problem-based learning on overall learning motivation has not been studied in great detail and should be addressed in future trials as this aspect was not covered in the systematic review mentioned above (Cook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>).</p><p>Students&#x02019; self-assessment of knowledge and skills related to the management of dyspnea increased significantly over time; due to the lack of a completely randomized design with mutual exclusion of either web-based or contact teaching, the contribution of the online module to this increase cannot be measured. We cannot exclude an improvement in students&#x02019; rating on their self assessment for knowledge and diagnostic skills in the control group similar to the one observed in the intervention group since we only obtained self-assessments from members of the latter. In any case, the true impact of WBL on any of the learning objectives pursued by this teaching format (e.g., factual knowledge gain, clinical reasoning) can only be determined in prospective randomized trials (Letterie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Raupach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). However, media-comparative research is being heavily criticized due to methodological limitations (Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>) one of which has once again become apparent in this study: It might well be that only motivated students will benefit from using WBL modules. Thus, medical educators and students could face an ever-increasing demand for individualization regarding the teaching formats used to arrive at the desired outcome.</p><p>During the enrolment phase, female students showed greater interest in using the web-based learning module. This observation is surprising in view of the fact that women have previously been reported to be more hesitant regarding the use of computers (Broos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). However, this aspect needs to be addressed in future research since the present study was not designed to specifically assess gender aspects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study examined the effect of virtual collaborative learning in respiratory medicine on student achievements in a multiple choice test covering the whole range of cardiology and pneumology. Students randomly assigned to using the problem-based online module on the differential diagnosis of chronic shortness of breath scored higher in a test of factual knowledge than students not included in the study despite comparable achievement levels before entering the study. The online module is likely to have increased students&#x02019; motivation to learn, and subsequent learning was not restricted to the content of the online module. However, it remains to be elucidated whether all students would benefit from using innovative teaching and learning methods regardless of prior motivation. In addition, future research will have to further assess gender aspects related to computer-assisted learning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all tutors and students who devoted their time and effort to this study.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barrows</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An innovative course in undergraduate neuroscience.
