A recent systematic review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> of the effectiveness of structured education in kidney disease care identified only 22 randomised controlled trials (RCTs); and despite including only RCTs, methods generally were suboptimal, mainly because of poor reporting, small sample sizes, high dropout rates and inconsistency in the delivery of interventions. The interventions were aimed at predialysis and dialysis patients, with no interventions addressing early CKD (stages 1&#x02013;3) or BP control. More educational interventions are needed in early CKD to help prevent the progression of kidney disease, and a major recommendation from this review is that rigorous evaluation of such interventions is essential to establish effectiveness.</p><p>Pilot studies are an essential part of this process, and the importance of robust pilot work to progressively refine the design of a complex intervention before embarking on a definitive trial has been highlighted in the Medical Research Council's guidance framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> The importance of assessing acceptability is an essential part of this process because if people will not accept an intervention, testing its potential effectiveness could be regarded as irrelevant. To understand acceptability, we need to look more closely at who we are recruiting for studies and interventions to determine possible reasons as to why people will choose or decline to participate. We can then modify and adapt our approach accordingly to increase the likelihood of delivering an effective intervention.</p><p>This pilot RCT (Controlling Hypertension: Education and Empowerment Renal Study (CHEERS)) involved a structured educational intervention, involving a group session, to improve self-management of BP in people with CKD (stages 1&#x02013;4). The aims were to assess the acceptability of the intervention for a definitive trial to ascertain the effectiveness of the intervention for lowering BP and other cardiovascular risk factors and, if positively evaluated at pilot level, the intention was to further test the intervention in a definitive RCT comparing standard clinical care for BP management with standard care supplemented by the structured group intervention. The objectives of the study were as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To assess recruitment and retention rates for a definitive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess patient satisfaction with the proposed intervention to inform the design for a definitive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To increase our understanding of how to recruit patients more effectively by collating reasons given by patients declining to take part in the study and by exploring the characteristics of these patients compared to those patients who agreed to take part.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To increase our understanding of how to retain and engage patients more effectively by exploring the characteristics of the patients failing to attend the group session compared to those patients who attended the session.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the potential effectiveness of the proposed intervention on BP control and other cardiovascular risk factors for a definitive RCT.</p></list-item></list><p>The current paper focuses on patient acceptability of the proposed intervention with regard to recruitment, retention and patient satisfaction and the implications of these findings for the design of complex interventions for people with kidney disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants, settings and location</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committee (Ref: 06/Q2502/4), and participants were recruited from nephrology outpatients clinics at a single study centre (Renal Department, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UK). Patients with CKD (stages 1&#x02013;4) had been referred (in line with clinical practice guidelines at the time) to secondary care for investigation and management of declining renal function. Patient invitations and information sheets were sent out prior to clinic visits, at which patients were approached by the study nurse to be consented for the study.</p><p>Suitable participants were identified for inclusion in the study if they had impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (<sub>e</sub>GFR) &#x0003c;90&#x02005;ml/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup>) and sustained hypertension defined as BP above the recommended target (130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02002;Hg if no proteinuria and 125/75 if proteinuria present) at two or more readings taken at clinic visits in the previous 6&#x02005;months. Target BP was defined in accordance with the UK Renal Association's CKD guidelines, which were the current guidelines at the time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Pregnant women, patients unable to speak English, patients with end-stage kidney failure, patients unable to give informed consent and patients aged &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years were excluded as the educational intervention was not designed to meet their needs.</p></sec><sec><title>The study interventions</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The control group received standard clinical management of hypertension. This involved participants being seen by a doctor in the outpatient clinic or by their general practitioner for measurement and management of BP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention group received the structured CHEERS patient education intervention plus routine standard care as above.</p></list-item></list><p>After randomisation, the patients assigned to the CHEERS educational intervention received a leaflet on the management of hypertension. This was intended as a preparatory component to the education session so that participants would have some knowledge of high BP and be able to contribute to the facilitated discussions that would form the major part of the teaching in the educational intervention.</p><p>Initial development of the CHEERS intervention involved identifying a suitable theoretical framework to structure the intervention and the use of key findings from preliminary focus groups to involve both patients and health professionals in developing the content and design. Participants from the patient focus group identified a need for basic knowledge with a particular emphasis on explaining the link between kidney disease and hypertension. Patients also wanted more information about medication, diet and other ways of controlling BP. Health professionals pointed to the need for patients to understand risks, targets and the importance of taking medications. Patients felt that participating in a group such as the focus group had in itself allowed them to share experiences and provided support and motivation. They also cited the usefulness of having an experienced health professional as a key contact with whom they could build a relationship and from whom they could obtain ongoing positive support. These key findings and evidence were used to structure a written curriculum that would form the basis of the educational intervention.</p><p>The written curriculum was developed to guide the facilitator and to ensure consistency of delivery between education sessions, and a resource folder was created to help participants consolidate their knowledge and improve their self-management skills. The CHEERS curriculum involved the following modules: Blood Pressure and Me; Fact-Finding; How to Control Your BP; Setting, Achieving and Maintaining Goals; and Summary and Take Home Message. The modules were based on social cognitive theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and incorporated a knowledge element to give patients the necessary information that they needed to know how to effectively self-manage their BP, and a psychological element that involved teaching and encouraging skills, such as goal setting, that were likely to improve the confidence and motivation needed for effective self-management. More information on the CHEERS intervention is available as an online supplementary file. Social cognitive theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> was identified as being particularly relevant and inclusive in terms of meeting the needs of the project that involved self-management education to change health behaviour.</p><p>The intervention was delivered in a group format (two to six participants) in a single session lasting 2.5&#x02005;h. Each participant was scheduled to take part in a session within 3&#x02005;months of randomisation. They were allowed to bring a friend/relative for support. Eight groups were facilitated by the study nurse who had had previous experience of offering lifestyle advice to patients and who had been observed in a pilot run of the CHEERS education session by two independent nurses to ensure effective facilitation and engagement of participants in line with the curriculum. All sessions took place in an education centre located at the hospital. This location was chosen as it offered excellent facilities for teaching and a pleasant environment away from the main hospital where participants attended their clinic reviews. Following the education session, all patients were offered access to further support from the study nurse, and reminder letters were sent out 6&#x02005;months later detailing the goals that each participant has identified in the education session. The additional support was included based on a key finding from the focus groups so that the participants had access (if needed) to a key contact who could offer positive ongoing verbal support and advice via the telephone. If participants failed to attend a session, they received a telephone reminder; if they failed to attend for a second time, no further contact was made.</p><p>The different components of the CHEERS educational intervention and the evidence base<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6 b7 b8">6&#x02013;8</xref> for their inclusion are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Components and evidence for the CHEERS educational intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Component</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evidence</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A leaflet on BP control was sent to participants prior to the educational intervention to prepare them for a group discussion.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preparatory information has been used in a previous successful group education intervention (involving one session) for predialysis patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single group educational session (lasting 2.5&#x02005;h) involving facilitated informal discussion, problem-solving activities and sharing of experiences to work through modules that would equip the participants with the necessary knowledge to be able to self-manage their BP.

A simple &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;, &#x02018;No&#x02019; and &#x02018;Not Sure&#x02019; format was used to encourage the participants to answer all the questions and to provide a basic overview of how satisfied patients were with the intervention. In addition, for each question, participants were asked for any comments to provide a more detailed assessment of patient satisfaction. Forms were completed anonymously so that patients would be more likely to give honest feedback.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Evaluation form to assess patient satisfaction with educational session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000381fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Patient access of additional support</title><p>The number of patients accessing the additional support offered was also recorded to ascertain whether this was an effective strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Recruited patients were randomly allocated to each of the study groups on a 1:1 basis in blocks of six to ensure similarity of numbers in each group.

The main reasons cited for non-participation were lack of interest in a patient education session for BP control (44% of those who declined) and the time commitment required to participate (48%). For those approached who did not meet the inclusion criteria (9%), an inability to converse in English was the main reason for exclusion.

We experienced difficulty with recruitment and retention because patients lacked interest and were reluctant to commit the time to attend a group session, particularly if the patient was older or had a lower self-efficacy level.</p><p>Small sample sizes and high dropout rates are recognised problems for the evaluation and delivery of educational interventions in kidney care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Previous studies have involved multiple education sessions that required a large time commitment from patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> We had aimed to maximise participation, by keeping time commitment to a minimum with just one session supplemented by telephone support. However, our findings suggest that a group education session in addition to normal clinic visits did not engage the majority of our patients.</p><p>The main reasons given by the patients for not wanting to be recruited to the study were a lack of interest and time. Many patients approached for the study demonstrated evidence of confusion; they did not acknowledge that they had a significant problem with their kidneys or BP; therefore, they did not perceive the need for any education. Confusion and negative feelings among patients have been reported in qualitative studies looking at the experiences of people with hypertension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10 b11 b12">10&#x02013;12</xref> and diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>We also previously conducted a focus group study in people with CKD, which showed that patient confusion and negative feelings were key issues for BP control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Specifically, lack of basic knowledge appeared to contribute strongly to confusion and higher levels of confusion appeared to correlate with negative attitudes towards patient empowerment and education. This qualitative study suggested the need for appropriate education and support to increase knowledge and motivation to overcome the confusion and negativity expressed. However, the findings from the current study suggest that if education and support is offered as a patient choice, then many patients are unlikely to take up this option because they are not able to perceive the benefits. Even for those people who did participate in the education session and who had indicated that they had enjoyed the session and found it beneficial, allowing patient choice for the additional continued support following the session resulted in none of these participants contacting the study nurse. Continued support is an essential component of effective behavioural change, but the support offered in the current study failed to be accessed by the participants and as a result there were no significant improvements in BP control or any other cardiovascular risk factors (further details of these results are available from the author). The reason why the additional support was not accessed is not clear, but the participants failed to see the need for it.</p><p>Patient confusion in people with CKD is a key factor in the management of BP that needs to be addressed at the earliest opportunity to prevent negative attitudes and to increase interest in empowerment and education. The new NHS Health Checks launched recently by the Department of Health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> aimed at identifying those people at risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke and CKD may offer a strong opportunity to address this issue and promote more general awareness about CKD.</p><p>In contrast, in diabetes education, researchers have successfully recruited and retained participants in their group education programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> A culture of patient empowerment and education is well established in diabetes care as part of routine care, evidenced by the fact that people with diabetes appear to be more motivated to take part in educational interventions.</p><p>Men were significantly easier to recruit than women. This difference may be due to the fact that many of the women commented that they had family commitments and did not feel that they could spare the additional time for the education session. Time commitment in general was a major reason that people gave for not taking part in the study. This issue is important for designing an effective educational intervention. Either the education has to take place during normal clinic visits and be structured so that it is not seen as an &#x02018;optional extra&#x02019; or a format is required that allows patients to access education at their own convenience (eg, using information technology).</p><p>Recruiting patients from ethnic minority backgrounds to take part in research can be difficult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> In this study, there were no significance differences found for ethnicity regarding the recruitment and retention of patients. However, it must be acknowledged that there were relatively low numbers of ethnic minority patients and people without English language skills were excluded.</p><p>The participants who failed to attend for the education session were significantly older and had lower levels of self-efficacy when compared to the people who did attend. It could be speculated that the group format for people with CKD was intimidating for older people who may be unfamiliar with this type of education and for those with less confidence as it demands interaction with other patients. In the evaluation, one older participant commented that he had been anxious about attending the group session and it could be surmised that this was a reason why so many people failed to attend. Although we have no direct evidence for this, other reasons for the high dropout rate may have been related to parking and transport issues despite reimbursement of costs.</p><p>The current pilot study was established as a robust evaluation of recruitment, retention and patient satisfaction for a definitive trial and employed appropriate randomisation procedures so that the evaluation took place under controlled conditions. A weakness of the study is that the blinding procedures for group allocation post-randomisation were limited due to the open nature of the study and because of practical reasons, which meant that the evaluator was aware of group allocation as they were also involved in data collection and entry and were responsible for delivering the education session. The evaluation form for assessing patient satisfaction was also limited as we received very few additional comments to allow a more detailed assessment. On reflection, the form contained too many closed questions, which limited the responses and a number of the questions needed to be reworded so that it was more clear what was being asked. However, as a pilot evaluation of a structured group educational intervention for people with CKD, the current study has highlighted the importance of in-depth evaluations of recruitment and retention in order to increase our understanding of how to engage patients more effectively and design better educational interventions. The current study showed that the structured group intervention in its current format is not effective as we failed to recruit and retain patients and the support that was offered was insufficient for our patients' needs.</p><p>The message that emerges from this pilot study is that before effective education can take place, people need to be much more aware of kidney disease as an entity and its implications for health. Time needs to be spent to foster a culture of patient empowerment in people with kidney disease in order to encourage more interest in education. A system is needed whereby education and continued support are an intrinsic part of routine care for people with CKD. This would help to create a culture of education and empowerment that is currently lacking for these patients. This strategy could also promote the recruitment of people with early kidney disease in clinical research as they would have a greater understanding of their condition.</p><p>Measuring self-efficacy levels is an important part of the process for developing an effective educational intervention. Self-efficacy has been shown to be one of the most consistent predictors of successful self-care behaviour and has been incorporated into most health psychology models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Educational interventions will probably work best if education is tailored to take this into account so that additional help and support can be given if required. By identifying those people who lack motivation and confidence, additional help and support could be targeted much more effectively. A possible strategy would be to target resources on training healthcare professionals to use validated questionnaires during clinic consultations to help them to assess levels of self-efficacy more effectively. This could lead to better use of limited resources and potentially improve the effectiveness of educational interventions for people with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000381-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e741" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e154" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000381.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e155" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000381.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Byrne J, Khunti K, Stone M, <italic>et al</italic>.
