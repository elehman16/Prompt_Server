The approach aims to enhance daily functioning through increased psychological flexibility. Whilst the therapeutic model behind ACT appears well suited to chronic pain, there is a need for further research to test its effectiveness in clinical practice, particularly with regards to combining ACT with physical exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This prospective, two-armed, parallel-group, single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT programme, in comparison to supervised exercise for chronic pain. One hundred and sixty patients, aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with a chronic pain condition by a physician will be recruited to the trial. Participants will be individually randomised to one of two 8-week, group interventions. The combined group will take part in weekly psychology sessions based on the ACT approach, in addition to supervised exercise classes led by a physiotherapist. The control group will attend weekly supervised exercise classes but will not take part in an ACT programme. The primary outcome will be pain interference at 12-week follow-up, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference Scale. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported pain severity, self-perception of change, patient satisfaction, quality of life, depression, anxiety and healthcare utilisation. Treatment process measures will include self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, fear avoidance, pain acceptance and committed action. Physical activity will be measured using Fitbit Zip<sup>TM</sup> activity trackers. Both groups will be followed up post intervention and again after 12 weeks. Estimates of treatment effects at follow-up will be based on an intention-to-treat framework, implemented using a linear mixed-effects model. Individual and focus group qualitative interviews will be undertaken with a purposeful sample of participants to explore patient experiences of both treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to examine whether combining exercise with ACT produces greater benefit for patients with chronic pain, compared to a standalone supervised exercise programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03050528">NCT03050528</ext-link>.

The economic burden is significant, with a recent survey in Ireland estimating the total cost of treating chronic pain at &#x020ac;5.34 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This survey of 1204 Irish people also reported that health-related quality of life was significantly lower in people with chronic pain compared to people without pain, and that depression was significantly higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Chronic pain has been defined as an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage, which persists for over 3 months&#x02019; duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The multidimensional nature of chronic pain presents significant challenges for patients and healthcare professionals. There is a plethora of treatment options available but the effects of these interventions on pain and disability are modest and improvements are typically short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Traditional biomedical interventions, such as surgery and spinal injections, have not been shown to be superior to conservative treatments for chronic pain and they carry greater risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Exercise interventions and psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are examples of conservative treatments that are known to be effective for patients with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These interventions can be provided individually or they can be effectively combined in the form of a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Physical activity is an important outcome to target with chronic pain interventions, as in addition to the physical limitations imposed by pain, there are strong associations with cardio-metabolic and respiratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Exercise, including aerobic, strengthening and aquatic exercise has been shown to reduce pain and improve physical function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but the quality of the evidence is low and further studies with larger samples are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. No particular type of exercise has been shown to be superior to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and research suggests that group-based physiotherapy interventions incorporating exercise are just as effective for pain and disability as individual treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patient adherence to treatment should be promoted by providing individualised exercises within supervised programmes, and supplementing with home exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">There is a large evidence base related to psychological treatments for chronic pain, with CBT being the dominant intervention. A Cochrane review concluded that CBT has small to moderate effects on pain, disability, mood and catastrophising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The authors noted that whilst there have been improvements in the methodological quality of studies in recent years, there has been no change in the overall effects of the interventions and they recommend against further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of CBT.</p><p id="Par21">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychological therapy that encourages participants to change their relationship with their thoughts and physical sensations through mechanisms of acceptance, mindfulness and value-based action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Systematic reviews of RCTs featuring ACT for adults with chronic pain have reported that ACT is effective for enhancing general function and decreasing distress, compared to inactive treatment comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One RCT included in these reviews compared ACT with CBT and found no significant differences in improvement between the two treatments; however, greater levels of satisfaction were reported by the ACT participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Another RCT reported equivalent reductions in pain and disability with ACT, when compared with applied relaxation for chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Whilst there is growing evidence to support the effectiveness of ACT, it has been acknowledged that there are currently only a small number of high-quality studies and further RCTs have been recommended, in particular with active treatment comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">There are currently no RCTs that have examined the effectiveness of exercise combined with ACT for chronic pain. Furthermore, in the RCTs published to date, ACT as a standalone therapy has not been shown to be effective in enhancing physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. When CBT and ACT were compared for chronic pain, no significant improvement in physical activity was observed for either psychological approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the authors suggest that tailored interventions, with greater emphasis on exercise, may complement psychological treatment for chronic pain. To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT intervention for chronic pain.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research objectives</title><p id="Par23">The primary objective is to determine whether a combined Exercise and ACT group-based intervention is effective for reducing pain interference at 12-week follow-up, in patients with chronic pain, compared to a physiotherapy-led supervised exercise programme.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par24">

The classes will be delivered by a physiotherapist and will feature two components: (1) education/advice and (2) exercise (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The education/advice sessions will be interactive and will take the form of group discussions of approximately 30-min duration, covering topics such as goal-setting, understanding pain, physical activity and pacing. The physiotherapist will answer questions and facilitate discussion related to relevant issues that the participants bring to the group. The exercise sessions will take place in either a pool or a gym setting (four sessions of each). The aquatic sessions will include a warm up, gentle aerobic exercise, buoyancy-assisted and resisted movements, and informal ball games. The gym programme will feature a combination of gentle aerobic exercise, stretches and strengthening exercises. The specific exercises will be chosen by the physiotherapist and examples will include, but will not be limited to: cycling on a static bike and treadmill walking, pulleys, sit to stands, step-ups, wall squats, wall press-ups, seated flexion, trunk rotation in standing, knee rolling/trunk rotation on plinth, bridging, knees to chest. The exercise programmes will be individualised, based on each participant&#x02019;s personal goals and a written exercise programme, compiled by the physiotherapist will be provided. The programmes will be progressed and modified for each individual as deemed appropriate by the physiotherapist. Participants will be encouraged to carry out their exercises at home or in their local pool. Throughout the aquatic and gym exercise sessions, there will be an emphasis on reducing threat and fear of movement. The physiotherapist will encourage improved physical activities in a manner that gradually increases physical function and enhances enjoyment of physical activity. The physiotherapist leading the supervised exercise programmes will have over 7 years of experience treating patients with chronic pain, including the delivery of group exercise programmes to patients with similar conditions to the trial participants.

We have endeavoured to address recommendations that have been made to enhance the quality of research in the field of ACT, including choice of outcome measures and comparison to an active control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The inclusion of objective measurement of physical activity, using wearable activity trackers is novel in this field of research and highly relevant, considering the prevalence of co-morbidities in chronic pain patients. The inclusion criteria for the study are broad, in recognition that chronic pain is a heterogeneous condition, and with the aim of maximising the generalisability of the findings. Through the embedded qualitative study, we aim to provide insight into patients&#x02019; experiences and views of the interventions.</p><p id="Par85">There are a number of limitations inherent in this trial of what have been termed &#x02018;complex interventions&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], most prominently concerning the inability to blind study participants and clinicians to treatment allocation. We have attempted to address issues of additional biases as far as has been practically possible through the provision of randomisation and concealment of allocation, strategies to minimise and manage incomplete outcome data, assessment of intervention fidelity, an adequate sample size with appropriate duration of follow-up and a priori specification of all primary and secondary outcomes as detailed in this study protocol.</p><p id="Par86">To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT intervention for chronic pain. The study results will add to current knowledge in the field of chronic pain management and will have the potential to inform the delivery of effective treatments for patients.</p><sec id="Sec50"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par87">This trial is currently recruiting participants. It is anticipated that recruitment will be ongoing until the end of 2018.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec51"><p>
