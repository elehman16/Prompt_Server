Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 160 mg oral enzalutamide or placebo once daily. Randomization was stratified according to study site. Treatment was discontinued for occurrence of unacceptable side effects, or until confirmed radiographic progression or a skeletal-related event and the initiation of cytotoxic therapy or an investigational agent for prostate cancer.</p><p>Estimates of the medians and 95% CIs were determined using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method.

In this follow-up analysis of Japanese patients, with an additional 9 months of data, including 5 months of data after 17 of 33 placebo-treated patients in the open-label extension crossed over to enzalutamide, enzalutamide reduced the risk of death by 35% (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28&#x02013;1.51; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="hyw187F1">1</xref>A). Median OS was not yet reached (NYR) in enzalutamide-treated patients (95% CI, 26.6 months&#x02014;NYR) and NYR in placebo-treated patients (95% CI, 17.8 months&#x02014;NYR). An exploratory analysis of investigator-assessed rPFS was also performed based on a 15 January 2014 data cutoff (at 929 events in the overall population). Enzalutamide reduced the risk of investigator-assessed radiographic progression or death by 60% (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18&#x02013;0.90; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="hyw187F1">1</xref>B). Median rPFS was NYR in enzalutamide-treated patients (95% CI, 11.1 months&#x02014;NYR) and 5.7 months in placebo-treated patients (95% CI, 1.9 months&#x02014;NYR).
