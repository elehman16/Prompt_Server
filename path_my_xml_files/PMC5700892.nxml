Some wounds of mixed etiology, e.g., burns and diabetic foot ulcers, are treated with meshed skin grafts (MSGs), which are a standard procedure for coverage of wounds because of their ease of harvest, applicability and resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, MSGs are very sensitive, and can be lost completely or partially if they do not grow properly into the underlying tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Complete graft loss is the worst possible outcome. The grafting process must be repeated, reducing patient quality of life, increasing the workload for healthcare professionals, and increasing treatment costs. The loss of MSGs can be due to many factors with infection being one of the most prominent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">All wounds contain bacteria, but that does not mean that they are clinically infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is a continuum in wound infection ranging from contamination to colonization and ultimately infection, with different necessities of medical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Understanding this sequence and using the right treatment is key to wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The presence of low counts of bacteria with no apparent negative effect on wound healing has also been described for MSGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Control of microbiological colonization and prevention of infection is vital and requires antimicrobial management and adequate wound dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The worldwide change of pathogen characteristics, mainly induced by antibiotic overuse, is leading to a global increase of resistant pathogens. Therefore, antiseptic use is considered necessary to reserve antibiotics for indications where they are really needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Iodine has been used in wound treatment for more than 150&#x000a0;years. Povidone&#x02013;iodine (PVP&#x02013;I) has been popular since its discovery in 1955 because of its broad anti-microbial spectrum, versatility in wound treatment and lack of microbial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, cell viability has been demonstrated at bactericidal concentrations of PVP&#x02013;I in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suggesting that it may not inhibit the wound healing process, unlike many other antiseptic solutions. The incorporation of PVP&#x02013;I into liposomes was found to be very beneficial. PVP&#x02013;I in a hydrogel base (PVP&#x02013;ILH, hydrosome) combines the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the antiseptic with the drug delivery and moisturizing properties of the liposomes and the hydrogel, thus presenting an innovative approach for wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Paraffin gauze dressing is a standard skin graft dressing as it promotes more rapid and complete re-epithelization and is less painful than dry fine mesh gauze dressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies assessing non-infected skin grafts showed specific differences in wound healing depending on the antiseptic and dressing/formulation employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PVP&#x02013;I ointment did not impede wound healing in a study of non-infected MSGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In some cases, it may be necessary to perform transplantation on already infected wounds (e.g., burn patients with fluid loss), or MSGs may become clinically infected subsequent to grafting, both of which will inhibit the speed and quality of wound healing and increase the risk of graft loss. Infected MSGs have not been assessed in clinical studies. The focus of this exploratory assessment is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of PVP&#x02013;ILH (Repithel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; RepiGel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and PVP&#x02013;I ointment (Betaisodona<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; BETADINE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in a &#x0201c;satellite group&#x0201d; of patients with infected MSGs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical Study</title><p id="Par13">Patients were enrolled into a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, pilot Phase II study, conducted between November 1997 and March 1999 at a single plastic surgery clinic in Germany. The study was conducted in accordance with ICH GCP, adhering to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 1996. The Ethics Committee of the Landesaerztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz reviewed and approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment.</p><p id="Par14">Male and female patients aged over 18&#x000a0;years with meshed split-thickness skin grafts transplanted to various full-thickness wounds were enrolled after written consent. Specifically excluded were patients with alcohol, medication or drug abuse, hyperthyreosis or other thyroid disease, and dermatitis herpetiformis during or 4&#x000a0;weeks before or after radioiodine therapy or before nuclear medical diagnostics. Patients with non-infected MSGs were randomized to treatment with 3% PVP&#x02013;ILH or chlorhexidine gauze as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and are subsequently not discussed here. An exploratory satellite group of patients with infected MSGs were randomized to treatment with 3% PVP&#x02013;ILH or 10% PVP&#x02013;I ointment and are the focus of this paper. Patients were randomized using blocking methodology according to patient number, allocated sequentially as patients were enrolled into the study.</p><p id="Par15">Infection was based on clinical assessment of the wound/graft and classical signs of infection (redness, heat, swelling, pain) and more specifically in wound healing on what was then understood to be critical colonization and the symptoms summarized as NERDS (including, e.g., non-healing and excessive exudation). Since the inclusion of patients with infected MSGs was a small exploratory part of the study, there were no specific inclusion criteria regarding the type or size of infection, and the group was heterogenous in nature. Some patients already had clinically frank wound-bed infections at the time of grafting, and the grafting day coincided with the start of treatment due to medical reasons. In other patients, the infection occurred at different intervals (up to 4&#x000a0;days) after grafting and the start of the healing process. Application of study medication started immediately following diagnosis of the skin graft infection. In both treatment groups, study medication was applied in a 2-mm continuous layer. A paraffin gauze and a tie-over dressing were placed on top. Dressing changes with identical application of study medication took place daily until the next operation (or healing, if applicable). Patients were followed-up until wound closure, which occurred by Day 12 for all patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measurement of Epithelialization and Microbiological Assessment</title><p id="Par16">The epithelialization of the mesh holes on skin grafts was assessed by photoplanimetry (standardized photos, observer-blind differentiation by computer-aided measurements between epithelialized and non-epithelialized surface areas defined by colorization and the calculation of re-epithelialization per time), which was performed every 2&#x000a0;days as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

MSGs are very sensitive with almost a quarter lost, mainly due to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of excessive amounts of bacteria in open skin wounds is a major challenge to graft take and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Few studies have been published on how to treat clinically infected MSGs. Consequently, part of the present study was performed to assess the efficacy of PVP&#x02013;ILH versus PVP&#x02013;I in patients with infected MSGs.</p><p id="Par26">MSGs can easily be analysed objectively, e.g., by photometric assessment, and subjectively by health care professionals and patients. However, in some cases, such as burn wounds covering large total body surface areas (TBSAs) and chronic wounds, the results must be interpreted with caution, as these may represent more complex wound healing settings.</p><p id="Par27">In our study, both PVP&#x02013;ILH and PVP&#x02013;I ointment performed remarkably well towards lowering the bacterial burden in infected MSG wounds; thus, enabling healing. PVP&#x02013;I ointment showed excellent antibacterial efficacy with no detectable microorganisms by Day 10, and rapid wound healing (mean 90% re-epithelialization by Day 6). PVP&#x02013;ILH also demonstrated impressive wound healing capability (mean 72% re-epithelialization by Day 6), especially considering the initial wound size (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with a trend towards improved subjective measures of wound healing quality. The greater antibacterial efficacy observed with PVP&#x02013;I ointment is likely to be due to the higher iodine content (10%) compared with PVP&#x02013;ILH (3%), which may become relevant in the case of a massive infection. The antimicrobial effect of PVP&#x02013;I enabling wound healing is probably further supported by the liposomal hydrogel in the PVP&#x02013;ILH group. The high efficacy of PVP&#x02013;I ointment against a broad spectrum of bacteria over the 10-day course of our study reflects the results of previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">PVP&#x02013;I has been compared to other antiseptics and has performed remarkably well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This was highlighted in published studies in various non-infected skin grafts (mainly donor sites), that represent frequently used model wounds.</p><p id="Par29">Chlorhexidine dressing, despite being highly effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, does not perform as well as PVP&#x02013;ILH in terms of re-epithelialization rate and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and has additional disadvantages, such as adhesion to wound surfaces and pain from the irritation caused by this dressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Octenidine dihydrochloride has significantly lowered bacterial count of skin graft donor sites but has failed to reduce the time to wound closure versus inert dressing (with a trend for inert dressing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Silver dressings also do not differentiate against established treatment on a clinical level (time to wound closure, graft loss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and have been shown to be poorly tolerated by skin graft patients in terms of pain scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent randomized, double-blind, controlled study in full-thickness grafts showed no effect of polyhexanide-soaked dressings on postoperative bacterial loads and increased risk of surgical site infections compared with inert dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, PVP&#x02013;I has shown a highly bactericidal effect with earlier onset of healing than inert dressing in MSG recipient sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This makes the results of enhanced wound healing in MSG recipient sites, both against chlorhexidine gauze and inert paraffin gauze, noteworthy. It should be considered that not only the antiseptic but also the dressing contributes to a good overall result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">No delay in wound healing time of 10% PVP&#x02013;I ointment (compared with simple vaseline gauze) has been found in split skin graft patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while 3% PVP&#x02013;ILH even enhanced wound healing in non-infected MSGs compared to chlorhexidine and simple paraffin gauze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Slightly accelerated wound healing, no infection and good local tolerance has been observed in an early study in donor sites for PVP&#x02013;I solution versus dry and moist cotton gauze as well as two other antiseptics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This small, early study also demonstrated the advantage of moist wound healing. Overall, these observations are in agreement with recent in vitro results showing lower cytotoxicity of PVP&#x02013;I compared to other antiseptics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and reviews of iodine in wound care concluding that PVP&#x02013;I does not impair wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Our data in infected MSGs extend these findings, with both PVP&#x02013;I ointment and PVP&#x02013;ILH showing fast re-epithelialization, with favorable assessments of healing by the treating physician. Consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we found no evidence of an effect of PVP&#x02013;I ointment (or PVP&#x02013;ILH) on healthy thyroid function.</p><p id="Par32">As detailed in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref>&#x0201d;, the issue of transplant loss during treatment is of particular clinical relevance. None of the four patients with infected MSGs who received PVP&#x02013;I ointment in our study experienced graft loss, which can likely be attributed to the pronounced antimicrobial efficacy of the PVP&#x02013;I ointment. Partial graft loss involving small areas occurred in four patients (40%) in the PVP&#x02013;ILH group; however, it must be considered that our study population already had clinically frank graft infections at the time of treatment. In the previously reported group of non-infected MSGs, only 5% of patients treated with PVP&#x02013;ILH suffered transplant loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The results of this study have their limitations because of the low number of patients with infected MSGs included in this satellite group and the treatment group disparity; in total, 10 patients received PVP&#x02013;ILH and 4 patients received PVP&#x02013;I ointment. As this was only a satellite group of patients with infected MSGs, recruitment was terminated when the main part of the study in patients with non-infected MSGs was completed, which, combined with the blocking method of randomization used, resulted in treatment group imbalance. The interpretation and applicability of the results is also confounded by the heterogeneity of the satellite group, attributable to the different time points at which infection had occurred in relation to the time of grafting. This made patients difficult to compare in terms of the main criterion of photoplanimetry because a certain degree of re-epithelialization may have taken place before treatment started, meaning that the baseline point did not lie uniformly at Day 0. While the photoplanimetry assessments were objective, assessments of wound healing by the physician and patient were subjective and unvalidated. However, no validated metrics exist for assessing infected MSGs, and our methods were intended to give at least an indication of the success of the procedure, while subjective assessment adds valuable information not easily obtainable from objective parameters. The <italic>p</italic> values obtained from the statistical analyses can only be considered exploratory due to the small sample size in this satellite group of patients with infected MGSs.</p><p id="Par34">Future studies must therefore focus on recruiting more eligible patients to better elucidate the effects of PVP&#x02013;ILH and PVP&#x02013;I in infected MSGs. Additional microbial assessments (e.g., on Days 6 and 8) could help better understand the removal kinetics of prevalent infecting bacteria. This may generate valuable information for health care practitioners and give an insight into existing clinical data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">In conclusion, our results in infected MSGs show a trend for more effective bacterial removal and more rapid re-epithelialization (by physician assessment and photoplanimetry) with 10% PVP&#x02013;I ointment, which may be the initial treatment of choice for infected MSGs. Liposomal 3% PVP&#x02013;I hydrogel achieved better scores in subjective assessments of quality of wound healing, and may be preferred as a dressing for non-infected MSGs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/196CF0602C493233">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/196CF0602C493233</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Sponsorship for this study and article processing charges were funded by Mundipharma Research GmbH &#x00026; Co.KG.
