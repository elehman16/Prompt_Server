In early cohort studies, up to 40% of patients with T1D developed macroalbuminuria (AER &#x02265;300 mg/24 h), and up to 75% of these patients progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Moreover, the presence and severity of kidney disease have been consistently and strongly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that hyperglycemia contributes to the damage of target organs, including the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, poor glycemic control has been consistently associated with increased risk of developing kidney disease in T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) tested the hypothesis that intensive diabetes therapy (INT) aimed at lowering glucose concentrations as close as safely possible to the normal range would reduce the risk of developing microalbuminuria (AER &#x02265;40 mg/24 h), macroalbuminuria, and other complications of T1D, compared with conventional therapy (CON) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

In addition, the EDIC has examined the long-term effects of INT on related outcomes, such as impaired GFR and hypertension, as well as the evolving clinical course of kidney disease in T1D. This article summarizes the most important published DCCT/EDIC findings related to kidney disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>The DCCT enrolled 1,441 people with T1D from 1983&#x02013;1989 to determine the effects of INT on the long-term complications of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The trial included two cohorts. The primary prevention cohort was characterized by diabetes duration 1&#x02013;5 years, AER &#x0003c;40 mg/24 h, and no retinopathy by fundus photography. The secondary intervention cohort was characterized by diabetes duration 1&#x02013;15 years, AER &#x02264;200 mg/24 h, and at least one microaneurysm in either eye (but no more than moderate nonproliferative retinopathy). For both cohorts, serum creatinine &#x0003c;1.2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &#x0003e;100 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> was required for eligibility. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &#x02265;140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;90 mmHg, or treatment with antihypertensive medications, was an exclusion criterion.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive INT or CON, as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The DCCT ended in 1993 after a mean duration of 6.5 years. Subsequently, all surviving participants were invited to join the observational EDIC, which continues today. During EDIC, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, which were separated by &#x0223c;2% during DCCT, became similar for the two original DCCT treatment groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>AER was measured yearly during DCCT and every other year during EDIC using supervised 4-h urine collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Water intake was encouraged to maintain urine output throughout the collection period. Urine albumin was measured at the DCCT/EDIC Central Biochemistry Laboratory (CBL) at the University of Minnesota using a fluoroimmunoassay (interassay coefficient of variation 8.4%).</p><p>Serum creatinine was measured annually throughout DCCT/EDIC at the CBL (interassay coefficient of variation &#x0003c;3%). All results were calibrated to National Institute of Standards and Technology isotope dilution mass spectrometry assigned values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation was used to estimate GFR from calibrated serum creatinine, age, sex, and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Blood pressure was measured every 3 months during DCCT and yearly during EDIC.

For microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, beneficial effects were observed during the DCCT. Moreover, during EDIC follow-up, the incidences of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria continued to be lower among participants previously assigned to DCCT INT, with risk reductions during EDIC years 1&#x02013;8 that were even greater than those observed during the DCCT itself. For impaired GFR and hypertension, beneficial effects of INT were not observed during the DCCT, but significant effects became apparent during long-term EDIC follow-up. The cumulative incidences of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria 30 years after diagnosis of diabetes were substantially lower among participants assigned to INT versus CON, providing further evidence that early INT alters the clinical course of kidney disease in T1D.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;metabolic memory&#x0201d; has been used to describe the differences in outcomes that persist or even expand after the original separation in chronic glycemia, based on treatment assignment, has disappeared. The persistent effects of INT on microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria during EDIC years 1&#x02013;8 are striking examples of this phenomenon. The subsequent beneficial effects of INT on impaired GFR and hypertension represent the long-term consequences of INT. The biological basis of metabolic memory remains a matter of speculation. Clinically, the important implication is that INT applied early in the course of T1D has strong and long-lasting effects to reduce the long-term risks of kidney disease.</p><p>Importantly, the DCCT/EDIC evaluated the effects of INT on each of the two most important clinical features of diabetic kidney disease&#x02014;albuminuria and impaired GFR. To our knowledge, INT is the only intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce the risks of developing both albuminuria (microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) and impaired GFR in T1D. This emphasizes the importance of hyperglycemia in the pathophysiology of kidney disease in T1D and the primary role for glucose control in preventing both major manifestations of diabetic kidney disease in this population.</p><p>The beneficial effects of INT on the risks of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and impaired GFR were fully attenuated by statistical adjustment for HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Interestingly, in parallel, the beneficial effects of INT on the risk of impaired GFR were also fully attenuated by statistical adjustment for AER. This suggests that a common set of disease mechanisms leading from hyperglycemia to both albuminuria and impaired GFR is interrupted by INT. Additional observations from the DCCT/EDIC suggest that other mechanisms also contribute to the development of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and impaired GFR, and that these mechanisms may vary by disease manifestation. Most participants who developed microalbuminuria did not go on to develop impaired GFR, and most but not all participants who developed impaired GFR first developed macroalbuminuria. Blood pressure, obesity, and other metabolic factors appear to influence the development of kidney disease in T1D, in addition to hyperglycemia. These risk factors may offer additional treatment options to prevent and treat kidney disease in T1D, in addition to intensive glucose control.</p><p>Higher AER and blood pressure were associated with increased risks of CVDs, including carotid atherosclerosis, coronary atherosclerosis, stiffening of the aorta, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Taken together with similar observations in other cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), these results suggest a central role for kidney disease in the macrovascular complications of T1D. The beneficial effects of INT on kidney disease and blood pressure would therefore be expected to yield subsequent reductions in the risks of CVD. Statistical modeling suggested that reductions in AER explained a minority of the beneficial effects of INT on clinical CVD events, but such mediation analyses can underestimate the impact of covariates. Future studies will further evaluate the impact of kidney disease on CVD in the DCCT/EDIC, including the extent to which reductions in kidney disease with INT affect risk of CVD over long-term follow-up.</p><p>Strengths of the DCCT/EDIC include its randomized, controlled design with substantial separation in HbA<sub>1c</sub> achieved by treatment assignment; the detailed longitudinal characterization of diabetes complications; and the unusually long duration of follow-up, particularly for a clinical trial. These strengths were made possible by dedicated research staff, consistent sponsor support, and, most important, the invaluable contributions of the DCCT/EDIC participants. Low numbers of ESRD and CVD events have limited analyses of these outcomes to date. Continued follow-up of the DCCT/EDIC cohort will facilitate further examination of these events in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, INT applied early in the course of T1D resulted in clinically important, long-lasting reductions in the incidence of kidney disease. These benefits, combined with congruent reductions in the risks of retinopathy, neuropathy, CVD, and other diabetes complications, serve as a cornerstone of recommendations to control glycemia in T1D.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. nos.
