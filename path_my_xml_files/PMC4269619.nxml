By 2&#x000a0;years of age, most children have been infected with RSV at least once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk for severe RSV is particularly high in children who were born prematurely, or who have congenital heart disease (CHD), or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2005, it was estimated that there were 33.8 million cases of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection worldwide in children&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of these, 3.4 million were severe and required hospitalization, and 66,000&#x02013;199,000 cases resulted in death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (RespiGam, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was the first RSV-specific prevention used in high-risk infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although this therapy was effective, it required several hours of an intravenous (IV) infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Palivizumab (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), an F-protein&#x02013;specific humanized monoclonal antibody, was the first monoclonal antibody developed to prevent an infectious disease and represented an advance in RSV prevention. Palivizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 and is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk for RSV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, palivizumab offers a more convenient, intramuscular (IM), route of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Palivizumab was first manufactured as a lyophilized powder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Lyophilized palivizumab is administered at a dose of 15&#x000a0;mg/kg IM monthly throughout the RSV season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The efficacy of lyophilized palivizumab is well established; results from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown that palivizumab resulted in a 45&#x02013;82% reduction in RSV hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, lyophilized palivizumab requires reconstitution with sterile water, which takes approximately 20&#x000a0;min, and the drug must be used within 6&#x000a0;h of reconstitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A liquid formulation of palivizumab bypasses the need for reconstitution and simplifies the administration of palivizumab. This liquid formulation was approved by the FDA in 2004 based, in part, on the results of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and has been the only formulation distributed in the United States since 2006. The reduced time required for administration of liquid versus lyophilized palivizumab has additional clinical relevance in that it enables high-risk infants to spend less time in a healthcare provider&#x02019;s waiting room, thereby decreasing their exposure to other sick children visiting the pediatrician. Single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of the liquid formulation of palivizumab administered IV and IM were first tested and compared with the lyophilized formulation in 53 healthy adult volunteers. In this parallel cohort study, liquid palivizumab demonstrated PK and safety profiles similar to those of lyophilized palivizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The goal of the current study was to establish bioequivalence and safety of the liquid formulation in a pediatric population for whom palivizumab is approved. This randomized, crossover study assessed the PK, safety, and tolerability of the liquid formulation compared with the lyophilized formulation of palivizumab in infants&#x000a0;&#x02264;6&#x000a0;months of age who were born&#x000a0;&#x02264;35&#x000a0;weeks gestational age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Infants aged &#x02264;6&#x000a0;months who were born &#x02264;35&#x000a0;weeks gestational age were included in the study.

All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Written informed consent was obtained from each study patient&#x02019;s parent or legal guardian before study entry or any study procedures were performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Drug</title><p>Liquid palivizumab was provided in 3-mL vials containing 100&#x000a0;mg/mL of sterile liquid product in a volume of 1.2&#x000a0;mL (25&#x000a0;mM histidine, 1.6&#x000a0;mM glycine, at pH 6.0). Lyophilized palivizumab was provided in 5-mL vials containing 100&#x000a0;mg of sterile lyophilized product (25&#x000a0;mM histidine, 1.6&#x000a0;mM glycine, and 3% w/v mannitol at pH 6.0, before lyophilization) that yielded palivizumab at a concentration of 100&#x000a0;mg/mL after reconstitution with 1&#x000a0;mL of sterile water for injection. Study medications were administered at a dose of 15&#x000a0;mg/kg IM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Design</title><p>This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover study (NCT00240929) was conducted at 21 sites in the United States. Patients were randomized from November 2002 through February 2003 in a 1:1 ratio to either the sequence A group or the sequence B group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Study medication was supplied to the pharmacy as open-labeled lyophilized or liquid palivizumab. The pharmacist prepared the study medication with the appropriate formulation, and the medication was dispensed from the pharmacy in identical syringes. The investigators, study nurses, and patient&#x02019;s parents were blinded to the study medication. Patients received a single 15&#x000a0;mg/kg IM dose of liquid (sequence A) or lyophilized (sequence B) palivizumab on Day 0. Patients crossed over to receive the alternate formulation on Day 30. The design and endpoints of the trial were finalized following regulatory input. After study completion (i.e., after patients had received 2 doses of study drug), investigators were free to give patients additional doses of commercially available lyophilized palivizumab for the remainder of the RSV season. Liquid palivizumab was not commercially available at the time of the study and was used only in the experimental setting.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design. <italic>PK</italic> pharmacokinetics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40121_2014_42_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Bioequivalence was assessed by comparing the relative bioavailability of the two palivizumab formulations. Because the indicated patient population for palivizumab consists of preterm infants from whom only limited numbers of blood samples and total blood volume could be collected, the standard bioequivalence parameters of maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC), which require a full PK profile, could not be used to establish bioequivalence. Serum samples for determining palivizumab concentrations were collected at baseline, on study Day 30 (before the dose of alternate formulation), and study Day 60 (30&#x000a0;days after the dose of alternate formulation). Serum samples were analyzed at a central laboratory (PPD Development, Richmond, VA, USA) to determine palivizumab concentration using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The ELISA used for measuring serum palivizumab concentration was developed by MedImmune and provides linear results in the range 10&#x02013;750&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL. Patient samples with concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay of 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL were reported as &#x0003c;LOQ.

AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were graded by severity (level 1&#x02013;4) and relationship to study drug (none, remote, possible, probable, or definite) by the study investigator. AEs were considered related to the study medication (as determined by the blinded site investigator) if they were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related. SAEs included those that resulted in death; were life-threatening; or resulted in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Antidrug Antibodies</title><p>Serum samples for determining antidrug antibodies (ADA) to palivizumab from patients who had previously consented to additional testing were collected at baseline and on study Days 30 and 60.

Patient serum samples and negative and positive controls were diluted 1:10 before performing the assay. Solutions were incubated for 1&#x000a0;h, and anti-palivizumab immunoglobulin was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated palivizumab. A titer &#x0003e;1:10 was considered positive for ADA.

The sample size was increased to 75 because of potential difficulties in obtaining adequate blood samples from infants, and to allow for withdrawals and dropouts in the study.</p><p>An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on log-transformed 30-day postdose serum concentrations, which included both Day 30 and Day 60 trough serum concentrations due to the crossover design. The model accounted for all sources of variation that could be reasonably assumed to have an effect on the serum concentration, namely, sequence, patient, formulation, and period. The geometric means of the trough concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>) for each formulation, the ratio of the geometric means (with the lyophilized formulation as the reference group) and the associated 90% CI were estimated. If the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of the <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> was within 0.8&#x02013;1.25 of the statistical interval, the two formulations would be considered bioequivalent. The CI was to be constructed only if a significant sequence effect was not demonstrated. If a significant sequence effect was demonstrated, a 90% CI using only the Day 30 data was to be constructed. This additional CI is reported here for convenience.</p><p>The incidence of AEs was summarized separately for liquid and lyophilized palivizumab during each of the 3 study periods: study Days 0&#x02013;30 (i.e., from after the first injection through 30&#x000a0;days or up to the date of the second injection), study Days 30&#x02013;60 (i.e., from after the second injection through 30&#x000a0;days), and study Days 0&#x02013;60 (i.e., through the respective 30-day follow-up periods for patients receiving study drug at study Day 0, study Day 30, or both).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 153 patients were randomized into the study (75 to sequence A, 78 to sequence B), and 152 completed the study through 30&#x000a0;days after the second injection of the study drug.

A crossover design was used since this allows for the assessment of bioequivalence while minimizing the impact of subject-to-subject variability on the results of the analysis. Given that palivizumab is administered monthly in infants, serum trough concentrations were used to assess similarity in palivizumab exposures between lyophilized and liquid formulations in a crossover fashion.</p><p>An analysis of palivizumab PK across 22 studies (including data from the current study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed that body weight impacts palivizumab exposure, and gestational age only has a minimal effect on palivizumab concentrations. Across a range of gestational and postnatal ages, palivizumab serum concentrations were similar, suggesting the appropriateness of body weight dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, palivizumab 15&#x000a0;mg/kg demonstrated comparable therapeutic concentrations in patients with different demographic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Findings from this study of infants aged&#x000a0;&#x02264;6&#x000a0;months with a history of prematurity of&#x000a0;&#x02264;35&#x000a0;weeks gestation showed that liquid and lyophilized palivizumab formulations exhibit comparable PK and similar safety profiles. Similar trough palivizumab levels were observed between the two sequence groups and the 90% CIs for the ratios of least squares geometric means of trough levels for the two formulations were within the 90% confidence limits for bioequivalence.</p><p>The half-life of palivizumab is approximately 20&#x000a0;days; palivizumab accumulation is expected upon redosing on Day 30 based on the frequency of dosing compared with the half-life. The trough serum palivizumab levels in the present study were generally consistent with the levels previously reported from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy study in infants&#x000a0;&#x02264;35&#x000a0;weeks gestation and&#x000a0;&#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months of age or&#x000a0;&#x02264;2&#x000a0;years of age with CLDP, in which mean trough serum levels through 30&#x000a0;days after the first and second doses were 37 and 57&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL, respectively, after 15&#x000a0;mg/kg of lyophilized palivizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Serum levels from a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study of liquid palivizumab in premature infants with and without CLDP showed a mean trough serum palivizumab level of 87.4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL on Day 60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is difficult to compare absolute levels between studies, given the subtle differences in assays or study conduct, which could lead to different results. However, all studies have shown higher values at Day 60 relative to Day 30 due to accumulation of palivizumab with repeated dosing.</p><p>Liquid palivizumab has been used in the United States since its FDA approval in 2004 and has demonstrated a similar safety profile to lyophilized palivizumab in the postmarketing setting. In the current study, a similar incidence of AEs was observed regardless of palivizumab formulation or the sequence of palivizumab administration. The incidence of SAEs was also similar between the liquid and lyophilized palivizumab groups. The AEs considered to be related to the study medications in the present study were consistent with those reported in a larger study with lyophilized palivizumab, including fever (2.8%), nervousness (2.5%), and injection site reaction (2.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, the AEs reported in the present study were generally consistent with those reported in a large (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3,306) study of infants who received liquid palivizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The most commonly reported AEs in that study were upper respiratory tract infection (30.1%), pyrexia (16.9%), and rhinitis (13.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Overall, the reported AEs and SAEs were generally as expected for the studied population of infants&#x000a0;&#x02264;6&#x000a0;months of age with a history of prematurity.</p><p>The crossover study design, a strength of this study, allowed for the evaluation of the safety of the sequential exposure of one palivizumab formulation to another. One of the limitations of the study is that there was no washout period. A drug washout period of approximately 3&#x000a0;months would have potentially placed these infants at risk during the RSV season. This crossover design, with the alternative formulation administered at the next scheduled monthly dosing period, was also felt to mimic a potential clinical situation where infants receiving lyophilized palivizumab could be switched to the liquid formulation within a single RSV season. The ANOVA demonstrated no significant differential carryover effect. Moreover, the geometric mean ratio and associated 90% CI constructed after a single dose using Day 30 <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> data alone were within the bioequivalence limits, supporting the bioequivalence conclusion in the absence of a washout period in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, findings from this study show comparable PK profiles of the liquid and lyophilized formulations of palivizumab in infants, supporting the bioequivalence of the two formulations. The safety profiles were also similar between the liquid and lyophilized formulations of palivizumab in the studied pediatric population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40121_2014_42_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 14 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="40121_2014_42_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (PDF 204 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00240929.</p></fn><fn><p>Genevieve A.
