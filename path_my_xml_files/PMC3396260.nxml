The lack of liver detoxification as well as the loss of metabolic and regulatory functions of the liver leads to life-threatening complications, including renal failure, altered immune response, hepatic coma and systemic hemodynamic dysfunction, eventually culminating in multi-organ failure. Current medical therapy involves the management of the precipitating event and treatment of complications until the liver eventually recovers, leaving us with no other treatment options other than transplantation if these attempts fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>During the acute phase of their disease, a substantial number of patients are treated using extracorporeal blood purification devices. Besides regular hemodialysis, the Molecular Adsorbent Recycling System (MARS, Gambro AB, Lund, Sweden) is used with increasing frequency. This non-biologic liver dialysis system is currently in use to bridge patients with acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure, either to recovery of native liver function or to liver transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Liver failure is characterized by a balanced but brittle coagulation system. Minor disturbances profoundly increase the risks of severe bleeding and of thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An important area of debate at present is the choice of the optimal extracorporeal blood circuit anticoagulation regimen. On the one hand, systemic anticoagulation therapy should be minimized given the high risk of bleeding associated with liver failure. On the other hand, contact of blood with the extracorporeal circuit leads to coagulation activation and might result in loss of coagulation factors, contributing to broad coagulation disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Unfractionated heparin and to a lesser extent low molecular weight heparin are the standard of care anticoagulation regimens in most centers. However, optimal dosage has not been studied. Moreover, heparin induces systemic anticoagulation, thereby aggravating liver failure-associated coagulopathy. Several retrospective studies reported on protocols to minimize heparin anticoagulation during MARS dialysis. Faybik <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the use of prostaglandin I<sub>2 </sub>during MARS treatment. However, in this cohort, half of the patients still received additional unfractionated heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several retrospective studies suggested the feasibility of MARS without anticoagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. All of these studies reported clotting of the extracorporeal circuit and/or severe coagulopathy due to contact activation in a subset of treatments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Heparin-free MARS studies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Study</th><th align="center">Design</th><th align="center">Indication</th><th align="center">Total<break/>n</th><th align="center">Heparin Free<break/>patients/sessions</th><th align="center">Clotting<break/>n (P/S %)</th><th align="center">Coagulopathy or Bleeding<break/>n (P/S %)</th><th align="center">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Doria et al.

Regional citrate anticoagulation for regular hemodialysis is feasible, well-tolerated and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, experience with citrate anticoagulation during treatment of patients with liver failure is limited. The liver contributes substantially to exogenous citrate metabolism and endogenous citrate clearance in patients with liver failure is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In an observational non-comparative study, regional citrate anticoagulation was used during 50 consecutive liver dialysis treatments using the fractionated plasma separation and adsorption system (FPSA, Prometheus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Substantial clotting of the dialyser occurred only twice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More recently, Faybik <italic>et al</italic>. performed a prospective observational study in twenty patients treated with MARS. Regional citrate anticoagulation appeared safe with superior patency of the extracorporeal circuit during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but further studies are required to support widespread application of citrate anticoagulation during MARS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Little evidence thus supports choice of the optimal anticoagulation regimen during MARS. The aims of this prospective cross-over study in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure were (A) to investigate feasibility of regional citrate anticoagulation during MARS and (B) to compare biocompatibility, safety and efficacy of anticoagulation-free versus regional citrate anticoagulation for anticoagulation during MARS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, admitted to the medical intensive care unit, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, were screened for eligibility.

The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics review board of the University Hospital Leuven.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>During MARS treatment, both water-soluble and the free fraction of protein-bound liver toxins are dialysed into the secondary circuit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), while blood cells and proteins are retained in the primary circuit. In the secondary circuit, an albumin-rich aqueous solution (human albumin 200 g/l, Baxter SA, Lessines, Belgium) is regenerated over two adsorbent columns. A dialyser in the secondary circuit permits clearance of water-soluble molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. MARS treatments were delivered with a MARS monitor (Gambro AB, Lund, Sweden) coupled to a hemodialysis device (AK200, Gambro AB, Lund, Sweden). MARS prescription was six consecutive hours for all procedures. The blood circuit was primed with 5000 IE heparin (LEO pharma, Wilrijk, Belgium). Blood access was by double lumen catheterization (Hemoaccess, Gambro-Hospal, Zaventem, Belgium) of the femoral vein in all patients.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram of the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System</bold>. Blood is dialysed against an albumin containing secondary circuit. The MARS<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>membrane allows passage of both water-soluble and the free fraction of protein-bound hepatic failure related toxins. In the secondary circuit, the albumin solution is regenerated by low-flux dialysis and passage over two adsorbent surfaces, an activated charcoal and an anion exchanger, respectively. For regional citrate anticoagulation, citrate is continuously infused in the afferent blood tubing, thus reducing ionized calcium concentrations at the MARS dialyzer inlet to 0.2 to 0.3 mmol&#x000b7;l<sup>-1</sup>. Restoration of blood calcium is by dialysis against dialysate containing Ca<sup>2+ </sup>at a concentration of 1.5 mmol&#x000b7;l<sup>-1</sup>. Systemic ionized calcium concentrations are repeatedly monitored during the procedure. If systemic calcium concentration falls below 0.8 mmol&#x000b7;l<sup>-1 </sup>despite calcium influx through the dialysate, additional CaCl<sub>2 </sub>is administered as an intravenous bolus injection.

Overall, reductions in systemic ionized calcium concentrations were modest and did not result in clinical symptoms.

During three sessions, we observed a ratio slightly exceeding 2.5. It is important to notice that ratios returned to baseline at the start of the next MARS session in all patients. Acid-base status was similar at all individual time points and did not significantly differ from sessions without heparin, excluding massive accumulation of citrate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial on anticoagulation protocols during Molecular Adsorption Recirculating System (MARS) treatment. Regional citrate anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit under strict metabolic monitoring appears safe, feasible and proves superior to MARS treatment without anticoagulation.</p><p>Liver failure is a heterogeneous disease state resulting from either acute or chronic relentless loss of liver synthetic or detoxification function. To improve outcomes of this grave condition, several experimental (bio-)artificial devices have been developed, including fractionated plasma separation and adsorption (FPSA) and the molecular adsorption and recirculating system (MARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patency of the extracorporeal blood circuit is a prerequisite for all of these therapies.</p><p>Anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin given to maintain patency of the extracorporeal device exerts systemic effects. This may tipple over a balanced but brittle coagulation system such as seen in liver failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] towards severe bleeding. On the contrary, insufficient anticoagulation leads to contact activation during passage of the extracorporeal circuit, thereby inducing clotting of the circuit and/or increasing the risk of thrombosis after coagulation propagation.</p><p>Regional citrate anticoagulation might prove a valid alternative. Citrate efficiently reduces extracorporeal circuit ionized calcium concentration, a necessary cofactor for coagulation. Recalcification normalizes anticoagulation prior to returning blood to the systemic circulation. In hemodialysis patients, regional citrate anticoagulation proves a valid alternative for unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The downside of regional citrate anticoagulation is that only part of the used citrate is eliminated by the extracorporeal device, whereas the other part is returned to the patient, the amount of which depends on the extracorporeal device. Citrate is metabolized by the liver and to a lesser extent by other tissues, for example, the intestines and the kidneys. While this appears safe in patients with end-stage kidney disease, it has long been held that liver dysfunction and especially liver failure is a contra-indication for use of regional citrate anticoagulation. Recently, several observational studies suggest that citrate anticoagulation can be safely used in patients with liver failure treated with either FPSA or MARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this study, we confirm that regional citrate anticoagulation for MARS is safe and feasible.</p><p>A critical aspect not touched upon previously is a comparison between these anticoagulation strategies. This is the first prospective randomized study to demonstrate superior patency during MARS using regional citrate anticoagulation when compared to no anticoagulation. The primary endpoint was longevity of prescribed MARS treatment sessions. Three out of 13 MARS sessions performed without anticoagulation were interrupted preterm due to occlusive clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, in line with previous observations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, none of the treatment sessions using regional citrate anticoagulation ended preterm (Log rank <italic>P </italic>= 0.03).</p><p>This translates in significantly higher RRs of total bilirubin (<italic>P </italic>= 0.02) in patients when citrate anticoagulation was used. When analyzing completed treatment sessions only, RRs were similar. This suggests that observed differences should predominantly be ascribed to treatment downtime rather than to reduced permeability of clotted dialysis fibers.</p><p>The current study has several limitations. Due to the cross-over design all patients are treated with both citrate anticoagulation and without anticoagulation. This precludes between groups analysis of longer-term outcomes. Second, the number of patients is small, increasing the risk of type I error. Finally, liver failure is a heterogeneous disease state. For all of these reasons we opted for a cross-over design, where each patient is his/her own control, thereby minimizing the effects of heterogeneity and increasing the statistical power. Nevertheless, while regional citrate anticoagulation provides superior patency and increased treatment efficacy as compared to no anticoagulation, the available metabolic data need confirmation in a larger cohort of patients. We do not have data on systemic citrate accumulation. Observed ratios of total calcium over ionized calcium ruled out important accumulation of citrate, thus reassuring safety of regional citrate anticoagulation during MARS treatment. Nevertheless, continuous vigilance when using citrate anticoagulation in patients with liver failure is warranted, as these patients have a diminished citrate clearance. An observation worth noticing is that measurement of ionized calcium concentration might be biased due to access recirculation. We, therefore, recommend the use of a separate arterial line which, given the setting of the patients, most often is in place.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Avoidance of anticoagulation during MARS results in significant loss of treatment efficacy due to treatment downtime.
