Blind tip leads to mechanical complications. This study was designed to evaluate whether real-time US-guided CVC with a marked introducer needle is superior to the existing unmarked needle.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methodology:</title><p>Sixty-two critically ill patients aged 18&#x02013;60 years of either sex were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups based on whether a marked or unmarked introducer needle was used. Both groups underwent real-time US-guided CVC by a single experienced operator. Aseptically, introducer needle was indented with markings spaced 0.5 cm (single marking) and every 1 cm (double marking). This needle was used in the marked group. Approximate depths (centimeter) of the anterior and posterior wall of the internal jugular vein, anterior wall of the internal carotid artery, and lung pleura were appreciated from the midpoint of the probe in short-axis view at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Access time (seconds) was recorded using a stopwatch.

This blind spot can often occur in real-time US guidance for CVC in both short (transverse) and long (longitudinal) axis during needle advancement toward anticipated vein. To circumvent this, we incorporated a simple additional safety measure by indenting markings on the existing unmarked introducer needle. We further evaluated the marked against unmarked needle during real-time US-guided CVC in a prospective randomized pilot study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study commenced after approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. The study was registered in the Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI/2015/04/005728). Written informed consent from first of kin of included patients was taken. Sixty-two critically ill adult patients (aged 18&#x02013;60 years) of either gender admitted to the Intensive Care Unit were included in the study from among the 125 admitted patients during this period. Patients with age &#x0003c; 18 years, presence of skeletal deformities, features suggestive of raised intracranial tension, refusal of consent, and in whom subclavian catheterization was planned were excluded from the study. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups (marked and unmarked introducer needle) as per the computer-generated random number table.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation</title><p>Both groups underwent real-time US-guided CVC. Portable US machine (Sonosite MicroMaxx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> with a 7.5-MHz vascular probe) was used for imaging. A single operator with a minimum of 5 years of experience in CVC and more than 1 year experience in real-time US-guided CVC performed all the cannulations. One observer helped in recording the US data and access time (skin puncture to successful guidewire placement in the vein). All patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated (Servo-I ventilator; Maquet Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA). Internal jugular vein (IJV) was chosen as the standard vein for CVC in both groups. The selection of right or left IJV was as per feasibility. After placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] we aseptically prepared and draped the neck area with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol. The target area was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine solution via a 22-gauge needle. Triple lumen central venous cannula set (Certofix Trio; B Braun, Germany) was used in both groups. Aseptically, the unmarked 18-gauge introducer needle from the same set was indented with markings spaced 0.5 cm (single marking) and every 1 cm (double marking) with the help of a sterile blade (available in the CVC set) and scale (predipped in cide &#x000d7; 15 min before the procedure) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Henceforth, this needle was used as the marked introducer needle. The entire US vascular probe was cleaned with the help of sterile gauze soaked in 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol after which footprint of the probe was covered with sterile Tegaderm (10 cm &#x000d7; 12 cm). The sterilizing solution was used as US gel for viewing. The operator held the probe in a transverse (short-axis) plane to the IJV to be cannulated in the diversion of sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Approximate depths of the anterior and posterior wall of the IJV, anterior wall of the internal carotid artery, and lung pleura (where possible) were appreciated from the midpoint of the probe in this short-axis view [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Then, under real-time US guidance, the operator inserted the introducer needle directing it straight toward the vein. After skin penetration, long-axis was used to see the path of the needle. In unmarked group, the strict vigilance of the needle path in US was done. While in marked group, the strict vigilance of the needle path in US along with its markings over needle outside skin was ensured. The needle was thus forwarded toward vein. The venous puncture was confirmed by aspiration of the free flow of venous blood. Then, guide wire was placed from the side port of introducer needle. The time required from skin puncture to successful guidewire placement (access time) using a stopwatch was recorded. After placement of guidewire, US long-axis view of the vein with the movement of the guidewire within the vein was checked to confirm placement. Rest of the procedure of CVC was performed as per Se ldinger technique. Carotid artery puncture was noted by the forceful pulsatile expulsion of bright red blood from the needle. In patients where the first attempt of introducer needle placement or guidewire placement failed, the same operator performed the second attempt in the same vein. In case if the vein was not punctured at the same depth as estimated previously by US, the operator reverified the depth by repeat US. However, any such reconfirmation was also counted as a second attempt. The access time of the repeat attempt was then noted. A check US was done to review hematoma and pneumothorax after all the procedures.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ghatak-Singh-Baronia's marked introducer needle.

In short-axis view, the cross-sectional area near the needle tip can cause needle tip effect. The long-axis view cannot resolve this problem, and the needle tip may pierce the sidewall of the vein.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] To address this issue, an echogenic vascular cannula (VascularSono, Pajunk, GmbH, Medizintechnologie, Geisingen, Germany), with &#x0201c;Cornerstone&#x0201d; reflectors near the tip, was evolved.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, the use of this costly echogenic vascular cannula has not reduced the incidence of mechanical complications.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Moreover, for beginners, the real needle tip and echogenic reflectors in the shaft can be confusing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Our present study was in continuation to a published case of successful CVC using marked introducer needle in an obese hepatic encephalopathy patient.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, we performed a static short-axis US view to measure the approximate depth of target IJV, carotid artery, and pleura (where ever possible) before the use of marked needle. The long-axis view for US-guided CVC was used since it provides a better imaging of the needle path, vein, and guidewire placement than the short-axis view.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Access time in our study is the time between skin puncture and guidewire placement as against other studies (study with echogenic needle versus nonechogenic needle) where it is between skin to vein puncture.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Higher access time in our study in marked needle group may also be due to overcautious vigilance toward markings on the needle. The lesser number of attempts for CVC in marked introducer needle group may be due to similar cause. As the distance from needle entry point to the anterior and posterior wall of the vein is known, one should be overcautious in putting the needle beyond the expected distance.</p><p>We found a less number of hematoma formation during the procedure in marked needle group (3.2% vs. 22.5%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). The study using echogenic cannula reported similar results (0% vs. 10%). The cause of a more number of hematoma in unmarked group is due to posterior and lateral walls of the vein and arterial puncture by the blind tip.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations and future plans</title><p>Our sample size is small. A sample size of 60 patients per group would be required to detect an intergroup difference of at least 20% (&#x003b1; = 0.01, two-sided, power = 90%). The power of our study with the existing sample size is around 60%. Blinding, though desirable was not possible, as a readymade marked introducer needle is not available anywhere. Correlation between US depth and actual depth will be attempted on a larger sample in future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study supports the idea that a small modification of existing introducer needle, i.e., marking the introducer needle can reduce the number of attempts and the iatrogenic mechanical complications associated with CVC. A simple modification of the existing introducer needle along with a prior assessment of depth of the vein, artery, and pleura can be another step toward zero CVC complications.</p><sec
