However, it remains elusive whether pharmacological manipulations of cholinergic neurotransmission enhance complex visual processing in healthy individuals. To test this hypothesis, we randomly administered either the cholinergic transmission enhancer donepezil (DPZ; 5 mg P.O.) or placebo (lactose) to young adults (<italic>n</italic> = 17) 3 h before each session of the three-dimensional (3D) multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) task. This multi-focal attention task evaluates perceptual-cognitive learning over five sessions conducted 7 days apart. A significant amount of learning was observed in the DPZ group but not the placebo group in the fourth session. In the fifth session, this learning effect was observed in both groups. Furthermore, preliminary results for a subgroup of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 9) 4&#x02013;14 months later suggested the cholinergic enhancement effect was long lasting. On the other hand, DPZ had no effect on basic visual processing as measured by a motion and orientation discrimination task performed as an independent one-time, pre-post drug study without placebo control (<italic>n</italic> = 10). The results support the construct that cholinergic enhancement facilitates the encoding of a highly demanding perceptual-cognitive task although there were no significant drug effects on the performance levels compared to placebo.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>3D-multiple object tracking/NeuroTracker</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>cognitive enhancer</kwd><kwd>donepezil</kwd><kwd>sensory training</kwd><kwd>visual learning</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Canadian Institutes of Health Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000024</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">MOP-111003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000038</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">238835-2011</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6890"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory training has recently emerged as a promising field in the improvement of perception and cognition (Seitz, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The enhancement of perception and cognition would alleviate sensory shift due to aging or sensory diseases or simply improve daily and sport-related performance. Various training procedures, such as the repetitive presentation of a specific set of stimuli, have been proposed for computer, tablet or three-dimensional (3D) environment (Faubert and Sidebottom, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence shows that stimulation of the neuromodulatory brain systems may potentiate perceptual learning (long-term improvement of perception induced by sensory training; Rokem and Silver, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that the cholinergic system improves the efficiency of cortical processing of visual stimuli. Acetylcholine (ACh) optimizes the gain of pyramidal cells in response to sensory stimuli and reduces sensory noise in humans (Moran et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This contributes to visual attention and learning processes (Yu and Dayan, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Sarter et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Hasselmo, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Herrero et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This also increases both sensory precision and the strength of the representation of stimuli. Moreover, in cases of visual training it has been shown that ACh aids cortical processing, improving both its speed and efficiency (Ricciardi et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, combining visual training of a specific stimulus with cholinergic potentiation, namely electrical or pharmacological stimulation of the cholinergic system, induces enhancement of visual perceptual learning (Rokem and Silver, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Beer et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p><p>Animal studies investigating electrical stimulation of cholinergic neurons paired with visual stimulation demonstrate a strong effect on cortical responses in the primary visual cortex (V1), cortical plasticity and visual performance (Goard and Dan, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kang and Vaucher, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bhattacharyya et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>). However, there are certain issues with implementing this electrical stimulation technique in a human clinical setting. A worthwhile alternative to this cholinergic enhancement is the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), drugs used in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease to block the breakdown of ACh at the synapse and prolong its action. Accordingly, AChEIs improve performance of people in visual attention tasks (Demeter and Sarter, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and behavioral tasks that require voluntary attention (Bentley et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In rats, donepezil (DPZ), the AChEI most universally used for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, has been demonstrated to increase the amplitude of visually evoked potentials when administered during a visual training period (Chamoun et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). DPZ also improves performance in diverse cognitive behavioral tasks (Wise et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Cutuli et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Soma et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Pharmacological therapy with AChEIs combined with a behavioral intervention is therefore a potentially interesting therapeutic approach to enhancing perceptual-cognitive visual performance in humans.</p><p>Therefore, we used the 3D-multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) task to evaluate the effect of cholinergic potentiation on the perceptual-cognitive capacity of healthy young adults. In the 3D-MOT test, tracking of several targets among distractors is done in a 3D environment to increase stereoscopy and demands on attention tracking (Parsons et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). 3D-MOT thus entails multi-focal attention and requires a high level of processing (Pylyshyn and Storm, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Cavanagh and Alvarez, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Faubert and Sidebottom, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Legault and Faubert, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) which encompasses the capacity of the brain to ignore distractors and noise. The task is performed weekly over 5 weeks (a 30-min session once a week). A significant increase in tracking performance is usually measured during the fifth session. 3D-MOT is usually used to improve vision in athletes (Faubert, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and aging persons (Legault and Faubert, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Legault et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Since 3D-MOT requires a high attentional load and induces perceptual and cognitive learning, it falls into the range of possible cholinergic involvement and thus should be sensitive to cholinergic potentiation.</p><p>We therefore administered DPZ during 3D-MOT perceptual-cognitive training and calculated speed thresholds for tracking moving balls. Moreover, the acute effect of DPZ on basic visual processing was further evaluated with orientation and visual motion discrimination (Hutchinson and Ledgeway, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Allard and Faubert, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We demonstrated that the tracking ability was improved at an earlier time point in healthy young adults taking DPZ, which could be related to attention and efficiency of cortical processing. Moreover, preliminary data suggest a long-lasting effect on performance. This study supports the possibility of using DPZ to improve training of perceptual-cognitive function in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>General Methods</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy young adults participated in the study.

The spheres moved in a 3D-volume space, sometimes bouncing off of or occluding one another or bouncing off the virtual wall (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This movement activity lasted 8 s and then stopped. Next, participants had to identify the target spheres. They received feedback as to their correct or incorrect response.

A trial consisted of identifying the motion or the orientation of a sine-wave grating of 0.3 CPD, by pushing arrow keys on a keyboard (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A feedback sound indicated whether the response was correct or incorrect. Motion stimuli were composed of either a luminance or a contrast modulation of a sine-wave grating drifting in a random direction (either left or right). All modulations were vertically oriented. First-order motion stimulus (luminance modulation) drifted at 15 Hz and the second-order motion stimulus (contrast modulation) at 2 Hz. The orientation task was a horizontal or vertical display of the sine-wave grating. The contrast or luminance modulation was controlled by a 2-down-1-up staircase procedure (Levitt, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Allard and Faubert, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>) and the luminance or contrast threshold obtained for the stimulus discrimination was estimated for the last six reversals of the staircase. The testing consisted of three repetitions of four blocks of trials; each block presented one of the four conditions (first- and second-order motion and first-and second-order orientation) in a randomized manner.

Together these results suggest that acute cholinergic potentiation does not influence basic visual processing of orientation and motion. The fact that no difference was observed for both levels of processing might be explained by the lack of repetitive training/DPZ administration that could not induce an optimal recruitment of cholinergic neurons or by an optimal performance of the young subjects, which might not be further increased.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that an increase in cholinergic transmission by the AChEIs, DPZ, has no significant effect on the tracking skills in the 3D-MOT task compared to placebo but may improve the learning in this 5-week perceptual-cognitive training procedure (1 session/week). In addition, preliminary results suggest that the training effect was maintained after 4&#x02013;14 months in the DPZ group but not in the control group. This long-term result is preliminary, due to the small sample of returning participants. The basic visual discrimination of first- or second-order stimuli did not seem to be affected by cholinergic potentiation as measured in an additional one-time, pre-post drug study without placebo control. Together, these results suggest the role of the cholinergic system in fine-tuning complex visual perceptual-cognitive processing. The discussion emphasizes how this DPZ effect might be due to the role of ACh in attentional processes, optimization of visual efficiency (refining of cortical circuitry and increase in sustained neural firing), improvement of the signal/noise ratio, repetitive training, or all these effects combined.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cholinergic Enhancement Improves Training but Not Performance in a Multi-Focal Attention Task in Healthy Young Adults</title><p>The present results showed that DPZ facilitates the learning in a 5-week multi-focal attention 3D-MOT training procedure. The overall maximum performance measured at the fifth session was however not significantly improved by DPZ administration, suggesting a learning effect rather than an improvement of performance <italic>per se</italic>. This learning effect could be due to a potentiation of the attentional capacities by increased brain concentrations of ACh. This result is in line with previous studies showing that ACh is involved in visual attention processes in primates (Voytko et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Bentley et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Herrero et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and that DPZ potentiates performance in attentional tasks (Rokem et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As well, the cholinergic enhancement by physostigmine (another cholinesterase inhibitor) potentiates selective attention by improving selectivity to the relevant stimuli (Furey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Ricciardi et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In the 3D-MOT task, both selective and divided attention are involved (Cavanagh and Alvarez, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Doran and Hoffman, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and could be potentiated by a higher ACh concentration.</p><p>The learning effect of DPZ on 3D-MOT training could also be due to a refinement of the cortical circuitry sustaining the accomplishment of the task. 3D-MOT training increases by itself attention, working memory and visual information processing speed. Moreover, 3D-MOT training induces changes in resting-state functional brain imaging and electroencephalography, more specifically a decrease in the theta, alpha and gamma frequencies in the frontal lobe and increased gamma frequency over the occipital lobes (Parsons et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It has been established that cholinergic activity during top-down attention processes also influences interactions between the different brain areas (Golmayo et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). For instance, the improvement in working memory performance following a steady-state infusion of the AChEI physostigmine was accompanied by increased activity in the visual cortex associated with perceptual processing, whereas activity in the prefrontal cortex was decreased, suggesting a reduction of attentional load to perform the same task (Furey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). ACh also plays a role in reducing the spatial spread of visual responses in early visual cortex tested in fMRI (Silver et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Given that 3D-MOT is a task that requires higher levels of processing (Faubert and Sidebottom, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and involves multiple brain areas (Culham et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Jovicich et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), coupling this task with cholinergic enhancement benefits from the role of the cholinergic system in increasing the activation of the sensory cortex and the refinement of processing. Improvement of the 3D-MOT performance by regional activation has also been shown by transcranial current brain stimulation of certain structures (anterior intraparietal sulcus, for example) in the visual pathway (Blumberg et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>An additional role of cholinergic potentiation in faster improvement of tracking skill of participants is the possible modulation of the signal-to-noise ratio, thus making relevant stimuli sharper. Some studies demonstrate that ACh can increase the processing of relevant stimuli and suppress the processing of irrelevant input in a top-down attention task. Human studies show that ACh allows a clearer perceptual representation of the target by reducing background noise (Furey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Ricciardi et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In rats, cholinergic enhancement is associated with an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio therefore enhancing the rat&#x02019;s response to a visual stimulus (Kang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>). Therefore, administering DPZ could have had an effect in reducing the noise level, allowing the participants to have a clearer representation of the targets among the distractors.</p><p>3D-MOT performance usually improves during training because of specific perceptual-cognitive learning activity (Makovski et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Given the role of ACh in learning, pairing visual training with ACh enhancement may modulate the tuning of the neurons for the trained stimuli (Rokem and Silver, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In fact, studies in rats and humans have shown the role of cholinergic enhancement of visual training on the potentiation of visual capacities such as visual cortical responsiveness (Kang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; Chamoun et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), contrast sensitivity (Soma et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Boucart et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), motion direction discrimination (Rokem and Silver, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and texture discrimination (Beer et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, given the role of the cholinergic system in attention and the role of attention in perceptual learning (Ahissar and Hochstein, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), pairing visual training with ACh enhancement may fine-tune the allocation of attention in this multi-focal attention task. Therefore, perceptual-cognitive learning combined with DPZ administration might optimize multi-focal tracking skills. The lack of effect of DPZ on the absolute performance value could be indicative of a ceiling effect due to high performance and cholinergic activity in young healthy subjects preventing further improvement of performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>The Cholinergic Enhancement Effect Is Long-Lasting</title><p>The present study suggests that cholinergic enhancement has a long-lasting effect on tracking performance. However, the long-term effect was tested on a smaller sample of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and further studies need to be conducted to verify such an effect. This lasting effect would correspond with previous studies showing that an improvement in visual learning after training on a motion task lasts for months after the training (Ball and Sekuler, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). However, the cholinergic enhancement doubled the amount of learning compared to the control subjects at this time point, suggesting that the cholinergic effect on visual learning and consolidation of the learning or recall mechanism (Zaninotto et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) amplifies retention of performance skills. Likewise, in a previous study, participants were trained on a texture discrimination task and were given an ACh agonist (nicotine) at the end of the training session, indicating an effect of ACh on consolidation processes (Beer et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The present results indicate that an effect of AChEI on the consolidation of learning of a trained task is possible. In animal models, long-term potentiation-like effects of the cholinergic system have been observed on visual evoked potentials after basal forebrain stimulation (Kang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>), suggesting the formation of memory traces in the visual cortex. Together these findings suggest a role of cholinergic enhancement in the encoding and long-term perceptual-cognitive learning processes following visual training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Limitation of the Study</title><p>This study was conducted with a relatively small sample of participants, reducing the power of the statistical analysis. While this sample size is regularly used in corresponding studies, we obviously need a greater sample size to more thoroughly assess possible effects of DPZ on the performance level in the 3D-MOT task. Also, the long-term data are for a smaller number of returning participants and should be further confirmed. Further experiments will also be required to isolate the transfer effects of this cholinergic potentiation on attention or perception. However, it is known that 3D-MOT training over 5 weeks can enhance cognition and changes in resting-state neuroelectric brain function (Parsons et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, repetitive DPZ administration during perceptual-cognitive training led to an earlier improvement of tracking ability and to a potential long-lasting effect. We believe that this effect is due to a combination of the effect of ACh on attention, perception and fine tuning of visual processing. These results suggest the importance of boosting the cholinergic system in practicing visual tasks to enhance plastic changes and efficacy of visual processing and memory traces. This effect would help in improving rehabilitation strategies to help visually impaired people recover vision capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>EV: director of the Laboratory of neurobiology of the visual cognition at the University of Montr&#x000e9;al; contributed by designing the project, providing the material, analyzing the data and writing the article.
