It normally varies between 10 and 21.7 mm Hg and is considered abnormal above 22 mmHg. If IOP is too high, it may produce opacities by interfering with normal corneal metabolism.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The importance of IOP for anesthetists is that patients with acutely or chronically raised IOP may present for corrective surgery, nonophthalmic surgery or with open globes following penetrating eye injuries. Rise in IOP may be critical in patients with acute glaucoma, impending perforation of the eye and perforating eye injuries due to expulsion of the global contents through a surgical or traumatic opening, retinal artery occlusion and retinal ischemia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Control of IOP is often important for the success of the procedure. Coughing, straining, or vomiting can increase IOP to 30-40 mm Hg similar to endotracheal intubation. Intravenous (i.v.) succinylcholine used for rapid sequence induction causes IOP to increase by 6-12 mm Hg, which lasts for 5-10 min.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In an open eye, these increases can lead to loss of intraocular contents, hemorrhage, and permanent vision loss.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Laryngoscopy produces reflex sympathetic stimulation with an increase in plasma catecholamines resulting in tachycardia, arterial hypertension, arrhythmias, increased IOP and intra-cranial pressure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods have been tried to limit these changes following insertion of the endotracheal tube, but no ideal agent has been found and hence the search for an ideal agent continues.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, by its central sympatholytic action, promotes hemodynamic stability when used as an adjuvant during general anesthesia. It has analgesic, potent sedative and IOP lowering properties.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We have therefore used this drug as premedication to see its effect on IOP and pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After approval from the ethical committee and a valid informed written consent of the patient, this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted on two groups of patients of either sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I of 18-60 years undergoing elective nonophthalmic surgery from May 2013 to April 2014. The total (<italic>n</italic> = 100) number of patients were taken as 50 in each group after statistically analyzing the power of the study (a power of 90% with a confidence interval of 0.05).

Baseline hemodynamic parameters (heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure [MBP], and oxygen saturation) were noted. Baseline IOP was measured using Schiotz tonometer after instillation of lignocaine. After dexmedetomidine or normal saline bolus, patient was premedicated with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg in each group. Each patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula throughout the study drug infusion in each group. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 1 mg/kg.

The main causes of visual loss after nonocular surgery are retinal vascular occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy. Incidence of POVL has been reported as 1/60,000-1/125,000.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Although the incidence of POVL is low, the permanent disability cripples the patient to lifelong handicap. This concern has raised the awareness regarding maintaining IOP intraoperatively. Steep trendelenberg position in robotic surgeries, prone position in spine surgery, open heart procedures with prolonged hypotension, etc. has increased the incidence of POVL. Open globe injuries if subjected to raised IOP can lead to loss of intraocular contents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] So maintaining IOP intraoperatively to low-normal values is of utmost importance. Avoiding laryngoscopy and intubation is an alternative to intubation for maintaining airway intraoperatively but can not be used in all cases. So in cases where intubation is imperative, pharmacological measures have been sought to reduce and maintain IOP. Among these pharmacologic measures local anesthetics, opioids, vasodilators, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, etc. have been used in the past. These agents either were not effective as required or had untoward side effects. Newer agents then were explored, and work has been done on agents like dexmedetomidine, clonidine, gabapentin, etc.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine, is a highly selective and specific &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist. Dexmedetomidine, by its central sympatholytic action, promotes hemodynamic stability when used as an adjuvant during general anesthesia. The effect of dexmedetomidine on the IOP may be due to its direct vasoconstrictor effect on the afferent blood vessels of the ciliary body. It leads to a reduction of aqueous humor production. It may also facilitate the drainage of aqueous humor by reducing sympathetically mediated vasomotor tone of the ocular drainage system. Finally, the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine can be responsible for the reduction of IOP.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] studied the effect of dexmedetomidine premedication (0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg) on the IOP changes after succinylcholine and intubation on patients undergoing elective nonophthalmic surgeries under general anesthesia. They concluded that dexmedetomidine premedication blunted the rise in the IOP caused by succinylcholine and intubation. In addition, dexmedetomidine attenuated the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Later on Pal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied two doses of dexmedetomidine, 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg and compared with saline and studied their effects on IOP, HR and MAP on laryngoscopy and intubation with succinylcholine. They concluded that dexmedetomidine (0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg, as well as 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight,) effectively prevents rise of IOP associated with administration of suxamethonium and endotracheal intubation. However, dexmedetomidine 0.6 &#x003bc;/kg may cause significant hypotension and bradycardia without further decrease in IOP. Thus, dexmedetomidine 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg may be preferred for prevention of the rise in IOP Even in hypertensive patients administration of dexmedetomidine before anesthesia blunts the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and reduces the thiopental dose.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Previous researchers used succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction, which lead to increase in IOP as observed in studies done by Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Suxamethonium use for intubation is controversial in penetrating eye injury due to the risk of extrusion of vitreous contents, which can be avoided by substituting it with rocuronium when a rise in IOP is undesirable.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Thus to curb this rise in IOP by succinylcholine for laryngoscopy and intubation, we have used rocuronium, a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent as there was evidence from another previous study done by Larsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] where he substituted rocuronium in place of succinylcholine and got ideal intubating condition for rapid sequence induction with a definite benefit in terms of stable IOP.</p><p>Based on the above findings a randomized, double-blind study was designed by us to study the effect of dexmedetomidine premedication on IOP and hemodynamic changes in response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>HR in the dexmedetomidine group showed that there is no incidence of significant bradycardia during the infusion of the drug or even later on. The findings were similar to the observations in the previous study by Pal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] where he found that at 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight dexmedetomidine does not lead to any untoward side effects whereas in a dose of 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight, it leads to significant bradycardia.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine given as a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h intraoperatively also helped to alleviate the IOP increase in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the steep trendelenburg position.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, HR remained at values lower than the baseline preoperative values in the dexmedetomidine group (<italic>P</italic> values at T2-T1, T3-T1 and T4-T1 &#x0003c;0.001).
