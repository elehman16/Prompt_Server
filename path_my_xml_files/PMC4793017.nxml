proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on patients with neglect syndrome.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the eye movements
(EM) group; and the PNF with eye movements (PEM) group. The program was conducted five
times each week for 6 weeks. Balance (both static and dynamic) and head alignment
(craniovertebral angle and cranial rotation angle) were measured before and after testing.
[Results] In measurements of static balance, the EM group showed significant improvement
in sway length and sway area when examined in the eyes-open condition, but not when
examined in the eyes-closed condition. The PEM group showed significant improvement when
examined under both conditions. In the assessment of dynamic balance, both groups showed
significant improvement in measurements of sway areas. With respect to head alignment,
there were no significant differences pre- and post-testing in either the craniovertebral
angle or the cranial rotation angle in the EM group, but the PEM group showed significant
differences in both measurements. [Conclusion] These results suggest that in stroke
patients with neglect syndrome, PNF with eye movements, rather than eye movements alone,
has a greater positive effect on balance and head alignment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eye movements</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Neglect syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neglect frequently appears due to brain damage and impedes everyday life as well as
rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Perennou et al. found
that stroke patients with neglect showed postural instability more clearly compared to those
without neglect<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The syndrome frequently
occurs in left hemiplegic patients because while the right hemisphere of the brain
recognizes left and right spaces, the left hemisphere recognizes only right spaces. Damage
to the left hemisphere can be compensated by the right hemisphere, while damage to the right
hemisphere cannot be compensated by the left hemisphere but the converse is not true<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients with neglect show diverse kinds of damage to their eye movements, such as
decreased saccadic movements and difficulties in space observation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hornak showed that patients with neglect showed
difficulties in perceiving and drawing pictures placed in the left visual field and that
stimulating these affected visual fields was important<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, Kerkhoff et al. reported that optokinetic stimulation activates
many regions involved in vision and hearing such as the temporo-parietal cortex, basal
ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. They emphasized the importance of optokinetic
stimulation for patients with damage to the nervous system<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The roles of vision, the vestibular system, and the somatosensory system are very important
in postural control. Visual inputs provide important information about one&#x02019;s environment,
postures, and head movements<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) training was
implemented in combination with eye movements in order to induce head movements. PNF can
activate the neuromuscular system by stimulating the proprioceptors in the muscles and
tendons thereby activating or suppressing certain muscle groups<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main characteristic of PNF patterns is the occurrence
of spiral and diagonal movements. These movements enhance functional movements<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, PNF training was implemented in the neck region to
induce head movements. Kim and Oh reported that neck proprioceptive training has a good
chance of improving the balance function of stroke patients with hepiparesis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the importance of eye and head movements for postural control has been emphasized,
most previous studies have been conducted on healthy adults<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study was
conducted to examine the effects of eye movement and PNF training in neglect patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted on 20 patients in two rehabilitation hospitals located in
Gyeonggi-do. Patients who were diagnosed at least six months previously with hemiplegia due
to stroke, had at least moderate neglect symptoms, and had a total score of at least 11
points on the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) were selected<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The study was limited to those who had scored not lower than 24 points on the Korean
version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K), and who could carry out
instructions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, had no visual or
hearing impairment, and could stand independently for at least one minute. This study
complied with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects agreed to
participate in the study after receiving explanations regarding its purpose and procedures.
They all signed an informed consent statement before participation. The protocol for this
study was approved by the local ethics committee of Yongin University

apparatus (SyCoMORe, France). Subjects stood on the footplate with their feet spread at an
angle of approximately 30&#x000b0; while looking straight ahead. Static balance was measured by
measuring the sway length and sway area while standing for one minute with eyes open and
eyes closed. Dynamic balance was measured as the limit of stability (forward/backward and
left/right). Lower values for static balance and higher values for dynamic balance denoted
better balance ability.</p><p>Head alignment was measured as the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle
(CRA) using the Global Postural System (GPS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

direction of the head movement.</p><p>The PEM group underwent PNF training after implementing the eye movements program. The PNF
training was implemented using the neck extensor pattern while the subject was in a sitting
position. The movements began with the contraction of the neck extensor group by neck
flexion, right rotation, and left lateral flexion, and ended with neck extension involving
left rotation and right lateral flexion. The therapist verbally instructed the subject to
push their head in the opposite direction, with another instruction to the subject to move
their eyes upward along with the movement of the head. The contract-relax training was
implemented by performing the movements 10 times as a set and repeating the set three times
with a rest period of two minutes after each set. The PNF training was implemented by one
researcher who had completed PNF Level I and Level II courses.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 20.0 software. The mean and standard

Karnath reported that vestibular and neck
proprioceptive stimulation with visual inputs was a useful method for the treatment of
neglect patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
eye movements and PNF in the neck region of neglect patients were applied to examine their
effects.</p><p>In measurements of static balance, the EM group showed significant differences in sway
length and sway area in the eyes-open condition (p&#x0003c;0.05), but not in the eyes-closed
condition (p&#x0003e;0.05). In measurements of dynamic balance, both the EM and PEM groups showed
significant differences after intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Morimoto et al. reported that when healthy adults performed eye movement and gaze stability
exercises, their postural stability was improved<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that optokinetic stimulation activated many
regions of the brain (temporo-parietal cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study concluded that eye movements
activated regions of the brain that positively affected balance ability. Moreover, no such
positive effect on balance ability was noted when vision was blocked.</p><p>The PEM group in our study showed significant differences in both eyes-open and eyes-closed
conditions (p&#x0003c;0.05). Proprioceptive inputs to the neck muscles are important for postural
control<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. PNF training stimulates
proprioceptors of muscles and tendons by activating the neuromuscular system<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stimulation of the vestibular system and
the proprioceptors of the neck region with visual inputs provide asymmetric stimulation to
sensory organs, improving coordination in neglect patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the PNF training on the neck employed in this study
appears to have stimulated the neck proprioceptors, resulting in positive effects on
postural control. In stroke patients, abnormal trunk alignment appears because of weakened
muscles, particularly in the flexion position of the upper trunk<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This causes forward head postures and extension of the
cervical vertebrae<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Posture is an essential element of normal balance<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in this study, the head alignment of stroke patients
with neglect symptoms was measured. The EM group showed no significant differences in the
craniovertebral angle and the cranial rotation angle (p&#x0003e;0.05). We conclude therefore that
eye movements alone have no positive effect on head alignment. However, the PEM group showed
significant differences in both the craniovertebral angle and the cranial rotation angle
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Sarig-Behat reported that proprioceptive training is effective for mechanical
problems in the neck region<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
indicates that PNF training has stimulated the proprioceptors, leading to positive effects
on head alignment. Hindle et al. reported that the contract-relax method in PNF is effective
for the improvement of the range of motion<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> and they concluded that PNF training has a positive effect on the
range of motion of cervical vertebrae.</p><p>In the present study, the eye movements had positive effects on static balance with the
eyes open, and on dynamic balance, but they had no positive effects on static balance with
the eyes closed, or with head alignment. However, PNF training with eye movements had
positive effects on both static and dynamic balance as well as on head alignment. Therefore,
we conclude that for neglect patients, PNF training with eye movements is a more effective
intervention than eye movements alone.</p><p>Since the present study was conducted with only 20 neglect patients, the results cannot be
generalized to all neglect patients. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the importance of
eye and head movements for postural control . More extensive studies should now be done to
test the effectiveness of this treatment for neglect patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Schenk</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Karnath</surname><given-names>HO</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Neglect and attention: current trends and
