The word <italic>Amavata</italic> is made up of a combination of two words, <italic>Ama</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The disease is mainly due to derangement of <italic>Agni</italic>, resulting in the production of <italic>Ama</italic> which circulates in the body and gets located in the <italic>Sandhis</italic> (joints) causing pain, stiffness, and swelling over the joints.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] According to modern medicine, it can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] which is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and deformity of the joints. RA can also cause inflammation of the tissues around the joints as well as other organs in the body. It is a common disorder, with varied clinical signs and symptoms related to multiple anatomical sites, both articular and extra-articular.</p><p>Allopathic system of medicine has got an important role to play in overcoming symptoms of articular diseases. Drugs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] are available to ameliorate the symptoms due to inflammation, in the form of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and the long-term suppression is achieved by the Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] But most of the NSAIDs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] have gastrointestinal side effects, whereas DMARDs have marrow, renal, and hepatic suppression. Hence, the management of this disease is merely insufficient in other systems of medicine and patients are continuously looking with a hope towards Ayurveda to overcome this challenge.</p><p>Many research works have been done to solve this clinical enigma, but an effective, safe, less complicated treatment is still required in the management of <italic>Amavata</italic>.

Maximum number of patients (41.66%) belonged to the age group of 41&#x02013;50 years, which shows its predominance in middle-age group. In this stage of life, <italic>Vyadhikshmatwa</italic> gradually decreases and accumulation of <italic>Dosha</italic> occurs, particularly <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> which acts as the major predisposing factor for this disease process. Thus, this age group is more prone for this disease. This data is slightly in accordance with the modern findings that the onset is most frequent during the fourth and fifth decades of life, with 80% of all patients developing the disease of age between 35 and 50 years. Majority of the patients (91.66%) were females, which clearly shows the predominance of the disease in females. Textual reference also reflects the predominance of rheumatoid arthritis in females. The nature of the household work especially after taking meal, which is one of the causative factors mentioned in Ayurvedic text, may be the responsible factor of <italic>Amavata</italic>. In this present study, data show that maximum (70.83%) patients were RA negative and 29.16% were RA positive. The presence of RA factor does not establish the diagnosis for RA, but it can be of prognostic significance because patients with high titers tend to have more severe and progressive disease with extra-articular manifestation.</p><p>Regarding the joint wise relief, <italic>Simhanada Guggulu</italic> showed better results than <italic>Shiva Guggulu</italic>.
