We tested doxetacel plus cisplatinum as chemotherapy protocol. An immunomodulatory adjuvant system was added as chemoimmunotherapy to the previously mentioned protocol. This system contains three well-known and complementary conditioners of protective immune-responses: cyclophosphamide low-dose, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulant factor and magnesium silicate granuloma. Eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive every 3-weeks one of the treatments under comparison. Patients received four cycles of treatment unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was documented. The maximum follow-up was one year. In each arm, tumor response (rate,duration), median survival time, 1-year overall survival, safety, and immunity modifications were assessed. Immunity was evaluated by submitting peripheral blood mononuclear cells to laboratory tests for nonspecific immunity: a) phytohemaglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation, b) prevalence of T-Regulatory (CD4+CD25+) cells and for specific immunity: a) lymphocyte proliferation induced by tumor-associated antigens (TAA) contained in a previously described autologous thermostable hemoderivative. The difference (chemotherapy vs. chemoimmunotherapy) in response rate induced by the two treatments (39.0% and 35.0%) was not statistically significant. However, the response duration (22 and 31 weeks), the median survival time (32 and 44 weeks) and 1-year survival (33.3% and 39.1%) were statistically higher with chemoimmunotherapy. No difference in toxicity between both arms was demonstrated. A switch in the laboratory immunity profile, nonspecific and specific, was associated with the chemoimmunotherapy treatment: increase of proliferative lymphocyte response, decrease of tolerogenic T-regulatory cells and eliciting TAA-sensitization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung cancer chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>lung cancer chemoimmunotherapy</kwd><kwd>cancer vaccine</kwd><kwd>immunomodulatory cancer treatment</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy adjuvants</kwd><kwd>cancer therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in more than 160,000 deaths per year in the United States and 1.2 million worldwide. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-btt-2-555">ALA 2005</xref>).</p><p>The treatment of advanced stages of lung cancer with systemic chemotherapy has obtained modest results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-btt-2-555">Socinski et al 2003</xref>). Immunotherapy, another systemic treatment, also has been disappointing since the historic intents with BCG (bacille Calmette Gu&#x000e9;rin; Had&#x0017a;iev et al 1982), Corynebacterium parvum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-btt-2-555">Issell et al 1978</xref>), and thymosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-btt-2-555">Chretien et al 1979</xref>) up to the recent trials with humanized antibodies targeting specific tumor-associated antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-btt-2-555">Lynch et al 2004</xref>). However, in last years, new platforms for chemotherapy as tumor antigens releaser and immunotherapy as immunomodulatory conditioner have introduced a rational for the association of these platforms in a chemoimmunotherapy protocol in order to improve the results of advanced NSCLC treatment.</p><p>In fact, chemotherapy is a tumor antigens releaser. In malignant disease spontaneously progressing, without treatment, the content of dying tumor cells is transferred to the interstice, to the lymph and to the blood. Some components of that content are tumor-associated antigens (TAA). This malignant tumor content, released from dying cells, meets the immune system in the interstice, in the lymph, and also in the circulating blood. This mechanism can work as a spontaneous endogenous vaccination. However, it is evident the failure of tumor immune control by this spontaneous endogenous vaccination in progressive cancer. This failure could be result of the low antigenicity of TAA released from spontaneous apoptotic tumor cells death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-btt-2-555">Melcher et al 1998</xref>) and the conditioning of tolerogenic or permissive immune response induced during the carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-btt-2-555">Cochran et al 2006</xref>). Apoptotic tumor cell death increases when malignant disease is submitted to oncological treatments, mainly chemotherapy. Cell death through apoptosis is less immunogenic than cell death through necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-btt-2-555">Melcher et al 1999</xref>). However, the immunogenicity is maintained when apoptosis follows a cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-btt-2-555">Feng et al 2002</xref>) as it is produced by chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-btt-2-555">Tiligada 2006</xref>). Therefore, chemotherapy works, at least partially, as an endogenous vaccination enhancer with high efficacy as releaser of TAA antigens, one of the components in the configuration of cancer vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-btt-2-555">Raez 2005</xref>).</p><p>Immunomodulatory conditioning is a new platform of immunotherapy. The goal is to switch the tolerogenic (permissive) tumor-induced conditioning of the immune responses to immunogenic (protective) immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-btt-2-555">Pinedo et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-btt-2-555">Rini et al 2005</xref>). A tool to accomplish this goal is the described systemic depletion of tolerogenic T-regulatory cells population (CD4+CD25+) by cyclophosphamide at low dose, injected a short period (three days) before antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-btt-2-555">Berd et al 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-btt-2-555">Ghiringhelli et al 2004</xref>). Another tool is the recently described immunotherapeutic site (ITS), where different immunomodulatory agents are injected in order to induce in the draining lymph node an increase of activated antigen-presenting cells and a depletion of tolerogenic T-regulatory cells. This loco-regional immunomodulation is decisional because it elicits a systemic protective lymph nodes conditioning. Among other agents (erythrocytes or other local inflammatory agents) to create an ITS, magnesium silicate that produces a subcutaneous granuloma (MSG) was reported as a strong inducer of remote macrophage activation with enhancement of protective antitumor immune responses, when it is performed during the 4 days previous to the antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-btt-2-555">Fauve and Hevin 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-btt-2-555">Fontan et al 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-btt-2-555">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-btt-2-555">Fauve et al 1987</xref>). It was also reported that granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), injected subcutaneously, simultaneously or around the time of antigen stimulation, is a recruiter and activator of antigen presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-btt-2-555">Disis et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-btt-2-555">Dranoff 2002</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, the association of systemic low-dose cyclophosphamide and a locoregional lymph node immunomodulation by MSG and GM-CSF is a safe immunomodulatory adjuvant system (IAS) of cancer vaccines supported by the proven properties of their components and evidenced in previous clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-btt-2-555">Garcia-Giralt et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-btt-2-555">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-btt-2-555">Lasalvia-Prisco et al 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-btt-2-555">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-btt-2-555">2007c</xref>). This study compared in advanced NSCLC, the antitumoral and immunological effects of the standard chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy designed using the same chemotherapy in its platform of tumor antigens releaser and the platform of immunomodulatory conditioning immunotherapy through and IAS with cyclophosphamide, MSG, and GM-CSF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and trial</title><p>Patients were submitted to a randomized phase II study.

The study was conducted in patients admitted to medical centers that submitted medical data to the Cooperative Trials Center (CTC) of Interdoctors Medical Procedures, Florida, USA (Interdoctors Medical Procedures is a nonpharmaceutical concern group supporting scientific research in medical procedures). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the trial, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-btt-2-555">WMA 1997</xref>). In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, the treating physicians did not participate in the arm randomization for their patients.

The overall response rate was expressed as the proportion of patients demonstrating CR (complete remission) or PR (partial remission) based on all patients randomly assigned to receive treatment and according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). All responses required confirmation at least four weeks after they were first observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-555">Therasse et al 2000</xref>).</p><p>Response duration (RD) was calculated from the first date of a 50% reduction in the tumor was registered to the last date that tumor reduction was documented.</p><p>At the end of the follow-up (1 year), survival parameters were analyzed for each group using the Kaplan-Meier method from the first day of treatment to death or the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who were still alive. Median time survival (MTS) and one year overall survival (1-OS) were estimated. Assessment of safety was based on reports of adverse events, laboratory-test results, and vital-sign measurements. Adverse events were categorized according to the common toxicity criteria of the National Cancer Institute (CTCAE), version 2 (NCI 2006).</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory tests</title><p>The laboratory tests were designed taking in account preliminary assays in patients treated with each component of IAS, showing accumulative increase of peripheral blood monomolecular cells (PBMC) proliferation responses to phytohemaglutinin (PHA) and decrease of T-regulatory cells (results not shown) supporting the use of the associated three IAS components in this study.</p><p>In a sample of PBMC, lymphocyte proliferation assay induced with PHA and T-regulatory Cells (CD4+CD25+) prevalence (T-Reg) were assessed as nonspecific immune-reactivity parameters.

Two immunologic challenges and appropriate controls were tested in triplicate: a) Medium control in the top row, an additional 100 &#x003bc;l of working RPMI 1640 medium; b) PHA, 100 &#x003bc;l of a serial dilution of stock PHA (0.5 mg/ml) in RPMI 1640 (1:10, 1:100 and 1:500) was placed in triplicate wells of the first 9 wells of the second row; c) ATH, 100 &#x003bc;l of a serial dilution of ATH (10x concentrate from 20 mL blood) in RPMI 1640 (1:10, 1:100 and 1:500) was placed in triplicate wells of the first 9 wells of the third row; d) Negative control, 100 &#x003bc;l of l:100 dilution of healthy male plasma in RPMI 1640 medium was added to each of first 3 wells of the forth row. RPMI 1640 were also obtained from Sigma. Plates were incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 &#x000b0;C for 5 days. One microcurie of tritiated thymidine was then added to each well in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l and plates were again incubated, at 37 &#x000b0;C for 16 h. The content of each well was harvested and counted in a liquid scintillation beta-counter. The mean of the three determinations per point was registered as mean-cpm of each challenger. The mean-cpm of the negative control was divided by the mean-cpm of the media control. If this ratio was less than 2.00, then the negative control was accepted. For each test in each patient, the mean-cpm of the PHA dilution with the highest cpm was divided by the mean of the media control, expressed as % of the value calculated for the day -3 and defined as PHA lymphocyte proliferation response (PHA-LPR). Also for each test in each patient, the mean-cpm of the ATH dilution with the highest cpm was divided by the mean-cpm of the media control expressed as a percentage of the value calculated for the day -3 and defined as ATH lymphocyte proliferation response (ATH-LPR). The results were statistically compared in both treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>T-regulatory (CD4+CD25+) prevalence</title><p>An aliquot of each PBMC sample, days-3, 3 and 20, isolated from peripheral blood, were used for two and three color cell surface labeling using Abs against CD4 and CD25.

The prevalence of CD4+CD25+ cells as a percentage of total CD4+ population was determined by standard determination of quadrant statistics and registered as T-regulatory cells value (T-reg). For each test, days-3, 3 and 20, in each patient, T-reg values were expressed as percent of the day -3 mean values and defined as T-reg response (T-regr).

The sample size was acceptable according to the approach of Schoenfeld and Richter and it also accomplished the criteria recently reported for the two-arm design of phase II clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-btt-2-555">Taylor et al 2006</xref>). The RRs were statistically nondifferent between CHM and CHIMT and the values are in the range of RR reported in similar medical conditions treated only with comparable chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-btt-2-555">Socinski et al 2003</xref>). We infer that the tested immunomodulatory adjuvant had no influence upon the initial response to chemotherapy. Differently, the duration of response and the survival parameters were all statistically increased in CHIMT compared with CHT. This increment is also evident if we compare CHIMT results with the previously reported same parameters in trials of comparable patients treated with comparable chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-btt-2-555">Socinski et al 2003</xref>). We deduce that the tested immunomodulatory adjuvant elicits a mechanism that maintains the response to chemotherapy. The statistically significant increase of PHA-LPR and the significant decrease of T-reg are compatible with a switch of the immune system, conditioning the immune responses from the permissive (tolerogenic) to the protective (immunogenic). These facts concur with the reported immunomodulatory activity of the IAS components: Cyclophosphamide, low dose, 3 days before antigen stimulation, decreases the CD4+CD25+ (T-reg) cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-btt-2-555">Berd et al 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-btt-2-555">Ghiringhelli et al 2004</xref>). The magnesium silicate granuloma has been demonstrated as a remote enhancer of systemic macrophage activity committed to the protective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-btt-2-555">Fauve and Hevin 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-btt-2-555">Fontan et al 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-btt-2-555">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-btt-2-555">Fauve et al 1987</xref>). GM-CSF, subcutaneously, administered around the antigenic stimulation, recruits and activates the antigen presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells, allowing a stronger immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-btt-2-555">Disis et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-btt-2-555">Dranoff 2002</xref>).</p><p>The influence of this nonspecific immunity modulation upon the specific antitumor immunity is suggested by the results of ATH-LPR. The early increase of ATH-LPR at day 3, in both arms, CHT and CHIMT, is compatible with higher release of TAA induced by chemotherapy and recovered in the contemporary ATH. The most important increase of ATH-LPR, evidenced at day 20, is exclusive of CHIMT and is associated with the immunity nonspecific modulation. We interpret that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis produced an immunogenic TAA release from tumor cells, impacting upon an immune system that could be conditioned by IAS to elicit protective responses, resulting in an immunotherapy mechanism added to the chemotherapy antitumor effect. The antitumor response duration and the survival parameters are higher in CHIMT arm than in CHT arm. This result is compatible with a protracted antitumor effect of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, which delays the recovery of tumor growth after remission induced by cytotoxic drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CHT and CHIMT resulted in a not-different RR but CHIMT maintained the cancer control safely for a longer period, improving RD, MST, and 1-OS compared with CHT. The immunity-associated changes are compatible with a potentiation of the time-effective chemotherapy-antitumor-effect through an internal vaccination by TAA (released from chemotherapy-induced tumor cells apoptosis) impacting upon a modulated proprotective/antipermissive immune system. Despite the small number of cases of this phase II study, the statistical significance evidenced warrants further investigations in order to assess the clinical relevance of this chemo-immunotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-btt-2-555"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Altman</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulz</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name><name><surname>Moher</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2001</year><article-title>The revised CONSORT statement for reporting randomized trials: explanation and elaboration</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><volume>134</volume><fpage>663</fpage><lpage>94</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11304107</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2-btt-2-555"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>[ALA] American Lung Association</collab></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Epidemiology and statistical unit.

Observed survival in the chemotherapy arm (CHT; 41 patients): Doxetacel + cisplatinum and the chemoimmunotherapy arm (CHIMT; 40 patients): CHT + immunomodulatory adjuvant system. Survival rates at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and the comparisons between the two treatment procedures were carried out using the two-tailed log-rank test. P-value for log-rank test was calculated. The sample size for Survival (log-rank) was assessed using the approach of Schoenfeld and Richter.</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> MST, median survival time; 1-OS, one year overall survival.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btt-2-555f1"/></fig><table-wrap id="t1-btt-2-555" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patients&#x02019; characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CHT</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CHIMT</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of Patients</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Included</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessable</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median Age</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age Range</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40&#x02013;73</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33&#x02013;74</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight loss &#x02265;5%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.8%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.0%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Squamous cell</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.6% (15)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.0% (16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large cell</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.4% (10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5% (9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adenocarcinoma</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.3% (12)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0% (10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not otherwise specified</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.8% (4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.5% (5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn1-btt-2-555"><p><bold>Notes:</bold> Stage IV NSCLC randomized in two arms: CHT, treated with chemotherapy (doxetacel + cisplatinum) and CHIMT.
