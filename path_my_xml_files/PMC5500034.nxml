It has been widely used in anesthesia for critically ill patients and patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, intravenous induction with etomidate is usually associated with myoclonus. Myoclonus can occur after induction with etomidate in 50% to 80% of patients without pretreatment,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and it increases muscular tension similar to spasms in patients with severe myoclonus. This phenomenon may lead to negative, unpredictable effects during an operation, as well as the subsequent outcome and prognosis, especially for patients with full stomachs or ocular trauma.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> As shown in recent studies, pretreatment with neuromuscular blocking agent,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> opioids,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> dexmedetomidine,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> midazolam,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> low-dose ketamine,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> gabapentin,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> dezocine,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> and magnesium sulfate<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> could prevent etomidate-related myoclonus. However, these drugs are associated with side effects such as excessive sedation, delayed recovery, and respiratory inhibition. Thus, it is essential to explore a new approach to inhibit etomidate-related myoclonus with few complications.</p><p>In a preliminary investigation, we found that pretreatment with propofol could inhibit the myoclonus induced by etomidate. Etomidate plus propofol had few effects on respiration and circulation in patients, and was safer and more effective than propofol alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> However, the effect and the optimal dose of propofol to minimize side effects are not well established. Thus, this study investigated the effect of pretreatment with different doses of propofol on etomidate-related myoclonus in patients scheduled for painless gastroscopy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study used a prospective, double-blind, clinical, randomized controlled design and was approved by the Harbin Medical University Institutional Ethics Committee. Each patient signed a written informed consent to receive anesthesia after being informed of the advantages and disadvantages of each anesthesia scheme. This manuscript adheres to the applicable Equator guidelines.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>In total, 375 adult patients of both sexes, aged 18 to 80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists status (ASA) of I or II, who were scheduled for an elective painless gastroscopy planned to last &#x0003c;30 minutes, were included in the study. Using a random number table, they were divided equally into 5 groups (n = 75 in each group) to receive propofol in different doses (0&#x0200a;mg/kg, 0.25&#x0200a;mg/kg, 0.50&#x0200a;mg/kg, or 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg) combined with etomidate anesthesia. These groups were as follows: etomidate (E) group, low-dose propofol and etomidate (LPE) group, middle-dose propofol and etomidate (MPE) group, and high-dose propofol and etomidate (HPE) group, or propofol anesthesia only (P) group. Patients with abnormal cardiac, respiratory, hepatic or renal function, history of metabolic disease, neuromuscular system disease or psychotic disorder, anemia, or known hypersensitivity to emulsion were excluded. Female patients were not pregnant or parturient. None of the patients received any sedatives or analgesics 2 weeks before the operation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Anesthesia and operation</title><p>All of the patients started to fast 8 hours before the operation and did not receive any preoperative medication. Upon arrival at the operating room, peripheral intravenous access was established, and oxygen (3&#x0200a;L/min) was administered via a nasal cannula. Noninvasive mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored during anesthesia. An intravenous injection of 0.8&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl was first performed, and then an intravenous injection of 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg lidocaine was administered 1 minute later. After an additional 2 minutes, patients in the E group, LPE group, MPE group, and HPE group received a slow intravenous infusion of 0.05&#x0200a;mL/kg saline, followed by 0&#x0200a;mg/kg, 0.25&#x0200a;mg/kg, 0.50&#x0200a;mg/kg, or 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol (Lot number: GK053, AstraZeneca, Italy) according to the anesthesia induction scheme. Ninety seconds later, 0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg etomidate (Lot number: 20110610, Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co Ltd., China) in the LPE, MPE, HPE groups and 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg etomidate in the E group were administered within 60&#x0200a;seconds. Patients in the P group received a slow intravenous infusion of 0.05&#x0200a;mL/kg saline, followed by a 60-second infusion of 1 to 2&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol 90&#x0200a;seconds later. To maintain the anesthesia during the operation, 0.06&#x0200a;mg/kg etomidate in the E group, LPE group, MPE group, and HPE group and 0.50&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol in the P group was additionally administered every 4 minutes or when patients had a modified Bromage score of 5, as performed by Breen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The gastroscopy was performed under standard clinical protocols. A 6-mg dose of ephedrine was injected intravenously when intraoperative systemic blood pressure decreased to &#x0003c;80&#x0200a;mmHg or &#x0003c;30% of the basic value. A 0.3-mg dose of atropine was administered intravenously when HR decreased to &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;bmp. Hypoxemia was determined when SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;93%, and if the duration of hypoxemia was &#x0003e;30&#x0200a;seconds. Patients&#x02019; jaws were adjusted to improved ventilation, but if the hypoxemia did not improve, the patient was ventilated by simple respirator.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Measurement</title><p>Myoclonus was the primary focus of this study. Myoclonus occurred within 5 minutes after the etomidate injection was recorded by an anesthesiologist who was blind to the patients&#x02019; treatment. The severity of myoclonus was assessed according to a method by Doenicke et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and the intensity of myoclonic movement was graded as follows: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no myoclonus, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;mild myoclonus, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;moderate myoclonus, and 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;severe myoclonus.

Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events in the HPE group and the P group was lower than that in the E group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05).</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>These data indicated that low dosage of propofol (0.25&#x02013;0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg) pretreatment decreased the incidence of etomidate-related myoclonus, and the effect of myoclonus inhibition was more pronounced when combined with a dosage of propofol at 0.50&#x0200a;mg/kg and 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg. However, the incidence of adverse events, including the inhibition of respiration and circulation, increased as the propofol dosage increased. Etomidate was a kind of intravenous anesthetics, which was suitable for frail patients with unstable hemodynamics, but had some side effects, including myoclonus and cortical hormone suppression.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Propofol was the most commonly used intravenous anesthetics with some disadvantages on hemodynamics. How to take the advantages and prevent the shortcoming of the 2 anesthetics were the primary tasks in the process of anesthesia induction. Etomidate, a short-acting imidazole-derivative anesthetic, can rapidly enter the brain and other blood-rich organs after intravenous injection and can provide hypnotic effects in one arm-brain circulation time.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Etomidate is associated with some transient complications such as injection pain, adrenal suppression, and myoclonus. Injection pain may result from local irritation caused by etomidate,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> and adrenal suppression may result from reversible inhibition of 11-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol into cortisol.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, the explicit mechanism of myoclonus development remains unclear.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> In our study, the incidence of myoclonus in the etomidate group was 48.6%, which was close to the rate of 50% to 80% reported by Doenicke et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The slight difference might be because of the administration of 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg lidocaine in this study, which could inhibit the myoclonus partially induced by etomidate.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several agents have been reported to reduce myoclonus associated with etomidate in varying degrees. However, the exact neurological mechanism of myoclonus reduced by etomidate is unclear. Some studies explored that myoclonic activity might be associated with disinhibition of subcortical structures owing to inhibition at the spinal level or cerebral cortex, rather than being associated with epilepsy.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Another study indicated that the pathways related to skeletal muscle control became more sensitive to spontaneous nerve transmissions once GABA neurons were disrupted, causing myoclonic muscle movements.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Recently, some authors found that etomidate could modulate the desensitization of recombinant &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;1&#x003b4;/&#x003b2;3&#x003b1;1 GABAA receptors of the central nerve systerm.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Thus, we can deduce that etomidate suppressed the central nervous reticular activation system by interacting with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. By interrupting GABA neurons, the pathways associated with skeletal muscle control became more sensitive. These events ultimately led to myoclonic muscle contractions. Bai et al<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> found that propofol modulated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor deactivation and desensitization to some extent. In this study, propofol pretreatment at a lower dosage (0.25&#x02013;0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg) exerted inhibitory effects on myoclonus induced by etomidate. We inferred that propofol could have decreased the excitability of the central nervous system through the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens of the brain.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> However, the exact mechanism needs to be further clarified.</p><p>Etomidate itself has little effect on the circulatory system<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> and respiratory depression caused by etomidate was relatively transient. Values only became significantly lower than the control values during the 2nd minute after the induction,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> which may have resulted in an increase of approximately 15% of PaCO<sub>2</sub> but unchanged PaO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In this trial, as the dosage of propofol increased, the probability of respiratory and cardiovascular depression also increased, which was similar to a previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Numerous studies have found that propofol can reduce blood pressure by suppressing sympathetic activity, inhibiting myocardial contractility, and dilating blood vessels. However, an increase in propofol concentration within the therapeutic range causes a decrease in vascular-stressed volume without a change in CO.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Excessive dosage of propofol or rapid delivery can cause a decrease in respiratory frequency and tidal volume,<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> which may lead to respiratory depression and hypoxia. In this study, propofol pretreatment had little influence on respiration, possibly because the dosage used did not reach the threshold. Propofol can inhibit throat reflection and lead to apnea with the induction dosage indicated in the P group. Moreover, as mentioned above, the high-dose propofol pretreatment showed an impact on circulation. Therefore, the dosage of propofol should be balanced considering its advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>The dosage of anesthetics in this study was decided by the anesthesia depth, which was determined by propofol and etomidate interaction. Therefore, the propofol dose in the P group was higher than that in other groups, and the optimal dosage for each patient was individual, depending on the patient's status. Personalized medicine could have reduced the risk of hypoxia and excessive sedation in the P group. Therefore, just as Zhou et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> reported, etomidate plus propofol had few effects on respiration and circulation in patients undergoing gastroscopy and were safer and more effective than propofol alone.</p><p>Many drugs could inhibit etomidate-related myoclonus when administered in advance. However, pretreatment can cause adverse events such as prolonged recovery time induced by benzodiazepine; circulatory and respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity induced by opioids; and airway obstruction, reflux, and aspiration induced by muscle relaxants. Therefore, pretreatments should be limited to short durations and for minor operations. The ideal drugs used for pretreatment should be short-acting agents without significant effects on respiratory and circulatory parameters and no association with prolonged postoperative recovery time.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Thus, etomidate itself and low-dose propofol might be the ideal drugs for pretreatment. Aissaoui et al<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> found that pretreatment with a low dose (0.03&#x0200a;mg/kg) of etomidate at 60&#x0200a;seconds before induction with etomidate could effectively inhibit the development of myoclonus. In this study, we demonstrated that propofol pretreatment inhibited myoclonus induced by etomidate, and the pretreatment had no severe related side effects.</p><p>This clinical trial was performed for outpatients, and some information cannot be fully obtained. Previous studies showed that benzodiazepine medicine,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> opioids,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and dexmedetomidine<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> could prevent etomidate-related myoclonus. These factors may influence the outcomes of this study. Therefore, to avoid the influence induced by the above-mentioned factors, this study excluded the patients with possible influencing factors. Maybe many uncertain factors were not excluded, and this was a limitation. There were other limitations of this study. First, the exact anesthesia depth was not monitored during anesthesia induction, and it was not clear whether the inhibition of myoclonus owing to propofol was related to the anesthesia depth; second, the specific mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of propofol pretreatment on myoclonus induced by etomidate were not explored. Finally, in the LPE, MPE, and HPE groups, the dose of etomidate was 0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg, whereas 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg in the E group. The conventional induction dose of etomidate was 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg, whereas the conventional induction dose of propofol was 1.5 to 2.5&#x0200a;mg/kg. There was an additive effect of the anesthesia depth when the 2 agents applied together. Therefore, to avoid a deeper anesthesia and some unnecessary complications, such as low blood pressure and respiratory inhibition, we chose 0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg etomidate in the mixed medicine groups.</p><p>Additionally, the degree of myoclonus was most grade 1 and 2, and rare grade 3, which could induce muscle pain, elevate serum potassium, brain metabolic rate, and intraocular pressure, and even increase the rate of aspiration.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it was necessary to take some appropriate precautions to decrease the incidence of myoclonus. In this study, a low dose of propofol was pretreated and the dose of etomidate was decreased to 0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg from 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg, which eventually decreased the severity and incidence rate of myoclonus. Thus, the clinical effects on patients were significant.</p><p>In conclusion, 0.50&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol pretreatment before the anesthesia induction with etomidate had little influence on hemodynamics, and had few side effects on patients, including myoclonus. Propofol was the ideal drug to inhibit the myoclonus, and decreased the induction dose of etomidate in patients scheduled for painless gastroscopy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists status, ECG = electrocardiogram, HR = heart rate, MAP = mean arterial pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> = arterial oxygen saturation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>JL and RL contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lumley</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitwam</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group>
