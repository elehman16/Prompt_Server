They are available in most areas in England. Despite some evidence for their clinical and cost-effectiveness, recurrent concerns are expressed regarding discontinuity with other services and lack of focus on preventing future relapse and readmission to acute care. Currently evidence on how to prevent readmissions to acute care is limited. Self-management interventions, involving supporting service users in recognising and managing signs of their own illness and in actively planning their recovery, have some supporting evidence, but have not been tested as a means of preventing readmission to acute care in people leaving community crisis care. We thus proposed the current study to test the effectiveness of such an intervention. We selected peer support workers as the preferred staff to deliver such an intervention, as they are well-placed to model and encourage active and autonomous recovery from mental health problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The CORE (CRT Optimisation and Relapse Prevention) self-management trial compares the effectiveness of a peer-provided self-management intervention for people leaving CRT care, with treatment as usual supplemented by a booklet on self-management. The planned sample is 440 participants, including 40 participants in an internal pilot. The primary outcome measure is whether participants are readmitted to acute care over 1 year of follow-up following entry to the trial. Secondary outcomes include self-rated recovery at 4 and at 18 months following trial entry, measured using the Questionnaire on the Process of Recovery. Analysis will follow an intention to treatment principle. Random effects logistic regression modelling with adjustment for clustering by peer support worker will be used to test the primary hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The CORE self-management trial was approved by the London Camden and Islington Research Ethics Committee (REC ref: 12/LO/0988). A Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee oversee the progress of the study. We will report on the results of the clinical trial, as well as on the characteristics of the participants and their associations with relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Clinicians in primary and secondary care refer service users whom they believe to meet this criterion, and in some catchment areas, self-referrals are also accepted for assessment. Guidance regarding the model requires CRTs to &#x02018;gatekeep&#x02019; hospital beds, with no admissions occurring without their agreement, although this guidance is not always fully implemented in practice.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> They also accept early discharges of people who, without an intensive input at home, would have a prolonged stay on an inpatient ward. Since being mandated in the NHS Plan (2000),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> CRTs have proliferated and are now available in most NHS Trust catchment areas in England. Research evaluations have been mainly positive, suggesting CRTs reduce inpatient admissions<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref> and healthcare costs,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> and increase service user satisfaction with acute care.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7</xref> Service users, however, have reported considerable areas of dissatisfaction, including continuity of care between services during and following a period of CRT care.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Recent policy reports have also criticised CRTs for failings including lack of continuity and integration with other services, and insufficient attention to strategies for maintaining well-being and avoiding future crises.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;18</xref> This is a very significant gap as more than half of CRT users are reported to be readmitted to acute services within a year.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Thus demand for acute care in England remains very high in the absence of interventions to reduce repeat use.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A scoping review regarding interventions for mental health crisis care did not find robust evidence on how to prevent repeat crises in people leaving crisis care.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>The aim of the present study is to develop and test an intervention intended to achieve this. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines are followed in this report of the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Choice of comparators</title><sec id="s1b1"><title>Self-management intervention</title><p>There is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of self-management programmes supporting mental health service users to manage their own illness.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These commonly involve learning to anticipate and respond to signs of a crisis and developing skills to manage symptoms or other difficulties. The provision of peer support&#x02014;support provided by people who have themselves experienced mental ill health&#x02014;alongside existing aftercare services has also been advocated to improve outcomes for people who have just experienced a mental health crisis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Hypothesised qualities of peer workers include an ability to provide support and encouragement that is particularly warm and empathic due to being rooted in personal experience, and provision of a role model for recovery.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These qualities suggest that peer workers are a particularly appropriate choice for delivery of programmes aimed at enhancing recovery and proactive behaviours and self-care to remain well. North American trials of peer-provided self-management programmes such as the Wellness Recovery Action Plan<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the Recovery Workbook<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> report some promising outcomes for service users, but their impact on admissions or relapse has not been assessed. Our goal in the current study is to develop and test an intervention with a similar self-management focus for people leaving the care of crisis teams, aiming to reduce their subsequent readmission rates and dependence on services. The employment of peer support workers to deliver self-management support to service users is becoming increasingly common within National Health Service (NHS), promoted by initiatives such as the NHS Confederation <italic>Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change</italic> project,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> but thus far the effectiveness of such an intervention in reducing acute care readmission following a crisis has not to our knowledge been tested.</p></sec><sec id="s1b2"><title>Control intervention</title><p>Specific interventions to prevent relapse and promote recovery following a crisis are not currently routinely delivered in NHS settings; we are thus aiming to test whether investing in delivery of such an intervention is more effective than just providing service users with a simple resource to help them manage their mental health and recovery themselves. The control condition was therefore treatment as usual from any services to which CRT&#x000a0;users were referred on discharge, with participants also being sent the self-management manual on which the experimental intervention was based. This manual gives details of how to develop plans for relapse prevention and for setting recovery goals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Hypotheses/Objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The primary hypothesis to be tested is that service users receiving the experimental intervention will be less likely to relapse (indicated by readmission to acute care) over 1&#x02009;year than those in the control intervention receiving treatment as usual enhanced by access to a self-management manual. The anticipated admission rates at 1-year follow-up on which study power calculation was based were 50% for control and 35% for intervention&#x000a0;groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Secondary hypotheses are to test whether being in the experimental rather than the control condition is associated with longer time to first admission to acute care and fewer days in acute care over 1&#x02009;year, and also in better perceived recovery and illness management, greater satisfaction with services, fewer symptoms, less loneliness, enhanced social networks and greater social inclusion at the 4-month and the 18-month follow-up interviews than participants in the control condition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A further objective was to conduct a health economic evaluation to calculate the probability that peer-provided self-management is cost-effective compared with control over 1&#x02009;year for a range of values of willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A secondary analysis will calculate cost per QALY gained over 18 months.</p><p>A planned secondary use of the data is to investigate a set of hypotheses regarding loneliness, social isolation and social capital and outcomes following a crisis; these will be separately reported and disseminated.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Trial design</title><p>The CORE (CRT Optimisation and Relapse Prevention) trial of a peer-provided self-management intervention is a rater-blind, randomised controlled superiority trial with two parallel arms (allocation ratio 1:1), designed to test the hypotheses above.

Four are in London, one in the South East of England and one in the South West. Areas include inner city, suburban, mixed and rural catchment areas. All the&#x000a0;CRTs aim to operate according to the standard NHS model. All teams are contactable 24&#x02009;hours a day and see service users primarily in their homes, offering short-term care during the crisis before discharge to other secondary or primary care services as appropriate for further management. Structured self-management interventions are not widely implemented in these catchment areas,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> so that both control and experimental arms are receiving an additional intervention.

With this aim of achieving broad representativeness of CRT service users, we also set a threshold at each study site of at least 50% of participants to be identified at screening as having schizophrenia or other psychosis, or bipolar disorder. Within this stipulation, participation has been offered to all eligible service users in participating CRTs until the recruitment target for the service has been reached.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Experimental group intervention</title><p>The peer-provided self-management intervention tested in the study has been adapted from recovery resources compiled by Dr Rachel Perkins, Dr Julie Repper and colleagues at South West London and St George&#x02019;s NHS Foundation Trust,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> specifically their Personal Recovery Plan. This was in turn informed by self-management resources such as the Wellness Recovery Action Plan<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and relapse prevention interventions.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><sec id="s2c1a"><title>Selection and development of the intervention</title><p>The intervention was adapted and selected via the following stages, more fully described in a companion paper:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Initial searches: Systematic literature searches were carried out to find relevant literature on self-management interventions for people with mental health problems, and on peer support interventions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A literature and internet search was also carried out and key experts consulted to identify relevant resources for self-management interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Individual interviews to inform intervention selection: In individual interviews with 41 consenting service users, their views were explored of the types of intervention that would be feasible and useful following a crisis, how they should be offered and delivered, and the potential benefits and risks of having a peer worker deliver the interventions. These interviews were carried out by service user researchers, and were also used to elicit data relevant to the other workstream included in the CORE study, involving development and testing of an intervention to improve CRT fidelity.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stakeholder focus groups and adaptation of the intervention: Informed by this work, the Personal Recovery Plan<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> was identified by the study team and advisory groups of service users and carers, and of clinicians, involved in the study as the most promising basis for the study intervention. A series of stakeholder focus groups was then convened for discussion on how to fit this intervention within existing care pathways. The groups usually comprised six to eight participants. Twelve groups of consenting participants were convened in all: five of people with experience of using crisis services, five of CRT staff and two of carers with experience of crisis services. Following this step, the Personal Recovery Plan was adapted with the permission of its authors and under licence from the copyright holders, South West London and St George&#x02019;s Mental Health Trust, to fit the context of the trial, including adaptations to make it as relevant as possible to people who have recently experienced a crisis. A protocol was also developed for peer support worker training, and for delivery of the intervention in the context of the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Feasibility study: Following this, an uncontrolled feasibility study was conducted to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Four peer support workers were given a 4-day training in fundamentals of delivering peer support and in the delivery of our draft self-management intervention: an abbreviated and tailored version of the Nottingham Institute of Mental Health&#x02019;s accredited peer support worker training. Eleven participants were recruited from an inner city CRT and gave informed consent to receive the intervention over 10 sessions. Following the intervention period, a group interview was conducted with the peer support workers and individual interviews with the service user participants (n=9). Experiences of the intervention and suggestions for adaptation were explored and further minor modifications introduced throughout the intervention.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="s2c1b"><title>Delivery of the intervention</title><p>The intervention is delivered in a series of up to 10 sessions with a peer support worker. Each trial participant is allocated to one peer support worker. If participants specifically requested a peer support worker of their own gender, this is arranged, but no attempt beyond this is made to match peer support workers and participants. There is no consensus in the literature<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> on whether, and on the basis of which characteristics, peer support workers and clients need to be matched. In practice, with three peer support workers available in each CRT, we anticipated being unable to match on many characteristics, and felt that attempting to do so may restrict generalisability to routine NHS settings, where matching is often not feasible. The peer support worker offers sympathetic listening and seeks to instil hope through appropriate sharing of skills and coping strategies acquired in their own recovery journey. The intervention is structured round the completion of a Personal Recovery Workbook with the following structured components:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>setting personal recovery goals</p></list-item><list-item><p>help with plans to re-establish community functioning and support networks following a crisis</p></list-item><list-item><p>using the experience of recent crisis to identify early warning signs and an action plan to avoid or attenuate relapse</p></list-item><list-item><p>planning strategies and coping resources to maintain well-being once a crisis has abated.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Meetings take place weekly, with the aim of completing the programme of up to 10 sessions within 3&#x02009;months. The peer support worker encourages the participant to consider involving friends and family in the intervention, by showing them materials from the meetings, eliciting their help with making crisis plans or inviting them to attend a meeting. Unless clinical staff identify any risks necessitating that meetings should take place on NHS premises, they take place in the location preferred by the participants, which can be their homes, an appropriate public space or NHS premises.</p></sec><sec id="s2c1c"><title>Peer support workers and their training</title><p>Peer support workers have been recruited and employed by participating NHS Trusts for the study. All are people who have themselves experienced mental health problems and used mental health services, an agreed essential requirement for a mental health peer support worker.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> We did not require CRT use, as we were not aiming for a high level of matching of participant and peer support worker experiences. More restrictive criteria might also have resulted in difficulty in prompt recruitment of people with the required personal skills as well as experience. An introductory programme of training has been arranged by the study team. This includes familiarising peer support workers with the study workbook and how to support participants in using it. It also covers more generic issues such as safety, confidentiality, appropriate self-disclosure, roles and boundaries, engagement and listening skills, and cultural sensitivity. Additional induction required by participating NHS Trusts has also been attended by peer workers. An experienced peer support worker from the study team additionally met each peer support team during the trial. A programme of group supervision has also been established by the peer workers, facilitated by clinicians from the employing Trust. Peer support workers have been encouraged to use this additional supervision to discuss general issues arising from using the Personal Recovery Workbook or from their role as a peer supporter (not specific clinical concerns relating to participants, which are addressed by local NHS supervisors), and to discuss needs for any additional &#x02018;top-up&#x02019; training, to be provided as required by the study team. Standard NHS Trust procedures are followed regarding confidentiality, safety and lone working for both peer support workers and researchers, including seeing service users on NHS premises when there are safety concerns and checking researchers are safe following all contacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Control intervention</title><p>In the control condition, participants are sent a Personal Recovery Workbook to complete by themselves or with family and friends if they wish; this has the same content as in the experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Discontinuation criteria</title><p>Participants may withdraw from the intervention at any time without giving a reason.

during the follow-up period of 50% in the control group versus 35% in the experimental group, with 80% power and 5% significance. We have based group allocation on an initial allocation rate of 1:1.37 prior to adjustment for clustering, resulting in 159 in the intervention arm and 217 in the control arm. The intervention arm is then inflated for clustering (peer support worker) using an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.03, and after rounding this gives 220 participants in the intervention arm and 220 participants in the control arm (a total of 440 participants) from six CRTs, all in different NHS Trusts. Thus our initial allocation rate has been selected so as to result in equal numbers following inflation for clustering, making trial randomisation logistically more straightforward. An intraclass correlation coefficient of&#x000a0;0.03&#x000a0;is confirmed as a relatively conservative estimate by a meta-analysis of therapist effects in low-intensity mental health interventions.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> It is expected that, on average, there will be at least four peer support workers within each CRT, with an average cluster size of 11. Of these 440 participants, 40 were recruited during the internal pilot conducted in one Trust only to establish acceptability of our trial procedures and feasibility of recruitment to a randomised controlled trial of the intervention. It was agreed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the study funders that changes to study procedures and to the intervention following this internal pilot were sufficiently minimal (increased support for peer support workers; addition of measures of loneliness, social network, social capital and social outcome) for the internal pilot sample to be included within the main study sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Recruitment strategies</title><p>Close liaison is maintained by research staff with the participating CRT staff, who have been strongly encouraged to consider every CRT client&#x02019;s eligibility for the trial. Leaflets, a website and a Twitter account are among the methods used to raise awareness of the study among staff and local service users.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods: assignment of interventions</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Group allocation</title><p>Following baseline assessment, consenting clients are block-randomised into treatment and control groups, stratified by site. Randomisation is conducted by the study data officer or trial manager using an independent randomisation service, &#x02018;Sealed Envelope&#x02019; commissioned by the Priment Clinical Trials Unit. Once the data officer learns from &#x02018;Sealed Envelope&#x02019; which group participants have been allocated to, and once the participant has been discharged from the CRT, the data officer contacts participants to let them know and, for those in the treatment group, to confirm arrangements that a peer support worker will contact them.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Blinding</title><p>It is not feasible to blind participants to whether they are allocated to the treatment or control group. Data for the study&#x02019;s primary outcome (readmission to acute care during the follow-up period) are provided by administrators from participating NHS Trusts, who are not informed by researchers of participants&#x02019; treatment allocation. The study data officer or trial manager conducts randomisation and informs the CRT which treatment group each participant has been allocated to. To avoid discharge plans being influenced by the availability of a peer support worker, we delay disclosing group allocation until the point of CRT discharge. Blinding of other clinicians involved in care following discharge is not feasible as Trust clinical procedures require peer support workers to record visits in electronic records. The data officer, or sometimes in their absence the trial manager, also conducts the section of the follow-up interview with participants in the treatment group which relates to their experience of the intervention. Study researchers, blind to participants&#x02019; allocation status, conduct the 4-month and 18-month follow-up interviews. Maintaining blinding of researchers is not likely to be achieved in full for secondary outcomes collected during a follow-up interview, as it is likely some participants may disclose in the course of the follow-up interview whether they have received the peer-supported programme. Researchers seek to minimise this by prompting participants not to disclose which trial group they were in, both when setting up interviews and during the interview itself. Data will be analysed blind to allocation with the exception of the RPRS, which will be analysed after the analyses of other outcomes have been checked and agreed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods: data collection, management and analysis</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Baseline interviews</title><p>Once written consent to participate in the study has been obtained, but before participants are randomly allocated to intervention or control groups, a study researcher completes the study baseline measures with all participants as a structured interview. This interview takes about 1&#x02009;hour to complete. It may take place at the participant&#x02019;s home, NHS or university premises, as the participant prefers within any limits advised by CRT clinicians during the recruitment process. Following completion, participants are offered a &#x000a3;20 gift of cash to acknowledge their time and help with the study.</p><p>Researchers were given specific training in using the BPRS outcome measure, which unlike other study outcome measures is not participant self-report, but requires the researcher to rate symptoms in 24 domains, based on a structured interview. Training was delivered by the trial manager and the principal research clinician on the study; it involved guidance and practice at interviewing and rating subjects using role play and videos of clinical interviews. Researchers&#x02019; practice ratings were assessed against agreed correct ratings, and further training provided in the event of unreliable scoring.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Follow-up interviews at 4 and 18 months</title><p>At these time points, researchers contact participants again using their preferred contact details. They remind participants of the study details, and ask if they are willing to meet to complete the follow-up. If so, the researcher sends another copy of the study information sheet and arranges a time and place to meet. At this meeting, the researcher again seeks written informed consent from the participant to complete the follow-up research interview, and completes an interview if this is obtained. If for any reason (eg, a move to a distant part of the country) a participant is willing but a face-to-face interview is not feasible, a phone interview is offered, but the BPRS not completed as this depends on observer ratings.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Data from patient records</title><p>Once all participants from a participating NHS Trust have been recruited into the study, a study researcher contacts the appropriate administrators or informatics team within the Trust regarding collection of data from patient records. The study researchers provide a list of consenting participants&#x02019; names, dates of birth and study identification numbers and a standardised schedule of the information required for each patient, with the time period for which data are needed clearly specified. Administrators are then asked to provide the data to the research team, identifying each patient by study ID number only to avoid data protection risks from transferring identifiable patient data.</p><p>One year after all participants from a participating NHS Trust have been recruited into the study (6&#x02009;months and 1&#x02009;year for the pilot trial), a study researcher again contacts the Trust&#x02019;s administrators to collect outcomes data, using similar procedures to those described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Minimising loss to follow-up</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Research Ethics Committee approval allows data on the primary outcome to be collected even if participants are lost to follow-up, minimising missing values on this measure.

Participant consent forms, contact details and a single master copy linking participants&#x02019; names and IDs are held separately from other data.</p><p>Data are entered using a web-based system set up by Sealed Envelope. This has been set up so that it mirrors the data collection sheets in order. It also has range checks and consistency checks, and for closed questions gives a number of options plus &#x02018;other&#x02019; where appropriate. Assessors who enter data have no access to the group allocation through this system.</p><p>With the checks in place, there should not be any issues with illegal values being entered or inconsistent data being entered, so necessary cleaning should be minimal. However, data are checked by the statistician before analysis and any problems reported to the assistant/trial manager, who rectifies them as appropriate before data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4d1"><title>General principles</title><p>The assumptions underpinning each statistical method will be checked. For example, normality and equality of variances will be checked for t-tests. The use of transformations or non-parametric methods will be considered if assumptions do not hold. Adjusted analyses will be performed if baseline imbalances are observed. The impact of missing data will be explored in all analyses. Supportive analyses will be performed if non-compliance is considered to be a problem.</p><p>The primary analyses will be complete case. All analyses will be performed according to the original assigned randomisation groups. Data will be analysed using Stata Version 14.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>Initial analyses will look at summary statistics for all variables, both overall and by randomised group. Summary statistics for continuous variables will be mean, median, standard deviation, lower quartile, upper quartile, minimum and maximum. These variables will also be plotted to check their distribution. If variables are skewed, then median and interquartile ranges will be reported, otherwise mean and standard deviationwill be reported. Summary statistics for categorical variables will be frequency and percentage within each category. No statistical significance tests for baseline characteristics by randomised group will be performed, but balance will be assessed visually.</p><sec id="s4e1"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Data on readmission during the study period will be analysed using logistic regression with random intercepts, with clustering by peer support worker being modelled using random effects. Those in the control group will be considered to be clusters of size 1 for analysis purposes. Condition (psychosis vs no psychosis) and centre will be entered into the model as fixed effects. This analysis will be reported in terms of an odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4e2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>For the analysis of the scales, linear regression with random intercepts will be used (with peer support worker as the random effect), controlling for the baseline value of the outcome, condition (psychosis vs no psychosis) and centre. These will be reported in terms of mean difference in outcome between the two randomised groups with associated 95% CIs.</p><p>To assess the total days spent in acute care, we will perform Poisson regression analysis with random intercepts, with the peer support worker being entered as a random effect. Centre will be entered into the model as a fixed effect. This analysis will be reported as coefficient and 95% CI.</p><p>Time to first readmission during the study period will be analysed using Cox regression frailty model. However, if the frailty model fails to converge, then Cox regression with robust SEs will be used. The condition (psychosis vs no psychosis) and centre will be added as fixed effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4e3"><title>Supportive analyses</title><p>Supportive analyses using methods analagous to the primary analyses will be conducted on the primary outcome, adjusting for any marked differences in randomised groups in terms of: demographic characteristics, service use in the year preceding entry to the study and scores on outcome measures; amount of improvement for both groups between baseline and follow-up. Aalyses of outcomes will be conducted adjusting for non-compliant participants in the treatment group using a dichotomous variable, with compliant defined as three or more meetings attended. Aalyses will also be carried out with adjustment for whether peer support schemes were already established in the catchment area or newly introduced for the study. Those in the treatment as usual group will be assigned to the same category as those who are non-compliant in the intervention group.</p><p>Participants attending fewer than three meetings with a peer support worker will be defined as non-compliant.

These meet regularly to monitor trial progress and advise on any proposed amendments. The DMC comprises three senior academics with experience of trials and mental health services research: a clinical academic psychologist who chairs the DMC, a non-clinical social scientist and a statistician. The DMC is independent of the sponsor; it has no competing interests. Minutes and recommendations from DMC meetings are sent by the DMC Chair to the Chair of the Independent TSC in advance of TSC meetings.</p><p>No interim analyses are planned, but the trial standard operating procedures (agreed by the Priment Clinical Trials Unit, which oversees this trial) require all adverse incidents of any kind to be reported in the first place to the Chair of the TSC. Criteria for defining adverse events are agreed with the overseeing Clinical Trials Unit. Adverse events are monitored by the trial manager and the study data officer through monthly checks with peer support workers&#x02019; supervisors at each site and monthly screening of NHS patient records, arranged by the supervisor or the site principal investigator at each site. Adverse events are recorded on a standard form by the study data officer, with information provided by an involved clinician from the NHS site. They&#x000a0;are then assessed for severity and study-relatedness by the study chief investigator, who acts as the trial&#x02019;s clinical reviewer, and the Chair in the independent TSC, who acts as an independent clinical reviewer and makes the final judgement about study-relatedness and any need to alert the DMC immediately. Participant deaths are&#x000a0;reviewed immediately by the Chair of the DMC. Any study-related serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the sponsor and the Research Ethics Committee.

At this stage, clinicians will screen out service users who are unwilling participate in the study, who pose a serious risk of harm to others or who clearly lack capacity to provide consent. Clinicians note this willingness to be contacted in clinical records and then pass on names and contact details to researchers. A study researcher contacts potential participants to explain what the study involves and answers any questions. For those still willing to participate, the researcher sends a written information sheet about the study and arranges a time to meet potential participants to seek written informed consent.
