We investigated the efficiency and cost of human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy old (<italic>N</italic> = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (<italic>N</italic> = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task or &#x0201c;resting&#x0201d; state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06&#x02013;0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties&#x02014;supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost&#x02014;which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>It is increasingly evident that many complex networks, in diverse fields and over a wide range of spatial and time scales, may have topological properties in common. These unifying organizational principles have been described in terms of &#x0201c;small-world&#x0201d; parameters&#x02014;meaning that many networks have both local clustering of connections and a short path length between any pair of nodes. Recent work has shown that we can also define small-world networks as having high global and local efficiency of parallel information transfer; and that many networks are economical in the sense of supporting high efficiency for low cost. Here we extend these ideas for the first time to an analysis of human brain functional networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We show that human brain functional networks have economical small-world properties and that economical performance of these networks is detrimentally but differently affected by normal aging and by treatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist. The results illustrate concepts and techniques that could be important in further exploration of developmental, pathological, and pharmacological effects on human brain functional networks. They are also likely to be generalisable to applications in other fields of computational biology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Achard S, Bullmore E (2007) Efficiency and cost of economical brain functional networks.

Nervous systems are complex networks at multiple scales of time and space. It has been shown that brain anatomical and functional networks are topologically intermediate between highly regular lattices and random graphs [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In other words, brain networks have characteristically small-world properties of dense or clustered local connectivity with relatively few long-range connections mediating a short path length between any pair of neurons or regions in the network [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Small-world topology is an attractive model for brain network organization because it could support both segregated and distributed information processing [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], confer resilience against pathological attack [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and minimise wiring costs [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. From an evolutionary perspective, it can be argued that small-world brain networks have been competitively selected to solve the economic problem of maximising information processing efficiency while minimising costs [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Hypotheses and Study Design</title><p>To test directly the hypothesis that small-world brain functional networks have economical properties, we measured global and local efficiency of parallel information processing, as a function of cost, in networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Economical network organization has been previously defined in terms of high efficiency <italic>E</italic> on the basis of low cost <italic>K</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Efficiency was defined as a function of the minimum path length between regions; the most simple measure of cost was defined as the number of edges or connections in the network; both metrics were expressed in proportion to the maximum efficiency and cost of a comparable network comprising all possible connections between regions [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We predicted that brain functional networks would generally demonstrate economical small-world properties of high global and local efficiency for low cost. The functional connectivity between each possible pair of <italic>N</italic> = 90 regional fMRI time series was first estimated in the low-frequency interval 0.06&#x02013;0.11 Hz using wavelet correlation analysis [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The resulting wavelet correlation matrices (one for each participant in the study) were then thresholded to produce a set of undirected graphs representing the brain functional network for each participant, and the efficiency of each network was measured as a function of variable cost in the range 0.01 &#x02264; <italic>K</italic> &#x02264; 0.5, which is equivalent to 1%&#x02013;50% of all possible edges in a (fully connected) network of <italic>N</italic> = 90 nodes.</p><p>We were also interested to test the subsidiary hypothesis that the economical performance of small-world brain functional networks would be adversely affected by normal aging and by pharmacological blockade of dopamine neurotransmission. We therefore acquired and analysed fMRI data from two age-defined groups of healthy volunteers&#x02014;a young group (<italic>N</italic> = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) and an older group (<italic>N</italic> = 11; mean age = 66.5 years)&#x02014;each scanned in a no-task or resting state on two separate occasions following oral administration either of placebo or of sulpiride 400 mg, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Methodological Motivations</title><p>Given the very large number of ways in which a dataset of this complexity could be analysed, it is reasonable to ask how this particular sequence of operations&#x02014;wavelet correlation analysis followed by thresholding and economical small-world analysis of the resulting graphs&#x02014;was motivated a priori.</p><p>We used <italic>wavelets</italic> for estimation of functional connectivity in these data because of prior evidence indicating that cortical fMRI time series often have long memory in time (slowly decaying positive autocorrelation), or a 1/<italic>f</italic> power spectrum in the frequency domain [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This property argues against measuring functional connectivity between a pair of fMRI time series by estimation of their covariance or correlation in the time domain, or their coherence in the frequency domain, because both time- and frequency-domain estimators of association are not properly estimable for long memory processes [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The wavelet domain, on the other hand, is technically advantageous for analysis of long memory and potentially nonstationary fMRI time series [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, the wavelet coefficients of a long memory process are stationary, and wavelet-based estimators of the correlation between two long memory processes have been shown to have desirable statistical properties [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An additional advantage of wavelet-based connectivity analysis, shared in common with approaches in the frequency domain, is that it allows us to focus on the functional association between brain regions subtended by activity in a defined frequency interval or wavelet scale. This is attractive for an application to resting-state fMRI data because there is prior evidence indicating that functional connectivity between regions is typically greatest at frequencies less than 0.1 Hz [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas non-neural sources of resting state correlations, such as aliased cardiorespiratory effects, are subtended by higher frequencies [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. (We return in the Discussion section to the question of what oscillations or correlations at these so-called infraslow frequencies might represent.)</p><p>The rationale for <italic>thresholding</italic> was simply that we wished to focus attention on the topology of relatively sparse (low-cost) networks, representing the strongest functional connections or largest wavelet correlations. This is broadly justified by the known sparsity of anatomical connections in non-human and human nervous systems; in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> for example, less than 6% of all possible unweighted synaptic connections exist between neurons [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are, of course, methods for analysis of functional connectivity matrices that do not demand preliminary thresholding; one could perhaps apply principal component analysis to the wavelet correlation matrix to produce frequency-specific eigenimages. However, here we were interested primarily in the topological properties of networks or graphs&#x02014;and thresholding is a necessary step in the derivation of graphs, whether weighted or unweighted, from any continuous measure of association between variables. The choice of threshold then becomes a critical issue which we addressed by estimating and integrating network efficiency over a range of correlation thresholds equivalent to costs in the range 0.01 &#x02264; <italic>K</italic> &#x02264; 0.5 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p><p>The main motivation for our adoption of the relatively novel <italic>metrics of network efficiency</italic>, first defined by Latora and Marchiori [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], was our hypothetical interest in directly estimating the economical performance of small-world brain functional networks. We note that global and local efficiency have previously been estimated for anatomical networks in macaque and cat cortex [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030017-t001">Table 1</xref>); however, there has been no previous application of these economical small-world metrics to human brain functional network analysis. Global efficiency (<italic>E<sub>global</sub>,</italic>
<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030017-e001">Equation 1</xref>) is inversely related to the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; small-world metric of average minimum path length, <italic>L</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi-0030017-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, a small-world network will have <italic>E<sub>global</sub></italic> greater than (<italic>L</italic> less than) a regular lattice but <italic>E<sub>global</sub></italic> less than (<italic>L</italic> greater than) a random network. This strong inverse relation might suggest that the two metrics are of equal merit in any application; however, efficiency offers a number of technical and conceptual advantages. First, average minimum path length was defined only for connected graphs, i.e., graphs in which all nodes are connected as part of one giant cluster or large subgraph, yet application of high thresholds to correlation matrices may result in one or more of the less strongly connected regions becoming disconnected from the giant cluster. In this case, the path length between the disconnected region and the rest of the network will be infinite, whereas the contribution of the disconnected region to the global efficiency of the network will be zero. Thus, inverting path length in the calculation of global efficiency simplifies the numerical issues in estimating efficiency of unconnected regions. More generally, we can see that inversion of path length also has the intuitively desirable effect of weighting global efficiency by the contribution of the most highly connected regions or &#x0201c;hubs,&#x0201d; whereas average minimum path length is weighted by the least connected regions or &#x0201c;diaspora.&#x0201d;</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-0030017-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Efficiency <italic>E</italic> and Cost <italic>K</italic> Parameters for Brain Networks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0030017.t001"/></table-wrap><p>Second, average minimum path length was defined only for unweighted graphs (in which the connections or edges between nodes are all assigned equal value 1); whereas the efficiency metrics are applicable both to unweighted and weighted graphs (in which the edges are assigned different values depending on the continuously variable strength of functional association or the physical distance between nodes). Here we will focus mostly on the simpler case of unweighted graph analysis but we also rehearse the formulation of efficiency metrics for weighted graphs and report some additional results for analysis of brain networks weighted by the strength of functional association between regions. Third, path length provides a measure of the network's capacity for serial information transfer between nodes, whereas global efficiency is a measure of the network's capacity for parallel information transfer between nodes via multiple series of edges. Since there is strong prior evidence that the brain supports massively parallel information processing, it seems conceptually preferable to adopt efficiency metrics of brain functional network topology.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030017-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Small-World Properties of Human Brain Functional Networks</title><p>Global and local efficiency (<italic>y</italic>-axis) as a function of cost (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for a random graph, a regular lattice, and brain networks.

More locally, both age and sulpiride impaired regional efficiency of dorsal cingulate gyrus, which is known to receive a major dopaminergic input and to be vulnerable to regressive changes in normal aging. However, the effects of age were generally more salient and extensive, involving several frontal and limbic/paralimbic regions that were not significantly affected by sulpiride. We conclude that attenuated dopamine transmission may contribute to age-related impairments in functional network efficiency, but it seems likely that additional mechanisms must be invoked to account for the topological marginalisation of medial temporal and frontal regions in older people.

<italic>,</italic> for a given network can be normalised by dividing these quantities by the maximum efficiencies and number of edges that would be observed in the ideal case that the graph included all possible <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic> &#x02212; 1)/2 edges. By this normalization, we have 0 &#x02264; {<italic>E<sub>global</sub></italic>,<italic>E<sub>local</sub></italic>,<italic>K</italic>} &#x02264; 1. Here we define the cost efficiency as the difference between global efficiency and cost, <italic>E<sub>global</sub></italic> &#x02212; <italic>K,</italic> which will be positive in the case of an economical network.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Weighted brain functional networks.</title><p>The computation of efficiency and cost can be generalised to weighted graphs. In this case, we require a weighting matrix <italic>D</italic> (same dimension, <italic>N</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>N,</italic> as the corresponding adjacency matrix <italic>A</italic> of the graph), whose <italic>d<sub>ij</sub></italic> elements represent additional information about the cost of the edges. Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to search the weighted edge matrix to find the shortest weighted path length <italic>l<sub>i</sub></italic>

The efficiency of communication between nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> is then measured by global, regional, and local efficiency of the weighted graph, simply derived from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030017-e001">Equations 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030017-e003">3</xref> by substituting <italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub> with <italic>l<sub>i</sub></italic>

<italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub>. As for unweighted graph analysis, efficiency and cost parameters can be normalised with respect to the maximum values observed when all the nodes of the graph are connected.</p><p>The main concern in modeling weighted networks is the choice of a weighting matrix. For a spatially embedded network like the brain it would generally be appropriate to use some measure of physical distance between nodes as a weighting factor. However, the length of axonal tracts between human brain regions is not yet well-known. An alternative weighting factor, more easily estimated, is a measure of the functional distance between connected regions, e.g., <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub> = 1 &#x02212; <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub>
<italic>,</italic> where <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub> is the wavelet correlation coefficient for regions <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030017-sg002">Figure S2</xref> for an analysis of functionally weighted networks that is directly comparable to the analysis of unweighted networks reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030017-g004">Figure 4</xref> on the basis of the same experimental data. It can be seen that the pattern of results for unweighted and functionally weighted networks is very similar in these data.</p><sec id="s4f1"><title>Comparison of network parameters between age and treatment groups.</title><p>To assess the significance of group differences in unweighted network topology, we used a two-way mixed-effects ANOVA model comprising age (young, old) as a between-subject factor, drug (placebo, sulpiride) as a within-subject factor, and the age by drug interaction. This model was separately fitted to each of the following dependent variables: global and local efficiency of sparsely thresholded networks with <italic>K</italic> &#x0223c; 0.1; global and local efficiency curves integrated over the small-world regime of costs, 0.05 &#x02264; <italic>K</italic> &#x02264; 0.34; maximum-cost efficiency; and nodal efficiency for each region in the individually estimated brain functional networks. If main effects were significant by ANOVA, post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests were also conducted for the following comparisons: young people after placebo (YP) versus old people after placebo (OP), young people after sulpiride (YS) versus old people after sulpiride (OS); YP versus YS; OP versus OS.</p><p>Note that the results of the multiple ANOVAs entailed for a region-by-region analysis of nodal efficiency were regarded as significant if <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, i.e., there was no correction for multiple comparisons.
