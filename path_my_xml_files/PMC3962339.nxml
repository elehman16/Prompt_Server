Limited data exist on inflammation during pregnancy or postpartum in HIV-infected women, though certain inflammatory markers are associated with adverse health outcomes among HIV-infected persons.</p><p>We measured hsCRP, D-dimer, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; at 34 weeks gestation and six months postpartum in HIV-infected women from the Botswana Mashi PMTCT trial who were randomized to breastfeeding or formula-feeding. Differences in inflammatory markers between gestation and postpartum periods, and by randomized feeding method, were estimated using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for baseline plasma HIV-1 viral load, CD4 count, calendar time, and antiretroviral treatment status. Additionally, we studied the association between marker concentrations at six months postpartum and major adverse clinical events over the following 4.5 years, using case-cohort sampling and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.</p><p>In 86 breastfeeding and 75 formula-feeding women, hsCRP and D-dimer decreased significantly between 34 weeks gestation and six months postpartum, while IFN-&#x003b3; increased. There was no significant association between inflammatory marker change and randomized feeding method after adjusting for multiple comparisons and removing outliers. In univariate analysis, TNF-&#x003b1;, D-dimer, and IFN-&#x003b3; concentrations at six months postpartum were significant predictors of subsequent clinical events, and TNF-&#x003b1; remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.16, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).</p><p>In young HIV-infected women in Botswana inflammatory marker concentrations did not differ significantly between women who breast- vs. formula-fed.

Similarly, a trend toward more rapid progression to AIDS or death was observed at six months postpartum in women randomized to breastfeeding in the Botswana Mashi trial, possibly as a result of higher maternal inflammation as suggested by CRP level, despite similar micronutrient level <xref rid="pone.0089928-Lockman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

We used stored samples and data from the completed Mashi mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) prevention trial in Botswana (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00197587). The Mashi trial randomized 1200 HIV-infected women to six months of breastfeeding plus six months of infant zidovudine prophylaxis, or to formula-feeding plus infant zidovudine for one month, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0089928-Thior1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Women in the breastfeeding arm were asked to exclusively breastfeed for five months then initiate weaning in order to fully wean to formula by six months postpartum. Women were enrolled between 33 and 35 weeks' gestation during 2001 to 2003, and were followed for up to five years postpartum. HIV RNA plasma viral load and CD4 cell count were tested at enrollment (&#x0223c;34 weeks gestation), delivery, and then approximately every six months postpartum for at least two years (plasma was stored at these time points). All women received zidovudine from enrollment through delivery; in 2002 (19 months into enrollment), three-drug ART became available and was offered to all HIV-infected infants and to all women with a CD4 count &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x000b5;l or history of an AIDS-defining illness.

Grade 3 or 4 conditions that were assumed to have no relationship to inflammation and/or HIV disease were excluded (e.g. repeat pregnancy, injury, migraine headache). A case was defined as a woman who had a six-month postpartum sample available for testing and experienced a major adverse clinical event after eight months postpartum but no previous major adverse clinical event documented by the study team prior to this time. Women in the cohort were those selected for the first study aim who also did not experience any adverse clinical events prior to eight-months postpartum in order to reduce the likelihood that biomarker concentrations at six months were influenced by concurrent illness (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;149, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089928-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; five formula-feeding and seven breastfeeding women who experienced illness prior to eight months were excluded from this case-cohort sample).

All ELISA and Cobas reagents were from the same lot for all tests.

For Aim 1 we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to compare inflammatory marker concentrations over time and whether feeding arm was significantly associated with changes over time, using a binomial link for dichotomous and an identity link for continuous markers (each marker in a separate equation). To account for differences between feeding arms at enrollment, and previously published associations between plasma viral load/CD4 T cell count and inflammation, all models were adjusted for CD4 T cell count, HIV-1 plasma viral load, calendar time, and for ART initiation between enrollment and six months postpartum. As a high proportion of samples had concentrations below the level of detection (62% for IFN-&#x003b3;, 69% for IL-10, and 41% for TNF-&#x003b1;), these were modeled as detected/undetected dichotomous observations. Breastfeeding and undetected inflammatory marker, where applicable, were the referents in all models. Although feeding strategy was randomized, mean enrollment values of hsCRP and TNF-&#x003b1; were significantly different at baseline between the strata. Sensitivity analyses including these variables were performed for all models. The main model outcomes were time (34 weeks gestation or six months postpartum), group (feeding strategy arm), and group*time (interaction) covariates. For IL-6, a small group of influential observations (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11, Pearson residuals &#x0003c;&#x02212;4) had values near the lower limit of detection of the assay, and removing these outliers influenced the statistical significance of the time covariate (from a p-value of .037 to .23) and group*time interaction (from a p-value of &#x0003c;.001 to .08). When compared to the rest of the subcohort, the outliers had no unique characteristics: no common test date, assay batch, or clinical characteristics of the participants. The significant influence of this small number of observations led us to remove them from our analyses, but kept them in the calculation of means for completeness in our reporting.</p><p>Aim 2 (association of inflammatory markers with subsequent morbidity/mortality) was investigated using Cox Proportional Hazards models with appropriate weighting for our case-cohort design <xref rid="pone.0089928-Kulathinal1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Univariate and multivariate models were fit for each proinflammatory marker. The adjusted models included the following covariates: maternal age at enrollment, six month postpartum HIV RNA viral load, six month postpartum CD4 T cell count, randomized feeding arm, and delivery calendar time represented by 12 three-month periods (calendar time of delivery adjusts for potential changes in public health practice).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>We selected at random 86 women from the breastfeeding and 75 women from the formula-feeding arms of the Mashi Study.

The hypothesis that inflammation would be further increased in the peri- and postpartum periods for HIV-positive women is supported indirectly by some reports that CD4 T cell counts declined during pregnancy for women on triple antiretroviral therapy <xref rid="pone.0089928-Mayanja1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and HIV RNA increases from delivery through the first 80 weeks postpartum for women not on therapy or on mono- or combination therapy <xref rid="pone.0089928-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Viral load has been linked to increased inflammation <xref rid="pone.0089928-Calmy1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Truong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Direct evidence exists in one study that found higher concentrations of &#x003b2;2-microglubulin (but not TNF-&#x003b1;) in the third trimester of pregnancy and first weeks postpartum among HIV-infected women compared with HIV-uninfected controls <xref rid="pone.0089928-Truong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and the difference was identified up to six months postpartum, in a separate study <xref rid="pone.0089928-Mikyas1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These studies suggest that HIV-infected women experience changes in inflammatory marker concentrations during pregnancy beyond those seen in HIV-negative women with uncomplicated pregnancies, and these changes persist for months beyond delivery. We found a decline in hsCRP and D-dimer between the third trimester and six months postpartum, but an increase in IFN-&#x003b3;. Given our finding that IFN-&#x003b3; concentration was also associated with adverse clinical outcomes, these data would suggest a mechanism for this relationship.</p><p>In contrast to other study results <xref rid="pone.0089928-Drain1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Kuller1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we did not find a significant association between hsCRP and subsequent adverse clinical events. One possible explanation is that other studies have examined populations that were exclusively or largely comprised of men, and these populations were also significantly older and individuals had more non-AIDS co-morbidities than Mashi participants. The Mashi study overall recorded few cardiovascular events as expected in this population of young women, and no cardiovascular events in this study population. More data exist for the association of standard, non high-sensitivity CRP and adverse outcomes in studies of populations similar to Mashi, and CRP is known to be associated with underlying infectious and inflammatory conditions <xref rid="pone.0089928-Drain1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Grutzmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, the predictive role of hsCRP is unclear. To minimize confounding from concurrent infections in our study, we excluded women with illness prior to or within two months after the time of hsCRP testing. While we may have unintentionally biased our selection toward a healthier population, it likely gives a cleaner analysis of the association of hsCRP elevation and subsequent adverse clinical events.</p><p>Prior studies have suggested that higher IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations were associated with HIV-1 disease progression in adult HIV-infection, as well as lower IFN-&#x003b3; with lower viral load set point <xref rid="pone.0089928-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Stylianou1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We found similar trends between these cytokines and subsequent morbidity and mortality, independent of CD4 T cell count and viral load.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. As samples were only collected and analyzed in the third trimester and at six months postpartum, we do not know the pre-pregnancy baseline or how marker concentrations changed during the first two trimesters of pregnancy or at the time of delivery. It is possible that an analysis of pre-pregnancy concentrations would yield different results. Antiretroviral treatment was also not assigned as part of the study, but given according to government guidelines. Our attempts to control for this in the analysis may leave residual confounding. Additionally, we looked at serum concentrations of six inflammatory marker proteins. An analysis of mRNA expression as cellular markers of immune activation <xref rid="pone.0089928-MacLeod1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, or different soluble markers such as markers of monocyte activation may have more accurately reflected chronic inflammation and immune activation in this population <xref rid="pone.0089928-Kelesidis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The markers we chose reflected previously published studies and allowed us to compare our results to those findings.</p><p>In summary, our data provide support for the need for further investigation of the role of inflammation in clinical outcomes among HIV-infected women peripartum (including the role of T cell activation and monocyte activation), and of strategies to reduce inflammation in the postpartum period. The randomized study, Promoting Maternal-Infant Survival Everywhere (PROMISE), is currently enrolling participants and aims to answer the question of whether there is a benefit to women with CD4 cell counts above current thresholds for treatment in continuing ART initiated for PMTCT <xref rid="pone.0089928-National1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. If pregnancy-related immune modulation leads to an extended increase in inflammation postpartum (with associated adverse clinical outcomes), this would add evidence to support women remaining on ART after pregnancy, regardless of CD4 count, for their own health <xref rid="pone.0089928-Fraternale1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089928-Piconi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants of the Mashi mother to child HIV transmission prevention trial for their dedicated participation for the duration of this study.</p><p>
