The primary end point was development of grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD. The cumulative incidence of grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD was 50% in the observation arm and 33% in the treatment arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.005). However, grade III&#x02013;IV GvHD was comparable (13% <italic>vs</italic>. 10%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>=0.6), and this was true for sibling and alternative donor transplants. Moderate/severe chronic GvHD was also comparable (17% <italic>vs</italic>. 9%). In multivariate analysis, an early interval between transplant and randomization (&#x0003c;day +20) was the only negative predictor of grade III&#x02013;IV GvHD. Patients in the observation arm had less infectious bacterial episodes (12 <italic>vs</italic>. 25; <italic>P</italic>=0.04), less severe infectious fungal episodes (0 <italic>vs</italic>. 3; <italic>P</italic>=0.04), and less severe adverse events (3 <italic>vs</italic>. 11; <italic>P</italic>=0.07). At five years, non-relapse mortality was 20% <italic>versus</italic> 26% (<italic>P</italic>=0.2), relapse-related mortality 25% <italic>versus</italic> 21%, and actuarial survival was 51% <italic>versus</italic> 41% (<italic>P</italic>=0.3) in the observation and treatment arms, respectively. In multivariate analysis, advanced disease phase, older age and an early onset of GvHD were significant negative predictors of survival, independent of the randomization arm. In conclusion, steroid treatment of acute grade I GvHD prevents progression to grade II but not to grade III&#x02013;IV GvHD, and there is no effect on non-relapse mortality and survival. Patients treated with steroids are at a higher risk of developing infections and have more adverse events.

In three prospective trials of first-line treatment, also patients with grade I acute GvHD (aGvHD) were enrolled;<sup><xref rid="b1-1022125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-1022125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> however, most Centers would probably treat only GvHD of grade II or over. One argument in favor of steroid treatment would be early intervention, thus possibly preventing progression to more severe GvHD. This is a general rule of medicine, but there is no evidence that this is also the case in patients with aGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b1-1022125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1022125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In one randomized study back in 1998, the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) had shown that early intervention with high-dose steroid treatment (10 mg/kg) was equally effective as a conventional dose of steroids (2 mg/kg) in first-line treatment of aGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b3-1022125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In that study, the proportion of patients who progressed to grade III&#x02013;IV was similar in the two groups, despite a median interval between transplant and treatment of 12 days, arguing against the hypothesis that early aggressive intervention would be more effective than standard therapy and would be able to modify the natural disease course.<sup><xref rid="b3-1022125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Similar results were seen in a more recent prospective randomized trial, once again comparing two different doses of steroids as first-line treatment, and again showing no difference in the rate of progression to severe GvHD.<sup><xref rid="b4-1022125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, steroids cause immune deficiency and promote infectious complications.<sup><xref rid="b5-1022125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>On the other hand, early treatment of GvHD could be beneficial. In a retrospective study of unrelated donor transplants in two different Centers, non-relapse mortality (NRM) was lower in one Center using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for GvHD prophylaxis and steroid treatment of grade I aGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b6-1022125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In any case, whether grade I GvHD should be treated or not has not been tested in a prospective trial, and this led GITMO to undertake this trial. The aim was how to calculate the lowest and highest success rate. We used data from the previous GITMO study:<sup><xref rid="b2-1022125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> 25% of patients with grade I GvHD treated with 6methylprednisolone (6MPred) 2 mg/kg progressed to grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD. We hypothesized that patients left untreated would have twice the risk of progression to grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD, and 170 patients were needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We report the results of this trial in patients with grade I GvHD, randomized to receive steroid treatment or no treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) study (study name: RAMP08; registered as EUDTRACT N 2008-000413-29). The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by all local ethical committees. Data entry was made by electronic CRF provided by Clinical Research Technolgy (CRT), Naples, Italy. The study is an open label multicenter, phase III randomized study comparing no treatment <italic>versus</italic> treatment with 6-methylprednisolone (6MPred) 1 mg/kg per day for transplanted patients with grade I aGvHD according to Gucksberg&#x02019;s criteria.<sup><xref rid="b7-1022125" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Randomization was managed centrally <italic>via</italic> the web in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were randomized using a dynamic randomization algorithm, with minimization of differences between arms A and B to no more than 2 patients overall and 3 patients per strata. Patients were stratified according to phase (early/advanced) and donor type (matched sibling/alternative donors). We applied a modified intention-to-treat analysis, and all patients with at least one day of follow up were analyzed in the arm to which they had been allocated: 173 patients were randomized, between July 2009 and August 2014, and 171 were analyzed. The study outline is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1022125">Figure 1</xref>. Patients randomized to the observation arm were left untreated. Patients progressing to grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD were considered to have reached the primary end point of the study, independent of the interval from randomization, and were treated according to standard procedures of each Center. Patients randomized to observation and not progressing were followed up. Patients randomized to treatment received 6MPred 1 mg/kg/day for five days. Patients progressing to grade II&#x02013;IV GvHD, had reached the primary end point of the sudy and were treated according to the policy of each Center. If GvHD did not progress, 6MPred was tapered as follows: 0.75 mg/kg/day on days 6&#x02013;10, 0.5 mg/kg/day on days 11&#x02013;15, 0.25 mg/kg/day on days 16&#x02013;20, 0.12 mg/kg/day on days 21&#x02013;30, and discontinued on day +30.</p><fig id="f1-1022125" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study outline.

We, therefore, asked whether steroid treatment of grade I GvHD would be beneficial, and we selected evolution to grade II or more as the primary end point of the study. Patients randomized in the observation arm would become eligible for treatment when diagnosed as grade II GvHD, also if this occurred 24 hours after randomization. This facilitated the informed consent procedure with the patients since there would be no delay in treatment once the disease had progressed to grade II. As expected, patients randomized to receive treatment at diagnosis of grade I GvHD had a significantly lower probability to progress to grade II or more GvHD compared to untreated patients (33% <italic>vs</italic>. 50%). The fact that patients in the observation arm, grafted from identical siblings, had a higher proportion of grades II&#x02013;IV GvHD (61%) compared to patients in the observation arm receiving alternative donor grafts (44%) can be explained by the fact that, in the latter, GvHD prophylaxis included either ATG or PT-CY, in addition to CyA and MTX (UD grafts) or CyA and mycophenolate (HAPLO grafts). The unexpected finding was that the CI of patients progressing to severe (grade III&#x02013;IV) GvHD was comparable in the two groups (13% <italic>vs</italic>. 10%). Therefore, the primary end point of the study was reached, but this was due to skin GvHD progressing from stage II to stage III in the observation arm (22 observation <italic>vs</italic>. 6 treatment patients) and stage 1 gut GvHD (10 observation <italic>vs</italic>. 3 treatment patients).
