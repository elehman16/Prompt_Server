We aimed to assess the impact on birth weight and weight-for-age Z-score in children aged 0&#x02013;16&#x000a0;months of a nutrition Participatory Learning and Action behaviour change strategy (PLA) for pregnant women through women&#x02019;s groups, with or without unconditional transfers of food or cash to pregnant women in two districts of southern Nepal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial (non-blinded). PLA comprises women&#x02019;s groups that discuss, and form strategies about, nutrition in pregnancy, low birth weight and hygiene. Women receive up to 7 monthly transfers per pregnancy: cash is NPR 750 (~US$7) and food is 10&#x000a0;kg of fortified sweetened wheat-soya Super Cereal per month. The unit of randomisation is a rural village development committee (VDC) cluster (population 4000&#x02013;9200, mean 6150) in southern Dhanusha or Mahottari districts. 80 VDCs are randomised to four arms using a participatory &#x02018;tombola&#x02019; method. Twenty clusters each receive: PLA; PLA plus food; PLA plus cash; and standard care (control). Participants are (mostly Maithili-speaking) pregnant women identified from 8&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation onwards, and their infants (target sample size 8880 birth weights). After pregnancy verification, mothers may be followed up in early and late pregnancy, within 72&#x000a0;h, after 42&#x000a0;days and within 22&#x000a0;months of birth. Outcomes pertain to the individual level. Primary outcomes include birth weight within 72&#x000a0;h of birth and infant weight-for-age Z-score measured cross-sectionally on children born of the study. Secondary outcomes include prevalence of LBW, eating behaviour and weight during pregnancy, maternal and newborn illness, preterm delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal mortality, infant Z-scores for length-for-age and weight-for-length, head circumference, and postnatal maternal BMI and mid-upper arm circumference. Exposure to women&#x02019;s groups, food or cash transfers, home visits, and group interventions are measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Determining the relative importance to birth weight and early childhood nutrition of adding food or cash transfers to PLA women&#x02019;s groups will inform design of nutrition interventions in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

The study will inform policymakers of whether each of the three interventions is more effective than current programme and what is the relative effectiveness of each intervention.</p><p>The main trial hypothesis is that an improved nutrition behaviour change strategy combined with a social transfer is an effective approach to improving birth weight and infant nutrition in rural south Asia. The justification for using community mobilisation through women&#x02019;s groups as our behaviour change strategy is based on earlier research in rural areas of Nepal (Makwanpur district), Jharkhand and Orissa, India, Bangladesh and Malawi. These studies demonstrated the potential for participatory learning and action-based women&#x02019;s groups to reduce neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and also maternal mortality in meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The intervention appeared equitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and an economic evaluation found it to be cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nonetheless, the trials assessed the impact of participatory women&#x02019;s groups on mortality rather than nutritional status of pregnant women or low birth weight.</p><p>Low birth weight (LBW) is common in low-income countries such as Nepal, mainly representing intrauterine growth retardation and preterm birth, and is associated with outcomes including increased neonatal mortality and childhood stunting, adult chronic disease, and impaired cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. 60&#x000a0;% of neonatal deaths are in LBW infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>We know of no trial that has assessed the impact of this approach on these outcomes, although others have used various approaches to providing dietary advice in pregnancy, with limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In Dhanusha district, we previously helped local Female Community Health Volunteers to facilitate women&#x02019;s groups which engaged with communities around issues of maternal and young child nutrition and postpartum care behaviours, as well as maternal and newborn health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our understanding of socio-cultural issues affecting good nutritional behaviours was developed through formative research, exploring preferences, taboos and beliefs about what is good for mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The justification for assessing the impact of unconditional food supplements and cash transfers rests on the relative paucity of evidence for their impact in South Asia. Evidence that food supplementation can increase birth weight exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and some limited evidence for the impact of cash transfers on birth weight has been found from large-scale cash transfer programmes in South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. No study has compared the effectiveness of food supplementation versus cash or versus behaviour change alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial in which 80 clusters are allocated to four arms, each of 20 clusters: (i) control receiving current Government of Nepal health services, (ii) enhanced Participatory Learning and Action nutrition behaviour change strategy for women in pregnancy (PLA), (iii) PLA plus a food supplement, and (iv) PLA plus an unconditional cash transfer. The cluster unit of randomisation is the Village Development Committee (VDC), with population size between 4000 and 9200 (mean 6150), drawn from Dhanusha and Mahottari districts in the plains of Nepal, bordering Bihar state, India. In order to reduce heterogeneity between clusters, we excluded VDCs that: were previous women&#x02019;s group intervention areas; had large towns and municipalities; had hilly, forested or non-Maithili-speaking areas; along the East&#x02013;west highway; and with population &#x0003c;4000 or &#x0003e;9200.</p><p>The design is outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, together with the randomisation process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2016_1102_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>The study involves two contiguous districts, Dhanusha and Mahottari, in the central <italic>Terai</italic> (map in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with a combined population of 1.4 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (&#x0003e;80&#x000a0;% in rural areas), and female literacy rates of 44 and 39&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This Maithili-speaking area of the central <italic>Terai</italic> is culturally and environmentally similar to large areas of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and India&#x02019;s other northern plains areas, as well as areas of Bangladesh and Pakistan. Maithili women, especially young wives, are often required to remain in their homes out of sight of non-family members. Intra-household food allocation is particularly inequitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and levels of undernutrition in women and girls are high. Central <italic>Terai</italic> data from the Nepal DHS survey 2011 indicate that 26&#x000a0;% of women have body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 14&#x000a0;% are below the 145&#x000a0;cm cut-off for short stature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Data from the our previous trial population in Dhanusha in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] indicate that 40&#x000a0;% have BMI &#x0003c;18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 17&#x000a0;% have short stature. Child undernutrition is also high, with stunting at 41&#x000a0;%, underweight at 32&#x000a0;%, and wasting at 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Map of Mahottari and Dhanusha districts showing study clusters and allocation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2016_1102_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Moderate-to-severe food insecurity in the Central <italic>Terai</italic> is about 20&#x000a0;% less common than in the more remote high-altitude areas of Western Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There may be more scope for cash transfers to contribute to micronutrient-rich diets in less poor socioeconomic groups, and more scope for a food supplement to be given to the pregnant woman in a household if other family members are less in need, providing a fair test of the transfers. In the poorest quintile, however, moderate to severe food insecurity is more prevalent. Studying the use of food and cash in these households will enable us to assess the potential impact of the transfers on infant nutrition amongst food insecure households.</p><p>The trial partners include University College London, Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA), Save the Children, World Food Programme and the Institute of Fiscal Studies, UK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p>The study is designed with independent interventions and surveillance systems to as great an extent as possible. However, interventions depend on the surveillance system to generate pregnancy ID cards, which enable women to access transfers. In transfer clusters the women&#x02019;s group intervention is integrated with the delivery of cash and food transfers, but otherwise interventions are managed independently of one another.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participatory Learning and Action women&#x02019;s group enhanced nutrition behaviour change strategy intervention (PLA)</title><p>Every ward division of each VDC in Nepal has a Female Community Health Volunteer (FCHV), a frontline health volunteer tasked within the Government of Nepal (GoN) health system to conduct a monthly women&#x02019;s group meeting, amongst other activities. In the past most of the groups met irregularly and usually without any specific agenda or activity, unless coupled with immunisation or vitamin-A supplementation programmes. Recently, however, the GoN community-based neonatal care package (CBNCP) is strengthening women&#x02019;s groups in some districts. Based on previous success in revitalising these groups using Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) with interactive agendas for discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we hypothesised that the groups would be an appropriate platform for a nutrition behaviour change strategy and for distribution of social transfers.</p><p>The 60 clusters in which the PLA is being implemented have 540 FCHVs and 539 women&#x02019;s groups (WGs). One sparsely populated ward was merged with its neighbour. Formative studies of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in Dhanusha and Mahottari showed that 60&#x000a0;% were illiterate and 67&#x000a0;% over 40&#x000a0;years of age, so we decided that a literate assistant would be required for each group. We recruited 539 literate incentivised volunteers called nutrition mobilisers (NMs), with a minimum education to 5th grade, to take responsibility for following the women&#x02019;s group manual and keeping records of transfers and group activities. Both FCHVs and NMs receive small cash incentives of NPR400 ($4) per month for facilitating women&#x02019;s groups and NPR 400 per month for attending orientation meetings, plus NPR 20 per sack of food and NPR 10 per envelope of cash delivered via home visits.</p><p>Each women&#x02019;s group follows a PLA cycle to mobilise the community for behaviour change. A pictorial meeting manual, with accompanying picture cards for each meeting, provides a monthly agenda. Formative research into local perceptions about food in pregnancy and baby size, food taboos, empowerment, experience from a previous cRCT about maternal and infant nutrition in Dhanusha district, and literature on risk factors for low birth weight informed the meeting content. Pre-existing tools from the GoN and other organisations working on nutritional interventions in Nepal (such as <italic>Suahaara</italic> and World Vision) were used or adapted where appropriate. A series of 22 meetings covers topics associated with maternal nutrition and the intergenerational cycle of under-nutrition, including foods needed for good health and exposures to avoid in pregnancy; pregnancy, delivery and postpartum danger signs and care-seeking; infection control and hygiene; importance of rest and family support; care of low weight infants; breastfeeding and infant feeding; disadvantages of adolescent pregnancies; birth spacing and family planning; and kitchen gardening. A recurrent theme on the importance of handwashing and hygiene runs throughout the meeting cycle. A full schedule of 22 meetings is provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Schedule of women&#x02019;s group meetings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2016_1102_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p><p>Prior to the intervention, which began in September 2013, 540 FCHVs and 539 NMs were trained by 30 Facilitation Field Coordinators (FFCs) in facilitation skills and potential barriers to good maternal nutrition, and the importance of rest and infection control in pregnancy. At each subsequent monthly orientation meeting, FFCs train the FCHVs and NMs on the women&#x02019;s group manual agenda for the coming month using role-play, games and picture cards. FFCs visit the FCHV-NM pairs in their intervention wards on rotation to support them in facilitating group discussions, problem solving and providing ongoing training. FFCs aim to observe two-thirds of meetings and provide feedback on the facilitation and transfer distribution processes.</p><p>The FCHV/NM facilitator is encouraged to pose questions, enabling members to use existing knowledge and resources in answering them, debate current practices and the potential for change, and identify their own gaps in knowledge. Groups are encouraged to think about the key stakeholders in the intervention (for example, village leaders, politicians, mothers-in-law, health workers, husbands), and how to involve them in addressing barriers and increasing the proper use of the food and cash transfers. A similar intervention in Malawi found it beneficial to inform men of group activities relatively early in the meeting cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Maternal nutritional problems are identified by discussion, games and stories over a series of meetings using pictorial aides, potential strategies are discussed, prioritised and then presented to the community at a ward-level meeting. Once community support has been enlisted, groups implement their strategies for a number of months. Strategies mainly involve raising awareness in the wider community through home visits to pregnant women who do not attend groups, playing a picture card game in the community, separate meetings to engage with mothers-in-law, male family members or adolescent girls, nutrition rallies on the importance of maternal nutrition, and showing pregnancy-related videos. Communities finally evaluate their strategies over 2 meetings and the groups are handed over to the community.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design of the unconditional transfer interventions</title><p>Nutrition Mobilisers (NMs) distribute the food, supported by FCHVs and women&#x02019;s group members. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the transfer delivery system, which is similar in both food and cash transfer arms. Women&#x02019;s group members assist the nutrition mobiliser in identifying beneficiaries early in their pregnancies and encourage them to come to the group to receive a monthly food transfer. If a woman is physically unable to come to the group in person (including if she is not allowed to attend by her family), the nutrition mobiliser takes the transfer to the pregnant woman&#x02019;s home and explains the importance of eating well in pregnancy (using picture cards). In food transfer arms the NM also explains how to prepare the food and how much should be eaten per day. In the cash transfer arm the NM recommends food purchases and frequency over the month.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Food and cash transfer delivery system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2016_1102_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

Super Cereal has been developed and tested by WFP and is being distributed elsewhere in Nepal to pregnant and lactating women and their young children. We conducted a formative study from September 2012 to January 2013 and found the cereal to be acceptable to pregnant women, particularly when consumed in the form of <italic>haluwa</italic> (a sweet dish prepared by roasting the flour in oil or ghee and adding water and sugar to make a thick paste) or as <italic>roti</italic> (unleavened flatbread). The nutrient content of Super Cereal is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. We recommend that women consume a Super Cereal ration equivalent to 150&#x000a0;g of dry flour per day so that, if needed, most of the micronutrient and additional energy requirements of pregnancy can be met from consuming only this food plus iron-folate supplements.</p><p>A 150&#x000a0;g intake of the supplement per day meets the total requirements for all nutrients except iron, folic acid (both of which we would expect to come from iron-folate supplements provided by the GoN via FCHVs), iodine (which should come from iodised salt consumption), zinc, copper and selenium. Slightly lower than recommended values are also found for retinol, thiamine, niacin, vitamins B2 and B6, and zinc in a 150&#x000a0;g serving of Super Cereal, but the shortfalls are small and may be less important than the bigger challenge of ensuring that each woman consumes her daily recommended amount. Women eat normal family foods in addition to the food supplement, which may include nutrient-rich green leafy vegetables, Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables, pulses, dairy products and sometimes meat and fish.</p><p>The Super Cereal is manufactured by a WFP-registered factory in Sunsari district (~100&#x000a0;km from the MIRA field site office in Janakpur), tested for quality by WFP, and delivered monthly to an &#x0201c;Extended Delivery Point&#x0201d; (EDP) food store, which meets stringent storage regulations provided by WFP for ventilation, vermin control and maximum stack height. Sacks of Super Cereal are delivered from the EDP to one Food Drop Point (FDP) per food cluster monthly or, when weather conditions render road access impossible, in bulk to cover the monsoon months. FDPs are also required to meet WFP storage standards and are inspected regularly. Any sacks of food suffering damage are destroyed. From the FDP, the food is carried by incentivised porters to nutrition mobilisers&#x02019; homes at around the time of the women&#x02019;s group meeting. Supplies are usually stored in the home of the nutrition mobiliser or FCHV until the monthly group meeting when ID card-holders receive their food transfers and non-attendees get a home visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Unconditional cash transfer</title><p>The cash transfer is NPR 750 ($7) per month.

A stringent security protocol is followed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Purchasing power of the cash transfer</title><p>Formative data suggested that a transfer of cash could be very important to the poorest families in increasing access to nutrient-dense foods for pregnant women, but might be needed to feed the whole family, not just the pregnant woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In 2012, we used Save the Children Cost of Diet linear programming tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to estimate the minimum cost of a nutritionally adequate food basket using price data from local markets. The Nepal Rastra Bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] estimated that food price inflation varied from 10&#x000a0;% in 2007&#x02013;8 to 16&#x000a0;% in 2008&#x02013;9. Our own food price inflation estimates based on 66 food prices in Dhanusha district sampled in 2006, 2008 and 2009 indicate that average food prices in Dhanusha increased by 33&#x000a0;% between 2005 and 2008 and by 25&#x000a0;% between 2008 and 2009. Based on a 10&#x000a0;% per annum inflation rate (Nepal Rastra Bank consumer price index estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]), the estimated cost of a nutritionally adequate diet for 2012 was NPR 57 a day or NPR 1767 per month.</p><p>The cash transfer should therefore cover a significant proportion of the necessary expenditure on micronutrient-rich items such as dairy products, meat, fish and eggs and fruits which the pregnant woman needs to eat to meet her minimum nutrient requirements.</p><p>We estimate that the food production costs NPR 70 per Kg, plus NPR 6 per Kg for transport making a total of NPR 760 per 10 Kg bag per month. We decided that the cash transfer should roughly match the value of the food transfer and set the cash transfer at NPR 750 per month, which is sufficient to buy 43&#x000a0;% of the cereal&#x02019;s micronutrient value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Home visiting</title><p>NMs provide home visits to women who are unable to attend groups. The NMs deliver food or cash and provide counselling on nutrition. NMs also visit women at home to encourage them to attend groups and FCHVs visit pregnant and postpartum women as part of their routine duties within the GoN health service. Home visiting by NMs, FCHVs and women&#x02019;s group members to provide counselling and show picture cards to pregnant women was widely adopted as a group strategy. Structured home visiting by nutrition mobilisers through use of a nutrition counselling manual was originally planned, but was not feasible due to overburdening of the volunteer nutrition mobilisers and FCHVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Current government programmes available throughout the study districts</title><p>Women enrolled in all arms of the trial are able to access current government health service programmes which include antenatal care at local health facilities (a woman who makes 4 antenatal visits receives an incentive of NPR 400 at the time of her final visit), and visits from FCHVs in which they provide free iron-folate supplements from the fourth month of pregnancy onwards, and a single dose of anthelmintic. For perinatal care, services include a maternity incentive of NPR 500 for women who go to government (and certain participating private) health facilities for institutional delivery, and postnatal visits by FCHVs to distribute vitamin A and iron-folate. The Community-based Newborn Care Package (CBNCP) operates in Mahottari district only over the study period. This involves FCHVs making postnatal visits to check on neonates and provision of agendas for FCHVs to facilitate women&#x02019;s group meetings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Benefits to control clusters</title><p>In order to ensure that control clusters do receive some benefit from the project we strengthen government services in the two study districts (regardless of trial arm allocation).

In an August - November 2013 household census, 64 000 eligible women consented to this. Names and contact details are entered into pre-printed registers with a unique ID number and quick response (QR) code for each participant. These IDs are scanned with Android smartphones when women enter the trial and remain with them throughout. A woman may have more than one pregnancy in the study and each is identified with a pregnancy number suffixed to the woman ID. New women are added to the registers prospectively as they move into the clusters.</p><p>Any woman whom a ward enumerator identifies as having missed two menses in a row is eligible for a pregnancy test to enrol into trial interventions.

No limit has been set on gestational age at enrolment in order to avoid women providing inaccurate dates of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) in order to access transfers. We define permanent migration as a pregnant woman or mother moving out of the study area without any apparent plan to return within the entire follow-up period.

</p><p>Political disturbance severely disrupted trial surveillance activities (but affected interventions only slightly) from late September 2014 to January 2015 and this led to premature closure of surveillance due to lack of funds. Enrolment of pregnant women closed on 28 Feb 2015 and follow-up using routine trial surveillance systems, including capture of birth weight, closed on 31 March 2015. Interventions continue to run for women due to deliver between April and October 2015.</p><p>Two devastating earthquakes hit Nepal on 25 April and 12 May 2015. Although the study population was not severely affected, some disruption was experienced, especially to researchers based in Kathmandu.</p><p>In order to capture anthropometric outcomes for as many woman-infant pairs as possible after closure of surveillance, nutritional follow-up clinics are implemented to enable a one-off cross-sectional sample per cluster from 20 June to 19 October 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Sample size</title><p>For 80&#x000a0;% power to demonstrate a difference between two study arms, where the underlying difference between arms is 50&#x000a0;g in mean birth weight (the primary outcome), we require at least 17 clusters per arm to contribute data and at least 163 births per cluster on average. We therefore randomised twenty clusters to each arm to allow up to 3 clusters to drop out from each arm. The calculations are based on comparisons between two arms, and apply to any pair of study arms. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarises the number of clusters per arm to provide 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a significant difference between two study arms, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of birth weights within each study arm of 410&#x000a0;g, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.01 and taking the standard two-tailed 5&#x000a0;% significance level. The design effect is 2.62 for clusters of 163 births. Due to difficulties obtaining the required number per cluster, but seeing little chance of cluster drop-out from the study, calculations were repeated during the trial to investigate the number required per cluster with no loss of clusters. With all 20 clusters per arm contributing outcome data, 111 birth weights per cluster (design effect 2.10) provide the same effective sample size as shown in the Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and hence the same power as originally proposed. A target sample of 111 birth weights per cluster, 2220 per arm and 8880 in total, was adopted.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sample size for birth weight, at 80&#x000a0;% power, 5&#x000a0;% significance level, and intracluster correlation coefficient 0.01</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Difference between arms, g</th><th>Effective sample size per arm</th><th>Number of VDCs per arm, 163 births per cluster</th><th>Number of VDCs per arm, 111 births per cluster</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>75</td><td>470</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>1056</td><td>17</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>4223</td><td>68</td><td>80</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>Power to rank arms for effect on birth weight (i.e. to see higher sample mean birth weight in the more effective arm) is good (&#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%) provided that the difference between arms is 15&#x000a0;g or more. A 25&#x000a0;g difference provides 92&#x000a0;% power, and 20&#x000a0;g provides 87&#x000a0;% power.</p><p>For the proportion of LBW infants, the sample size provides 82&#x000a0;% power to detect a reduction from the anticipated level of 27.5&#x000a0;% under current programmes to 22&#x000a0;% under one of the interventions, again at a two-tailed 5&#x000a0;% significance level. The ICC of 0.01, SD of 410&#x000a0;g and a LBW level of 27&#x000a0;% is based on 2011 MIRA Dhanusha data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our antenatal micronutrient supplementation trial in the same population showed a difference in birth weight of 77&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Pooled analyses suggest a combined effect of 22&#x000a0;g from multiple micronutrient supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and of 60&#x000a0;g from balanced protein energy supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our study will have power to detect a difference of 50&#x000a0;g, which is probably sufficient to be biologically relevant since mortality risk increases steeply with decreasing birth weight, especially below a 2500&#x000a0;g threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>We aimed to obtain outcome data for at least 2220 infants per arm, and 8 880 infants in total assuming 20 clusters per arm (i.e. no loss of clusters), from women who could have &#x0003e;16&#x000a0;weeks exposure if they enrol early enough in pregnancy and whose birth weights are measured within 72&#x000a0;h.</p><p>We hypothesise that our interventions will improve infant nutrition, growth, stunting rates and the lifelong consequences of being born small for gestational age. For this reason the second primary outcome of infant weight-for-age z score (WAZ), and secondary outcomes of length-for-age and weight-for-length z scores, head circumference and maternal BMI and MUAC, are measured through endpoint nutrition clinics from June to October 2015. The age of trial infants at endpoint nutrition assessment will range from 1 to 22&#x000a0;months (most will be between 3 and 15&#x000a0;months).</p><p>We anticipate that, counting from the start of interventions on 13 Feb 2014, 190 permanently resident mothers per cluster will have participated by 31 Mar 2015 when birth weight measurement ceased and 210 by 20 Jun 2015 when nutrition endpoint follow-up began. We estimate that the second primary outcome will be obtained from at least 150 eligible infants per cluster born before clinics began on 20 June 2015 (70&#x000a0;% response rate). Assuming an ICC 0.01 then the design effect is 2.49 and effective sample size is 1205 per arm. This sample size provides 84&#x000a0;% power to detect as significant a difference between two arms of 0.12 in mean z score, if the z-scores have a standard deviation of one within each arm as expected. In Nepal we assume an average infant weight of around 6.5&#x000a0;kg at 6&#x000a0;months with standard deviation of 800&#x000a0;g for males, so for such infants a difference of 0.12 in Z-score represents about 96&#x000a0;g. Power to rank pairs of intervention arms of 80&#x000a0;% or more is expected should the difference in mean Z-score be 0.034 or greater.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Assignment of interventions and blinding</title><p>Selected clusters were allocated randomly to the four study arms.

<bold>Mothers:</bold> height and weight in early pregnancy (8&#x02013;13&#x000a0;weeks), weight in late pregnancy (34&#x02013;37&#x000a0;weeks), at 6&#x02013;8 weeks postpartum and during endpoint nutrition follow-up clinics. For mothers under 20&#x000a0;years of age, height is also taken at these times.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Infants:</bold> weight, length and head circumference at birth (ideally within 72&#x000a0;h of delivery), weight and length within the first 42&#x000a0;days (if birth weight impossible) and/or at 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks. Weight, length and head circumference at endpoint nutrition follow-up clinics when children are aged 0 to 22&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Supervision and duplicate measurements</title><p>Repeat readings are taken for all anthropometric measurements, with a third reading if the difference exceeds predefined ranges. Routine calibration of anthropometric equipment is carried out using standard procedures and tools. Equipment not meeting acceptable limits is replaced immediately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Standardisation of anthropometric measurement across many observers</title><p>Monitoring Field Coordinators (MFCs) observe interviews conducted by VDCIs, and take duplicate readings to calculate intra- and inter-observer Technical Error of Measurement (TEM) on prospectively collected data. In addition, ten standardisation sessions were held for 82 field staff (66 VDCIs and 16 MFCs) in June-July 2014. Sessions required each data collector to take duplicate measurements (weight, height, MUAC for women; weight, length, head circumference for children) on 10 volunteers. Standardisation of 21 data collectors was conducted during training for endpoint nutrition follow-up clinics (for measures of weight, height and MUAC on 10 women). Intra- and Inter-observer Technical Error of Measurement (TEM) were calculated, and poor data collectors identified for re-training and additional field support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Measurement of mortality and pregnancy outcome</title><p>Capture of pregnancy outcomes during main trial surveillance was undertaken by enumerators recording miscarriages, births and deaths in the paper registers used for menstrual monitoring. Changes in women&#x02019;s status were then recorded on Android smartphones by VDCIs on a monthly basis. As political disturbance affected capture of these outcomes across some clusters, pregnancy outcomes, vital status of mother-child dyads at birth, 28&#x000a0;days and at the time of endpoint nutritional follow-up are recorded in the nutritional follow-up questionnaires.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Primary analysis of outcomes will be by intention-to-treat.</p><p>Birth weight (original primary outcome) can drop significantly, usually reaching its lowest within 48&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h after birth, with a mean loss of around 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;% of initial birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and we shall adjust for time after birth that measurements were taken and compare timing between arms. Analysis of the second primary outcome, weight-for-age z-score, will also be adjusted for age, despite the fact that age is accounted for within the calculations, in case of a different &#x02018;age-trajectory&#x02019; of weight in the study area compared to the WHO standard population used to derive the scoring system. Primary analyses of the primary outcomes will each be based on available cases without imputation. Differences seen between arms in analysis of the second primary outcome (z-scores) will be expressed in terms of the corresponding difference in grams of birthweight.</p><p>Secondary analyses will also relate to the efficacy of the interventions. A per protocol analysis will compare outcomes for women who enrolled early in pregnancy and actually received the full intervention package of five or more transfers. A dose-response analysis will compare outcomes in women with different levels of exposure to the intervention. Analyses will be adjusted for measures of socioeconomic status, parity, timing of birth weight measurement and other variables identified at the time of finalising the analysis plan.</p><p>All analyses will be conducted using random effects models that account for clustering. In common with other cluster RCTs, there is a possibility of baseline imbalance of clusters in birth weight and socio-demographic predictors of birth-weight and possible imbalance between arms in predictive characteristics of the mothers and infants who provide outcome data. Adjustments will be made through regression analysis. Birth weights and infant z scores are expected to be normally distributed and will be analysed without prior transformation. The effect measure for the primary analyses will be a difference in birth weight or infant weight-for-age z score associated with intervention, with 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, potentially adjusted for confounders. The primary comparisons will be with the control arm, but we shall attempt to rank interventions and calculate pairwise difference in effects. No formal adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made, but it will be acknowledged in the interpretation of the findings. We plan to undertake subgroup analyses on the basis of socioeconomic and food security categories to explore the equity impact of the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Cost effectiveness economic evaluation</title><p>Assuming that one or more of the three interventions (PLA, PLA&#x02009;+&#x02009;food, PLA&#x02009;+&#x02009;cash) has an effect on the primary or secondary outcomes, the economic evaluation will, from the provider perspective, rank the interventions according to their cost effectiveness, and classify each intervention as highly cost effective, cost effective, or not cost effective using Nepali GDP per capita as the cost effectiveness threshold. Provider cost data will be collected from project financial accounts, staff time use interviews, vehicle logbooks and key informant interviews at health facilities. Primary outcomes will be birth weight and infant weight-for-age z score. Secondary outcomes include infant length-for-age z score, infant weight-for-length Z-score and prevalence of LBW.</p><p>The costs of the interventions will be estimated incrementally and prospectively using an ingredients approach, with current government provision as the comparator. In addition, the incremental cost and cost- effectiveness of adding food or cash transfers to women&#x02019;s groups will be analysed from the provider perspective. Provider costs of caring for LBW infants and for the treatment of pregnancy complications will be proxied with data from household spending on care seeking in the private sector.</p><p>Start-up and programme costs will be identified separately from implementation costs, and monitoring and evaluation costs reported alongside intervention costs. Capital costs will be annualized and all costs will be adjusted for inflation, and reported in constant purchasing-power parity-adjusted international dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated for the primary outcome measures, LBW, and LBW prevalence (cost per case of LBW averted). We will also utilise data from published sources, together with trial data to estimate the cost per year of life lost, death averted and DALY averted. This will allow winder comparison with other interventions but will be subject to great uncertainty, which will be transparently documented. Sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of results to assumptions including joint cost allocation rules and discount rates. An analysis costing a 7&#x000a0;kg bag of super cereal as distributed in GoN programmes, as opposed to the 10&#x000a0;kg actually provided, may be undertaken to look at the potential cost of scale-up assuming a similar effect size can be achieved with a smaller ration. Data will be analysed using a Microsoft Excel costing tool specifically developed to enable comparative cost effectiveness analysis with other women&#x02019;s group interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The results of the economic evaluation and costing of the interventions will be presented separately from the primary results of the trial to facilitate a full exposition of the methods and findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>A data monitoring committee (DMC) has been formed in accordance with DAMOCLES guidelines. Since the magnitude of an interim effect that would be strong enough to consider stopping is large, we do not intend to ask the DMC to apply a stopping rule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Harms</title><p>We have no reason to believe that any of the interventions will cause harm. However, we shall track stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and maternal deaths, and record all miscarriages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Auditing</title><sec id="Sec37"><title>Bias in delivery or receipt of the interventions</title><p>Bias may arise if interventions systematically bypass the poorest, if there is imbalance between allocation arms, or through differential in-migration of poor women to access food and cash. We shall exclude temporary residents (in-migrators) of this kind from analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Bias in ascertainment of outcomes</title><p>Capture of a higher percentage of home deliveries than hospital deliveries will skew the sample towards women who have home deliveries, who tend to be less educated, poorer and more likely to be multigravid (Sikorski et al.: Does Nepal&#x02019;s Safe Delivery Incentive Programme redress inequalities in maternity care? Analysis of population surveillance data, under review).</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Minimising bias</title><p>We shall examine response rates across socioeconomic quintiles and adjust for socioeconomic status or literacy and parity in analyses. We ensure that enumerators, FCHVs, NMs and group members are aware of the importance of including everyone within their wards, irrespective of caste, religion or disability status, and they actively encourage disadvantaged and marginalised women to attend. We used block randomisation stratified by cluster size and accessibility to minimise allocation arm imbalance after profiling clusters at the time of the population census.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although other programmes have explored whether food or cash transfers generate dependency, this would be difficult to evaluate within the timescale of our trial and it seems an unlikely risk given that households only receive the transfer when women are pregnant over a seven-month period.</p><p>A concern is the effect of transfers upon migration of women between their marital and parental homes. Commonly, pregnant women, especially young primigravidae, relocate to their parental homes for late pregnancy and delivery. Provision of social transfers will undoubtedly increase in-migration of women whose parental homes lie in a food or cash transfer cluster. We permit any woman who claims to be resident to enrol for interventions, but will exclude her from the analysis when we identify her true status.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p>Data collection began in December 2013 and integrated interventions began on 13 Feb 2014. The birth weight capture rate was low from the start and political problems starting in September 2014 created further challenges to data collection from mothers with &#x0003e;16&#x000a0;weeks potential exposure to interventions. In light of the end of funding at November 2015, in January 2015 the trial management group decided to close birth weight capture on 31 March 2015 and to add infant weight for age Z-score as a primary outcome, collected at nutritional clinics in every cluster conducted between June and October 2015. The Nepal earthquakes of April and May 2015 also affected activities, but not intervention implementation to any significant level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec42"><title>Additional files</title><p>
