However, little is known about the acute effects of extended morning fasting upon subsequent energy intake and associated metabolic/regulatory factors in obese adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects/Methods:</title><p>In a randomised cross-over design, 24 obese men (<italic>n</italic>=8) and women (<italic>n</italic>=16) extended their overnight fast by omitting breakfast consumption or ingesting a typical carbohydrate-rich breakfast of 2183&#x000b1;393&#x02009;kJ (521&#x000b1;94&#x02009;kcal), before an <italic>ad libitum</italic> pasta lunch 3&#x02009;h later. Blood samples were obtained throughout the day until 3&#x02009;h post lunch and analysed for hormones implicated in appetite regulation, along with metabolic outcomes and subjective appetite measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lunch intake was unaffected by extended morning fasting (difference=218&#x02009;kJ, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x02212;54&#x02009;kJ, 490&#x02009;kJ; <italic>P</italic>=0.1) resulting in lower total intake in the fasting trial (difference=&#x02212;1964&#x02009;kJ, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x02212;1645&#x02009;kJ, &#x02212;2281&#x02009;kJ; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Systemic concentrations of peptide tyrosine&#x02013;tyrosine and leptin were lower during the afternoon following morning fasting (<italic>P</italic>&#x02a7d;0.06). Plasma-acylated ghrelin concentrations were also lower following the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch in the fasting trial (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) but this effect was not apparent for total ghrelin (<italic>P</italic>&#x02a7e;0.1). Serum insulin concentrations were greater throughout the afternoon in the fasting trial (<italic>P</italic>=0.05), with plasma glucose also greater 1&#x02009;h after lunch (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Extended morning fasting did not result in greater appetite ratings after lunch, with some tendency for lower appetite 3&#x02009;h post lunch (<italic>P</italic>=0.09).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate for the first time that, in obese adults, extended morning fasting does not cause compensatory intake during an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch nor does it increase appetite during the afternoon. Morning fasting reduced satiety hormone responses to a subsequent lunch meal but counterintuitively also reduced concentrations of the appetite-stimulating hormone-acylated ghrelin during the afternoon relative to lunch consumed after breakfast.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Regular breakfast omission is associated with greater risk of obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> prospective weight gain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Randomised controlled trials have examined whether breakfast consumption relative to extended fasting is causally related to weight change in free-living overweight/obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Owing to the limitations of quantifying energy intake under free-living conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> various laboratory-based studies have also examined acute energy intake and immediate metabolic responses to differing breakfast compositions/quantities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, the comparison of these acute responses in obese adults under laboratory-controlled conditions remain to be examined in relation to the more fundamental comparison between extended morning fasting and breakfast consumption.</p><p>Laboratory paradigms allow careful examination of the metabolic consequences of meal omission and can highlight potential mechanisms that cannot be studied in free-living settings. The use of an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal also allows some insight into the effects of different morning intakes on immediate energetic compensation that set meals do not allow. Some laboratory studies have quantified <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake following breakfast omission in lean individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> with the majority of studies indicating additional intake at lunch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> but less clear evidence for the effects upon intake at subsequent meal/snacking opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> In all but one investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> where a relatively small (10&#x00025; of daily energy requirements) breakfast was consumed, subsequent feeding has been insufficient to compensate for the breakfast omitted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> However, there is no evidence pertaining to immediate energetic compensation following breakfast omission in obese individuals. A recent study has examined metabolic and hormonal responses to extended fasting compared with breakfast consumption in overweight individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> However, this was in response to a set lunch meal, so immediate energetic compensation was not examined. It is therefore currently unknown the degree to which obese individuals compensate for morning fasting and importantly, the metabolic and hormonal consequences of doing so.</p><p>It cannot be assumed that the responses of obese individuals will be the same as lean individuals. Previous studies contrasting obese and lean counterparts have highlighted several relevant differences that might contribute to divergent findings in the two groups. For example, obese individuals have delayed satiation to feeding, with greater energy intake before reaching maximum satiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> This discrepancy in satiation may partly be influenced by differences in appetite-regulating hormones. It has been reported that peptide tyrosine&#x02013;tyrosine (PYY; a hormone implicated in satiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup>) concentrations are lower postprandially in obese as opposed to normal-weight individuals, despite greater intake during an <italic>ad libitum</italic> buffet lunch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> This attenuation of PYY release has been implicated in the reduced satiety induced by meals in obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, the usual suppression of ghrelin (an appetite-stimulating hormone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup>) in response to feeding in lean individuals is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> or potentially even completely abolished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> in obese individuals. Although these studies have established differences in hormonal regulation of appetite between lean and obese individuals, little is known about the hormonal responses of obese individuals to feeding after an extended morning fast and a subsequent meal. Owing to the features of hormonal regulation of appetite in obese individuals outlined above, the potential for a prior meal (in this instance a typical breakfast) to reduce subsequent intake might be inhibited but this requires examination.</p><p>To this end, the present study examined energy intake, as well as metabolic and hormonal responses to acute morning fasting in obese individuals. It is hypothesised that extended morning fasting will not result in greater <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch intake than breakfast consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-four healthy obese men (<italic>n</italic>=8) and women (<italic>n</italic>=16) aged 25&#x02013;58 years took part in this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, with the Ethical Approval for the study obtained from the NHS Bristol Research Ethics Committee. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN31521726). Participants were firstly deemed eligible to participate if they had a body mass index of &#x02a7e;30&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and then later classified as obese based upon dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived fat mass indices of &#x02a7e;9&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> (men) and &#x02a7e;13&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (women).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> The study was part of a wider programme of work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> The sample size for this study was based on estimates for the programme of work as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In brief, those estimates were determined by the number of participants required to detect differences in free-living physical activity and energy intake between two independent experimental groups (<italic>n</italic>~14 per group). Therefore, the sample size of this investigation (<italic>n</italic>=24) is sufficient to detect any meaningful responses of the more tightly controlled laboratory-based parameters assessed within participants using the repeated measures cross-over design employed. Participants reported being weight stable (&#x000b1;2&#x00025; body mass within the past 6 months), followed a standard sleep-wake cycle (for example, no shift workers) and did not anticipate changes in lifestyle (for example, diet/exercise) during the study period. Participants were free from metabolic disorders and were not taking any medications known to affect appetite regulation, with those participants that were pre-menopausal either menstruating regularly, or following their chosen contraceptive method (that is, pill, implant) for &#x0003e;6 months. Pre-menopausal women were tested during days 3&#x02013;10 of the menstrual cycle to avoid any effect of menstrual cycle phase on appetite. The cohort comprised of a mixture of regular breakfast consumers and non-consumers (classified based on &#x0003e;50&#x02009;kcal intake within 2&#x02009;h of waking on &#x02a7e;4 days of the week).

All participants were tested entirely separately from one another and remained sedentary in the laboratory throughout. Upon arrival at 08:00&#x000b1;1&#x02009;h, following an overnight fast of &#x02a7e;10&#x02009;h duration, participants voided and then had body mass measured in light clothing (Seca 873, Vogel and Halke). Resting metabolic rate was obtained according to guidelines for best practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> A cannula was then placed into an antecubital vein, with a 15&#x02009;ml baseline sample of blood drawn.

Blood samples were then drawn at hourly intervals until 3&#x02009;h post breakfast, when an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch was served. The lunch period lasted 30&#x02009;min with participants left alone during this time.

This was provided in a large bowl, with the pasta topped up every 10&#x02009;min to prevent visual feedback of food consumed and any tendency to finish the provided portion.

We have demonstrated for the first time that obese individuals do not compensate for missed breakfast energy intake at a lunchtime meal and that neither ghrelin nor subjective measures of appetite are increased during the afternoon following morning fasting.</p><p>This is the first study to specifically examine a contrast of acute morning fasting against breakfast consumption on <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch intake in obese individuals. Although it has been suggested that energy intake is increased with breakfast skipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> there is accumulating evidence from randomised controlled trials that energy intake is either unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> or lower in individuals who skip breakfast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> The current study indicates that any potential compensation for omitted energy intake through breakfast skipping is not strongly manifested through energy intake at this lunchtime meal in obese individuals. This is in contrast to lean individuals previously studied using the same experimental design,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> where it was established that energy intake at lunch was significantly increased after morning fasting (although insufficiently to compensate for the omitted breakfast). It therefore appears that increased adiposity results in similar lunch time food intake independent of morning feeding and eradicates the immediate compensatory feeding responses apparent in lean individuals.</p><p>It has previously been shown that ghrelin suppression by food intake is either reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> or abolished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> in obese individuals, yet in the present study ghrelin was suppressed by breakfast consumption in that trial, and by lunch intake in the morning fasting trial. This indicates that ghrelin suppression does occur in obese individuals and occurs independent of the overnight fast duration. However, similar to our previous observations in lean individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> a prior carbohydrate-rich breakfast meal can interfere with subsequent ghrelin suppression by a similarly carbohydrate-rich <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch. This blunted response of ghrelin during the afternoon (that is, a lack of suppression after feeding) may be linked to reduced insulin responses to the lunch following breakfast consumption that is putatively due to the second-meal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> as some authors have proposed an important role for insulin in ghrelin suppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Whether this effect persists with breakfast and lunchtime meal combinations inducing less-pronounced differences in insulinaemia relative to morning fasting is an interesting area of future study.</p><p>Leptin and PYY concentrations were lower in the afternoon during the fasting trial; as would be expected for both hormones due to the stimulatory effects of repeated feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> and the proposed mediating role of PYY in signalling relative energy deficit from calorie restriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Therefore, in individuals who had fasted during the morning, there were hormonal responses following lunch generally associated with reduced satiety (lower PYY/leptin) as well as others that may contribute to reduced hunger (lower ghrelin). Within the context of these contrasting hormonal responses, there was some tentative evidence of lower perceptions of appetite at the end of the day in the fasting trial in these obese individuals. Future work extending laboratory investigations into the evening would provide interesting information as to the time course of these hormones/subjective perceptions of appetite prior to a 2nd/3rd meal and establish if there are any resultant effects upon total daily energy intake in obese individuals. As it has recently been suggested that the circadian clock increases appetite and hunger in the evening independent of food intake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> it would be informative to establish if different morning feeding patterns can influence appetite later in the day imposed upon this underlying circadian rhythmicity. As two recent publications examining morning fasting in lean individuals have reported insufficient <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake at multiple subsequent meals to compensate for breakfast consumption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> it is of interest to establish the effect of morning fasting upon cumulative intake across several meals in obese individuals.</p><p>Despite marked differences in subjective ratings of appetite immediately prior to lunch, there was no difference in lunchtime energy intake between the two trials. This is not completely unexpected as the correlation between pre-lunch appetite ratings and <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch energy intake in lean men is modest at best (that is, <italic>r</italic>=0.25&#x02013;0.38)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> and a meta-analysis has indicated that sensations of hunger and satiety do not correlate with energy intake in obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> There are several plausible explanations for this lack of relationship between pre-lunch appetite ratings and energy intake. First, that the relationship between appetite and intake is disrupted in obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Second, that subjective appetite measures do not adequately capture the various dimensions of appetite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> Third, there is evidence that people eat according to habit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> and it is possible that the current intervention is not potent enough to overcome these feeding habits. Lastly, that another factor led to termination of the meal in participants who were still hungry. This could have arisen owing to feelings other than satiation (that is, boredom and reduced liking for the food provided due to the homogeneity of the meal provided in this fixed course meal), as provision of a variety of foods delays satiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> and promotes greater intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup></p><p>Examination of feeding behaviours within the laboratory allows tight experimental control of participants and measurements of physiological parameters that may influence, and are affected by, food intake. However, it is plausible that energy intake in a natural environment would be discrepant from the results obtained in the laboratory owing to self-regulation of feeding patterns and food choices. This is also particularly relevant as obese individuals display elevated neural responses to palatable and energy-dense foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> and are suggested to be more susceptible to environmental cues to eat than hormonal regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Laboratory studies utilising buffet designs or permitting volitional feeding frequency are warranted in obese individuals as well as free-living studies examining energy intake.</p><p>The present study demonstrates extended morning fasting does not result in compensatory intake at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal in obese individuals. We have shown for the first time that morning fasting does not interfere with the suppression of ghrelin by a lunch in obese individuals, potentially because of the greater insulin response when consuming the meal fasted. There was also no evidence of increased appetite in the afternoon when individuals had fasted throughout the morning. These results indicate that obese individuals do not compensate for morning fasting by consuming more food at the next meal but that hormonal and metabolic responses to lunch are impacted by morning feeding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all of those that participated in the study.
