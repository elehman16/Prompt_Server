The first group received 30 g of powdered flaxseed, the second group received two 1000 mg capsules of evening primrose, and the third group received 1 capsule of 400 IU Vitamin E, daily and for two menstrual cycles. Cyclical breast pain was measured at the beginning and end of both intervention periods by daily subscription form of pain duration.

Midwives should be aware of evidences on treatments with fewer side effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Of alternative treatments used as first-line treatment of breast periodic pain are flaxseed, evening primrose oil, and Vitamin E.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Flaxseed with the scientific name <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> includes some unsaturated essential fatty acids which cause synthesis of omega-3 fatty acid and through it, the production of some arachidonate metabolites are reduced, and eicosanoids with less pro-inflammatory effect are produced. Eicosanoids, derived from omega-3 found in flaxseed, have less inflammatory and even anti-inflammatory properties compared to omega-6 available in evening primrose. In addition, flaxseed contains large amounts of phytoestrogen lignan which is an antioxidant, inhibits the activity of the aromatase enzyme, resulting in decreased production of estrogen, thereby, plays a role in preventing cancers related to estrogen such as breast cancer.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The chemical structure of lignans is similar to estrogen receptor selective modulators such as tamoxifen which is of hormonal drug treatments of periodic breast pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] According to the study of Mirghafourvand <italic>et al</italic>., the average time period of breast pain significantly decreased in all three groups.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Due to the fact that in women with periodic pain of breast, plasma levels of essential fatty acids such as gamma linolenic acid and precursors of class prostanoid prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> are low, so supplements containing gamma linolenic acid such as evening primrose oil can be used in the treatment of period pain of the breast.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The study of Alvandipour <italic>et al</italic>. showed that evening primrose oil and Vitamin E have similar therapeutic effects in reducing breast pains.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism of Vitamin E in reducing the periodic pain of the breast due to its antioxidant benefits is the ability to prevent the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase and prevent the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and hence prevent the formation of prostaglandins, and with increasing internal opioids of the body, enhance the individual's tolerance to pain and reduce it.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the study of Jafarnejad <italic>et al</italic>., Vitamin E has been effective in reducing periodic breast pain duration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Due to the fact that people prefer the use of herbal supplements such as flaxseed in the treatment of chronic diseases such as cyclical breast pain[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and due to the fact that all three drugs of flaxseed, evening primrose, and Vitamin E have been introduced as the first line of treatment of breast periodic pain and a study is not available to compare the impact of these three first-line drugs on periodic pain of breast, the present study was conducted to compare the three drugs for periodic pain breast.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study is a quasi-randomized clinical trial performed in 2015 on ninety women with periodic breast pain, which was repeated for at least five consecutive days in two previous menstrual cycles, and they referred to Ghaem Educational, Research and Treatment Center or were resident in the dorms of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Patients having the following criteria were studied: informed consent, age of 18&#x02013;45 years, having a cyclical breast pain for at least 5 consecutive days in two previous menstrual cycles, regular 21&#x02013;35 day menstrual cycles, lack of any abnormal case in breast clinical examination, no history of breast cancer or any breast masses in themselves or first-degree relatives such as mother and sister, absence of tumors and cancers in other organs, no history of breast surgery and gel injections in the breast, and lack of having constipation and were excluded from the study in case of the following conditions: pregnancy, taking hormonal drugs such as oral contraceptives, sensitivity or intolerance to supplements and medication side effects during the study, lack of medication for three consecutive days or five periodic days, and withdraw from the study.</p><p>The sample size according to other studies[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with a power of 80% and 95% confidence level was 27 persons in each group and a total of 81.

Given that this study was a quasi-clinical trial and six centers were selected for sampling, and due to the fact that there was no possibility of blinding the drugs used, and people within each center were linked together, to control the dissemination of information, centers were divided into three groups randomly and based on the table of random numbers, and both centers were laid in one treatment groups. Then, people who had the profile of the study center were chosen based on easy way and objective. First, the basic form of demographic characteristics and duration of pain in people who complained of breast periodic pain was completed. The diagnosis criterion was breast periodic pain for at least five consecutive days provided that this case is repeated in their two previous menstrual cycles. Then, breast of people was examined in terms of mass, secretion, symmetry, and unnatural cases. Then, people were asked until the start the next menstrual period to use proper bra which were as supporters and minimizing movements of the breasts, and with the support of mammary tissue, prevent aggravating of the pain,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and intervention began with next menstrual cycle start. They were divided into three groups as follows: the flaxseed group received 30 g of milled flaxseed into two 15 g packages, each package must be solved in a glass of water, juice, doogh, milk, soup, yogurt, or salads. Group of evening primrose oil capsules received two 1000 mg capsules daily and group of Vitamin E received a 400 IU capsule daily. All three drugs were taken orally with a glass of water for two menstrual cycles.</p><p>Flaxseed used in this study was milled and weighed after preparation, and because of the possibility of oxidation, the packaging lid was vacuumed and was delivered to the research units on a weekly basis. Capsules of evening primrose oil (manufactured by Barij oil pharmaceutical company) have thirty number packages and capsules of Vitamin E (manufacturing of Co. Zahravi) in ten number sheets and were provided from drug store and were delivered to research units on a monthly basis. The research centers were called every week to remind taking medications and to answer questions of the individuals. Checklist of daily use of medication for daily record throughout the week, with the weekly checklist and duration of breast pain based on daily recording form of pain were given to the research units by the researcher. At the end of each month of treatment, criteria for the withdrawal during the study including a delay in medication for 3 consecutive days or 5 continuous days, use of any other treatments for breast pain, and pregnancy were evaluated and based on which those who have not observed the study circumstances were excluded from the study.</p><p>The validity of all forms made by the researcher including personal information form, examination form, form of elimination criteria during the study, and form of daily record of pain and medication checklists were determined by content validity method. Reliability of form of daily record of pain duration was determined by inter-rater reliability method, and the correlation between the responses was confirmed by 0.91 Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Other research tools included clear questions and were frequently asked research units, so no need to determine the reliability.</p><p>Finally, the data were analyzed by statistical software SPSS (IBM &#x02013; Company, Armonk, NY-USA, version 16). Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was used to evaluate the normality of variables, Chi-square and Fisher's exact test and one-sided ANOVA statistical tests were used to verify the homogeneity of variables, Freidman test was used to determine the drug's effect on individual groups, and Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used to compare the effects of drugs among the three groups. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Independent variables in this study were flaxseed, evening primrose oil, and Vitamin E and the dependent variable was periodic breast pain duration.

Three groups have not statistically significant differences at the beginning of the study in the duration of breast pain.</p><p>According to the present study, duration of breast pain into three groups of flaxseed, evening primrose oil, and Vitamin E per month of treatment was not significantly different in the total population. Blommers <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 120 patients with severe breast pain treated with evening primrose oil or fish oil; the days of pain in the entire study population were significantly reduced.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The results of the present study do not match with the research mentioned. In the present study, pain duration did not significantly reduce in the evening primrose oil group. The reason for this difference might be that in Blommers <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, both cyclical and noncyclical breast pains were investigated, which in the noncyclic pain because of they exist in the whole menstrual cycle, pain duration is more than that of cyclic. Another possible reason is the difference in the dosage of evening primrose oil used in the study of Blommers <italic>et al</italic>. as 3 g daily, while in the present study, it was 2 g daily. Furthermore, the duration of treatment in the study of Blommers <italic>et al</italic>. was longer as 6 months.</p><p>The results of Mirghafourvand <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the average duration of pain was significantly decreased in the three groups studied using flaxseed, Vitex agnus, or placebo.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the present study, reduction of the duration of pain was significant only in flaxseed group as well. The reason of this similarity probably was almost the same dosage of flaxseed used and the same duration of the intervention. Study of Alvandipour <italic>et al</italic>. showed that evening primrose oil and Vitamin E have the same treatment effects in reducing breast pain,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the results of which are consistent with this study because in this study, both evening primrose oil and Vitamin E drugs reduced duration of periodic pain but no significant difference was observed between them. The reason for the similarity of the results of this study and the present study may be the used similar doses of evening primrose oil and Vitamin E. In the study of Momeni <italic>et al</italic>., the number of days without pain 2 months after the intervention, had a significant decrease only in evening primrose and Vitex agnus, and not a significant difference found in Vitamin E. The results of this study on evening primrose are different from results of the present study and is similar regarding Vitamin E. In our study, despite the pain reduction in each of the three groups, this reduction was significant only in flaxseed group. The reason for this difference may be different doses of evening primrose and similar doses of Vitamin E as well as a higher number of individuals in each group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the study of Jafarnejad <italic>et al</italic>., Vitamin E and fish oil both led to a significant reduction in periodic breast pain. In the present study, despite the reduction in the duration of pain in Vitamin E, this reduction was not statistically significant, the reason for this difference may be due to the higher number of research units in the study of Jafarnejad, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Of the strengths of this study were to compare flaxseed with the most common treatments for periodic breast pain, which due to the ethical limitations, the examination and identification of periodic breast pain were conducted as retrospective and the correctness of the remarks of research units were applied as selection criterion and it was not possible to blind the study because of various medication forms and nonacceptance of research units of concomitant use of two different medication forms and high cost of providing the placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that all three drugs of flaxseed, evening primrose oil, and Vitamin E reduce breast pain duration, but this reduction is impressive in flaxseed group.
