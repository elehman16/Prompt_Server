When the current study was designed, not enough information was available to estimate the sample size required to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, trial. In order to assess the feasibility of a direct switch between two fibromyalgia drugs in the same class, this pilot study was designed to emulate clinical practice so that patients who were already receiving duloxetine, but were dissatisfied with treatment, could switch to milnacipran without down-tapering of duloxetine or uptitration of milnacipran. Both of these medications are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SRNIs) approved for the management of fibromyalgia in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-6-311">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref> Studies of SNRIs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression have shown that patients failing to respond to one treatment can benefit from a switch to medications with a similar mechanism of action,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jpr-6-311">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jpr-6-311">21</xref> but such studies have not been conducted in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, two of the main outcomes expected from this study were as follows: whether patients experience any improvements in pain or other symptoms after switching medications; and whether patients could switch directly without having to decrease duloxetine dosage before initiating treatment with milnacipran in order to avoid a gap in SNRI therapy. The current report presents preliminary findings regarding the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical benefits of switching between drugs in the same class when treatment response to one drug is inadequate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was an exploratory, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of milnacipran in patients with an inadequate response to duloxetine for the treatment of fibromyalgia (Clinical Trial Registration ID NCT01077375). The trial was conducted at 25 study centers in the United States from March to December 2010. An institutional review board approved the protocol, which was developed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written consent after the study was explained and their questions answered and before study procedures were initiated.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The study included female and male outpatients, aged 18&#x02013;70 years, with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia who had been receiving the recommended dosage of duloxetine 60 mg/day (ie, the maximum dosage recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-6-311">17</xref> at stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Duloxetine prescriptions had to be for the management of fibromyalgia and not for the treatment of depression or another pain syndrome. Patients with a one-week visual analog scale (VAS) pain recall score &#x02265;40 mm to &#x02264;90 mm at screening were entered into the open-label, run-in period of this study and continued receiving duloxetine 60 mg/day for an additional 2 weeks in order to confirm that they were not having an adequate response to duloxetine under study conditions. After this 2-week run-in period, patients who continued to have a VAS pain score &#x02265;40 mm and who still expressed dissatisfaction with treatment were eligible for randomization. A deliberately general question was used to evaluate treatment satisfaction (ie, &#x0201c;Are you satisfied with duloxetine treatment?&#x0201d;) in order to allow for any potential dissatisfaction (eg, unsatisfactory improvement in pain or non-pain symptoms, poor tolerability, simple desire to try a new medication), as might occur in clinical practice.</p><p>In order to minimize expectation bias that would occur with an open-label switch to milnacipran, patients were randomized (4:1) to milnacipran or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 10 weeks of treatment, followed by a one-week, double-blind, down-taper period. The placebo arm was included to lessen the potential for bias in patients who might otherwise expect improvement from being switched to another therapy, rather than to provide a comparison group, because the placebo arm was too small to allow direct comparison.</p><p>Patients randomized to milnacipran were switched directly without down-tapering of duloxetine or uptitration of milnacipran. During the first 2 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, milnacipran could be lowered to 50 or 75 mg/day if patients had initial difficulty tolerating the minimum recommended dosage (100 mg/day).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref> However, patients unable to tolerate milnacipran 100 mg/day by the end of week 2 were discontinued from the study. After week 2, the milnacipran dosage could be escalated to 200 mg/day (ie, the highest dosage recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref> as needed to treat symptoms effectively, and the dosage could also be decreased to 50 or 75 mg/day for tolerability. Patients randomized to the placebo group continued receiving duloxetine 30 mg/day for the first week of double-blind treatment during a duloxetine down-taper, then continued on placebo for the remainder of the study. In addition, all patients who withdrew from the study for any reason were down-tapered from active medication (duloxetine or milnacipran) in accordance with prescribing recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-6-311">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref></p><p>Patients meeting any of the following criteria were excluded from the study: history or current diagnosis of serious psychiatric disorder; substantial alcohol use or abuse; behavior that would, in the investigator&#x02019;s judgment, prohibit participation in the study; serious suicide risk; Beck Depression Inventory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jpr-6-311">22</xref> &#x0003e;25; pregnancy or breastfeeding; unacceptable contraception in those of childbearing potential; untreated hypertension; cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction or stroke within the past 6 months; sitting mean systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;100 mmHg; active or unstable medical illness; evidence of active liver disease; prostate enlargement or other genitourinary disorders; renal impairment (creatinine clearance &#x0003c;30 mL per minute); uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma; body mass index &#x02265;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Excluded concomitant medications included drugs with central nervous system activity, such as antidepressants, anorectics, antiepileptic agents, opiates, and related analgesics (eg, oxycodone, codeine, tramadol, narcotic patches), dopamine agonists, stimulants, and sodium oxybate. Permitted analgesic medications were acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Patients requiring short-term pain rescue medication were allowed opioid analgesics, but opioids were not permitted within 7 days of scheduled study visits. Triptans were permitted for acute migraine treatment. Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics were also allowed for patients requiring treatment of insomnia.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy parameter was responder status based on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score, defined as the proportion of patients rating their overall improvement from baseline to week 10 of the double-blind period as &#x0201c;very much improved&#x0201d; (score = 1) or &#x0201c;much improved&#x0201d; (score = 2) based on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7 (&#x0201c;very much worse&#x0201d;). As with the question used to evaluate patient satisfaction with duloxetine, the general wording of the PGIC (ie, &#x0201c;Since I started investigational product at visit 2 [randomization], overall my fibromyalgia is &#x02026;&#x0201d;) allowed patients to consider any reason for improvement, including better efficacy or tolerability.</p><p>The secondary efficacy parameter was change from randomization to week 10 of the double-blind treatment period in one-week recall VAS pain score. A post hoc analysis was also conducted to identify the percentages of patients with &#x02265;30%, &#x02265;40%, and &#x02265;50% improvement from baseline in pain severity.

Missing values were imputed using a last observation carried forward approach. For analyses of mean changes, baseline was defined as the randomization visit. Safety analyses were based on the double-blind safety population, defined as randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. All efficacy analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population, defined as all patients in the double-blind safety population who had at least one post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy parameter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 115 patients who received at least one dose of open-label duloxetine during the 2-week run-in period, 107 met the criteria for inadequate response to duloxetine and were randomized to double-blind treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-311">Figure 1</xref>). In the group switched to milnacipran, 51/86 (59.3%) patients completed the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events for milnacipran (15/86 [17.4%]) and insufficient therapeutic response for placebo (6/21 [28.6%]). In the milnacipran group, one patient who did not receive double-blind treatment was excluded from safety and intent-to-treat efficacy analyses; five patients without post-baseline efficacy assessments were excluded from the intent-to-treat population. All randomized patients in the placebo group were included in the safety and efficacy analyses.</p><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-6-311">Table 1</xref>. Most patients (&#x0003e;90%) were female; mean age for all intent-to-treat patients was 48.6 years.

In the small group of patients switched to placebo, 5/21 (23.8%) were improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-6-311">Table 2</xref>); however, as planned, sample sizes were not powered to evaluate between-group differences. At the week 6 and week 10 study visits, mean improvements in VAS pain score were found with milnacipran (&#x02212;8.2 and &#x02212;12.3, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-6-311">Figure 2</xref>); mean changes from baseline with placebo were minimal (+1.3 and &#x02212;1.3 at weeks 6 and 10, respectively). Clinically meaningful improvements in pain (ie, &#x02265;30% decrease from randomization in VAS pain score) were found in 27/29 (34.2%) of milnacipran-treated patients; 20/79 (25.3%) patients reported &#x02265;50% pain improvement. In patients switched to placebo, 6/21 (28.6%) and 3/21 (14.3%) had &#x02265;30% and &#x02265;50% improvements in pain, respectively.</p><p>Mean changes from randomization to week 10 in MASQ, EQ-5D, FIQR, and ASEX suggested improvements in multiple symptom domains among patients switched to milnacipran (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-6-311">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability and safety</title><p>Switching from duloxetine to milnacipran was generally well tolerated in patients with fibromyalgia. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea, dizziness, headache, and insomnia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-6-311">Table 3</xref>). In patients receiving placebo, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea and diarrhea. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 15 (17.6%) milnacipran-treated patients; nine of these patients discontinued during the first week after switching from duloxetine to milnacipran. Dizziness (3.5%) was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation in this group. Two patients switched to placebo discontinued due to an adverse event (one with nausea, one with contact dermatitis). No deaths occurred in the study. Serious adverse events were reported in two patients switched to milnacipran (one with hypersensitivity, one with suicidal ideation), both of whom were discontinued from the study. No serious adverse events were reported in any patient who switched to placebo.</p><p>In patients switched to milnacipran, mean changes in vital signs from randomization to end of study, defined as the last available assessment in the double-blind period, were as follows: systolic blood pressure, 1.13 mmHg (placebo 0.39 mmHg); diastolic blood pressure, 2.84 mmHg (placebo &#x02212;0.08 mmHg); heart rate, 7.42 beats per minute (placebo &#x02212;2.00 beats per minute); body weight, 0.04 kg (placebo 0.37 kg). Potentially clinically significant changes in these measures were found in three milnacipran-treated patients, including two who had diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;110 mmHg with a &#x02265;10 mmHg increase from baseline and one who had a &#x02265;7% decrease in body weight from baseline.</p><p>Mean change from randomization to end of study in Beck Depression Inventory total score was 1.0 (placebo 3.4), indicating no significant worsening of depressive symptoms following the switch from duloxetine to milnacipran.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from this pilot study suggest that switching between medications within the same drug class may be a useful treatment strategy in some patients with fibromyalgia. This study was conducted in patients who had already been prescribed duloxetine for fibromyalgia by their physicians and had received the recommended dosage of 60 mg/day for 6 weeks or longer prior to randomization (ie, &#x02265;4 weeks before screening and 2 weeks during the open-label, run-in period of this study). Because switching medications is not usually necessary when individuals respond well to treatment, this study was limited to patients who were not experiencing an adequate response to duloxetine, as indicated by moderate or severe pain at randomization (ie, VAS pain score &#x02265;40) and confirmation of patient dissatisfaction (ie, response of &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to the question &#x0201c;Are you satisfied with duloxetine treatment?&#x0201d;). In the patients who met these criteria, switching to milnacipran appeared to have some benefits. After 10 weeks of milnacipran treatment, approximately one third of patients had clinically meaningful improvements in global status (32.9% with PGIC score &#x02264;2) or pain (34.2% with &#x02265;30% reduction in VAS pain score). In the 21 patients who were randomized to placebo, five patients (23.8%) had improvement in PGIC and six patients (28.6%) had improvement in pain. However, no conclusive statements can be made regarding treatment effects because the small placebo group was designed for blinding purposes only and statistical analyses of between-group differences were neither planned nor conducted.</p><p>An important issue raised by this study is whether patients can safely switch from duloxetine to milnacipran without a washout period or down-tapering of duloxetine. The results suggest that a majority of fibromyalgia patients may tolerate a direct switch from duloxetine to milnacipran. Of the 85 milnacipran-treated patients in the safety population, 15 (17.6%) discontinued due to an adverse event, and nine (10.6%) left the study within one week after switching from duloxetine. It is unclear whether these withdrawals were related to stopping duloxetine or starting milnacipran, and it is possible that dose titration of milnacipran and/or tapering duloxetine, rather than a direct switch between medications, may help to alleviate side effects in this subset of patients. No unexpected treatment-emergent adverse events were found, and nausea was the most commonly reported adverse event in both groups (milnacipran, 21.2%; placebo, 28.6%). Nausea, headache, and constipation, which were the three most common adverse events in the pivotal milnacipran studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref> occurred less frequently in this study than in those previous trials. Moreover, nausea occurred less frequently in patients switched to milnacipran than in those switched to placebo. Although the reasons for these results are unclear, it is possible that prior exposure to duloxetine mitigated some of the nausea and other SNRI-related adverse events in patients switched to milnacipran; it is also possible that withdrawal of duloxetine induced nausea in the placebo group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-6-311">17</xref> Mean increases in blood pressure and heart rate were detected in patients switching from duloxetine to milnacipran. These changes were similar to results seen when starting milnacipran in other, placebo-controlled studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref></p><p>Although duloxetine and milnacipran are in the same class of drugs, there are a few differences that may affect how patients respond to these medications. While both compounds inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, duloxetine is more selective for serotonin reuptake inhibition while milnacipran is more selective for norepinephrine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jpr-6-311">28</xref> In addition, these drugs have slightly different adverse event profiles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-6-311">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-6-311">18</xref> Although no definitive statements can be made based on these pharmacologic differences, it is possible that they account for the milnacipran treatment response observed in this study.</p><p>Although this study provides preliminary information about the potential efficacy and safety of switching medications in patients with fibromyalgia, the findings are limited by the absence of a true placebo control and formal between-group analyses. The small placebo group was designed to reduce the risk of expectation bias rather than to provide for statistical comparisons between milnacipran and placebo, and no hypothesis testing was planned for this study. Nonetheless, the results of this study suggest that switching medications might be a useful treatment strategy in patients with fibromyalgia and that larger and more rigorous clinical studies are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this exploratory study suggest that fibromyalgia patients with an inadequate response to duloxetine may benefit from switching to milnacipran, although further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Because only three drugs have been approved for the management of fibromyalgia, it is important for clinicians to know that some patients may benefit from this switch and that the approach is safe and tolerable.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-jpr-6-311"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>LB has received research support and speaker fees from Forest Laboratories, Inc. and Forest Research Institute, Inc.
