Herd owners need a vaccine that will confer long-lasting immunity to prevent PRRSV infection and transmission. The studies described here evaluated duration of immunity conferred by a European-derived PRRS (isolate 94,881) modified live virus (MLV) vaccine, Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU, at 20, 24, and 26&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination. Primary endpoints were the assessment of gross and histological lung lesions and viral RNA load in lung tissue 10&#x000a0;days following heterologous PRRSV challenge. Secondary endpoints included clinical observations, average daily weight gain (ADWG) and viral RNA load in serum 10&#x000a0;days post-challenge. Three blinded, vaccination-challenge efficacy studies were performed using separate cohorts of pigs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56 per study). Pigs received either Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU (Group 1) or placebo (Groups 2 and 3).

The disease was first identified in North America in the late 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and soon after in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and has since spread to other regions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The disease has profound economic consequences, causing significant losses to the worldwide swine industry, and an estimated annual loss of 1 billion US dollars in North America alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The extent of animal suffering, along with these economic losses have led to a significant drive to develop effective prevention, control and elimination strategies.</p><p id="Par22">PRRS is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), which is a member of the <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> family of the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Like all members of this family, PRRSV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. There are two major genetic lineages: Type 1, which was originally isolated in Europe in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and Type 2, which was first isolated in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These two genotypes emerged at approximately the same time, but their nucleotide sequences differ by approximately 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, there is also significant genetic variation within each genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This significant heterogeneity both between and within PRRSV genotypes has hindered attempts to develop an effective vaccine against PRRS.</p><p id="Par23">At present, two types of vaccine are commercially available: killed-virus (KV) vaccines and modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. KV vaccines are largely ineffective, or have only limited efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] while MLV vaccines are generally regarded as the most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], reducing reproductive and respiratory symptoms of PRRS disease, and improving weight gain in growing pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Despite their promising efficacy, PRRS MLV vaccines are still associated with multiple problems. Commercially available PRRS MLV vaccines are based on either PRRSV Type 1 or 2 viral strains, which effectively induce immunity against genetically similar PRRSV strains from within the same genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the level of efficacy conferred against heterologous PRRSV isolates is less clear. Vaccine efficacy can suffer from both the immune evasion strategies of the virus and the antigenic heterogeneity of the field strains. It is not possible to forecast precisely the level of protection afforded by a given PRRSV vaccine strain against a heterologous one, but it is clear that partial heterologous protection can be obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Commercially-reared pigs are typically slaughtered between 18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; therefore, an optimal vaccine should quickly elicit an effective immune response, and maintain duration of immunity for at least 26&#x000a0;weeks. The absence of clear correlates of protection means that further in vivo studies are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Current PRRS MLV vaccines elicit humoral and cell-mediated immunity; both become detectable by 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, whilst levels of PRRS-specific antibodies rapidly reach their peak of detection 4&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination or infection, the cell-mediated response is profoundly delayed, remaining at low levels for over 3&#x000a0;months before reaching its highest levels after 32&#x000a0;weeks post-vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As well as their efficacy shortcomings, there also remain concerns over the safety of PRRS MLV vaccines due to their potential to revert to virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A vaccine conferring rapid, long-lasting as well as effective immunity against a broad range of heterologous viral strains is very much needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">An ideal vaccine would achieve a long duration of immunity to reduce the risk of re-infection with PRRS during an animal&#x02019;s lifetime. Simultaneously, it must effectively reduce clinical signs of PRRS disease, viraemia, viral RNA load in lung tissues and viral shedding, to help limit viral transmission. Such a vaccine would help limit both the acute economic losses caused by PRRS infection and animal suffering. Developing such a vaccine represents a significant challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A new vaccine, PRRS 94881 (tradename: Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU), is derived from European PRRS isolate 94881, and has previously been shown to be clinically safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In order to determine whether PRRS 94881 MLV could provide long-term immunity to PRRSV challenge in 2-week old pigs, three vaccination-challenge studies following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) were carried out to evaluate the duration of immunity (DOI) at three different time points after vaccination. This paper details the results of these studies, which found that vaccinated pigs had reduced lung lesion scores, viraemia and viral RNA load in tissues at 20, 24 and 26&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study designs</title><p id="Par27">Three blinded, vaccination-challenge efficacy studies were performed using separate cohorts of pigs.

Each study contained three groups; Group 1 was vaccinated on Day 0 with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU, and Groups 2 and 3 were vaccinated with a placebo vaccine. This study aimed to evaluate DOI at 20, 24 and 26&#x000a0;weeks following vaccination. After 20, 24 or 26&#x000a0;weeks, Groups 1 and 2 were challenged with a heterologous European PRRS viral isolate 205,817, which shared 88.3% sequence homology at the GP5 gene with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU. The GP5 gene encodes the major envelope protein of PRRSV, and carries the major neutralising epitope of PRRSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Groups 1 and 2 were subsequently evaluated for lung pathology, serum and lung viremia, and observed for clinical signs of disease. No infections were observed in Group 3 pigs in any study, and there were no signs of co-infection. Therefore, the results presented here were attributed to the effects of PRRS 94881 MLV vaccine.</p><p id="Par49">PRRS respiratory infection models using EU type 1 PRRSV are rare due to them being difficult to develop. In the current study, we have modelled a novel PRRSV type I isolate 205,817 that can consistently infect and cause severe PRRS respiratory lesions at different ages of a growing and fattening pig; however, the amount of expected clinical signs and respiratory disease is reduced the older the pig gets.</p><p id="Par50">Reduction in gross and histological lung lesion scores was the primary efficacy endpoint of three studies. Lung lesion development is one of the hallmarks of PRRSV in growing pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and can be considered the source for all subsequent manifestations of secondary PRRS disease characteristics, including clinical signs, pyrexia, decreased ADWG and secondary infection with other pathogens. Therefore, these are the most clinically relevant and convincing parameters for measurement of PRRS vaccine efficacy. Macroscopic gross lung lesions are usually mild in adult animals, so slides were examined for multiple microscopic lung lesions typically observed following PRRSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The results of these three studies showed significant improvements in both gross and histological lung lesion scores among Group 1 compared with Group 2 pigs at 24 and 26&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination. Additionally, a significant reduction in histological lung lesions was seen at 20&#x000a0;weeks in Group 1 pigs. In the 20-week study, the lung lesion score of Group 1 animals was in a similar range to that of Group 1 animals in the two adjacent studies; however, significance could not be reached due to the fact that lung lesions in Group 2 pigs were low as well. These findings suggest that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU vaccine is highly effective in providing long-term (up to 26&#x000a0;weeks) immunity against a virulent challenge with PRRS. Some histological lung lesions were observed in negative control pigs, despite their confirmed absence of PRRSV RNA in serum at all time points throughout the study. Pigs housed under normal swine husbandry conditions for extended periods of time can develop minor lung lesions that are inconsequential, and not related to specific pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Post-challenge viremia was selected as the most important secondary efficacy parameter because it represents the level of viral replication occurring within the host animal upon exposure. Furthermore, pathogenic and humoral immune responses to PRRSV are related to viral loads in acute infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, a significant reduction in PRRS viral load following vaccination would indicate that the vaccine could efficiently limit PRRSV pathogenesis in the host. Significant reductions in post-challenge viremia were observed in Group 1 pigs compared with Group 2 pigs 7 and 10&#x000a0;days post-challenge at 20&#x02013;26&#x000a0;weeks. Cumulative exposure (AUC) from Days 3&#x02013;10 post-challenge was also decreased in these pigs. Both findings indicate that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU is efficient in limiting PRRSV viremia following virulent challenge, and confers a duration of immunity up to 26&#x000a0;weeks. Furthermore, a significant reduction in PRRSV-viral RNA load in lung tissue was observed in Group 1 pigs compared with Group 2 pigs at 20, 24 and 26&#x000a0;weeks. Viral RNA load in lung tissue is associated with viral replication and persistence in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The results of these studies showed that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU can effectively reduce PRRS-viral RNA load in lung tissue.</p><p id="Par52">PRRSV infection contributes to a reduction in daily weight gain in young pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the 9&#x000a0;days following PRRSV challenge at 20 and 24&#x000a0;weeks, the ADWG of the Group 1 pigs was significantly higher than that of Group 2 pigs, whose ADWG was lower than that of Group 3 pigs. Following challenge at 26&#x000a0;weeks, ADWG in Group 1 pigs was increased compared with Group 2, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. These results indicate that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU is effective at diminishing weight gain reduction caused by PRRS, possibly representing substantial economic importance. A recently published field study also supports this conclusion. This study found that vaccinating 4-week old piglets with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU improved weight gain and reduced clinical signs during the growing period, even when the piglets are infected shortly after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, the current study is limited by the lack of statistical power due to the small sample size and findings need to be confirmed in larger studies. Also, this study used young pigs that were negative for PRRSV RNA; further studies are therefore required to determine whether these results apply to pigs of different ages and immune status.</p><p id="Par53">PRRS MLV vaccines are considered the most effective PRRS vaccines available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results of the previous studies provide evidence that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU effectively confers immunity to PRRSV, which is maintained for up to 26&#x000a0;weeks. Since commercially-reared animals are typically slaughtered between 18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], this long DOI conferred by Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU may help reduce the chance of PRRSV-related disease for the whole lifespan of vaccinated animals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The three studies described here show that Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU was highly effective at conferring long-term immunity (up to 26&#x000a0;weeks) against virulent challenge with a heterologous European isolate of PRRSV in young pigs. After challenge at 24 and 26&#x000a0;weeks, gross and histological lung lesion scores, post-challenge viremia and viral RNA load in lung tissue, and ADWG were improved in PRRS-vaccinated pigs compared with challenge controls, with most measures reaching statistical significance. These results show that protection against heterologous PRRSV is achieved with the Ingelvac PRRSFLEX&#x000ae; EU, and can be maintained for the expected lifespan of young pigs, with beneficial effects on animal health and production.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADWG</term><def><p id="Par4">average daily weight gain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par5">area under the concentration-time curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par6">confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CP</term><def><p id="Par7">control product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOI</term><def><p id="Par8">duration of immunity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPC</term><def><p id="Par9">day post-challenge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p id="Par10">good clinical practices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GE</term><def><p id="Par11">genome equivalent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IM</term><def><p id="Par12">intramuscular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par13">interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KV</term><def><p id="Par14">killed virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MLV</term><def><p id="Par15">modified live virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRRS</term><def><p id="Par16">porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRRSV</term><def><p id="Par17">porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qPCR</term><def><p id="Par18">quantitative polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCID</term><def><p id="Par19">tissue culture infective dose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VRI</term><def><p id="Par20">Veterinary Resources, Inc.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Ryan Saltzman, Dr. Lyle Keel, Dr. Stephan Perch, Mr. Rex Smiley, Dr. Alicia Zimmerman and Ms. Sarah Layton for technical assistance.
