The most common treatment strategy in the UK over the past 10&#x000a0;years has been neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of 2&#x000a0;cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil [5FU] prior to surgery. This is based upon the results of the MRC OE02 trial, which demonstrated a 6% survival benefit at 5&#x000a0;years for this approach over surgery alone. The data suggests this improvement was driven by improved local control rather than reduced metastatic spread. However, the overall survival is still poor, just 23% of patients surviving 5&#x000a0;years from treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The MRC OE05 trial compared 4&#x000a0;cycles of neo-adjuvant ECX [epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine] chemotherapy to two cycles of cisplatin/5FU. It recruited over 800 patients and the final results are awaited.</p><p>Oesophageal cancer predominantly presents with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Even those found to be suitable for surgery usually present with stage III disease (at least T3 with lymph node metastases). The oesophagus lacks a serosal surface and tumours frequently threaten the circumferential resection margin (CRM). Disease present at or within 1&#x000a0;mm of the circumferential resection margin (CRM) (R1 resection) occurs in more than 50% of stage III cases treated by surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is a poor prognostic factor. In the OE02 study, the 3-year and the median survival for patients with R0 and R1 resection were reported as 42.4% <italic>vs.</italic> 18% and 2.1&#x000a0;years <italic>vs</italic>. 1.1&#x000a0;years, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Like in rectal cancer, neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy [CRT] has the potential to downstage tumours that threaten CRM and potentially improve cure rates.</p><p>The concept of neo-adjuvant CRT had been previously rejected in the UK based on the increased mortality reported in previously conducted trials of pre-operative CRT, and the fact that all but one trial had failed to show a benefit in overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The landscape of neo-adjuvant CRT has recently changed with the reporting of the CROSS trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which showed no increase in peri-operative mortality and a near-doubling of median survival compared to surgery alone. The data for benefit of pre-operative CRT for squamous cell carcinoma was so compelling that this is now standard of care. The CROSS trial has regenerated enthusiasm for neoadjuvant CRT trials in the UK and a national oesophageal workshop held in 2012 identified neo-adjuvant CRT as a key area of future research within the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This has led to the development of the NEOSCOPE trial, which is evaluating CRT as an addition to pre-operative chemotherapy in adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>Previous trials of pre-operative CRT typically involved cisplatin-5FU based regimens and reported mortality rates of around 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CROSS trial, a randomised phase III study, compared surgery (S) alone to neo-adjuvant CRT (CRT-S) in 368 patients with operable oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction tumours (of whom approximately three quarters had adenocarcinoma and one quarter squamous cell carcinoma histology). The CRT regimen consisted of weekly carboplatin [AUC 2] and paclitaxel [50&#x000a0;mg/m2] concurrent with radiotherapy [41.4&#x000a0;Gy in 23 fractions]. This trial has shown a superior OS in favour of the CRT-S arm [OS 49 <italic>vs.</italic> 24&#x000a0;months, Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.657, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003], a pathological complete response [pCR] rate of 29%, with no increase in surgical mortality (4% in both groups) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The R0 resection rates in the S and CRT-S arms were 69% and 92%, respectively [p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001]. Of the 178 patients assigned to the CRT-S arm, 162 (91%) completed protocol treatment of five cycles of chemotherapy and 164 (92%) received full dose radiotherapy. The study reported a low incidence of Grade 3/4 CRT toxicity [haematological 7%; non-haematological 13%]. Only one death was reported in the CRT arm, probably due to perforation of the oesophagus accompanied by major haemorrhage in the absence of thrombocytopenia. The results of this study, performed in patients with a similar stage and tumour morphology to those in the UK, would suggest that where neo-adjuvant CRT is delivered safely, this leads to a significant improvement in outcome. Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel/RT is a novel regimen, but although promising in its outcome, it had not been compared against the current standard of care for this disease, i.e. a neo-adjuvant platinum-5FU based chemotherapy or CRT.</p><p>Oxaliplatin has now been shown to be at least equivalent to cisplatin in advanced upper GI cancers, can be given as a convenient 2&#x000a0;hour infusion and has a more favourable toxicity profile compared to cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Oxaliplatin based CRT has been tested in Phase II trials, both in the neo-adjuvant and definitive treatment of oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PRODIGE5/ACCORD17 trial included patients selected to receive definitive CRT for oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this multi-centre phase 2/3 trial, 267 patients were randomised to either FOLFOX (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;134) or cisplatin-5FU (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;133) in combination with RT. The median progression-free survival was comparable (FOLFOX group 9.7&#x000a0;months, Cisplatin-5FU group 9.4&#x000a0;months, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64) with no significant differences in rates of Grade 3/4 toxicity and lower number of toxic deaths associated with the FOLFOX arm (1 vs 6, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06). The authors concluded that FOLFOX-based CRT might be a more convenient option for patients with localised oesophageal cancer. In summary, studies of oxaliplatin&#x02013;based CRT show promising activity with acceptable toxicity, may be potentially safer than cisplatin-based regimen, and therefore justify formal testing in a pre-operative study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>NEOSCOPE is a randomised phase II study which will test the safety (with regard to post-operative morbidity/mortality), efficacy (determined by pathological complete response in the resected specimen, pCR) and feasibility of recruiting to a randomised multi-centre trial of neo-adjuvant CRT in the UK.</p><p>The randomised phase II design allows us to test two differing radiosensitiser schedules [carboplatin/paclitaxel and oxaliplatin/capecitabine] with non-overlapping toxicities. The study is aimed to identify a safe and effective regimen that can be taken forward to a future Phase III trial where neo-adjuvant CRT will be compared with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer at high risk of R1 disease at surgery.</p><p>Additionally, blood and tissue samples will be collected for translational research and exploratory sub-studies will investigate whether PET/CT improves the accuracy and reproducibility of target volume delineation and the role of Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) in improving the therapeutic index in oesophageal cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>NEOSCOPE is a two arm, open, randomised Phase II trial. It is being run in approximately 19 participating centres across the UK.

Within one week prior to randomisation the following screening assessments should be performed: a history and physical examination (to include height, weight and WHO performance status); full blood count; serum renal, liver and bone profile (including serum magnesium); glomerular filtration rate; electrocardiogram; and pregnancy test in females of child bearing age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>The sample size calculations are based on the maximum of two binomial random variables and follow the ideas of Dunnett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The primary outcome of the study is rate of pathological complete response in the resection specimen. A response rate of 15% would not be sufficiently large to warrant further investigation, while a response rate of 35% is considered worthwhile. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to each of the two treatment arms and the total sample size of the study is 76 (38 patients/arm). This design is based on a one-sided type I error of 10% and a power of 90% of achieving significance if patients on one novel treatment have a response rate of 35% while the second treatment has a response rate of 15%. This specification ensures that a power greater 90% is achieved if both treatments have a worthwhile effect of 35%. The study will seek to recruit a maximum total of 85 patients to account for a 10% drop-out rate before resection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Method of randomisation</title><p>Wales Cancer Trials Unit will randomise patients centrally using the method of minimisation with a random element.

Protocol development was an iterative process over several months with incorporation of comments from several upper GI oncologists. The definition of target volumes and margins for NEOSCOPE has been informed by three main sources: (i) the CROSS trial radiotherapy protocol (ii) European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recommendations for the use of naCRT in adenocarcinomas of the gastro-oesophageal junction and the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and (iii) the radiotherapy protocol of Art Deco (A Randomised Trial of Dose Escalation in definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with Oesophageal cancer), a definitive CRT trial run by the CROSS group (M.

The OE05 study, a randomised phase III trial, which recruited over 800 patients and compared 2&#x000a0;cycles of cisplatin-5FU chemotherapy to 4&#x000a0;cycles of ECX (epirubicin, capecitabine, cisplatin), is due to report later this year and is expected to define the optimal neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. It is proposed that the best arm of NEOSCOPE will be taken forward to a phase III trial against the best arm of OE05. This study also builds on the high quality RTTQA programme which was built around the SCOPE trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and aims to standardise the delivery of pre-operative radiotherapy across the UK.</p><p>The use of neo-adjuvant CRT in oesophageal cancer has been tested in a number of studies, which have been heterogeneous in design, size and treatment regimen tested. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of randomised trials has shown that this approach increases R0 resection rates, reduces loco-regional recurrence and improves survival compared with surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There has been only one randomised phase III trial comparing pre-operative chemotherapy with pre-operative CRT. This study by Stahl <italic>et al.</italic> aimed to recruit 354 patients to detect a 10% improvement in 3-year overall survival [OS] in favour of CRT [from 25% to 35%] but closed early due to poor recruitment (126 patients recruited over 5&#x000a0;years). Nonetheless, it showed a non-significant trend towards improved 3-year survival in favour of CRT [47.4% v 27.7%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Through better selection of patients, improved peri-operative care and centralisation of upper gastro-intestinal surgical services, there has been a significant reduction in post-operative mortality. In the MRC OE02 trial, the post-operative mortality was 10% in patients receiving either neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the 3rd Annual Report of the UK National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit (26th March 2012), the post-operative mortality was 3.8% and many large surgical centres now have rates of in-hospital mortality of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Neo-adjuvant CRT has been historically associated with higher post-operative mortality. In the Urschel meta-analysis, there was a non-significant increase in peri-operative mortality [1.72 (0.96, 3.07; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07)] and increase in all-treatment mortality that was of borderline significance [1.63 (0.99, 2.68; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.053)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the Stahl trial of neo-adjuvant CRT <italic>vs</italic>. neo-adjuvant CT, there was a trend towards increased post-operative mortality [5 of 49 (10.2%) <italic>vs</italic>. 2 of 52 (3.8%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although only recently reported, this study was designed in the 1990s and opened to recruitment in November 2000. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was recommended but not mandated as part of this trial. This, together with the lack of pre/on-trial RT quality assurance, may have contributed to increased post-operative morbidity and mortality. Contrary to this, the CROSS trial found no significant increase in peri-operative mortality, which probably reflects the use of patient selection and improvement in surgical care and radiotherapy delivery over time.</p><p>In recent years, a great deal of work has been done to raise the standards of conformal radiotherapy for oesophageal cancer in the UK. Through a detailed protocol and quality assurance procedures, including test cases and on trial review of plans, the SCOPE 1 trial, a randomised trial of definitive CRT with cisplatin and capecitabine with/without Cetuximab, recruited greater than 250 patients from 44 radiotherapy centres and demonstrated that the UK can perform high quality, multi-centre RT based studies safely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This trial has allowed UK investigators to gain significant experience in delivering quality assured CRT and this provides an ideal platform on which to build a neo-adjuvant study, and to investigate precise methods of tumour localisation such as CT/PET and image-guided radiotherapy [IGRT], all of which should allow safer and more accurate delivery of RT, reduction of radiation damage to organs at risk and ultimately reduce post-operative morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The current UK standard practice has been largely influenced by the results of the MRC OE02 trial and until recently, clinicians had been actively recruiting to the MRC OE05 trial. Concerns about increased post-operative mortality/morbidity from neo-adjuvant CRT as well as participation in the MRC OE05 trial had discouraged routine use of neo-adjuvant CRT. However, the MRC OE05 trial has now closed to recruitment, the outcome with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy alone remains poor and the CROSS trial demonstrated that neo-adjuvant CRT can be given with acceptable morbidity, and when done so, is associated with a significant survival advantage. The UK has now seen the development of a high quality upper GI RT Quality Assurance programme through the SCOPE 1 trial. This, along with better patient selection through new imaging techniques like PET-CT and EUS, and improvement in peri-operative care through centralisation of surgical services, is expected to lead to better outcome than reported in previous neo-adjuvant CRT trials.</p><p>Based on the above, there is a growing clinical consensus that the two strategies of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and CRT containing regimens should be compared head-to-head in a prospective randomised controlled trial in oesophageal adenocarcinoma, particularly focussing on those patients who are at high risk of R1 surgical resection. NEOSCOPE will first establish the efficacy, safety and feasibility of two different neo-adjuvant CRT regimens.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Somnath Mukherjee, Christopher N Hurt and Tom Crosby contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>TDC and SM were responsible for the primary research question and CNH was responsible for the statistical section.
