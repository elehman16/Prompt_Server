<italic>In vitro</italic> data suggest a synergistic effect of cytarabine and azacitidine when azacitidine is administered before cytarabine exposure <xref rid="pone.0052695-Neil1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Several potential resistance mechanisms are discussed, among those an inactivity of dCK.

The dose finding trial reported herein was a prospective, randomised, open-label phase II trial with parallel group design and fixed sample size preceeding an open-label, randomised, controlled, multicenter phase II trial of the study alliance leukemia (SAL). Participating centers of the dose finding part of this trial were the University Hospitals of Muenster, Frankfurt am Main, Dresden and Essen, all located in Germany. The trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier: NCT00915252, URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00915252">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00915252</ext-link>). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Muenster and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written, informed consent was obtained from all patients before study enrolment.</p><p>Patients with &#x0003e;60 years of age with untreated AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) were eligible. Exclusion criteria were: Known central nervous system manifestation of AML, heart failure class 3 or 4 according to New York Heart Association, unstable coronary artery disease, serious cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy beyond beta blockers or digoxin, inadequate renal (creatinin clearance &#x0003c;30 ml/min) or hepatic function (serum total bilirubin &#x02265;1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &#x02265;2.5&#x000d7;ULN not caused by leukemic infiltration), known human immunodeficiency virus and/or hepatitis C infection, evidence or history of severe non-leukemia associated bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, evidence or recent history of CNS disease, including primary or metastatic brain tumors, seizure disorders, uncontrolled active infection, concurrent malignancies other than AML with an estimated life expectancy of less than two years, history of organ allograft, hypersensitivity to cytarabine (not including drug fever or exanthema), daunorubicin, azacitidine or mannitol and previous therapy with azacitidine (i.e. for an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome). An exclusion criterion only for the dose finding part of this trial was a leukocytosis &#x0003e;20,000/&#x000b5;l at study entry. For the controlled part of the trial, those patients were eligible if the leukocyte count could be decreased to &#x0003c;20,000/&#x000b5;l with hydroxyurea.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients were randomised 1&#x02236;1 between 37.5 (dose level 1) and 75 mg/sqm (dose level 2) of azacitidine without stratification. This parallel randomised evaluation allowed us a rapid evaluation of two different dose levels of azacitidine, and ensured six patients being treated with the recommended dose for the controlled part of the study. The random allocation sequence was generated using SAS software (proc plan). Randomisation lists were generated using block randomisation with a block size of 4. Randomisation was performed centrally providing allocation concealment. Patients were first screened for eligibility at clinical sites without having access to randomisation lists. Eligible patients were reported to a central randomisation unit by fax. Subsequently the intended intervention of each patient was reported back to clinical investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment Plan</title><p>The treatment scheme is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052695-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. After randomisation, patients received the randomised dose level of azacitidine on days &#x02212;5 to &#x02212;1 as intravenous (iv) infusion over 30 minutes, followed by &#x02018;7+3&#x02019; induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine 100 mg/sqm continuous iv infusion on days 1&#x02013;7 and daunorubicin 45 mg/sqm iv on days 3&#x02013;5. The rationale for reducing the azacitidine application per cycle to five days, as opposed to seven days per cycle for monotherapy, were as follows: First, the five-days application allowed for an application on weekdays, since application on weekends poses problems in selected study centers. Second, a pretreatment &#x0003e;5 days would prolong the delay of initiation of cytotoxic therapy in those patients with untreated AML. The maximum dose of 5&#x000d7;75 mg/sqm resulted from concerns regarding an additional cytotoxicity of the combination of standard induction and postremission therapy and higher doses of azacitidine. Dose level 1 of azacitidine was selected as 50% of dose level 2 based on recommended dose reductions to 50% in case of prolonged hematotoxicity by the manufacturer (investigational brochure and subsequent prescribing information).</p><fig id="pone-0052695-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052695.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT statement.</title><p>The patient flow through this dose finding pilot trial is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0052695.g001"/></fig><p>An early bone marrow evaluation was performed seven days after the end of the first induction therapy. A sufficient blast clearance in the early bone marrow evaluation was defined as &#x0003c;5% remaining leukemic blasts according to the revised recommendations of the International Working Group for AML <xref rid="pone.0052695-Cheson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Only in case of &#x02265;5% residual bone marrow blasts did patients receive an identical second induction course starting with azacitidine on day 17. Patients that achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy received two consolidation courses of azacitidine at the randomised dose level on days &#x02212;5 to &#x02212;1 subcutaneously, followed by intermediate-dose cytarabine (1 g/sqm bidaily iv on days 1, 3 and 5). Stopping rules included an increase of the leukocyte count to &#x0003e;50.000/&#x000b5;l during the first five days of azacitidine treatment. Such a patient would immediately terminate azacitidine treatment and start standard induction therapy. A patient was evaluable if either 1. at least one therapy cycle with azacitidine plus induction therapy was completed or 2. patient received at least one day of therapy and a DLT occurred. Patients with premature termination of either azacitidine treatment and/or induction therapy during their first induction course were evaluable only if a DLT occurred in this patient, otherwise, such a patient would be replaced by another patient in this dose level. Patients received supportive care including standard antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis according to each institution&#x02019;s guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Primary and Secondary Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of this dose finding study was safety and toxicity of both dose levels. The recommended dose for the controlled part of the trial was defined as the highest dose level with one or less out of six evaluable patients experiencing a DLT. A separate dose level 0 with azacitidine 18 mg/sqm would have been evaluated in additional six patients in case of &#x0003e;1 DLT in each dose level. If &#x0003e;1 DLT would have been occurred also in this dose level 0, no azacitidine would have been administered preceeding the cytotoxic cycles in the controlled part of the trial. Adverse events (AE&#x02019;s) and severe AE&#x02019;s (SAE&#x02019;s) were graded according to NCI common toxicity criteria (CTC) v3.0. CTCAE Grade 4 leukocytopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia as signs of active antileukemic treatment were assessed as an SAE only if persisting &#x0003e;42 days after the last application of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with blast clearance with (CR) or without (CRi) complete hematological recovery and then defined a DLT.</p><p>Assessment of treatment response was performed seven days after the end of the first induction cycle as described above, after hematological recovery following induction therapy, but not later than 35 days after the start of the last induction cycle, and every three months after achievement of complete remission until disease progression. Patients were monitored with physical examination, complete blood count and chemistry profile at least once weekly during induction and consolidation, and then at least monthly for the first two years after treatment start during follow-up.

Seven patients (four in dose level 75 mg/sqm, three in dose level 37.5 mg/sqm) achieved a CR after one (four patients) or two (three patients) induction courses whereas two additional patients succumbed to early death. One of the responding patients terminated study participation due to serious adverse events and achieved a CR without further therapy. Two patients had refractory disease after induction therapy, of whom one patient achieved a CR after termination of study participation and salvage therapy. After a median follow-up of 616 days from start of therapy, median overall and event-free survival of the entire cohort was 266 days and 215 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052695-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0052695-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052695.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Outcome of the entire trial population.</title><p>A: overall survival, B: event-free survival.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0052695.g004"/></fig><p>Of note is the outcome of patient no. 10. The patient with a complex karyotype AML received one induction course with azacitidine 37.5 mg/sqm followed by &#x02018;7+3&#x02019;. One week after commencement of the first induction cycle, the bone marrow evaluation showed persisting infiltration with 77% blasts. Due to massive hemolysis (most likely fluorochinolone-induced) and subsequent cardiac failure, both regarded as a SAE, trial treatment was stopped on day 31 of therapy. Despite no further treatment after termination of study participation, the patient achieved a complete remission on day 69 (38 days after end of trial), while both SAE&#x02019;s resolved. The patient remained in CR with good health and in the absence of further therapy for almost a year before relapse occurred.</p><p>Outcome by ELN risk group revealed 2 out of 2 patients achieving a CR with good risk, 2/4 patients with intermediate-I risk, 2/3 patients with intermediate-II risk and 1/3 patients with high risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We herein present data of a dose finding trial to evaluate safety, toxicity and feasibility of the addition of azacitidine to standard induction and consolidation therapy in older, medically fit patients with newly diagnosed AML. While intensive chemotherapy leads to a CR rate of 50% in this patient group, the probability of long-term survival is less than 10%, demonstrating the need for alternative and more efficacious treatment options. Azacitidine has a proven efficacy in patients with high-risk MDS and low-proliferating AML with 30% bone marrow blasts or less <xref rid="pone.0052695-Fenaux2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052695-Fenaux3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, even though this treatment is still considered to be palliative. Therefore, it seems desirable to assess the efficacy of the drug in combination with standard chemotherapy. We decided to administer azacitidine before the cytotoxic therapy on the basis of existing preclinical data suggesting beneficial effects of azacitidine priming <xref rid="pone.0052695-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. So far, azacitidine in a dosage of 75 mg/sqm has been evaluated in combination with high-dose cytarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed, cytarabine-refractory ALL <xref rid="pone.0052695-Avramis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Since a combination of azacitidine with a cytarabine and anthracyclines has not been evaluated, we assessed two different dose levels of azacitidine to determine the maximal tolerated dose.</p><p>The seven complete remissions seen in our pilot trial are in line with observed remission rates with intensive chemotherapy in this entity and age group, and the observed survival rates are encouraging.</p><p>Recent reports found an association with response to therapy in patients carrying DNMT3A, ASXL1 or TET2 mutations <xref rid="pone.0052695-Traina1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052695-Itzykson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In our cohort, the frequency of those class III mutations was too low to draw any conclusions about a possible association with response.</p><p>Regarding toxicity, we observed three early deaths during induction therapy attributable to pneumonia, hepatorenal syndrome and apoplectic stroke, respectively. While the latter two toxicities are uncommon, the death rate of 25% after an intensive, cytarabine- and anthracycline-containing induction therapy in this patient population is in line with published results <xref rid="pone.0052695-Estey1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The majority of severe adverse events and adverse events grade 3 or higher occurred in the 37.5 mg/sqm dose level, suggesting that an increased azacitidine dose does not lead to an increased toxicity in the dose range tested.</p><p>In our pilot trial, both dose levels could be safely administered prior to standard cytotoxic induction and consolidation therapy. Therefore, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) suggested 75 mg/sqm for 5 days as the recommended dose for the randomised controlled phase II part of this trial (AML-AZA, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00915252). Eligible patients in this open-label, controlled part of the trial are randomised 1&#x02236;1 between the experimental or the control arm. Patients in the experimental arm receive azacitidine 5&#x000d7;75 mg/sqm prior to each induction and, if responding, consolidation therapy cycles as described above, and responding patients in the experimental arm additionally receive a maintenance therapy after consolidation with azacitidine 75 mg/sqm over 5 days s.c. q28 days for up to one year after initiation of therapy. Patients in the control arm directly receive induction therapy, consisting of 7+3 induction, and responding patients receive consolidation therapy as described above. No placebo-controlled design was chosen because of ethical considerations (treatment of patients with untreated AML with placebo for 5 days before initiating induction therapy). Sample size of this controlled phase II part was initially planned for 216 subjects (108 each arm), with event-free survival being the primary endpoint. However, recruitment is currently halted due to an increased rate of cardiac toxicity observed in the experimental arm after recruitment of 213 patients. The DMC recently stated that there is no concern regarding a further conduct of the randomised phase II trial, and results of this controlled part will be published separately. Taken together, our results of the pilot trial reported herein demonstrate that it might be feasible to add azacitidine 75 mg/sqm for 5 days to standard induction chemotherapy. This is in line with a recently published phase I trial combining standard induction therapy with the hypomethylating agent decitabine, which also showed feasibility and promising CR rates <xref rid="pone.0052695-Scandura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, six patients treated in each dose level might not be sufficient to fully evaluate the safety profile of this combination, which is obvious considering the observed cardiac toxicity in the controlled part of the trial. The combination of novel treatment strategies with proven chemotherapy regimens warrants further study in older patients with AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0052695.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
