The aim of the current study was therefore to directly compare the effects of two separate inhaled glucocorticoids, mometasone and budesonide, to compare the effects on the early and late asthmatic responses to inhaled allergen in patients with mild allergic asthma, and sputum eosinophils, and to relate the clinical positive effects to any systemic effects observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve patients with documented early and late asthmatic responses (EAR and LAR) to inhaled allergen at a screening visit were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with mometasone (200 &#x003bc;g &#x000d7; 2 or 400 &#x003bc;g &#x000d7; 2), budesonide (400 &#x003bc;g &#x000d7; 2) or placebo in a double-blind crossover fashion for a period of seven days. Challenge with the total allergen dose causing both an EAR and LAR was given on the last day of treatment taken in the morning. Lung function was assessed using FEV1, and systemic glucocorticoid activity was quantified using 24 h urinary cortisol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mometasone and budesonide attenuate both EAR and LAR to allergen to a similar degree. No significant dose-related effects on the lung function parameters were observed. Both treatments reduced the relative amount of sputum eosinophils (%) after allergen. At the dose of 800 &#x003bc;g daily, mometasone reduced 24 h urinary cortisol by approximately 35%. Both drugs were well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Mometasone and budesonide are equieffective in reducing early and late asthmatic responses induced by inhaled allergen challenge.

Allergen exposure can also increase non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to stimuli such as methacholine or histamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The LAR and the bronchial hyperresponsiveness are often associated with increase of eosinophils in the blood, and influx of eosinophils into the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled glucocorticoids in asthma are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], shown by attenuation of the EAR, LAR and allergen-induced sputum eosinophils. Glucocorticoids are also more effective than anti-leukotrienes in attenuating the LARs and improve the bronchial hyperresponsiveness in mild asthmatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mometasone and budesonide are corticosteroids that have been shown having a significant effect on late events induced by allergen, including attenuation of the LAR and reductions in eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to directly compare the effects of inhaled mometasone with inhaled budesonide and placebo on allergen-induced airway responses in mild asthmatic patients. Treatments were given for seven days and the allergen challenge was performed on Day 7 of treatment. Lung function was measured to assess the development of EAR and LAR. Sputum and blood were analysed in order to assess inflammatory processes.

The screening allergen provocation protocol started with the diluents, and the pre titrated allergen dose given was 32 standard quality units (SQU/ml). There was a twofold increase between every dose step. The highest allergen dose was 64 000 SQ-U/ml. FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured 5 and 10 min after each dose (the best of two manoeuvres with 1 min between). When FEV<sub>1 </sub>had fallen at least 20% from the baseline value, the allergen provocation was stopped (EAR). After the last allergen dose FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured at 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min during the first hour, and then every hour up to 10 h. The cumulative allergen dose titrated on the screening day was given as a single dose on day 7 in all four treatment periods. The FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured at the same time-points as above.</p><p>The LAR was defined as a fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>of 15% from baseline value on at least one time point between 3 and 7 h after the allergen dose that caused the EAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methacholine responsiveness</title><p>Methacholine challenge was performed 24 h after the allergen challenge at the screening and on Day 8. At a starting concentration of 0.03 mg/ml, twofold increasing concentrations were administered every fifth minute. FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured at 90 and 180 s after the inhalations. When FEV<sub>1 </sub>had fallen with &#x02265; 20%, the provocation was stopped (Provocative Concentration changing FEV<sub>1 </sub>by 20% = PC20).</p></sec><sec><title>Bronchial challenge</title><p>The dosimeter ME.FAR MB3 (Mefar, Brescia, Italy) was used for all bronchial challenges (allergen and methacholine). The patient inhaled slowly the dose of aerosol by means of an inspiratory capacity breath, followed by 5 s of breath holding. For each dose of allergen or methacholine, five inhalations were given. The nebulization time was set to 1 s. The patients were instructed to use a home spirometer (One Flow soft 1.0 from STI) for the FEV<sub>1 </sub>measurements 1 h to 10 h after allergen exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Sputum induction</title><p>Sputum induction was performed using a modification of the method of Pin et al.

If FEV<sub>1 </sub>had dropped less than 10% from baseline, the next saline concentration (4 and 5%, respectively) was administered. If the fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>was between 10 and 20% from baseline, the same saline concentration was given for the next 7 min. The nebulization was stopped if the fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>was more than 20% from baseline. The sputum was coughed up into a container and further analysed.

Thus, it may be difficult to compare the exact potency of these drugs, as no full dose response could be performed with this complicated provocation protocol. In fact, such a full dose-response evaluation has not been reported with any inhaled glucocorticoid on allergen-induced asthma responses to date.</p><p>The three different active treatments all significantly and strongly reduced the sputum eosinophilia observed 24 h after airway allergen exposure, with no differences observed between them. This argues that both drugs and the doses tested are sufficient to efficiently attenuate the inflammatory response associated with the late asthmatic response, as has been previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The exact mechanism by which inhaled glucocorticoids have such pronounced effect on eosinophilic inflammation are not clear, although inhibitory effects on T-lymphocyte responses may be crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Methacholine responsiveness, measured 24 h after the allergen provocation, was significantly attenuated by both doses of mometasone, as well as the single studied dose of budesonide. Importantly, this attenuation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness has two components to it. Firstly, the inhaled glucocorticoid significantly improves baseline bronchial hyperresponsivness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and secondly, it is also known that inhaled glucocorticoids can attenuate the increase in hyperresponsiveness induced by allergen exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, the attenuation of hyperresponsiveness observed in the current study is a composite effect of the inhaled glucocorticoid therapy on general bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the increased hyperresponsivness induced by the experimental allergen exposure. It is unlikely that the two studied inhaled glucocorticoids have fundamentally and mechanistically different effects on these separate explanations for the methacholine responsivenss value measured 24 h after allergen exposure.</p><p>With both doses of mometasone, and the single dose of budesonide studied, pronounced and highly significant inhibitory effects on allergen-induced sputum eosinophils were observed, and no dose-related effects of mometasone were obvious. This argues that the doses of inhaled glucocorticoids used in the current study was quite high for attenuating sputum eosinophils, and arguing that the anti-inflammatory efficacy of the doses studied were high.</p><p>Quite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids were studied, to add the potential of studying also systemic effects of the two different inhaled glucocorticoids. Furthermore, we decided to study two doses of mometasone, to allow for documentation of some dose-related effects on either anti-asthma effects or systemic effects. Indeed, some differences in both airway and systemic effects were observed, with greater inhibition on the early asthmatic response with the higher dose of mometasone. However, in parallel a slightly increased effect on 24 h urinary cortisol was observed, which thus means that the higher dose of mometasone also expressed some systemic effects. Thus, the additive effect with the higher dose of mometasone was associated with greater systemic effect, arguing against any major difference in therapeutic ratio between the two different inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p>In summary, both mometasone and budesonide at the doses studied (daily doses 400 and 800 &#x003bc;g for mometasone and 800 &#x003bc;g for budesonide) are highly effective in attenuating allergen-induced immediate airway responses, and strongly attenuate eosinophilic inflammation in the airways. Increased efficacy in the airways with the higher dose of mometasone was associated with a slightly higher degree of systemic effects, suggesting that increasing the dose is not necessarily associated with an improved therapeutic ratio. Inhaled glucocorticoids are efficient anti-inflammatory treatments in allergic asthma, and documenting any key differences in therapeutic effects and therapeutic ratio may deem difficult.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EAR: Early asthmatic responses; ECP: Eosinophil Cationic Protein; FEV1: Forced expiratory volume over 1 s; LAR: Late asthmatic responses; PC20: Provocative concentration changing FEV1 by 20%; AUC: Area under the plasma concentration - time curve</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>JL has received honoraria for lectures and consultations from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Novartis, Oriel pharmaceuticals, Schering-Plough and UCB.
