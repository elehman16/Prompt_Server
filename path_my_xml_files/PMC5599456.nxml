Furthermore, healthcare costs, particularly hospitalization costs, increase with COPD severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy document recommends the use of one or more long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) in addition to an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [triple pharmacologic therapy (ICS/LAMA/LABA)] for patients with symptomatic COPD who are at risk of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, while patients with COPD may initially receive ICS/LABA dual therapy, many need to &#x02018;step-up&#x02019; to a triple-therapy regimen to achieve symptom control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that using triple therapy (ICS/LAMA/LABA) can reduce hospitalization rates, compared with dual therapy or monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">FULFIL (Lung FUnction and quality of LiFe assessment in COPD with closed trIpLe therapy) was the first study to compare once-daily single inhaler triple ICS/LAMA/LABA therapy with twice-daily dual ICS/LABA therapy in patients with symptomatic COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previously reported findings from FULFIL demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life and a reduced exacerbation rate with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) compared with budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The incidence of previous exacerbations has been shown to be a predictor of exacerbation risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and this increased risk is also associated with increased disease impact and symptom burden, demonstrated by raised COPD Assessment Test scores and Medical Research Council dyspnea scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of note is the fact that dyspnea is the most frequently reported symptom experienced by patients with COPD, and thus a driving factor in healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As FF/UMEC/VI was previously reported to be associated with reduced symptoms and exacerbation rates compared with BUD/FOR, FF/UMEC/VI may reduce overall healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, initial use of triple therapy in patients with exacerbation history or who are highly symptomatic, rather than dual ICS/LABA, may be more efficient at reducing long-term use of healthcare resources and costs compared with using a &#x02018;step-up&#x02019; approach from ICS/LABA, as the improved symptom control may result in fewer required contacts with healthcare providers. Therefore, as part of the FULFIL study, HCRU and associated cost data were evaluated. In FULFIL, the number of contacts with healthcare providers, drug utilization, and healthcare (non-drug) resource use were collected and summarized for the FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR treatment groups.

Findings from the FULFIL study demonstrate that FF/UMEC/VI for COPD is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life, and reduced exacerbations, compared with BUD/FOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. FULFIL also demonstrated that the incidence of pneumonia was higher in the FF/UMEC/VI group than the BUD/FOR group in the ITT population over 24&#x000a0;weeks (2.2% and 0.8%, respectively), but was similar between the two groups in the EXT population at 52&#x000a0;weeks (1.9% and 1.8%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The HCRU evidence described here suggests that the longer-term use (as shown over 52&#x000a0;weeks) of FF/UMEC/VI reduces the economic and healthcare resource burdens of COPD compared with BUD/FOR, in a clinical trial setting. However, it should also be noted that these findings are based on the smaller EXT patient population, and that the smaller sample size may also have influenced the observed outcomes. The proportion of patients requiring unscheduled healthcare visits and the number of contacts needed for COPD exacerbations were lower with FF/UMEC/VI than BUD/FOR, over 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks in the ITT and EXT populations, respectively. Therefore, improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life, and reduced exacerbation rates observed with FF/UMEC/VI were achieved without an overall cost increase over 52&#x000a0;weeks. These findings from the primary analysis and the reduction from baseline in COPD Assessment Test score observed with FF/UMEC/VI, together with reduced St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire scores, may have contributed to improved patient health status and thus reduced HCRU and costs seen in this analysis.</p><p id="Par20">Population-based studies of COPD treatment patterns demonstrate that open triple therapy (the use of ICS/LAMA/LABA delivered by multiple inhalers) is already widely used in the management of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the US-based COPDGene observational cohort, among patients with COPD who were receiving treatment, 34% of patients were taking an open triple regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Results from a study based on the UK Clinical Practice Research Database revealed that over a 2-year period of time, 35% of patients with COPD who were initially prescribed a LAMA and 39% who were initially prescribed an ICS/LABA stepped up to an open triple therapy regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Triple therapy has previously been shown to be associated with reduced exacerbation rate, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in UK clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As triple therapy is recommended and often used in the management of COPD, the results from FULFIL are likely to be applicable to daily practice, particularly in clinical settings with substantial use of ICS/LABA dual therapy, and these HCRU findings provide support for this approach.</p><p id="Par21">The study design of FULFIL (inclusivity, continuation of patients&#x02019; usual COPD medications throughout the run-in period) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] means the findings are likely to be representative of the overall COPD population in real-world clinical practice.</p><p id="Par22">Although different inhalers were used in each treatment group, the double-blind, double-dummy design ensured that between-group differences were not influenced by patient preference. However, FULFIL only evaluated the effects of FF/UMEC/VI compared with ICS/LABA, not dual bronchodilator therapy; this comparison is currently being evaluated in the InforMing the PAthway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) study, which will provide additional data on the clinical efficacy and safety of FF/UMEC/VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It should be noted that study-based analyses often underestimate HCRU as some unscheduled HCRU may fall within planned study visits. Further studies that provide robust cost effectiveness analyses of FF/UMEC/VI compared with ICS/LABA over longer periods of time than 52&#x000a0;weeks would also be valuable, including those that include a societal perspective as well as a healthcare system perspective.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, over 24&#x000a0;weeks (ITT) in the FULFIL study, treatment with FF/UMEC/VI was associated with a reduction in the total number of contacts with healthcare providers compared with BUD/FOR among patients with COPD, particularly those required due to disease exacerbations. This reduction was also seen in the EXT population over 52&#x000a0;weeks. In both the ITT and EXT populations, non-drug healthcare costs were lower among patients with COPD in the FF/UMEC/VI group compared with the BUD/FOR group. Total costs were higher for FF/UMEC/VI than BUD/FOR over 24&#x000a0;weeks but lower for FF/UMEC/VI than BUD/FOR over 52&#x000a0;weeks, suggesting either an influence of the reduced patient population or a long-term cost advantage of single inhaler triple ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy compared with ICS/LABA combination therapy in a clinical trial setting. Although the cost findings reported here are UK-specific, country-specific unit costs can be applied to the HCRU data in order to make the findings relevant to other countries. Results from the HCRU analysis of FULFIL in combination with the efficacy results suggest that the use of FF/UMEC/VI in patients with COPD who are symptomatic and/or at risk of exacerbations can improve lung function and health-related quality of life, and reduce exacerbations. These benefits are achieved without increasing costs over a 52-week period, which may contribute to reducing economic and healthcare resource burdens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
