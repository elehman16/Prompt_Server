Although these representatives only rarely are qualified in healthcare, they nevertheless play decisive roles in the decision-making processes for people with dementia. Previously, we developed an education program (PRODECIDE) to address this shortcoming and tested it for feasibility. Typical, autonomy-restricting decisions in the care of people with dementia&#x02014;namely, using percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or physical restrains (PR), or the prescription of antipsychotic drugs (AP)&#x02014;were the subject areas trained. The training course aims to enhance the competency of legal representatives in informed decision-making. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy of the PRODECIDE education program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomized controlled trial with a six-month follow-up will be conducted to compare the PRODECIDE education program with standard care, enrolling legal representatives (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;216). The education program lasts 10&#x000a0;h and comprises four modules: A, decision-making processes and methods; and B, C and D, evidence-based knowledge about PEG, PR and AP, respectively.</p><p id="Par3">The primary outcome measure is <italic>knowledge</italic>, which is operationalized as the understanding of decision-making processes in healthcare affairs and in setting realistic expectations about benefits and harms of PEG, PR and AP in people with dementia.

Additionally, to support implementation, a concept for translating the educational contents into e-learning modules will be developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The study results will show whether the efficacy of the education program could justify its implementation into the regular training curricula for legal representatives.

Guardianship systems vary widely worldwide by jurisdiction and implementation. In contrast to systems that deny or restrict the legal capacity of a person, the so-called support system allows the person&#x02019;s legal capacity to remain intact while offering the person support from trusted individuals to make choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The German guardianship system provides a supportive instrument for the legal protection of adults, without incapacitation or restriction of legal capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If an adult is no longer able to handle his or her own affairs due to mental illness or physical and/or mental disability, a legal representative is appointed by court for certain groups of tasks, such as healthcare affairs, that are tailored to the needs of the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 1.3 million people in Germany have been appointed a legal representative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], of whom 60% are volunteers (family members and others) and 40%, professional representatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 65% of the cases, legal representatives are appointed for healthcare affairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with about 20% of professionals due to dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the legal representatives only rarely have a qualification in the field of healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], they are nevertheless required to take a major role in decision-making processes for people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Until now, however, there are no specific authorization criteria and no standardized training courses for legal representatives in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, core competencies to support healthcare decision-making cannot be presupposed.</p><p id="Par18">Behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as agitation, sleep and appetite changes are common in dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and may lead to distress in both patients and carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Interventions such as artificial nutrition via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), the use of physical restraints (PR) and antipsychotic drugs (AP) are frequently applied because of anticipated benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Germany, the estimated prevalence rates for such interventions on nursing home residents remain high: 5% for PEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 12.5% for PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and almost 30% for AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There are strong indicators that these autonomy-restricting interventions are more directed towards facilitating nursing care rather than enhancing the quality of life of people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Evidence for the claimed benefits is weak or controversial, and all interventions have a substantial potential for harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Due to clinical guidelines, interventions are only indicated in exceptional situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that their use is often not being justified.</p><p id="Par19">The decision-making processes in dementia care are complex and involve different parties, such as physicians, nursing staff, relatives and legal representatives. The attitudes and beliefs of these parties are important factors in explaining these high intervention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In order to reduce autonomy-restricting interventions, all parties involved in the decision-making processes should thus be addressed by educational approaches. Several evaluation and implementation studies of educational approaches to reduce PR and AP have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, legal representatives have not yet been addressed at all.</p><p id="Par20">We developed an education program for legal representatives and tested its feasibility in a pilot study at the University Hamburg, which ran from April 2013 until September 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The aim of the program was to enhance competencies in informed decision processes, as exemplified by the three decisions in the care of people with dementia (PEG, PR and AP). The program was based on the theory of planned behavior and was developed according to the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) evaluation framework as well as methods of evidence-based medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]<italic>.</italic> We generated a curriculum based on systematic literature searches and on interviews with voluntary and professional legal representatives and with senior citizens.</p><p id="Par21">In a previous pilot study, we tested the education program for comprehensibility, feasibility, usability and acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We initially conducted eight trainings with 47 legal guardians. The education program was well accepted, and the comprehensibility of contents and materials was rated as high. Participants stated that they developed essential competencies needed to discuss the necessity of PEG, PR and AP in people with dementia, and to aim for alternative interventions. The program appears ready for implementation, but in line with the UK MRC evaluation framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], efficacy has to be proven first. To prepare for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we next defined relevant outcome measures and developed appropriate assessment tools. Finally, to pretest the assessment instruments, we carried out the education program five times for a total of 34 legal representatives. Whenever necessary, questionnaires were revised and assessment strategies were optimized.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par22">The main objective of the planned randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the PRODECIDE education program for legal representatives. The key hypothesis is that legal representatives allocated to the education group would achieve a better understanding of decision-making processes and higher levels of realistic expectations regarding probabilities of benefits and harms of PEG, PR and AP to people with dementia compared to the control group.</p><p id="Par23">Understanding the decision-making processes and setting realistic expectations are prerequisites for informed decision-making. Informed and evidence-based decisions may enhance the quality of care of people with dementia and reduce both the overuse and the misuse of autonomy-restricting interventions. Therefore, a further objective is to determine whether the education of legal representatives can result in a clinically relevant reduction of PEG, PR, and AP in persons with dementia.</p><p id="Par24">We expect that implementing the PRODECIDE education program into the regular training offers for legal representatives will be perceived as feasible. To understand barriers and facilitators, a qualitative process evaluation will be performed.</p><p id="Par25">The reporting of this study follows current statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In parallel to this trial, we will develop a concept for translating the educational contents into e-learning modules, to further support implementation. Web-based learning creates an additional offer that has neither time nor location restrictions. We expect that this alternative could reach people who do not take part in the face-to-face courses. The e-learning modules will be tested for usability. We assume transferability of acceptance and comprehensibility of educational contents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par27">The PRODECIDE-RCT is a randomized controlled superiority trial with two parallel groups, a 1:1 randomization and a six-month follow-up.

Institution cooperation includes recruitment and conducting the education program. Appointments for the education program will be made, and invitations will be published, using the e-mail lists, websites, calendar of events, flyers, etc., of the cooperating institutions. The invitation covers information about both the education program (e.g., target group, content, place and time) and the study (e.g., randomized allocation, offers for the control group).</p><p id="Par34">Potential participants will register at the study center (by phone, e-mail or fax).

To ensure a close balance of entities in each group, randomization will be performed by randomly selected block sizes of four and six. The randomization list will be computer generated by a scientist who is not involved in either the intervention or data collection. An independent person will also perform the allocation.

Module A addresses the decision-making process and introduces the assessment of harms and benefits. The aim is to enhance critical analysis of medical interventions and competencies in informed decision making. The modules B, C and D transmit evidence-based knowledge to the example decisions. Case studies are used to demonstrate practical relevance and to enable participants to take a stand in discussions. The participants receive written education material and evidence-based information leaflets. Two persons (TR, JL) will conduct each training session. Courses will be offered free of charge for the equipment and staff. Participants will have to pay a reduced fee for room rental and catering if necessary. Indeed, charging a low fee might be more effective at increasing the willingness to participate after registration than offering a free-of-charge course.</p><p id="Par38">Both the curriculum and the education material have already been tested for feasibility in the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group (CG)</title><p id="Par39">As no equivalent intervention is available, the control group (CG) will receive standard care.

Additionally, baseline data and baseline outcome measurements of persons concerned will be assessed. For this, legal representatives will receive a pseudonymization list, documentation sheets and a standardized written introduction. A pseudonymization number will be assigned to each person concerned with dementia. All data will be given to the study site under this pseudonym. The legal representative, using data extracted from routine documentation, will fill in the documentation sheets. The age range, gender, diagnosis additional to dementia, presence of PEG, number and types of PR, name and dosage of antipsychotics will be assessed by multiple choice and free-response questions. Copies of the routine documentation (e.g., a list of drug prescriptions) will be passed on only if pseudonymization is safeguarded.</p><p id="Par43">At T1, the primary outcome <italic>knowledge</italic> will be assessed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The questionnaire comprises 13 items: two items on the understanding of decision-making processes in healthcare affairs; two items on quality and validity of study results; and nine items on realistic expectations regarding probabilities of benefits and harms of PEG, PR and AP to people with dementia (with three items per intervention). All items are multiple choice questions with four choices, with only one correct answer. Questions with more than one answer and unanswered questions will count as a wrong answer.

Baseline parameters are described by frequency tables, means, standard deviations or quartiles.</p><p id="Par61">The primary outcome is the percentage of correct answers for the knowledge test at T1. Assuming approximate normal distribution, the expected values from the IG and CG will be compared with adjustment for stratified randomization by professionals and volunteers using bifactorial analysis of variance (linear model). Distribution assumptions will be investigated by graphical methods. Furthermore, interactions between intervention and professional status will be included in a secondary model. Different effects depending on the professional status will be discussed.</p><p id="Par62">The secondary outcome of sufficient knowledge (binary) at T1 will be compared between IG and CG using bivariate logistic regression, including IG/CG and professional status as independent variables. Additionally interactions between intervention and professional status will be investigated in a second model.</p><p id="Par63">The sustainability of knowledge will be investigated at T3. The time course of the knowledge between T1 and T3 will be analyzed by fitting a linear mixed model: the dependent variable is knowledge (% of correct answers), and the independent variables are IG/CG, time (T1, T3), interaction between intervention and time, professional status and interaction between intervention and professional status. To adjust for repeated measurements of the legal representatives, random effects are included (covariance pattern model with covariance structure compound symmetry).</p><p id="Par64">Further secondary outcomes are the numbers of persons concerned and the percentage of these persons affected by PEG, FEM or AP (separately) per legal representative at T3. Mean values &#x000b1; standard deviations will be described for IG and CG at T3 as well as at T0. Linear models will be fitted including IG/CG and initial values at T0 as independent variables.</p><p id="Par65">Finally, the results of the first decision about PEG, FEM or AP by the legal representative after T0 (e.g., after training for IG, or after randomization for CG) will be assessed. Initially, the duration from T0 to the first decision will be described for IG and CG by Kaplan-Meier curves. In case of no decision, durations are censored at the end of observation after 6&#x000a0;months or at dropout. Kaplan-Meier curves between both groups will be compared by the log rank test, as long as there are no clear deviations from the proportional hazard assumption in the graphics. Four categories of decisions will be described by frequency tables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par66">No information was available for the primary outcome from previous studies. The assessment instrument was pretested with a before-after design to roughly estimate the expected intervention effect in the primary outcome of knowledge (given as a percentage of correct answers). The knowledge test was revised after three courses with a total of 18 legal representatives. Afterwards, two pilot courses with 16 participants were used to estimate the effect size of the intervention. Fifteen datasets before intervention, and 12 after intervention, were included in the analysis.</p><p id="Par67">A common standard deviation of &#x003c3;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.17 can be assumed in IG and CG. A mean difference of 0.085 between IG and CG can be detected by a power of 90% by the two-sided t-test, using a significance level of 5% based on a sample size of 86 per group (172 overall). Including a maximum dropout rate of 20%, an overall sample size of 216 is planned. The pilot study estimated a larger effect (0.38). Because of the low sample size, and considering a possible bias in the pilot study, the planned sample size is higher than theoretically necessary. It corresponds to a medium effect of 0.5*&#x003c3;, as suggested by Cohen.</p><p id="Par68">With six to ten participants per training session, the education program will be offered approximately 24 times (12 times per group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Monitoring</title><p id="Par69">A data monitoring committee will not be necessary, as the clinical trial does not involve a high-risk intervention and participants do not belong to a vulnerable population.

Module A constitutes a comprehensive approach and a methodological basis that can be used for healthcare-related decisions in other somatic and psychiatric diseases.</p><p id="Par93">Conditions for a sustainable implementation of the proposed program have been met. The ipb, which is part of the BdB (a professional association for legal representatives in Germany with more than 6500 members) and which offers training throughout Germany, has expressed interest in making the PRODECIDE program a standard offer in its training.

Legal representatives will be allocated to the intervention or to the control group using a computer-generated randomization scheme. An independent person not involved in either the study or data collection will perform the allocation. Data entry will be performed blinded. Various approaches will be taken to reduce missing data and dropouts. These strategies were adapted from previous RCTs with very low attrition rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. For analysis, the intention to treat principle will be used.</p><p id="Par96">The study limitations include the fact that, due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor researchers conducting the education program and data collection will be blinded. Likewise, it is not possible to safeguard either the inclusion of all eligible persons with dementia or the correct documentation of PEG, PR and AP for all persons concerned. Only the legal representatives will perform the assessment for eligibility, and they will give the data of the persons concerned to the study center under a pseudonym. We assume that the error ratio will be comparable in IG and CG. Nevertheless, it is possible that enhanced knowledge in the IG leads to a more correct documentation and to a bias of results. Data collection will be verified by using medical and nursing records if possible. Finally, legal representatives are well connected, for instance through office partnerships or supervision sessions, such that &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; from the intervention to the control group by sharing educational materials is possible. However, as the training is both hands-on and in-depth, we do not expect that the CG has an improved knowledge solely on the basis of written educational materials.</p><p id="Par97">At the end of this study, information about the efficacy of the PRODECIDE education program, the usability of e-learning modules and processes that interfere with or promote a successful implementation into the regular training curricula for legal representatives will be available.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AP</term><def><p id="Par6">antipsychotic drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BdB</term><def><p id="Par7">Bundesverband der Berufsbetreuer/innen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p id="Par8">control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFG</term><def><p id="Par9">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IG</term><def><p id="Par10">Intervention group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ipb</term><def><p id="Par11">Institut f&#x000fc;r Innovation und Praxistransfer in der Betreuung</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OLAT</term><def><p id="Par12">Online Learning And Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEG</term><def><p id="Par13">percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p id="Par14">physical restraints</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par15">randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Veronica Raker for her valuable support regarding editing the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par98">The study is funded by the <italic>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</italic> (DFG) awarded to Dr. Tanja Richter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/318728034">http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/318728034</ext-link>).
