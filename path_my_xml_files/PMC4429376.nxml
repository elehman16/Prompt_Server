Low ceruloplasmin (CP)-ferroxidase activity has been identified in the SN and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with PD. The iron chelator, deferiprone, reduces the abnormally high levels of iron in the SN. In order to determine CP&#x02019;s involvement in iron accumulation in SN and PD progression, we aim to compare the ability of iron chelation treatment to reducing both SN iron levels and motor handicap in PD patients according to the level of ceruloplasmin activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used a moderate chelation protocol with deferiprone (DFP) based on a, 6-month delayed-start paradigm, randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in 40 PD patients. CP-ferroxidase activity was determined in blood and CSF together with the D544E gene polymorphism (rs701753). Iron levels were determined by R2* MRI sequence and the motor handicap by the UPDRS motor score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 6 to 12&#x000a0;months of DFP treatment, greater reductions in SN iron levels and UPDRS motor scores were obtained in patients with higher serum and CSF levels of CP-ferroxidase activity. After 6&#x000a0;months of DFP treatment, the AT genotype group displayed greater reduction of iron level in the SN with greater CSF and serum levels of CP activity than the AA genotype group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although most of the DFP-treated patients displayed clinical and radiological improvements, those with the lower CP activity appeared to respond better to iron chelation. Larger RCTs are now needed to establish whether pharmacological modulation of CP activity could be an innovative neuroprotective strategy in PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>FAIR-PARK study (ClinicalTrials.gov reference: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00943748?term=FAIR+PARK&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00943748</ext-link>; French national reference number: 2008&#x02212;006842&#x02212;25).

The latter generally attains toxic levels as a result of imbalances between iron ingress, use, storage and egress. Cell iron egress and thereby cell iron accumulation appear to be modulated by ceruloplasmin (CP), a copper ferroxidase that facilitates the incorporation of plasma iron (II) into circulating apotransferrin. Ceruloplasmin&#x02019;s key role is illustrated by an extreme example: that of aceruloplasminemia, which affects both systemic and brain iron metabolism. Low CP-ferroxidase activity has also been identified in the substantia nigra (SN) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and particularly in individuals bearing the AT genotype of the rs707753 CP gene variant (corresponding to a D544E protein change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A screening of ceruloplasmin gene sequences variations allowed to identify five new missense variations and an already known variation (rs707753), which was not previously identified in PD. Of these six missenses variations, D544E polymorphism was the most frequent and the only one to be significantly associated with PD and iron overload measured in SN by transcranial ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that PD is associated with oxidative damage via iron accumulation in the SN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], CP&#x02019;s putative involvement in iron accumulation and disease progression remains subject to debate. One way of addressing this issue involves comparing the ability of moderate iron chelation treatment to reducing both SN iron levels and United Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores in PD patients according to the level of ceruloplasmin activity. The underlying rationale is that PD patients with lower CP activity might retain more cell iron and thus respond more favorably to iron chelation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To test this hypothesis, we used a moderate chelation protocol with deferiprone (DFP, administered at 30&#x000a0;mg/kg/day in two daily doses) that had previously served as the basis for a translational study (i.e. including a preclinical study with cells and mice models and the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of an iron chelator in PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The FAIR-PARK study</title><p>(ClinicalTrials.gov reference: NCT00943748; French national reference number: 2008&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;006842&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;25) was based on a 6-month delayed-start paradigm in 40 PD patients on stable dopamine regimens. Treatment with DFP was initiated at 0 or 6&#x000a0;months and stopped at 18&#x000a0;months.

Levels of CP-ferroxidase activity in CSF and sera were determined according to the method published by Schosinsky et al.

(2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Briefly, the procedure is based on the CP-mediated oxidation of o-dianisidine, a chromogenic substrate forming a yellow-brown reaction product that absorbs at 500&#x000a0;nm. The CP activity is proportional to the rate of formation of reaction product. The working reagent solution was prepared immediately before use by mixing 1 volume of substrate solution (o-dianisidine dihydrochloride: 7.8&#x000a0;mM, Triton X-100: 1% v/v) with 4 volumes of sodium acetate buffer solution (100&#x000a0;mM, pH adjusted to 4.6). All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Samples of CSF or serum (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) were added to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of working reagent solution and the increase in absorbance at 500&#x000a0;nm over 100&#x000a0;s (first reading point: 200&#x000a0;s; second reading point: 300&#x000a0;s) at 37&#x000b0;C was read [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Grey circles represent the DFP-treated patients with an AA genotype with an AT genotype; the latter displayed higher levels of CP activity and a greater reduction in R2* in the SN.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12883_2015_331_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>We screened for the D544E gene polymorphism (rs701753: AT and AA genotypes) in the ES group; after 6&#x000a0;months DFP treatment, the AT group displayed greater CSF and serum levels of CP activity than the AA group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> C &#x00026; D). On the basis of median [interquartile range] R2* values in MRI (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> E), iron levels in the SN fell greater in the AT group (from 4.5 [4.2-4.9] at baseline to 3.9 [3.8-4.1] after 6&#x000a0;months (F<sub>(1,17)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.9; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) and 3.8 [3.6-4] after 12&#x000a0;months (F<sub>(1,16)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.1; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06)) than in the AA group (from 4.6 [4.4-4.8] at baseline to 4.4 [4.2-4.4] after 6&#x000a0;months and 4.0 [3.8-4.3] after 12&#x000a0;months).</p><p>Although the AT group displayed a greater mean reduction in the motor UPDRS score than the AA group (decreases of 4 and 3 points, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that iron chelation efficacy appeared to be related with the level of CP activity. PD patients with lower CP activity might retain more cell iron and thus respond more favorably to iron chelation therapy. Thus, CP may have a pivotal role in iron accumulation, which exacerbates the PD progression. Although most of the DFP-treated patients with PD displayed clinical and radiological improvements, those with the D544E CP polymorphism appeared to respond better to iron chelation. The greater mean reduction in the motor UPDRS score in the AT group as compared with the AA group did not reach the significant level. This might have been related to the small sample size and the many factors affecting the clinical response (notably DFP&#x02019;s symptomatic effect through inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Larger RCTs are now needed to establish whether (i) the D544E CP polymorphism is a bona fide biomarker for responsiveness to iron chelation therapy in selected PD patients and (ii) pharmacological modulation of CP activity, by itself, could be an innovative neuroprotective strategy in PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lower ceruloplasmin activity in PD may be associated with iron overload in SN. Ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity deficiency in PD could be partly improved by iron chelation by deferiprone in both groups (AA and AT) but mostly in the AT group, in which D544E polymorphism induced a lower ferroxidase activity. The measure of the R2* MRI sequence in SN was improved in both groups but the reduction was higher in the D544E (AT).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no financial or non-financial disclosures to make or potential conflicts of interest to report in relation to this investigator-led study.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>1) The research project: A: conception; B: organization; C: execution 2) The manuscript: A: the first draft, B. review and critical comment G.
