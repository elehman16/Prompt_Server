COCs with a shortened HFI (eg, from 7 days to 5 days, 4 days, or even 2 days) provide markedly greater suppression of ovarian activity and limit the extent of exogenous hormonal fluctuations throughout the cycle, and have been shown to reduce or eliminate these symptoms.<xref rid="b3-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Consequently, shortening or eliminating the HFI is now recognized as a well-tolerated and effective method of reducing the frequency or severity of HWAS.<xref rid="b8-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to assess whether the ethinylestradiol (EE) 20 &#x003bc;g/drospirenone 3 mg COC taken in a 24/4-day regimen (ie, 4-day HFI) is more effective than an EE 20 &#x003bc;g/desogestrel (DSG) 150 &#x003bc;g COC taken in a 21/7-day regimen (ie, 7-day HFI) in reducing the frequency and severity of HWAS in otherwise healthy women prone to these symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study (NLM identifier: NCT01076582) was conducted at 34 centers in 12 countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Korea, Philippines, Portugal, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom).

The women were asked to rate three symptoms (headache, pelvic pain, or bloating) in their diaries daily, indicating the worst pain level on that day. In order to be eligible for randomization, the 7-day composite score of HWAS (sum of headache + pelvic pain + bloating) during cycle days 22&#x02013;28 had to be at least 50% higher than the composite score during cycle days 1&#x02013;21 (ie, the 21-day score divided by 3 [for normalization]).

Subjects recorded the severity of their HWAS daily in diary cards using a seven-point Likert scale, as described for the baseline cycle.</p><p>Secondary efficacy variables assessed during cycle days 22&#x02013;28 were as follows: mean change from baseline to cycle 2 in the composite HWAS score, as described for the primary variable; mean change from baseline to cycles 2 and 4 in individual HWAS (headache, bloating, pelvic pain, and the composite score for bloating plus pelvic pain); proportion of subjects experiencing individual HWAS (score of &#x02265;1); and mean change from baseline to cycles 2 and 4 in the maximum intensity of individual HWAS.</p><p>Regional analyses for Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America were performed for the primary variables, as well as for the baseline characteristics and demography post hoc.</p><p>Quality of life was assessed using a short version of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)<xref rid="b10-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale.<xref rid="b11-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The short Q-LES-Q is a 15-item questionnaire in which the subject rates their satisfaction during the last week. Scores were rated on a 5-point scale, where 1= very poor and 5= very good. Women completed the Q-LES-Q on day 1 after the baseline cycle and day 1 after cycle 4. The CGI was completed by both women and the investigators at the end of the study. The subject&#x02019;s overall clinical experience was rated on an eight-point scale, where 0= not assessed, 1= very much improved, and 7= very much worse.</p><p>The following variables were also assessed: bleeding/spotting days and episodes; cycle control indices; treatment response; rescue medication use; and compliance. Subjects assessed and recorded their bleeding daily in the same diary cards used to document HWAS severity. Any bleeding that occurred on a given day was rated by the subjects as: none; spotting; light; normal; or heavy, as previously described.<xref rid="b12-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Bleeding/spotting episodes were described using the 90-day reference period as recommended by World Health Organization.<xref rid="b13-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Withdrawal bleeding and intracyclic bleeding were assessed as cycle control indices. Withdrawal bleeding was defined as the first bleeding episode that starts on days 1 to 7 after progestogen withdrawal, provided that the progestogen-free interval lasts at least 3 days. All other bleeding episodes were considered intracyclic. Treatment response was defined as an improvement from baseline to cycle 4 in the most severe symptom during cycle days 22&#x02013;28 of at least half the standard deviation (SD) with no increase in rescue medication use. In terms of rescue medication, subjects were permitted to take medication to relieve, but not prevent, HWAS. Rescue medication use was recorded by the subject in the daily diary card. Subjects were asked not to change their rescue medication during the study. To assess compliance to the study drug&#x02019;s use, all subjects recorded their study drug intake on a daily basis in diary cards along with the return of all used, partially used, or unused pouches/blister cards for drug reconciliation at the final visit. Compliance to study treatment was assessed by the extent of exposure (absolute and relative to planned exposure) and cycle length. Safety variables included adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical and gynecological examinations, and monitoring of vital signs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For simplicity, we reasonably assumed that the sum of the composite scores during cycle days 22&#x02013;28 was normally distributed.

The treatment difference was estimated on the basis that the reduction in HWAS was 42% greater with a continuous COC than with a 21/7 COC.<xref rid="b14-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Taking into account differences in the Likert scale used in the Sulak et al<xref rid="b14-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> publication (0&#x02013;10 versus 0&#x02013;6 in our study), the sum of scores was estimated to be approximately 5 for each symptom, yielding a score of 15 for three symptoms. It was assumed that the 24/4 COC would reduce the sum of scores by 3/7 compared with the 21/7 COC; therefore, the anticipated reduction was 15&#x000d7;3/7&#x02248;6.5.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Overall, 714 women were screened and 594 were randomized into the EE/drospirenone group 24/4 (number [n]=290) and the EE/DSG 21/7 group (n=304) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijwh-7-501">Figure 1</xref>).

Bleeding data for cycle 4 were incomplete for many women, as the study ended during their final bleeding episode. For this reason, withdrawal and intracyclic bleeding data were assessed for cycles 1&#x02013;3 only.

An overview of AEs and TEAEs is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ijwh-7-501">Table 3</xref>. Three serious AEs were reported, two of which occurred in the EE/DSG 21/7 treatment group but were considered unrelated to the study drug (pyelonephritis, leading to discontinuation, and tonsillitis). The third serious AE was a spontaneous abortion occurring in one subject receiving EE/drospirenone 24/4, which was considered to be related to the study drug.

The reductions seen with both treatments were deemed to be clinically relevant; in other (chronic) pain indications, a change of approximately one point on the Likert scale translates into a clinically relevant difference in the subject&#x02019;s pain perception (which is typically about half a SD).<xref rid="b15-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This corresponds to a treatment difference of 14 for two symptoms, although it should be noted that the threshold may be smaller in cyclic HWAS.<xref rid="b15-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In contrast to what we expected, the difference in the composite HWAS score change from baseline to cycle 4 was smaller and hence not statistically significant between the EE/drospirenone 24/4 and EE/DSG 21/7 groups. Previous studies have shown that shortening the HFI reduces HWAS; in a study by Klipping et al<xref rid="b5-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> of women receiving EE 20 &#x003bc;g/drospirenone 3 mg, shortening the HFI from 7 days to 4 days was associated with greater ovarian suppression and a trend toward a reduction in headache and breast tenderness, which were reported as AEs. Furthermore, in two studies of similar design, estradiol valerate/dienogest in a 26/2 regimen was shown to reduce the frequency and intensity of headache and pelvic pain to a significantly greater extent than the comparator 21/7-day COCs (EE/levonorgestrel<xref rid="b6-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and EE/norgestimate<xref rid="b4-ijwh-7-501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The reason for the absence of a statistical difference between the EE/drospirenone 24/4 and EE/DSG 21/7 groups in our study is partly unclear. One possibility is that the seven-point Likert scale used in our study was not sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in the reduction of HWAS severity between the treatment groups. Our study included a diverse population of women across three continents, and it is likely that the prevailing symptom profile may differ between regions as to the most troublesome HWAS. For the post hoc analysis of the primary endpoint, the results favored EE/drospirenone 24/4 in both Europe and Latin America. In the Asia/Pacific region, however, the opposite effect was seen.</p><p>One of the limitations of our analysis was an issue with data collection procedures at one study site in the Asia/Pacific region. During the analysis of the study data, potential inconsistencies were identified, leading to an audit inspection and site visit by the study sponsor. This audit showed an implausible bleeding pattern that was not in line with other sites and regions in the study. This site recruited the most women (&#x0003e;10% of the overall study population) and, therefore, these discrepancies could have had a major impact on the study results. However, the exclusion of data from the problematic site from the Asia/Pacific region data did not alter the statistical conclusion (data not shown). It is possible that European/Latin American women may differ from those in Asia in terms of the types of HWAS experienced and/or the perception of severity. From this experience, the conclusion can be drawn that differences in patient reported outcomes including pain perception, general well-being, etc, are conditioned by a large variety of individual factors that are difficult to control for. Future research should therefore be focusing on a homogeneous sample of women observed by closely collaborating investigators or by a single center.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both EE/drospirenone in a 24/4-day regimen and EE/DSG in a 21/7-day regimen reduced composite HWAS scores (headache, bloating, and pelvic pain) from baseline to cycle 4 in otherwise healthy women. Contrary to expectations, statistically significant differences between treatments were not observed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Bayer HealthCare AG.
