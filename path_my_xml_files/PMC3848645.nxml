Additionally, recent studies have shown beneficial effects of weight loss through diet and exercise in ghrelin concentrations in obese subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 5% weight loss on lipid profile, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and acylated ghrelin (AG) using two different methods of intervention (diet or diet plus exercise).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Eighteen subjects (twelve women and six men) aged 20&#x02013;40 years with a body mass index of 30&#x02013;34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (grade 1 obesity) were randomized into two intervention groups: diet (n=9) or diet plus exercise (n=9). Both groups underwent treatment until 5% of the initial body weight was lost. At baseline and upon completion, RMR and AG were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both groups showed a significant decrease in body fat percentage and fat mass.

However, at the end of the program, nine subjects from each group were analyzed for reasons that are explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dmso-6-469">Figure 1</xref>. All participants had a sedentary lifestyle, were nonsmokers, aged 20&#x02013;40 years, and classified as grade 1 obese (body mass index [BMI] 30&#x02013;34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), nondiabetic, and without any major comorbidities. Treatment duration was recorded individually as the time between the initiation of treatment and achievement of a 5% body mass reduction. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (institutional review board equivalent), and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec><title>Diet</title><p>A balanced diet (60% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 25% fat of the total energy value) was prescribed to all participants.

All tests were performed between 7:30 and 9:30 am in a quiet, temperature-controlled room (20&#x000b0;C&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) under artificial illumination. The protocol consisted of 10 minutes&#x02019; bed rest in the supine position followed by assessment of expired gas samples for 30 minutes. A computerized gas analyzer (CPX/D; MGC Diagnostics, Saint Paul, MN, USA) was used to determine oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide output (VCO<sub>2</sub>). To calculate RMR, the first 10 minutes of gas uptake were discarded and data from the final 20 minutes of collection were used to calculate mean values over the test period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dmso-6-469">17</xref> The following formula was used to obtain the values of kcal/day: ([3.9 &#x000d7; VO<sub>2</sub>]+[1.1 &#x000d7; VCO<sub>2</sub>]) &#x000d7; 1,440.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dmso-6-469">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Maximal oxygen consumption</title><p>The maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) protocol consisted of incremental exercise on a stationary bicycle.

Both groups were considered homogeneous at baseline. However, for data analysis, 18 individuals were considered, nine in each group, as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dmso-6-469">Figure 1</xref>. The pre- and postintervention anthropometric and metabolic data of all participants are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dmso-6-469">Table 1</xref>. Both groups achieved the targeted 5% body mass reduction, but treatment duration was longer in the DG (85.1&#x000b1;26.5 days vs 74.1&#x000b1;26.0 days in the D+EG). There were significant differences in pre- and postintervention body mass (kg) between groups. The reduction in total body mass induced a significant decrease in body fat percentage (38.9%&#x000b1;5.26% vs 36.9%&#x000b1;5.21%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.001; and 37.6%&#x000b1;5.1% vs 35.0%&#x000b1;5.5%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.01) and fat mass (38.1&#x000b1;4.1 vs 33.9&#x000b1;3.4 kg, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.001; and 34.4&#x000b1;3.54 vs 30.4&#x000b1;3.33 kg, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.01) in the DG and D+EG, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dmso-6-469">Table 1</xref>). RMR (kcal/day) did not increase after treatment in the DG; however, RMR increased after treatment in the D+EG (1,363.6&#x000b1;379.9 vs 1,585.3&#x000b1;171.4 kcal/day, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dmso-6-469">Figure 2</xref>). There were a positive correlation between RMR and AG for DG pretreatment (0.82, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.04).

In the present study, diet- and diet plus exercise-induced weight loss had no significant effects on glucose or insulin levels after treatment. Although these results were not statistically significant, reductions in glucose and insulin levels may be clinically relevant in the management of insulin resistance. A possible explanation lies in the duration of treatment to achieve the targeted 5% body mass reduction, which was different between groups (DG 85 days vs D+EG 74 days).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-dmso-6-469">21</xref></p><p>In the present study, diet- and diet plus exercise-induced weight loss had no significant effects on glucose or insulin levels after treatment. A possible explanation lies in the duration of treatment to achieve the targeted 5% body mass reduction, which was different between groups (DG 85 days vs D+EG 74 days).</p><p>Fat mass decreased significantly in both groups after treatment. In addition, diet-induced weight loss produced a significant reduction in fat-free mass. These results suggest that exercise may help maintain muscle mass by inducing physiological changes that increase muscle mass or decrease the potential of diet to have an influence on muscle tissue. Diet plus exercise-induced weight loss also significantly increased RMR, which may be related to the maintenance of muscle mass observed in this group. Because fat-free mass did not decrease significantly in this group, these results may indicate that physical exercise has an effect on RMR values in obese subjects when in combination with a weight-reduction diet. In turn, participants assigned to diet alone showed no differences in RMR after treatment, although previous studies have suggested that a reduced-calorie diet may lead to a decrease in muscle mass, promoting RMR reduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dmso-6-469">22</xref> Nevertheless, RMR does not only depend on muscle mass and may be influenced by several factors, including fat-free mass, body surface area, fat mass, age, and sex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dmso-6-469">23</xref> We found a positive correlation between RMR and AG for DG pretreatment (0.82). After treatment, we found an increased ghrelin concentration, and this correlation was lower (0.67). This positive relationship of AG and basal metabolic rate is supported by Marzullo et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dmso-6-469">6</xref> who found a positive relationship between AG and resting energy expenditure in obese subjects, suggesting that ghrelin secretion is only decreased with the impairment of energy expenditure. Since RMR was not statistically different for the DG after treatment, we could speculate that increased ghrelin could be related to a lower RMR when comparing this result with the D+EG, where this correlation was not found, which could be justified for other metabolic or body-composition changes that influenced the increase in RMR regardless of ghrelin concentrations, such as fat-free mass or total surface area.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that increased AG concentrations observed in obese subjects after diet-induced weight reduction are related to lower energy reserves, mainly adipose tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dmso-6-469">11</xref> Increased AG concentrations may also be associated with reports of increased hunger during treatment and difficulty in reducing food intake and losing weight. In a recent study by our group, a single session of aerobic exercise was able to reduce acutely AG concentrations and hunger in eutrophic subjects compared to resting controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dmso-6-469">10</xref> Similarly, Broom et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dmso-6-469">24</xref> found reduced AG concentrations in normal-weight individuals undergoing an acute session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (60% VO<sub>2max</sub>) compared with resting controls. A few studies have evaluated the effects of chronic exercise on obese subjects. King et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dmso-6-469">25</xref> showed that caloric restriction induced a significant increase in AG concentrations compared with baseline values, whereas exercise promoted opposite effects. Our results demonstrated that a 5% diet plus exercise-induced weight loss was able to significantly reduce AG concentrations in obese individuals. Our analysis of delta values revealed a 15.4% increase in AG concentrations in subjects assigned to diet alone and a 39% decrease in AG concentrations in those assigned to the D+EG. Likewise, Scheid et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dmso-6-469">26</xref> found similar results after a 3-month aerobic training in eutrophic subjects who lost weight. Ravussin et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dmso-6-469">27</xref> however, found no significant differences in plasma ghrelin concentration in monozygotic twins under different diet and physical exercise treatments. Similar to our results, Hansen et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dmso-6-469">11</xref> found increased total ghrelin concentrations following weight reduction in obese women attending a diet-induced weight-loss program. However, our findings contrast with those reported by Foster-Schubert et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dmso-6-469">12</xref> who found increased total ghrelin concentrations after an exercise program. We can speculate that exercise training combined with dietary intervention, rather than diet therapy alone, promotes different effects on AG concentrations when associated with weight loss, reducing AG concentrations. Also, AG concentrations may respond differently than total ghrelin, thus affecting the AG and desacylated ghrelin ratio. The reduction in AG observed in our group attending the diet-plus-exercise intervention may be related to the effects of aerobic exercise promoted by muscle response, ie, growth-hormone release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dmso-6-469">28</xref> According to St-Pierre et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dmso-6-469">29</xref> obese individuals with some degree of insulin resistance have lower AG values when compared with normal-weight subjects. Krekoukia et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dmso-6-469">30</xref> showed that aerobic exercise was able to reduce insulin resistance and reduce or even prevent the deleterious effects of diabetes mellitus. Insulin and acylated ghrelin showed a positive correlation only after treatment for D+EG (<italic>r</italic>=0.80). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a positive correlation was found after a diet-with-exercise intervention. We could only speculate that the change in BMI after the intervention affected the modulation on insulin and ghrelin in obese subjects, and future studies should investigate this relationship further. The effect of AG on food intake suggests a potential role of AG in the body&#x02019;s return to homeostasis following a reduction in body mass. Thus, the combination of dietary treatment and exercise training may promote homeostasis and restore AG values to normal physiological levels. Therefore, it could maintain RMR in healthier levels.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. Although our sample size matches the statistical power for our main variable (AG) we could argue that it was small to present intergroup differences for such variables as insulin and glucose. Regarding our anthropometric data, we used a two-component measurement protocol, which is better suited for diagnosis but it is not the ideal for clinical approaches, since the changes in some tissues cannot be measured by this method, mainly differences in body water. Also, we could not measure hormones such as adiponectin, leptin, or growth hormone, which might be able to provide a better understanding of the ghrelin metabolism and mechanisms related to physical training and RMR regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings showed that a dietary intervention associated with exercise training was able to reduce AG concentrations and increase RMR in grade 1 obese subjects, factors considered essential to ensure the benefits of a weight-loss program. Therefore, we believe that successful treatment of obesity should consist of a comprehensive approach involving diet and exercise intervention. In addition, future research is encouraged to further investigate treatment options that can effectively combat obesity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>Andr&#x000e9; L Lopes worked on experimental design, patient selection, assessment and prescription of exercise, data analysis, and writing.
