Various criteria have been used to formally define remission in clinical trials, of which the Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (score of &#x0003c;2.6) has traditionally been used most frequently. However, patients in DAS28 remission may experience residual disease activity, as evidenced by swollen joint count (SJC) in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which can lead to irreversible structural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] advocate using more stringent remission criteria, namely the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and a Boolean definition. Alternative definitions proposed for use in clinical practice, where measurement of acute-phase reactants is often unavailable, are the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and a corresponding Boolean definition.</p><p>Abatacept is a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that selectively modulates T cell co-stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and has shown efficacy in several clinical trials, including the Abatacept study to Gauge Remission and joint damage progression in methotrexate (MTX)-naive patients with Early Erosive rheumatoid arthritis (AGREE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The main objective of the present analysis was to explore remission in patients with early RA treated with abatacept plus MTX in light of the current, stringent ACR-EULAR definitions of remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These new remission criteria are frequently believed to be difficult to achieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated patients with early RA who had been treated with either MTX alone or abatacept plus MTX in the AGREE trial. We also investigated sustainability of initial remission and evaluated the relationship of disease activity with function and structure in these patients. As will be demonstrated, a considerable number of patients can indeed achieve (and sustain) remission, even when using the new and stringent remission criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population and study design</title><p>This post hoc analysis is based on data from the previously published AGREE Phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00122382), in which patients were randomized (1:1) to receive abatacept plus MTX or MTX alone over a 12-month, double-blind period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Analyses were performed post hoc for patients who had received abatacept plus MTX or MTX alone in the double-blind period. The proportions of patients achieving remission and LDA according to DAS28 (CRP), SDAI and CDAI, and remission according to Boolean outcomes, were analyzed as point estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were performed to determine shifts in SDAI status (remission, LDA, MDA and HDA) from month 6 to 12, presented as the proportions of patients in each SDAI state at month 6 who achieved each SDAI state at month 12. Cumulative probability of time to achieve first remission/LDA and sustained first remission/LDA (defined as maintained at all subsequent visits up to month 12) according to DAS28, SDAI and CDAI were evaluated based on Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimation with 95 % CI.

We also evaluated mean scores for core set variables for patients achieving remission at month 12 but not at month 6. Finally, we evaluated the relationship between disease activity at month 3 and functional and structural outcomes at month 12, including mean scores (SD) and mean changes (95 % CI) by disease activity status (remission, LDA or MDA and HDA pooled) at months 3 and 12.

Discontinuations were mainly due to adverse events (4.3 % in the MTX alone group vs 3.5 % in the abatacept plus MTX group) and lack of efficacy (3.2 % and 0 %, respectively). Included in this post hoc analysis were 209 patients receiving MTX alone and 210 receiving abatacept plus MTX, with DAS28 and SDAI data available at baseline, month 6 and month 12.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics</title><p>Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics for the analysis population were comparable between groups (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), and were similar to those reported previously for the overall study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with mean disease duration of &#x02264;7 months and high mean disease activity levels. In both treatment groups, patients attaining remission or LDA at month 12 generally had numerically lower baseline TJC, SJC and DAS28, SDAI and CDAI, as well as mean duration of RA, than patients with MDA or HDA at month 12 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Remission outcomes</title><p>At month 12, remission was achieved in 27.3 % (95 % CI 21.2, 33.3) of patients receiving MTX alone compared with 47.6 % (95 % CI 40.9, 54.4) of patients receiving abatacept plus MTX by DAS28 criteria, by 12.4 % (95 % CI 8.0, 16.9) and 33.3 % (95 % CI 27.0, 39.7) by SDAI criteria, by 16.3 % (95 % CI 11.3, 21.3) and 34.3 % (95 % CI 27.9, 40.7) by CDAI criteria, and by 5.7 % (95 % CI 2.6, 8.9) and 23.8 % (95 % CI 18.0, 29.6) by Boolean criteria (the 95 % CI did not overlap) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, a large proportion of patients achieved remission according to the stringent SDAI, CDAI and Boolean criteria, although, as expected, fewer than by DAS28 (CRP) criteria. Indeed, one out of three patients achieved SDAI remission and almost 25 % of patients achieved Boolean-defined remission (28-joint count with laboratory measures) at month 12. Similar respective rates were seen for CDAI remission and for Boolean remission evaluated without CRP using 66/68-joint counts (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1A). Also, large proportions of patients achieved LDA at month 12 with abatacept plus MTX and MTX alone, but &#x02013; in contrast to the remission criteria &#x02013; proportions were comparable regardless of the index used, although numerically higher with the combination (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1B).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overall remission rates at months 6 and 12 based on as-observed analyses for patients with data available at baseline, month 6 and month 12.

Indeed, for patients in SDAI LDA at month 6, 68.5 % of patients receiving MTX alone and 88.7 % receiving abatacept plus MTX maintained LDA or achieved remission at month 12 (estimate of difference (95 % CI) 20.2 % (4.4, 36.0)).

Although very stringent, regarding the definition of sustained remission, these analyses highlight that a higher proportion of patients receiving abatacept plus MTX attained sustained LDA or remission than patients receiving MTX alone. The median time to achieve first remission was also longer for SDAI and CDAI than for DAS28 (data not shown), indicating greater stringency.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Cumulative probability plot for time to achieve first low disease activity (<italic>LDA</italic>)/remission or sustained LDA/remission.

In these post hoc analyses, high proportions of patients receiving abatacept plus MTX achieved remission at months 6 and 12 according to the stringent ACR-EULAR index-based SDAI (19 and 33 %, respectively) and CDAI (19 and 34 %, respectively) criteria. Higher proportions of patients achieved remission according to DAS28 (31 and 48 % at months 6 and 12) compared with SDAI, CDAI and Boolean criteria. This was not surprising as it is well established that DAS28 remission criteria frequently are afflicted with significant residual disease activity, both clinically and by sonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

However, the DAS28 remission rates observed at 6 months were similar to those previously observed with other biologic agents. Rates for patients achieving Boolean-defined remission (with laboratory measures) were also relatively high for patients treated with abatacept plus MTX (15 and 24 % at months 6 and 12). These findings demonstrate that remission according to the stringent ACR-EULAR remission criteria (SDAI, CDAI and Boolean) is indeed frequently achievable in clinical trials in many MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients treated with MTX, and in even greater proportions of patients receiving biologic therapy (in this case abatacept) in combination with MTX. These results were not dissimilar to those observed in clinical practice, where SDAI and CDAI remission outcomes have been seen in approximately 20&#x02013;25 % of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Analyses of disease activity based on different indices have been performed for other populations of patients treated with abatacept, including those with established RA refractory to MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and similar to other biologic agents, remission rates are lower for patients with refractory disease treated with abatacept plus MTX/DMARDs than for those in the MTX-na&#x000ef;ve population, especially for achieving the stringent SDAI-derived criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Cumulative probability plots have shown that patients receiving abatacept plus MTX reached stringent first remission targets at earlier time points than patients receiving MTX alone; this may have an impact on functional and structural outcomes, and so is important to evaluate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>As anticipated, not all patients in DAS28 remission also achieved SDAI or CDAI remission, although a large proportion of patients were in SDAI or CDAI LDA, highlighting that it is more difficult to achieve remission according to these stringent criteria or that - in line with the data shown here - DAS28 "remission" comprises many patients with significant residual disease activity which are rightly captured as not being in remission by ACR-EULAR remission criteria and as being in an active disease state by SDAI and CDAI.</p><p>For abatacept plus MTX, the proportions of patients achieving stringent remission increased from month 6 to month 12 regardless of the index used, highlighting an increasing magnitude of response over time, even in this RA population with high risk of progression. Such observations, which have not been reported previously with other biologic agents, suggest that the efficacy of abatacept plus MTX may not peak at 6 months, but appears to continue to increase after month 6, allowing more patients to reach the therapeutic goals of SDAI and CDAI remission with continued therapy. These findings are supported by the recently updated EULAR recommendations for the management of RA with DMARDs, which state that individual patients may take longer than 6 months to achieve remission, and that in such cases change in disease activity from baseline should also be taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, these findings highlight the value of the LDA target in the treat-to-target recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and also support the ACR-EULAR recommendations to report not only achievement but also maintenance of outcomes and sustainability of remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the association between remission of clinical disease activity at early time points (month 3) with functional and structural outcomes over the 12-month period. Patients who achieved clinical remission demonstrated numerically greater improvements in physical function, especially versus patients in MDA/HDA, regardless of the index used, supporting an association between early suppression of inflammation and long-term functional benefit. The best functional outcomes were achieved with SDAI and CDAI remission. Mean changes in radiographic score were numerically lower for patients in remission or LDA versus MDA/HDA; this difference was less pronounced for patients receiving abatacept plus MTX. Importantly, adjusted mean differences and exploratory <italic>P</italic> values (i.e., not based on prespecified analyses) show a difference between patients in MDA/HDA treated with abatacept plus MTX versus MTX alone, suggesting a dissociation of the profound relationship between inflammation and destruction, as seen previously for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, tocilizumab and rituximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Altogether, these findings further highlight the value of targeting stringent remission outcomes, as recommended by ACR-EULAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of this post hoc descriptive analysis should be taken into consideration when interpreting these data. The population analyzed here represents a subset of the original AGREE study, including only patients with complete datasets. The analyses were neither prespecified nor powered to detect between- or within-group differences. However, only 90/509 randomized patients were excluded from the analysis, which provides a relatively large sample size, and even if those patients excluded had been included and none had achieved remission, the overall proportion of patients achieving remission would likely have still been substantial, especially for patients treated with abatacept plus MTX. Nevertheless, the findings presented here would benefit from validation in a larger population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, in contrast to commonly held beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], relatively high proportions of patients can achieve at least low disease activity or remission by the ACR-EULAR criteria, despite, and at the same time because of, their stringency; this was seen for MTX and was more pronounced for treatment with abatacept plus MTX. In the AGREE study, many patients attained low disease activity, an alternative therapeutic target to remission. Furthermore, the regular assessment of remission in this study may have resulted in patients with transient fluctuations in disease activity failing to achieve the study definition of sustained remission (i.e., maintenance of first remission at all subsequent monthly visits up to month 12), and may have led to an underestimation of sustained remission. Some data suggest that higher rates of remission can be observed in observational datasets and clinical trials when a treat-to-target strategy is adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. More recent trials of abatacept in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients with early progressive RA have reported higher rates of remission than reported here, even when using stringent remission criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This trend is thought to reflect the increasing use of biologic DMARDs earlier in the course of RA disease, patients entering clinical trials having shorter disease duration and lower disease activity at baseline. Nevertheless, these present analyses support the use of viable treatment targets in the therapy of patients with RA.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2015_671_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
