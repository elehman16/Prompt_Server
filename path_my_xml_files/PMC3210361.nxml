In healthy participants, it induces perceptual changes (Krystal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1994</xref>; Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Stone and Pilowsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2006</xref>), thought disorder (Krystal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Malhotra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1996</xref>; Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>) and negative symptoms (Krystal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>), as well as delusion-like thinking (Pomarol-Clotet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2006</xref>). Moreover, ketamine induces selective impairments in cognitive function (Morgan and Curran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>) that are comparable to those observed in schizophrenia (Fletcher and Honey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). Notably, both ketamine (Honey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>) and schizophrenia (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2001</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>) are associated with difficulties in manipulating, rather than maintaining, information in working memory (WM). While ketamine does not reproduce the signs and symptoms of established schizophrenia, it has been argued that the perceptual and cognitive changes it induces resemble those found during prodromal stages of the illness (Pomarol-Clotet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2006</xref>; Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>).</p><p>One feature of schizophrenia that has not been well-explored under ketamine is that of the experience of time. Numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia show reduced accuracy in estimating periods of time in the minutes-to-hours range (Rabin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1957</xref>; Johnson and Petzel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1971</xref>) and in timing of stimulus durations in the range of several hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds (Lhamon and Goldstone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1956</xref>; Tysk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1983</xref>; Elvev&#x000e5;g et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; Davalos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>; Carroll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). However, the effects of ketamine on timing are uncertain: in rats, ketamine had no direct effect on timing (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>) but instead &#x02018;unlocked&#x02019; the clock-speeding effects of cocaine that had otherwise been masked by extensive training (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007a</xref>). Yet, subjective reports in healthy volunteers indicate that ketamine can distort the experience of time (Pomarol-Clotet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2006</xref>; Stone and Pilowsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2006</xref>), a phenomenon also observed in schizophrenia (Freedman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1974</xref>; Seeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1976</xref>; Vogeley and Kupke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2007</xref>).</p><p>Although the effects of ketamine on timing have not yet been explored experimentally in humans, Rammsayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2006</xref>) noted that memantine (a lower-affinity NMDA antagonist) impaired timing of auditory stimuli in the seconds (~1&#x000a0;s.) but not tens of milliseconds (~50&#x000a0;ms) range. Timing in the range of seconds, but not milliseconds, requires support from WM and sustained attention processes (Gibbon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1984</xref>; Zakay and Block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1996</xref>): a seconds-range stimulus must be continually attended from stimulus onset to offset (as opposed to estimates of, e.g. pitch or colour, which can be estimated almost instantaneously), and the contents of WM must be continuously updated as stimulus presentation unfolds. Given the pattern of memantine's effects, Rammsayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2006</xref>) concluded that its selective effects on seconds-range timing were secondary to its effects on WM. Given differences in their pharmacological specificity, we cannot presume that ketamine's effects would be similar to those of memantine nor, from a more cognitive point of view, that such effects necessarily reflect a more fundamental effect on WM. Timing of longer, seconds-range durations depends not only upon WM but also, of course, upon an index of elapsed time itself, for example accumulation of temporal pulses (Gibbon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1984</xref>; Treisman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1963</xref>) or temporal integration of steadily climbing neuronal activity (Reutimann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2004</xref>). Critically, psychophysical evidence suggests that this timing mechanism may be quite distinct for millisecond- and seconds-range timing (Gibbon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1997</xref>; Buonomano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a deficit in the seconds but not milliseconds, range reflects a specific temporal, rather than WM, deficit. We therefore sought to both establish whether ketamine, like memantine, is associated with a disturbance in an objective measure of time perception in the seconds time range and, crucially, to dissociate such an effect from concurrent mnemonic disturbance by directly comparing the effects of ketamine on performance of timing and colour discrimination tasks that were matched for WM demands (Coull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). A ketamine-induced impairment of the timing, but not colour, task would strongly suggest a selective timing impairment over and above any effects on WM.</p><p>However, &#x02018;timing&#x02019; is an imprecise term (Michon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1985</xref>; P&#x000f6;ppel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1997</xref>; Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>) that can refer equally well to how long a current event lasts (duration estimation) or when a future event is likely to occur (temporal prediction). Since ketamine has previously been shown to modulate neural indices of prediction error (e.g. Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>), we examine performance not only on time perception but also on measures of temporal prediction. Specifically, we tested the impact of ketamine on two distinct indices of temporal prediction derived from the temporal-orienting paradigm (Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2001</xref>), a temporal analogue of the classic Posner covert orienting of spatial attention task (Posner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1980</xref>). In the task, visual cues provide valid, invalid or neutral information concerning the likely delay before an imminent target is presented. The behavioural benefit of temporally informative cues is indexed by faster reaction times during valid compared to invalid trials (Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Griffin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). Yet, even when the onset of the target cannot be predicted by temporal cues (i.e. in the neutral condition), the unidirectional flow of time itself, or &#x02018;time's arrow&#x02019; (Eddington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1928</xref>), provides a degree of predictive power: since time flows inexorably forward an event that we expect to occur, but has not yet occurred, must do so at some time in the future. The &#x02018;hazard function&#x02019; measures the increasing conditional probability (and, hence, increasing sense of temporal expectation) over time that an event will occur, given that it has not already occurred (Elithorn and Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1955</xref>; Luce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1986</xref>). Increasing temporal certainty of target presentation over time allows the response plan to be updated dynamically, as the trial unfolds, which ultimately translates into faster RTs at longer delays (Niemi and N&#x000e4;&#x000e4;t&#x000e4;nen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1981</xref>). The orienting paradigm can therefore index temporally predictive information that is conveyed either by valid, prelearned cues (temporal condition) or by the very passage of time itself (neutral condition). In order to control for possible, though unlikely (Morgan and Curran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>), effects of ketamine on non-specific attentional processes, we also examined effects of ketamine on the more classic, spatial, version of the task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>We collected data from 13 (6 male and 7 female; mean age 23.1&#x000a0;years) right-handed, healthy volunteers.

The timing tasks reported here were performed during the 100&#x000a0;ng/ml infusion period only. The infusion pump (Graseby 3500, Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) was controlled by a personal laptop computer running Stanpump software, programmed to use a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model for ketamine (Absalom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>) to calculate infusion rates. The order of infusion was counterbalanced across participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cognitive tasks</title><p>Both tasks were performed at 100&#x000a0;ng/ml blood plasma level of ketamine.

In the time condition, participants estimated whether the duration of the second (probe) stimulus was shorter (S), equal to (=), or longer (L) than the previous (sample) stimulus. In the colour condition, participants estimated whether the probe was redder (R), equal to (=), or bluer (B) than the sample. The response screen presented three alphanumeric characters, indicating each of the three possible responses for each condition. Their spatial position could vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants pressed one of the three corresponding response buttons (left, middle or right) to indicate their estimate of relative duration or colour. The response screen appeared for 1,500&#x000a0;ms, during which time the subject gave their response, and any responses slower than 1,500&#x000a0;ms were not recorded. Inter-trial intervals varied pseudo-randomly from 1 to 2&#x000a0;s. Participants performed 36 trials per condition, which comprised equal numbers of trials in which the probe was shorter than/longer than/equal to the sample in the time condition, or bluer than/redder than/equal to the sample in the colour task. The time and colour conditions were presented twice each in a blocked manner, with each block comprising 18 trials of either the time condition or the colour condition.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Temporal and colour discrimination task. Participants estimated either the duration or colour of two consecutive stimuli. The first (<italic>sample</italic>) and second (<italic>probe</italic>) stimuli were presented for one of three durations (540, 1,080, 1,620&#x000a0;ms) and had an overall percept of one of three shades of purple (<italic>maroon</italic>, <italic>violet</italic> or <italic>indigo</italic>). Stimuli were not of a uniform colour but instead comprised rapidly flickering (90&#x000a0;ms) presentations of three of five different shades of purple (see inset) to give the overall colour percept.

Each stimulus was presented for one of three durations (540, 1,080 or 1,620&#x000a0;ms), and had an overall percept of one of three shades of purple (maroon, violet or indigo) ranging from a reddish to a bluish hue. Duration and colour stimulus attributes were counterbalanced such that any of the three stimulus durations could be paired with any of the three colours. The stimuli to be estimated were not a uniform colour for the entire duration of stimulus presentation. Rather, rapidly alternating presentations (90&#x000a0;ms) of five different shades of purple across the entire stimulus duration gave an overall percept of maroon, violet or indigo. During the colour task, the participant estimated the average shade of purple by amalgamating all shades presented during the flickering percept. This rather unusual colour task was designed to ensure that subjects maintained attention, and continually updated their colour estimate, throughout the entire stimulus presentation. This manipulation is crucial for equating sustained attention and working memory demands across the time and colour tasks since (1) time perception necessitates attention being sustained for the entire duration of the stimulus (~1&#x000a0;s.), whereas perception of a static colour would occur within the first hundred milliseconds or so, and (2) time perception requires stimulus onset to be held in working memory and then continually updated as time elapses, whereas perception of a static colour would require no such updating of working memory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Temporal and spatial orienting of attention</title><p><bold>Task</bold> The task manipulated participants' expectations of <italic>where</italic> or <italic>when</italic> target stimuli would appear within an experimental display. A central cue (inset Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) predicted either the location (spatial condition) or onset (temporal condition) of an imminent target or else it provided neither temporal nor spatial information (neutral condition). In the spatial and temporal conditions, cues could either correctly (valid trials) or incorrectly (invalid trials) predict where or when the target would appear, with an overall ratio of 80:20 valid/invalid trials. In the neutral conditions, the participants could predict neither where nor when the target would appear. The participants' task in all three conditions was simply to detect the target as rapidly as possible, while avoiding mistakes. Participants indicated covert detection of the target by pressing a response button with their right index finger. Inter-trial intervals varied between 600 and 1,000&#x000a0;ms. The computer recorded reaction times to target stimuli. Subjects were thoroughly familiarized with the cues prior to performing 120 experimental trials of each of the three conditions (360 in total). For the temporal and spatial conditions, this corresponded to 96 valid trials and 24 invalid trials.

The central cue was a compound stimulus consisting of a diamond and two concentric circles. One part of the cue was briefly (100&#x000a0;ms) highlighted to inform the subject whether to attend to the location or time of onset of the target. During the spatial condition, the left (or right) side of the diamond brightened to inform the subject that the target was likely to appear in the left (or right) peripheral box. During the temporal condition, brightening of the inner or outer circle indicated that the target would appear after a short (750&#x000a0;ms) or long (1,500&#x000a0;ms) delay, respectively. During the neutral-cue condition, the entire cue brightened, providing no spatial or temporal information. Targets appeared for 100&#x000a0;ms in one of the two peripheral boxes and after one of two time intervals, according to the nature of the cue: in the spatial condition, targets appeared randomly at the short or long time delay, but their spatial location was determined by the nature of the preceding cue (left/right; valid/invalid); in the temporal condition, targets appeared randomly in the left or right box but their temporal onset was determined by the nature of the preceding cue (short/long; valid/invalid).

If the probe and sample were of the same duration but the subject judged the probe to be shorter, then this was classed as an underestimate, whereas if the probe was judged to be longer, then this was classed as an overestimate. If the probe was longer than the sample but the participant judged it to be shorter or of equal length, then this was classed as an underestimate.

As compared to placebo, ketamine reduced accuracy of perceptual timing while having no effect on accuracy of a colour perception task that was matched to the timing task for accessory cognitive processes, such as visual processing, sustained attention and working memory (WM). This is the first time that selective effects of ketamine on a perceptual timing task have been shown. Despite our relatively small sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12), the selectivity of the results, demonstrated by a significant task by drug interaction, is striking. Although the colour task was more difficult than the timing task, the lack of drug effect on the colour task is unlikely to merely reflect a floor effect since participants' performance in both sessions (~70% accuracy) was well above chance (33%), allowing sufficient margin for further deterioration in performance. Selective impairment on performance of the timing task was reflected in participants' subjective assessment of time. Ketamine significantly altered the inner experience of time and drug-induced changes in subjective ratings correlated with objective measures of duration overestimation in the perceptual timing task.</p><p>Further evidence of timing disturbances were noted during performance of a cued reaction time (RT) task with variable cue-target intervals. In this task, RTs are generally faster for targets appearing at long, rather than short, intervals due to the increasing conditional probability of target appearance over time (Niemi and N&#x000e4;&#x000e4;t&#x000e4;nen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1981</xref>). However, ketamine slowed RTs selectively at the long interval, thereby attenuating the increase in speed that is normally seen at long delays. By contrast, ketamine had no significant effect on RT when temporal pre-cues could be used to predict in advance when the target would appear. Similarly, ketamine had no effect on the ability to use spatial cues to predict target location, consistent with previous results in schizophrenic patients (Carter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Are effects of ketamine on timing due to WM deficits?</title><p>Rammsayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2006</xref>) concluded that effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on timing in the seconds (~1&#x000a0;s.) but not tens of milliseconds (~50&#x000a0;ms) range were due to a primary effect on the additional WM processes that are needed to process seconds-range durations. We aimed to disentangle drug effects on timing from effects on WM by examining the effects of ketamine on two tasks that were matched for WM demands, in terms of both manipulation and maintenance in WM. During the 500&#x02013;1,500&#x000a0;ms stimulus presentation time in both tasks, subjects had to maintain attention and integrate (i.e. manipulate) either duration or colour information in WM: for the timing task, duration estimates had to be updated incrementally throughout stimulus presentation; for the colour task, colour estimates had to be averaged across stimulus presentation. Both tasks also required that a sample stimulus be stored (i.e. maintained) in WM for a delay of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;s for comparison with a later probe, and for the resulting decision to be maintained in WM until appearance of the response screen. Since mnemonic (and attentional) load were thereby matched across tasks, selective effects of ketamine on timing, but not colour, discrimination, suggests that ketamine-induced impairments do not simply reflect a functional side effect of the drug on the WM processes that are necessary for processing seconds range rather than millisecond timing.</p><p>However, one difference between the timing and colour task was the specific way in which information was manipulated in WM. For the timing task, information was incrementally accumulated, whereas for the colour task, it was averaged. Accumulation implies a unidirectionality, a fundamental feature of the flow of time itself (&#x02018;time's arrow&#x02019;, Eddington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1928</xref>). Averaging does not imply this unidirectionality. It is possible therefore, that ketamine influences timing behaviour by selectively impairing the ability to manipulate information in WM in a particular direction or order. A related possibility is that subjects were accumulating not time, but a numerical count of the flickering stimulus. However, this is unlikely given that (1) each flicker was presented for a duration of only 80&#x000a0;ms necessitating an abnormally fast rate of counting and (2) the vast majority of our trials contained at least one stimulus whose duration was below the critical 1,200&#x000a0;ms value at which counting begins to become a useful strategy (Grondin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Temporal expectations and the flow of time</title><p>As expected, both spatial (Posner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1980</xref>) and temporal (Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>) cues speeded RTs when targets appeared at expected, rather than unexpected, locations or delays, respectively. These RT effects were not modulated by ketamine, in either the spatial or temporal domain. Although the glutamatergic system has previously been implicated in signaling mismatch between expected and actual outcome (also known as the prediction error) (Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>), we found no evidence in this study for a selective effect of ketamine on RTs to unexpected target locations or onsets. This null effect could represent a lack of effect of ketamine on the processing of unexpected events. Alternatively, it may represent the insensitivity of our behavioural measures: the behavioural consequences of prediction error are rather elusive, and it has previously proven easier to demonstrate the underlying neural responses to prediction error, and their modulation by ketamine, using, for example electrophysiological recordings (e.g. Schultz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1998</xref>; Umbricht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2002</xref>) or fMRI (e.g.McClure et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>; O'Doherty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>; Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>). Future studies examining the effects of ketamine on neural responses to unexpected locations or onsets could help resolve this issue. A final possibility is that these null effects simply reflect a lack of power in the data. However, the predicted behavioural advantages of valid versus invalid cues were clearly present in both the temporal and spatial conditions, itself suggestive of sufficient power. Moreover, although ketamine had no effect on speed of responding in the temporal or spatial conditions, it selectively slowed RTs to long delay targets in the neutral condition. Together, these patterns of data suggest a selectivity of effect rather than insufficient power.</p><p>In the orienting task, temporal cues allow subjects to predict event onset, thus generating temporal expectations that help speed performance (Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Griffin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). Yet, even when the onset of the imminent event cannot be predicted by arbitrary, pre-learned cues, the unidirectional flow of time itself (Eddington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1928</xref>) provides a degree of predictive power via the hazard function. In our study, the neutral cue condition of the orienting task, in which participants did not know in advance, whether the target would appear at the short or long delay, provides an index of the hazard function. We observed the expected speeding of RTs for targets appearing at long versus short delays following administration of placebo. Ketamine, however, significantly attenuated this increase in response speed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), slowing RTs selectively at the longer delay. Previous studies using a fixed foreperiod paradigm have also reported ketamine-induced slowing selectively at long delays (Guillermain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2001</xref>; Micallef et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2004</xref>). This was interpreted as reflecting an effect of ketamine on motor preparation processes due to particularly impaired temporal resolution at long delays. However, this is an unlikely explanation for our own results since ketamine did not slow RTs at long intervals when participants could use arbitrary temporal cues to predict in advance when the target would appear (i.e. the temporal cue condition of the orienting task), suggesting they were perfectly able to estimate and prepare for the long interval as long as it had been cued beforehand. Ketamine did not therefore affect the ability to use prelearned cues to predict in advance when the target would occur but, instead, interfered with the ability to use the very passage of time itself to predict target occurrence when no other sources of temporal information were available. Ketamine effects have previously been interpreted within a Bayesian framework (Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>), in which information processing is contingent upon prior expectations. In Bayesian terms, our data show that ketamine does not disrupt the ability to make use of prior expectations to interpret sensory events, but does interfere with the ability to generate expectations online as a function of sensory evidence accumulated over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Relevance to schizophrenia</title><p>Temporal predictability in the temporal cue condition of the orienting task is driven by external, visual cues. Conversely, temporal predictability in the neutral cue condition, where visual cues are uninformative, depends upon an internal sense of the passage of time. After administration of ketamine, participants made good use of external visual cues to make temporal predictions, but were less able to use internal estimates of time to make predictions. This psychopharmacological dissociation is reminiscent of findings in patients with schizophrenia who rely more upon external sensory stimuli to interpret the consequences of their actions, rather than internal sensorimotor processes (Synofzik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>; Voss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2010</xref>). Moreover, while the temporal cue condition requires straightforward maintenance of a fixed a priori temporal prediction in WM, the neutral cue condition requires updating (i.e. manipulation) of the prediction as a function of elapsing time. Notably, both ketamine and schizophrenia have previously been associated with deficits in manipulation, rather than maintenance in WM (Fletcher and Honey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). Our orienting data, taken together with the results on the temporal discrimination task discussed above, support the proposal that ketamine interferes with the way in which the unidirectional flow of time is integrated within WM. Intriguingly, disturbances in the temporal flow (past&#x02013;present&#x02013;future) of causal experience have previously been suggested to underpin certain symptoms of schizophrenia (Fuchs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>). The timing deficits observed in schizophrenia may therefore be more accurately characterised as impairments in temporal flow, such that the beginning, middle and end of the event to be timed are not necessarily processed (or retained in WM) in the correct order, thus compromising duration estimates. Further experiments are clearly needed to test this hypothesis more directly.</p><p>Patients with schizophrenia have previously been reported to both over- (Johnson and Petzel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1971</xref>; Tysk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1983</xref>) and underestimate (Rabin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1957</xref>; Elvev&#x000e5;g et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>) stimulus duration. We therefore examined whether ketamine produced a consistent temporal error in one direction or the other by measuring the incidence of over- or under-estimation of probe duration. Overall, ketamine induced both types of error, with no significant bias in one direction or the other (see also Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>). However, a particularly high incidence of drug-induced overestimation was evident whenever the probe stimulus was shorter than the sample. This result is unlikely to reflect a ketamine-induced increase in speed of an internal clock (Gibbon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1984</xref>), because any change in clock speed would apply equally to both sample and probe stimuli. Instead, ketamine appears to have either selectively elongated perception of the current (probe) event, or contracted the memorized representation of the sample. This issue could be addressed by future experiments in which the sample duration is encoded either before or after administration of ketamine (see Malapani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>) for an example of this approach in patients with Parkinson's disease).</p><p>Finally, patients with schizophrenia (Carroll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>) or individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (Penney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2005</xref>) have previously been reported to show larger than normal differences in the relative accuracy of auditory versus visual timing, potentially due to a preferential impairment of timing in the auditory modality (Carroll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). If ketamine can be considered a useful model of schizophrenia, then we may expect to replicate this &#x02018;modality effect&#x02019; with ketamine and, furthermore, to predict that its effects on timing would be even more evident when tested in the auditory domain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Possible neural substrates</title><p>We have shown that ketamine impairs accuracy on a temporal discrimination task that has previously been shown to engage Supplementary Motor Area, right prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia (Coull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). Although ketamine had no effect on the ability to use visual cues to predict stimulus onset in the temporal orienting task, a process previously shown to engage left inferior parietal cortex and intraparietal sulcus (Coull and Nobre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Coull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>), it did impair the ability to use the flow of time to make temporal predictions (the hazard function), a process that has consistently been shown to depend upon right prefrontal cortex (Vallesi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2009</xref>; Bueti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Taken together with data from the temporal discrimination task, we suggest that ketamine may impair timing by modulating right prefrontal cortex function. This hypothesis is supported by functional imaging data showing that ketamine modulates activity in prefrontal cortex, among other areas, during tasks of WM and executive function (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Honey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>) or prediction error (Corlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>).</p><p>These data might indicate therefore that timing depends upon glutamatergic function in prefrontal cortex. Alternatively, ketamine is known to increase prefrontal dopamine in rats (Bowers and Morton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Verma and Moghaddam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1996</xref>), suggesting that its effect on timing may instead be a result of drug-induced modulation of prefrontal dopamine. Therefore, just as dysregulation of dopaminergic innervation of prefrontal cortex has been suggested as the common underlying mechanism for both schizophrenia and ketamine-induced impairments in WM (Fletcher and Honey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>), it may also explain the timing deficits associated with these two states. Notably, the dopaminergic system has repeatedly been implicated in timing (Meck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1996</xref>), with converging evidence from the animal and clinical literatures (Coull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). Yet dopaminergic manipulations provoke consistent changes in clock speed, with enhanced dopaminergic activity leading to overestimates of stimulus duration (Maricq and Church <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1983</xref>; Meck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1983</xref>; Matell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2006</xref>) and reduced activity inducing underestimates (Maricq and Church <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1983</xref>; Meck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1986</xref>; MacDonald and Meck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>) and results of the present study, as well as prior work in rats (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007a</xref>), suggest ketamine has no effect on clock speed. Instead, Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007b</xref>) suggest ketamine &#x02018;unlocks&#x02019; the clock-speeding effects of dopaminergic agonists that are otherwise attenuated by extensive training. Specifically, although administration of dopaminergic agonists is known to speed the internal clock, extensive training on the task abolishes this effect (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007b</xref>). The hypothesis is that as performance on the timing task becomes more and more automated through training, the dopaminergic system becomes less critical for timing, and instead, the glutamatergic system takes over to mediate a more habitual form of timing behaviour. If a glutamatergic antagonist, such as ketamine, is administered, then control reverts to the dopaminergic system, meaning dopaminergic agents will once more produce their clock-speeding effects. So why, in contrast to Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007a</xref>), does ketamine modulate timing in our relatively naive participants? The answer may lie, once more, with the hazard function. Keeping track of the unidirectional flow of time in WM in order to time current events, as well as to predict the onset of future events, is an overlearned, automated process that, as suggested above, appears to be subject to disruption by ketamine. Therefore, the results of this study appear not to reflect a dopamine-dependent clock-speed effect, but may instead indicate a glutamate-dependent modulation of the unidirectional nature of &#x02018;time's arrow&#x02019;. Alternatively, in line with ketamine's effects on the manipulation of information in WM (Honey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>), our results may reflect dopamine-dependent modulation of the way in which temporal information is integrated within WM. Future studies combining functional neuroimaging and psychopharmacological methodologies could ascertain more directly the role of prefrontal dopamine or glutamate in the effects of ketamine on timing or, more specifically, on the ability to integrate the unidirectional flow of time in WM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>PCF is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Bernard Wolfe Health Neuroscience Fund.
