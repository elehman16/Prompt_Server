Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with an inflatable cuff has been the most common device used in the last decade. Different modifications of LMA like ProSeal, Unique, Supreme, and iLMA have been used in clinical practice and discussed in the literature. The i-gel is a relatively new and unique supraglottic airway with a noninflatable cuff made of a soft gel-like medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. It has been used in adult patients and found comparable to LMA.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Pediatric i-gel is now available in four different sizes &#x02013; 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 &#x02013; on the basis of body weight. There are very few studies comparing the size 2 i-gel with classic LMA (cLMA) of the same size to assess their performance in anesthetized and artificially ventilated children.</p><p>In this study, we have compared size 2 i-gel (Intersurgical Inc., Berkshire, UK) with cLMA (LMA Classic; Laryngeal Mask Company Ltd. Henley-on-Thames, UK.) for ease of insertion, oropharyngeal sealing pressures (OSPs), and air leak. Hemodynamic effects and any postoperative complications because of insertion of the device were noted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After getting approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee, 60 patients were studied. A randomized prospective study was planned to compare size 2 i-gel with cLMA of the same size.</p><p>The children included in the study were 1-6 years of age, ASA physical status I&#x02013;II, weighing 10-20 kg, and were posted for elective surgeries of less than 1 h duration in the supine position including lower abdominal (e.g., colostomy closure), inguinal (e.g., herniotomy, circumcision), and orthopedic procedures (e.g., upper and lower limb surgeries). The following were excluded from the study: (i) patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, (ii) those at risk of gastroesophageal regurgitation, and (iii) those with airway related conditions such a trismus, limited mouth opening, trauma, or mass. Sixty patients were equally randomized to one of the two groups (i-gel and cLMA) of 30 each for airway management, using a computer-generated randomization program.</p><p>Written informed consent was taken from the parents prior to intervention and a standardized protocol for anesthesia was maintained for all cases. All the children were kept nil per mouth as per standard guidelines. They were premedicated with 0.3 mg/kg of midazolam syrup 1 h prior to induction of anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia included sevoflurane in oxygen with standard monitors placed. Anesthesia was maintained with 1-2% sevoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen.</p><p>Once an adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved, the supraglottic device was inserted by the standard technique recommended by the manufacturer (single-finger technique for cLMA). We considered easy up-and-down movement of the lower jaw, no reaction to pressure applied to both angles of the mandible, and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (EtSev) of 2.5% to indicate the adequate depth of anesthesia for insertion of the device. The technique for placement of i-gel is reviewed on the website. Each device was inserted by an experienced anesthesiologist who had performed at least 50 size 2 cLMA and 20 size 2 i-gel placements.</p><p>The ease of insertion was graded as very easy, easy, or difficult by the attending anesthesiologist. The device was inserted with &#x0201c;sniffing&#x0201d; position. The following manoeuvres were included: (i) chin lift, (ii) jaw thrust, (iii) head extension, and (iv) neck flexion. If the device could be inserted without any manipulation, it was graded as &#x0201c;very easy.&#x0201d; If there was only one manipulation required, it was called &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; and any difficulty more than that was graded as &#x0201c;difficult.&#x0201d; The number of attempts was noted, and it was considered a failure if the insertion was not successful in three attempts. The patient was then excluded from the study, and either a different size of the same device was inserted or the child was intubated with an endotracheal tube.</p><p>The device was fixed from maxilla to maxilla, and the cuff was inflated in the cLMA group using a cuff pressure monitor (Mallinckrodt Medical, Hennef, Germany) to achieve a pressure of 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. This pressure was maintained throughout the surgery by continuous cuff pressure monitoring. A lubricated gastric tube was passed through the gastric channel in the i-gel group. The device was connected to a closed circle breathing system (Fabius<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> plus anesthesia work station, Draeger, Germany) and an effective airway was defined by a square wave capnograph trace, normal chest movements, stable oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) not less than 95%, and bilateral auscultation of the chest.</p><p>At the end of the surgery, anesthetic agents were discontinued and the device was removed after the child was awake. Any blood staining of the device or tongue&#x02013;lip&#x02013;dental trauma was documented immediately in the post-anesthesia care unit and 24 h later. The parents were also asked about sore throat, hoarse cry, or any other discomfort in the child's throat.</p><p>Monitoring devices (IntelliVue MP40&#x02122;, Phillips) were attached to the patient including pulse oximeter and for measurement of non-invasive blood pressure. The following parameters were measured.</p><p>

</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Sample size was based on a crossover pilot study of 10 patients and was selected to detect a projected difference of 30% between the groups for airway sealing pressure for a type 1 error 0.05 and a power of 0.8. The demographic data (age, weight, and height), the OSP, and hemodynamic data were analyzed by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.

It has a channel for gastric catheter placement, except for size 1. The soft, noninflatable cuff fits snugly onto the perilaryngeal framework, mirroring the shape of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, piriform fossae, perithyroid, peri-cricoid, posterior cartilages and spaces. So, each structure receives an impression fit, thus supporting the seal by enveloping the laryngeal inlet. The seal created is sufficient for both spontaneously breathing as well as paralyzed patients. Studies in adults have been promising, showing an easy insertion, high airway leak pressures, and low complication rates with few postoperative complaints.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we found that insertion of the i-gel was successful in the first attempt in 28 of 30 patients and comparable to 27 of 30 in cLMA group. A global study involving 50 children undergoing ventilation using the i-gel pediatric device was carried out over 2 months. In that study the success rate for inserting the device was 80% in the first attempt and 100% after two attempts.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Other studies of using the pediatric i-gel[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and LMAs[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have shown similar results. The ease of insertion was graded as &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very easy&#x0201d; in all the cases in the i-gel and the cLMA groups.</p><p>In our study, we found significant difference in OSP between cLMA and i-gel. Similar result had been observed in a study where average OSP in i-gel was found to be 24 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, compared to 18-21 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in cLMA.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the other hand, Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found no significant difference between i-gel and cLMA in children. Janakiraman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] measured OSP 17 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in cLMA and i-gel group, respectively. The result of our study was further substantiated by the observation of the study by Goyal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In this study, the authors found that OSP in the i-gel group (26 &#x000b1; 2.63 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) was significantly higher than in the cLMA group (22 &#x000b1; 2.3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>The incidence of complications (airway trauma and sore throat) was very low in all cases except for blood staining in a few children in the cLMA group, which was neither clinically important nor statistically significant. Other studies have also reported similar incidence.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Though i-gel inserts less pressure on perilaryngeal tissue because of its noninflatable cuff, the incidence of sore throat was comparable in all three groups. This observation of our study is supported by the study of Wong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] where they stated that sore throat could be minimal even with supraglottic devices with inflatable cuff, if the intracuff pressure remains less than 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>From our study, we conclude that size 2 i-gel is comparable to cLMA of the same size in terms of hemodynamic parameters, ease of insertion, and postoperative complications. OSP is the only parameter which is significantly higher in the i-gel group. Size 2 i-gel is equally safe, efficient, and cost effective in children, compared to other prototypical pediatric supraglottic airway devices. It has an added advantage of gastric channel which is found only in ProSeal LMA and LMA supreme&#x02122;. Therefore, i-gel should be more frequently used in children in both elective surgeries and in procedures requiring anesthesia outside the operating room.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Uppal</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinsella</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of the i-gel with the cuffed tracheal tube during pressure-controlled ventilation</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2009</year><volume>102</volume><fpage>264</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19151051</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Francksen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanss</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Scholz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Doerges</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Bein</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of the i-gel with the LMA-Unique in nonparalysed anaesthetised adult patients</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2009</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>1118</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19735404</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of clinical performance of i-gel with LMAProseal in Elective surgeries</article-title><source>Indian J Anesth</source><year>2009</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>302</fpage><lpage>5</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gabbot</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Beringer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The iGEL supraglottic airway: A potential role for resuscitation?</article-title><source>Resuscitation</source><year>2007</year><volume>73</volume><fpage>161</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17289250</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Userguides/i-gel_users_Guide_English.pdf [Internet]</article-title><year>2010</year><date-in-citation>Last cited on 2012 Jan 10</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
