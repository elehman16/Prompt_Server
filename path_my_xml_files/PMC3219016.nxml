EPA/GLA has anti-inflammatory benefits, as evidenced by its association with reduction in pulmonary inflammation, improvement in oxygenation and improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe forms of acute lung injury. This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial designed to investigate whether EPA/GLA could have an effective role in the treatment of patients with early sepsis (systemic inflammatory response syndrome with confirmed or presumed infection and without any organ dysfunction) by reducing the progression of the disease to severe sepsis (sepsis associated with at least one organ failure) or septic shock (sepsis associated with hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation). Secondary outcomes included the development of individual organ failure, increased ICU and hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation and 28-day all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Randomization was concealed, and patients were allocated to receive, for seven days, either an EPA/GLA diet or an isocaloric, isonitrogenous control diet not enhanced with lipids. Patients were continuously tube-fed at a minimum of 75% of basal energy expenditure &#x000d7; 1.3. To evaluate the progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock, daily screening for individual organ failure was performed. All clinical outcomes were recorded during a 28-day follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 115 patients in the early stages of sepsis requiring EN were included, among whom 106 were considered evaluable. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis demonstrated that patients fed the EPA/GLA diet developed less severe sepsis and/or septic shock than patients fed the control diet (26.3% versus 50%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0259), with similar results observed for the evaluable patients (26.4% versus 50.9% respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0217). The ITT analysis demonstrated that patients in the study group developed cardiovascular failure (36.2% versus 21%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0381) and respiratory failure (39.6% versus 24.6%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0362) less often than the control group. Similarly, when considering only the evaluable patients, fewer patientsdeveloped cardiovascular failure (20.7% versus 37.7%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.03) and respiratory failure (26.4% versus 39.6%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.04). The percentage of patients fed the EPA/GLA diet requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was reduced compared with controls (ITT patients: 18.9% versus 33.9%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.394; evaluable patients: 17.5% versus 34.5%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.295). Patients nourished with the EPA/GLA diet remained in the ICU fewer days than the control population (ITT patients: 21.1 ICU-free days versus 14.7 ICU-free days, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001; evaluable patients: 20.8 ICU-free days versus 14.3 ICU-free days, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) and fewer days at the hospital (ITT patients: 19.5 hospital-free days versus 10.3 hospital-free days, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001; evaluable patients: 19.1 hospital-free days versus 10.2 hospital-free days, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) (all numbers expressed as means). No significant differences in 28-day all-cause mortality were observed (ITT patients: 26.2% EPA/GLA diet versus 27.6% control diet, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.72; evaluable: 26.4 EPA/GLA diet versus 30.18 control diet, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.79).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that EPA/GLA may play a beneficial role in the treatment of enterally fed patients in the early stages of sepsis without associated organ dysfunction by contributing to slowing the progression of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, especially with regard to cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00981877">NCT00981877</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta><notes><p>See related letter by Machado, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccforum.com/content/15/5/449">http://ccforum.com/content/15/5/449</ext-link></p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been demonstrated that nutritional support by feeding patients specialized diets, as a result of its capacity to interfere with a variety of biological processes, can modulate the chain of inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recent pharmaceutical interventions proposed for sepsis have sought to focus on regulating the chain of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which are responsible for causing the systemic characteristics of the disease and consequently leading to multiple organ failure. The inflammatory reaction is capable of activating the synthesis of several lipid mediators which are involved in the complex regulation of the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Lipid mediators are synthesized by three main pathways, cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450, by using fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and &#x003b3;-linolenic acid (GLA) as substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but the biological anti-inflammatory activities of EPA and GLA are far beyond the simple regulation of eicosanoid production. For instance, EPAs can affect immune cell responses through the regulation of gene expression and subsequent downstream events by acting as ligands for nuclear receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and as control transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. EPA can also affect the activity of the proinflammatory transcription nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), which regulates the expression of many proinflammatory gene-encoding adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines and other effectors of the innate immune response system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Researchers have recently described that the two main active fish oil pharmaconutrients, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, are substrates of two novel classes of mediators called resolvins and protectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which are involved in the resolution of the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In 1999, Gadek and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] demonstrated that the use of a diet enriched with EPA, GLA and antioxidants can improve oxygenation status in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The same study demonstrated that patients nourished with this diet spend fewer days in the ICU as well as in the hospital. This diet was further evaluated in two additional studies published in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Singer <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] demonstrated the effectiveness of an EPA/GLA diet in improving oxygenation status and decreasing the ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) of patients with acute lung injury (ALI). This diet was also associated with lower mortality rates on the basis of 28-day all-cause mortality. Similar results were observed by Pontes-Arruda <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in which such a diet was fed to patients with ARDS secondary to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.</p><p>In a recently published meta-analysis of outcomes, the three above-mentioned studies were combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For the patients considered evaluable (<italic>n </italic>= 296), the use of an EPA/GLA diet was associated with a 60% reduction in the risk of 28-day in-hospital all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.24 to 0.68; <italic>P </italic>= 0.001). With regard to the effects of the use of an EPA/GLA diet upon mortality on the basis of intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (<italic>n </italic>= 411 patients), a 49% reduction in the risk of 28-day in-hospital all-cause mortality was evident (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79; <italic>P </italic>= 0.002). Available clinical evidence is also consistent in showing a reduction in time on mechanical ventilation as well as ICU and hospital LOS. In fact, a second meta-analysis including data from unpublished studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] demonstrated similar results.</p><p>In analyzing the data together, it was clear that feeding patients an EPA/GLA diet was associated with a reduction in the development of new organ dysfunction. Although the Singer <italic>et al. </italic>study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] did not assess this variable, both Gadek <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and Pontes-Arruda <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] demonstrated reductions in this particular outcome. Combined, the feeding patients an EPA/GLA diet was associated with an 83% reduction in the development of new organ failure. If we accept that the development of new organ failure is the pathway that leads patients with sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock, it appears logical to evaluate the possible benefits of treating patients with this nutritional intervention in the early stages of sepsis (defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with confirmed or presumed infection and without any organ failure) as a way to prevent the evolution or to slow progression of the disease. Moreover, if we consider that the development of multiple organ failure is associated with increased mortality rates, we can hypothesize that feeding patients a diet including an enteral formulation enriched with EPA/GLA might be a determining factor in reducing the mortality rate.</p><p>All previously published trials were performed in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with at least one organ failure. Since the effects of the EPA/GLA diet in patients without any organ failure remain uncertain, the aims of this clinical study were to evaluate the role of an enteral formulation enriched with EPA/GLA in patients diagnosed in the very early stages of sepsis, despite respiratory failure, and to compare the results with those obtained with the use of a standard ICU formulation, isocaloric and isonitrogenous to the study diet, and not enhanced with lipids but higher in carbohydrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design and ethical aspects</title><p>In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial, we compared the effects of feeding patients with early sepsis a diet including enteral nutrition enriched with EPA, GLA and elevated levels of antioxidant vitamins (Oxepa&#x02122;; Abbott Nutrition, Chicago, IL, USA) those of an isonitrogenous and isocaloric control diet (Ensure Plus HN&#x02122;; Abbott Nutrition, Chicago, IL, USA).

Mechanical ventilation at baseline <italic>per se </italic>was not considered a reason for exclusion as long as the patient maintained a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio not indicative of respiratory failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and study diet administration</title><p>Patients were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 using a web-based central randomization system. Patients, families and caregivers were blinded to the type of diet being delivered. All data were inserted into a web-based clinical research form located in a secure server using an encrypted and dedicated website. Randomization was performed using blocks of randomization. Each block used an algorithm with different sizes and sequences of randomization to guarantee an adequate balance between the two study groups at any time, independently of the number of patients enrolled. The caloric goal was automatically calculated by using the Harris Benedict Equation &#x000d7; 1.3, taking into consideration the information inserted (such as age, weight and height). After randomization, the group information (study or control) and the dietary caloric goals (measured in kilocalories per liter or in milliliters) were sent by personal email message to the nonblinded person in the center in which the patient was included. Once the patient was randomized, a 12-hour window was allowed to start the enteral diet; therefore, each institution had a 48-hour window within which to begin the study protocol including the 36 hours required to identify the patient, obtain the patient's written informed consent and randomize the patient, with an additional 12 hours to start the diet) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Information was inserted daily regarding the exact date and time when the diet started as well as the patient's daily caloric intake. Patients were excluded from the trial on the basis of a protocol violation if the enteral diet was not started within 12 hours after randomization.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Participant flow diagram</bold>. BEE = basal energy expenditure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc10267-1"/></fig><p>Study and control diets were similar in consistency and color. To maintain adequate blinding, the diets were poured into similar and sealed containers before being delivered to the ICU. The containers were connected to an infusion pump (Patrol Enteral Feeding Pump; Abbott Nutrition, Chicago, IL, USA) using a closed system to prevent any detection of the diet smell by the blinded subjects. Enteral feeding was delivered at a constant rate to achieve a minimum of 50% basal energy expenditure (BEE) &#x000d7; 1.3 within the first 24 hours. If well tolerated, enteral nutrition was advanced to achieve a minimum of 75% of BEE &#x000d7; 1.3 within 72 hours. Diets were delivered continuously without night pause and using the same protocol in all participating institutions. The enteral diets were delivered for a total of seven days or until they were interrupted at the physician's discretion or because of the development of any adverse event that could be related to the enteral feeding. The diet could also be interrupted if there was an indication to start oral feeding or parenteral nutrition. After the diet was interrupted, and if the patient was still in need of enteral nutrition, each individual institution was allowed to freely select the most appropriate diet to continue the enteral nutrition therapy. The day on which patients started receiving the diet was considered study day 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory data, outcome measures and statistical analysis</title><p>Blood samples were obtained for routine laboratory testing on a daily basis. Severity scores, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA), were automatically calculated by the web-based system, taking into consideration the individual values inserted for each patient to avoid possible human errors in the calculations of the severity scores.</p><p>The primary issue was to determine the development of severe sepsis and septic shock during a 28-day follow-up period. To achieve this goal, a daily evaluation regarding the development of individual organ failure was performed. The criteria used to define each organ failure are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. If the patient developed at least one organ failure, the patient was considered to have developed severe sepsis. If refractory hypotension was identified, the patient was counted as having developed septic shock. Secondary issues included ICU and hospital LOS, mechanical ventilation support, development of individual organ failure and 28-day all-cause mortality.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Criteria used to define individual organ dysfunction<sup>a</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Type of dysfunction</th><th align="left">Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Cardiovascular</td><td align="left">Systolic arterial pressure &#x02264; 90 mmHg after adequate fluid resuscitation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Respiratory</td><td align="left">PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio &#x02264; 300 and, if measured, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure not suggestive of central volume overload</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hematologic</td><td align="left">Platelet count &#x02264; 100,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>or 50% drop in the past 72 hours or relevant changes in coagulation profile (INR &#x0003e; 1.5 or aPTT &#x0003e; 60 seconds)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Renal</td><td align="left">Urine output &#x0003c; 0.5 mL/kg/hour for at least 2 hours, even after fluid resuscitation or creatinine &#x0003e; 2.0 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Metabolic</td><td align="left">pH &#x0003c; 7.30 or base excess less than -5 mEq/L with plasma lactate &#x0003e; 1.5 &#x000d7; normal value</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hepatic</td><td align="left">Total bilirubin &#x0003e; 2.0 mg/dL or 35 mmol/L</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio = ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen; INR = International Normalized Ratio; aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>At the conclusion of the study, the whole database and the source documentation were independently audited to ensure the quality of the information collected, and the database was analyzed by an independent statistical company (Bioestat&#x000ed;stica, Montreal, QC, Canada).

The contradiction is that there is also a consensus that, when treating patients with sepsis, most, if not all, available strategies are time-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, information about possible strategies to be applied in the early stages of sepsis is extremely limited, as is the number of trials evaluating possible therapies this early in the disease time line. The main purpose, and probably the most interesting characteristic of the present trial, was to apply a nutritional strategy that has proven to be of great value in the management of patients with late sepsis-associated respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and is associated with an important reduction in the development of new organ failures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], early in the evolutionary stage of sepsis when no organ dysfunction has been identified and to test whether this nutritional strategy can be used to help slow the progression of the disease.</p><p>In this study, we found an association of the use of an EPA/GLA diet with reduced incidence of severe sepsis and/or septic shock. Although the mechanisms underlying the results of the present trial are unclear, there are several possible roles associated with EPA, GLA and antioxidants which, acting alone or together, may help us to understand how this diet can lead to the observed effects, among them being the regulation of AA levels in the inflammatory cell membranes, downregulation of NF-&#x003ba;B, lower production of inflammatory eicosanoids, antioxidant-mediated reduction in overall reactive oxygen species levels and a quicker recovery from inflammation due to production of resolvins and protectins, among several others.</p><p>In this trial, we used a control diet different from those used in previously published works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our control diet was not enhanced with lipids but was higher in carbohydrates and was considered a standard ICU diet. The reason for our use of that control diet was that one major focus of criticism of previous work is precisely the control diet that was used (Pulmocare; Abbott Nutrition). Maybe the main reason for such criticism is that a high-lipid enteral diet is not considered by many to be a standard diet for critically ill patients. It is a common misunderstanding that enteral formulas enriched with &#x003a9;-6 lipids such as linoleic acid (LA, or 18:2n6; for example, from corn oil) can produce upregulation of the inflammatory response and, for that reason, such formulas may not be used to feed patients with hyperinflammatory diseases. Production of AA from LA involves three key enzymatic steps: &#x00394;-6-desaturation to form 18:3n6 (GLA), followed by elongation to 20:3n6 (dihomo-GLA (DGLA)) and a &#x00394;-5-desaturation step to produce 20:4n6. Thus, LA-enriched formulas cannot worsen inflammation simply because the activity of the enzymes &#x00394;-5-desaturase and &#x00394;-6-desaturase are severely compromised during critical illness by the release of stress and catabolic hormones (for example, glucocorticoids and catecholamines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] limiting the ability to form AA despite the provision of LA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. GLA is a metabolite of LA that can bypass the decreased expression of &#x00394;-6-desaturase. Its elongation product, DGLA, is incorporated into the inflammatory cell membranes, and the formation of DGLA suppresses leukotriene biosynthesis and can be metabolized to form prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, a potent pulmonary vasodilator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. DGLA is also metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase to form 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, which inhibits the formation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>. In fact, an enteral diet enriched with GLA cannot increase AA levels in immune cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and, on the other hand, can increase anti-inflammatory activity by incorporating DGLA into the immune cell membranes. Despite all of the above-mentioned evidence, the previous criticism of other studies highlights the importance of this trial as the first one to demonstrate a positive result in terms of primary and secondary outcomes comparing the EPA/GLA diet with a standard ICU formula.</p><p>In this study, we report a reduction in both ICU and hospital LOS for patients fed a diet with EPA/GLA compared to the control population. The differences represent a mean of 6.5 additional ICU-free days and 8.9 additional hospital-free days associated with the use of the study diet. These results are in accord with previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in which EPA/GLA diets were used to treat critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, all of which reported reductions in ICU and hospital LOS. In fact, a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] associated the use of EPA/GLA with a mean of 4.3 more ICU-free days compared to patients fed a control diet. Sepsis represents an important financial burden on the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and any reduction in terms of LOS must be considered to have a potential economic impact regarding reductions in the overall cost of care.</p><p>It is important to note that the reported number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) was slightly different in the study groups with regard to the number of patients considered to have developed respiratory failures since the end of the study. The reason for that finding was that, during the 28-day follow-up period, one patient in the study group and three patients in the control group required noninvasive mechanical ventilation but did not fulfill the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio criterion for respiratory failure.</p><p>Previously published works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the present study have many relevant characteristics in common. They all used a study diet containing carbohydrates and proteins together with high levels of EPA/GLA. They all started enteral nutrition as early as possible and delivered the diet continuously using an enteral feeding pump. In a recent study (the EDEN-Omega Study) conducted by the EDEN-Omega NHLBI ARDS Network, investigators reported different findings when treating critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. They found no benefit in using a module containing EPA/GLA to treat patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and the study was stopped because of futility. Comparison of the EDEN-Omega Study with the previously published works can lead to dangerous misinterpretation of the current evidence. First and foremost, the patients enrolled in the EDEN-Omega study received a bolus of EPA/GLA twice daily, not an enteral formula containing EPA/GLA as part of it. It is uncertain whether these pharmaconutrients act differently if not provided using continuous feeding and as part of an enteral nutrition formula. Absorption of individual macronutrients (such as lipids) at the intestinal level can be drastically affected by the presence or absence of other nutrients. Additionally, it has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] that the delivery of an EPA/GLA diet by continuous feeding can produce important changes in the production of inflammatory mediators associated with modulation of plasma phospholipid levels. It is not clear whether a bolus of EPA/GLA given twice daily can provide similar changes in plasma phospholipids. Unfortunately, to date, the EDEN-Omega NHLBI ARDS Network investigators have not made publicly available the plasma phospholipid measurements of the patients included in the EDEN-Omega study, data that are of pivotal importance to allow a fair trial comparison between their trial and those previously published. Moreover, the EDEN-Omega study did not control for several other variables, including the different levels of other macronutrients (such as proteins) in the underlying diets fed to their patients, producing a huge source of bias in their data. Finally, the EDEN-Omega study was not designed as an early intervention trial, but was in fact an early versus late intervention study, whereas early enteral feeding was described as a key factor in all previous trials. The currently available nutrition guidelines continue to unanimously recommend the use of an EPA/GLA diet in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients with ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; therefore, not to use this strategy in the indicated population of patients merely on the basis of the results of an unpublished single trial in which so many important questions remain to be answered does not appear to be justifiable.</p><p>Interaction between fish oil and sepsis is very complex and variable, depending on the dose administered and probably the route of administration as well. Most of the available evidence associated with the benefits of fish oil was produced when this active pharmaconutrient was used as part of enteral nutrition formulations. However, the number of trials testing parenterally administered fish oil in a variety of clinical situations, including sepsis, is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For instance, in a recently published study using a fish oil-based lipid emulsion in patients with sepsis, Barbosa and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] demonstrated significant improvements in the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio that were similar to the effects reported with the use of enteral nutrition.</p><p>Although in the present study we have demonstrated a reduction in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory failure in the patient population nourished with EPA/GLA as compared to the control population, this was not associated with a significant reduction in mortality. The probable reason for this finding is that this study included patients with early sepsis and no organ dysfunction, a clinical situation usually associated with lower mortality rates than are found in patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The sample size of this trial was not calculated to demonstrate mortality differences, and this particular variable should be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>Some important limitations need to be considered when evaluating the results of the present study. One of the most important is that this study included only those patients in need of enteral nutrition. During the enrollment of the patients, the investigators considered this to be very relevant and to represent a limitation in terms of the number of potential patients who could be included in this trial, since most patients whom we found to be in the early stages of sepsis did not require enteral nutrition, being able to receive oral feeding. In addition, the study included only patients at the ICU, which reduced even more the number of potential patients to be included, since the majority of the patients with early sepsis are usually not at the ICU but in the general wards. As a result of these important limitations, we believe that the population of patients included in this study was somehow selected, being constituted by elderly patients, most of whom were already receiving treatment and enteral feeding at their homes because of previous limitations such as stroke and eventually developing diseases such as community-acquired pneumonia, therefore requiring hospital treatment. In addition, this study excluded patients with a BMI &#x02265; 29, and for this reason generalization of the results to the obese population of patients is not possible. Finally, it was not possible to report changes in the &#x00394; or component SOFA scores, since this trial was not designed to collect daily SOFA scores. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the observed reduction in the development of severe sepsis and/or septic shock is associated with reductions in the SOFA score over time. This association represents an important variable to be evaluated in future trials in which an EPA/GLA diet is fed to septic patients.</p><p>It will be important to produce further evidence and reproduce the present work in a more broad population of patients in the early stages of sepsis using an EPA/GLA diet, maybe as an oral supplement, and not delivering these pharmaconutrients only when an enteral feeding tube is in place.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study presents evidence that enteral nutrition with EPA/GLA and elevated antioxidants, when used in the early stages of sepsis in patients without any organ failure and in need of enteral nutrition, can play a beneficial role by slowing the progression of the disease to severe sepsis and septic shock.
