Preoxygenation before intubation has been recommended in order to decrease such complications. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)-assisted preoxygenation allows increased oxygen saturation during the intubation procedure, by applying a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent alveolar derecruitment. However, the NIV mask has to be taken off after preoxygenation to allow the passage of the tube through the mouth. The patient with hypoxaemia does not receive oxygen during this period, at risk of major hypoxaemia. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) has a potential for apnoeic oxygenation during the apnoea period following the preoxygenation with NIV. Whether application of HFNC combined with NIV is more effective at reducing oxygen desaturation during the intubation procedure compared with NIV alone for preoxygenation in patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU with acute respiratory failure remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The HFNC combined to NIV for decreasing oxygen desaturation during the intubation procedure in patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU (OPTINIV) trial is an investigator-initiated monocentre randomised controlled two-arm trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment. The OPTINIV trial randomises 50 patients with hypoxaemia requiring orotracheal intubation for acute respiratory failure to receive NIV (pressure support=10, PEEP=5, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>)=100%) combined with HFNC (flow=60&#x02005;L/min, FiO<sub>2</sub>=100%, interventional group) or NIV alone (reference group) for preoxygenation. The primary outcome is lowest oxygen saturation during the intubation procedure. Secondary outcomes are intubation-related complications, quality of preoxygenation and ICU mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study project has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee (CPP Sud-M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e). Informed consent is required. If combined application of HFNC and NIV for preoxygenation of patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU proves superior to NIV preoxygenation, its use will become standard practice, thereby decreasing hypoxaemia during the intubation procedure and potential complications related to intubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT02530957.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One strength of the study is the blinded assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other strengths are the inclusions performed around the clock, nights and weekend included as a routine clinical practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>One limitation of the study is that the operator performing intubation can be aware of the group of inclusion.

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that HFNC oxygen therapy generates a flow-dependent positive airway pressure and improves oxygenation by increasing end-expiratory lung volume,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> thus suggesting possible associated alveolar recruitment.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Optimising preoxygenation is therefore of particular importance before the intubation procedure, especially in patients with hypoxaemia needing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. However, although NIV preoxygenation is effective to reduce hypoxaemia during the intubation procedure,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> the NIV mask has to be taken off after preoxygenation in order to allow the passage of the orotracheal tube through the mouth. The association of HFNC with alveolar recruitment by NIV could be of particular interest both for increasing administration of oxygen during preoxygenation and to allow apnoeic oxygenation during the apnoea period, a time where the patient with hypoxaemia usually receives no oxygen. This period without oxygenation can last several minutes, especially when the intubation is difficult.</p><p>The OPTINIV trial is the first randomised controlled study powered to investigate the effectiveness of combined NIV and HFNC to decrease severe hypoxaemia during the intubation procedure in patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure in the ICU.</p><p>Apnoeic oxygenation is a physiological phenomenon in which, provided that a patent air passageway exists between the lungs and the exterior, the difference between the alveolar rates of oxygen removal and carbon dioxide excretion generates a negative pressure gradient of up to 20&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O that drives oxygen into the lungs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The aim of apnoeic oxygenation use throughout the intubation procedure is therefore to reduce severe hypoxaemia occurrence during the intubation procedure.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Previous studies assessed the effect of apnoeic oxygenation, with conflicting results. Apnoeic oxygenation increased the time to severe desaturation during the intubation procedure in acute lung injury in an experimental study in piglets.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Miguel-Montanes <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> compared 3&#x02005;min of preoxygenation using a face mask to 60&#x02005;L/min of HFNC in patients with mild-to-moderate hypoxaemia. With the face mask, the median lowest SpO2 during intubation was 94% vs 100% with HFNC. Vourc'h <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> found no difference on lowest arterial oxygen during intubation in patients with hypoxaemia between 60L/min of HFNC and 4&#x02005;min of preoxygenation with a face mask (92% vs 90%, p=0.44). Semler <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> performed a randomised trial in a medical ICU enrolling 150 patients. The administration of 15&#x02005;L/min nasal cannula oxygen in the apnoeic oxygenation group was not associated with significantly increased arterial oxygen saturation (from 92% in the apnoeic oxygenation group to 90% in the usual care group (p=0.16)). The discrepancies between the results of these three studies<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> could mainly be explained by the oxygen flow used for the apnoeic oxygenation group (from 15 to 60&#x02005;L/min) and the different studied populations in term of hypoxaemia. Moreover, the design of these studies differs from the design of this study, which allows to specifically study apnoeic oxygenation by HFNC simultaneously combined with NIV preoxygenation. However, this study will not conclude on the superiority or not of NIV over HFNC alone, and therefore on the best means to ensure preoxygenation.</p><p>The primary end point of the trial is the lowest oxygen saturation during the intubation procedure. The incidence of severe hypoxaemia following intubation is particularly high in the ICU, reaching up to 50%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The ability to anticipate hypoxaemia occurrence is of critical importance to prevent the development of subsequent complications. Severe hypoxaemia can lead to cardiac arrest, neurological damage or multiple organ failure.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Moreover, since we collect and report on most complications related to intubation, either severe or moderate, it may still be possible to determine the effects of combined preoxygenation on other complications.</p><p>One limitation of the study is that the operator performing intubation can be aware of the group of inclusion. However, the assessor is an independent observer, who does not know the group of inclusion. Some could highlight the risk of gastric air insufflation and aspiration related to positive airway pressure of NIV as a method of preoxygenation. However, as previously reported<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and in this study, it will be recommended to never exceed a total insufflation airway pressure (PS+PEEP) of 15&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O, which has been shown to be safe to avoid gastric air insufflation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> Moreover, adding a nasal cannula under the NIV mask may generate leaks during NIV and decrease its efficacy. However, the operator performing intubation holds the mask, which limits the leaks, and the two groups are treated similarly. Finally, given the error of measure associated with SpO2 monitors (usually around 2%) and the error associated with the oxygen blender (around 2%), one could argue that in fact the difference in SpO2 could be solely due to the devices' imprecision. However, given the randomised design of the study, this imprecision should be evenly distributed in each group.</p><p>One strength of the study is the blinded assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011298F3">figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the inclusions will be performed around the clock, nights and weekend included as a routine clinical practice.</p><p>In conclusion, the OPTINIV trial is an investigator initiated pragmatic randomised controlled trial powered to test the hypothesis that adding HFNC in combination with NIV in comparison to NIV alone allows to decrease severe hypoxaemia during the intubation procedure of patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. The OPTINIV trial will also assess the effects of combined NIV and HFNC for preoxygenation on intubation-related complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ADJ drafted the manuscript together with SJ.
