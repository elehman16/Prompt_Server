The MPCNL uses X-ray or ultrasound guidance; get the stone under the direct vision with ureterorenoscopy to remove urinary tract obstruction, in order to achieve the purpose of treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Because it has the advantages of less trauma, fewer complications, faster post-operative recovery, and shorter hospital stay, it gradually replaced the traditional open stone surgery (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In addition, MPCNL also has a high stone clearance rate. Moreover, for residual stones and recurrent stones it can give the stone twice, recognized by the majority of patients and medical personnel (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In spite of this, the difficulty of surgery is still large, requiring patients with high degree of cooperation, perioperative nursing intervention is also very important for the prognosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the comprehensive nursing intervention effect on the patients with MPCNL for the treatment of kidney stones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Total of 124 patients were selected from the Department of Urology in Zhumadian Central Hospital, HeNan, China between June 2013 and December 2014. Among them, 90 men and 34 women (average age 50.2 &#x000b1; 7.5 yr old) were included with minimum 37 years age and maximum 65 years of age. For the diagnosis of kidney stones, the patients were diagnosed by intravenous or ultrasound, and confirmed by CT if necessary. There were MPCNL indications. All cases were randomly divided into observation group and control group, with 62 cases in each group. There was no significant difference in gender, age and culture between the two groups and they were comparable (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhumadian Central Hospital. Signed written informed consents were obtained from the patients and/or guardians.</p></sec><sec><title>Operation method</title><p>After the success of the continuous epidural anesthesia, the patients were asked for lithotomy position, and then the ureteral catheter was inserted into the affected side. After its success, the body was turned to the prone position. Under ultrasound localization, in the lower edge of the rib 12, the renal pelvis was punctured with No.18 puncture needle. Further, under the guidance of zebra guide wire, the nephroscope was inserted to take stone. The procedure requires proper amount of contrast agent through the ureter, position under C arm X-ray machine monitoring, with the direction of puncture vertically in the renal parenchyma. Also it requires to establish percutaneous renal access, crush stones by holmium laser and lavage round-trip by infusion pump high pressure pulse, to take large stones with lithotomy forceps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Nursing methods</title><sec><title>Common for two groups</title><p>The two groups were given routine nursing care, humanistic care and health education. The nursing staff kept the operation room quiet and clean. After sending the patient to the operation room, nurses encouraged to bring comfort for patients, and cooperated with the doctors for patients placed in the right position. The nurses monitored the changes of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and other vital signs of the patients during the operation, and report the abnormal situation to the doctor in time. After the success of anesthesia in patients, the nurse assisted the patient to take the position of the stone to meet the need of the operation. After the reteral catheter placement, the nursing staff put down the double lower limbs of the patient and assisted him to change to the supine position, let his hands hold the head, and the nurses disaggre-gated on both sides of the patients, and assisted his reversing rolling into a prone position. The nurses help to roll into a flip position after the end of surgery. It is required for nurses to pay attention to changing body position and not let the pipe to come off, and the operation room temperature should be controlled 22&#x02013;24 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Comprehensive nursing intervention</title><p>1) Preoperative nursing: The patient was explained for the characteristics and process of the operation, the need to change the body position if necessary. The patients were allowed to watch first surgery video, and allowed to carry out the posture exercises with the guidance of the nurses. The exercise started from 30min and gradually extended to 1 h, 2, 3h. The patients can remain lithotomy position for 30 minutes and stay in the prone position for 3 hours. During the course, no abnormal signs of life mean the success of practice and training.</p><p>2) Intraoperative nursing: First of all, the nurses were trained to understand the responsibilities of the operation and to cooperate with the operation room nursing (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). [1] Body position nursing during operation was the same as above; [2] Psychological nursing during operation: If there was anxiety, tension and fear, nursing staff used humor language, smile to comfort the patients or to guide patients to relax such as deep breathing, or play music; [3] Intraoperative temperature nursing: In order to avoid the cold stimulation, in addition to adjusting the room temperature to the most suitable scope, attention was given to cover the warmth. The liquid was warmed with a constant temperature chamber and kept closer to the body&#x02019;s 35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C; [4] Intraoperative monitoring of life sign: close attention was given to the heart rate, blood pressure, respiration etc., because intraoperative postural changes, traction of operation and too long fixed position time will affect the patient&#x02019;s mood, blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Therefore it is necessary to pay close attention, if there is abnormal, it needs timely treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation index</title><p>The operation time, hospitalization time, number of cases which were operated successfully, complication, comfort (investigation of patients, with the option of comfortable or not comfortable) of two groups were compared. Further, the sleep quality, systolic pressure variation at the different time, variation of pulse and breath between the two groups after treatment, the patient&#x02019;s sleep quality and nursing satisfaction were compared.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; sleep quality was evaluated according to the subjective experience of the patients: [1] Good sleep: The patients sleep faster, feeling deep sleep, sleep time is over 7 h, after waking up feeling state of mind is good; [2] Poor sleep: Patients sleep relatively slow, feeling shallow sleep, sleep time is less than 7 hours, after waking up, and patients are in poor mental state and feel fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Processing method</title><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS 18.0 statistical software, measurement data were expressed by x&#x000b1;S with t test.

However, there is still need to pay attention to the cooperation of the operation including patients, nurses etc. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In particular, the nursing intervention is very important. Under the careful nursing, it can significantly improve patients&#x02019; comfort degree, the success rate of the operation, and shorten the operation time (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The psychological nursing in operation allows the patient to relax with not large swings in mood, because many patients do not understand the operation process and get worried about the pain and surgical effect operation brings. In that case, the medical staff needs to explain to the patient, or let the patient observe surgery video, understand the prognosis and the importance of the coordination of the operation as well as the advantages of the operation. At the time of surgery, the nurse can talk with the patient, or play music to distract attention. In addition, washing the stone in the surgery will take away a lot of temperature, so heating fluid to maintain the body temperature of patients is also very important, it will make patients feel more comfortable in the surgery (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The study showed that the operation time of patients in the control group was significantly longer than those of the observation group.

The sleep quality of the observation group was significantly better than that of the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).

The diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, respiration after anesthesia, intra-operative 30min, at the end of the operation, and postoperative 30min of two groups had significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), among which the fluctuation range of the control group was higher than that of the observation group, while the observation group was relatively stable. The research suggested that the comprehensive nursing intervention is beneficial to the stability of the vital signs of the patients during the operation and after the operation.</p><p>Nursing satisfaction is an important index to measure the quality of nursing care for patients with nursing intervention.
