It is also an effective treatment for operative pain and blunts autonomic, somatic, and endocrine responses. Till recently, bupivacaine 0.5% heavy was the only drug used for spinal anesthesia after the discontinuation of Lidocaine's intrathecal use. Bupivacaine is available as a racemic mixture of its enantiomers, dextrobupivacaine and levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine (S-1-butyl-2-piperidylformo-2&#x02019;, 6&#x02019;-xylidide hydrochloride), the pure S (-) enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine, is a new long-acting local anesthetic that has recently been introduced in India because of its significantly decreased cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] levobupivacaine seems to be an attractive alternative to bupivacaine.</p><p>Conventionally, the dose of levobupivacaine used for spinal anesthesia is 15 mg.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although 15 mg isobaric levobupivacaine dose provides an adequate sensory and motor block for most surgical procedures, the duration of sensory blockade and motor blockade is shorter and is more hemodynamic stable when compared to hyperbaric bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Intrathecal adjuvants are added primarily to increase the duration of analgesia. It would be very advantageous to have early ambulation, hemodynamic stability, and prolonged analgesia in most clinical settings, particularly in day-case surgery. We did the study to assess the feasibility of achieving this using tramadol as an intrathecal adjuvant to isobaric levobupivacaine.</p><p>Fentanyl is the most common opioid which has been studied as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia. We chose tramadol as we wanted to find out if it would be a good alternative in situations where fentanyl is not freely available due to licensing issues with fentanyl and also because fentanyl is a short-acting opioid.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose tramadol as an intrathecal adjuvant to isobaric levobupivacaine in terms of:</p><p>

Thus, both the observer and the subjects were blinded to the study drugs. Patients were placed in left lateral position. Under strict aseptic precautions, lumbar puncture was performed at the level of L3&#x02013;L4 through a midline approach using 25 G or 26 G Quincke spinal needle and study drug was injected after the confirmation of needle tip in the subarachnoid space by free flow of cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>The onset of sensory blockade was assessed using ether-soaked gauze for every 2 min till complete loss of sensation at T8.

Bradycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats/min and was treated with IV atropine 0.6 mg. Patients in whom there was inadequate spinal blockade or spinal anesthesia failed or in cases where spinal anesthesia wears off before completion of surgery general anesthesia was to be administered and such cases were to be excluded. In our study, we did not have to administer general anesthesia to any of the patients as rescue anesthetic plan. Patients were monitored in the postoperative period for hemodynamic changes. Verbal numerical rating score was recorded every 15 min postoperatively; the time when the patient first complained of pain and if the verbal numerical rating scale score was &#x02265;4, injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg was administered in 100 ml normal saline as rescue analgesia. Time interval from onset of sensory block to requirement of first rescue analgesia was recorded as the duration of analgesia. Further analgesia was given as per the institutional acute postoperative pain service protocol. Duration of motor blockade was assessed by monitoring modified Bromage scale every 15 min postoperatively till the patient was able to completely move both the lower limbs (Bromage score 0). Complications such as nausea or vomiting and shivering were recorded. Shivering was treated by covering the patient and using a patient warmer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>The study parameters were defined as follows</title><p>

We studied the onset of sensory and motor blockade and duration of sensory and motor blockade. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the efficacy of tramadol as an adjuvant to intrathecal isobaric levobupivacaine for elective infraumbilical surgeries.</p><p>Long-acting local anesthetics are used in subarachnoid block to increase the duration of anesthesia. Adjuvants increase the duration of analgesia. Levobupivacaine has been recently introduced in India. Levobupivacaine has been introduced into clinical practice because of its lower cardiac and central nervous system toxic effects. Bardsley <italic>et al</italic>., Morrison <italic>et al</italic>., and Huang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] concluded that levobupivacaine, the pure S (&#x02212;) enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine, a new long-acting local anesthetic, has significantly decreased cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity compared to racemic bupivacaine.</p><p>We have used tramadol as intrathecal adjuvant in our study. Tramadol exists as the racemic (1:1) mixture of the (+) and (&#x02212;) enantiomer. It has dual mechanism of action. The (+) enantiomer of tramadol contributes to analgesia by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, the (&#x02212;) enantiomer by inhibiting the reuptake of noradrenaline, and the O-desmethyl metabolite by binding with relative high affinity (compared to tramadol) to the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor. The monoaminergic activity of tramadol increases the inhibitory activity of the descending pain pathways thus resulting in a suppression of nociceptive transmission at the spinal level.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In our study, isobaric levobupivacaine 0.5% 3 ml with tramadol 10 mg as an adjuvant (3.2 ml) Group LT and levobupivacaine 0.5% 3 ml with 0.2 ml (3.2 ml) Group LS was administered intrathecally.
