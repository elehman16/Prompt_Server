MI was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Depression was developed by 4-week chronic mild stress (CMS). Behavior measurement was done before and during the experiment. Electrophysiology study in vivo and Western blot analysis were carried on after 4 weeks of CMS. After 4 weeks of CMS, depression-like behaviors were observed in the MI, depression, and model groups, and chronic fluoxetine administration could significantly improve those behaviors (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 vs model group). Fluoxetine significantly increased the ventricular fibrillation threshold compared with the model group (20.20&#x000b1;9.32 V vs 14.67&#x000b1;1.85 V, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).

Kv4 channels produce rapidly activating and inactivating currents such as I<sub>to</sub>, which mediates the early repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Kv4.2 is predominant in rat heart, and connexin 43 (Cx43) is the predominant protein forming gap junctions in the mammalian ventricular myocardium and is essential for normal conduction of action potential and maintaining a normal electrical coupling in the heart Thus, these two molecules are both important in the genesis of arrhythmia (for details, see &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d;).

The open field test was used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior by measuring the spontaneous exploratory behavior of animals in aversive environments.<xref rid="b13-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Similar to the reduction in sucrose intake, the exploratory activity was reduced in the MI group, depression group, and model group in our study. This indicated an increase in depression-like behavior after MI in model rats. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine could significantly improve the depression-like symptoms in post-MI depression rats. This was consistent with previous clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of fluoxetine on cardiac electrophysiology in post-MIrats</title><p>MAP demonstrates how the local electroactivity of myocardial cell mass in extracellular recordings and its waveforms could reflect the morphology and phases of the transmembrane action potentials, especially the phases of depolarization. In recent years, MAP has been widely applied in studies on the mechanism of arrhythmic occurrence, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic drugs, and other fields.</p><p>In the present study, we found that both depression and MI could significantly prolong the MAPD<sub>90</sub> and ERP and lower VFT in the peri-infarct zone. This prolongation caused by depression may be explained by the following aspects:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Disturbances in autonomic regulation and elevated sympathetic activity lead to increased resting heart rate, impaired baroreflex sensitivity, and reduced heart rate variability. Sympathetic hyperactivity increases the density of local catecholamine in myocardium, thus activating L-type calcium channel, and finally influences cardiac repolarization.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis hyperactivity and elevated cortisol levels influence the function and expression of L-type calcium channel, sodium&#x02013;calcium exchanger, and transient outward potassium channel (I<sub>to</sub>).<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-6 and interferon gamma affects the expression and function of ion channels.<xref rid="b26-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p>All of these three aspects of changes, which can be caused by MI as well, ultimately influence cardiac repolarization and lead to the prolongation of MAPD<sub>90</sub> and ERP.</p><p>In the model group, MAPD<sub>90</sub> and ERP in the peri-infarct zone were prolonged compared with the MI group, suggesting the potential cumulative effect of depression and MI on cardiac electrophysiology. This may be one of the reasons why the risks of mortality and cardiovascular events are higher in CHD patients with depression than in those without. Fluoxetine did not significantly reverse the prolongation of MAPD<sub>90</sub> or ERP but induced a rise of VFT in model rats. Thus, fluoxetine may reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in post-MI depression rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of fluoxetine on the expression of Kv4.2 and Cx43</title><p>In this study, we reported that Kv4.2 expression was significantly reduced in myocardial cells in model rats, which could be reversed by fluoxetine. The expression of Cx43 was reduced in any MI group, and the fluoxetine did not show marked improvement.</p><p>Kv4 channels produce rapidly activating and inactivating currents such as I<sub>to</sub>, which mediate the early repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. And Kv4.2 is predominant in rat heart. Kv4.2 channels, along with Kv channel- interacting protein 2, may represent the molecular correlate for I<sub>to</sub> current gradient across the RV myocardium, and may be a cause of an atypical anterior J wave pattern associated with sudden cardiac death.<xref rid="b28-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Reduction in expression of Kv4.2 and I<sub>to</sub> current density will affect the repolarization of myocardial cells and hence increase vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia, as indicated by decreased heart rate variability and increased sensitivity to ventricular fibrillation.<xref rid="b29-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus, we suppose that the downregulation of Kv4.2 could potentially contribute to the cardiac electrophysiology change of depression patients, and fluoxetine may prevent the reduction, which consequently decreases the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia in post-MI depression patients.</p><p>Cx43, the predominant protein forming gap junctions in the mammalian ventricular myocardium, is essential for normal conduction of action potential and to maintain a normal electrical coupling in the heart.<xref rid="b31-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It has been known that the expression and degradation, the distribution, and the density of Cx43 play an important role in modulating the magnitude of cell-to-cell electrical coupling in the heart. Acute ischemia induced by MI can result in marked reduction and dephosphorylation of Cx43, which may lead to delayed myocardial electrical activity and increased anisotropic conduction, prompting ventricular arrhythmias.<xref rid="b32-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-dddt-9-763" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, model rats showed decreased expression of Cx43 but were not improved by fluoxetine. Thus, Cx43 may not be the target protein of fluoxetine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in our study. First, because the electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated under an open-chest anesthetized state in our study, each parameter may be influenced by anesthesia. Second, although we measured the MADP, ERP, and VFT of heart in vivo, we did not carry on 24-hour Holter ambulatory ECG monitoring to observe the difference in prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias among different groups. Third, we did not simultaneously measure the MAPD and ERP of the normal peri-infarct zone and infarct area, because in the in vivo study, these zones were usually located at the lateral and posterior walls, and it is very difficult to record the MAP without altering the position and status of the heart.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MI rats exhibited an increase in depression-like behavior, and fluoxetine could significantly decrease the depression-like behavior in post-MI depression rats. The susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias was increased in depression and post-MI depression rats, and fluoxetine may reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in post-MI depression rats and thus improve the prognosis. This was consistent with previous clinical studies. The decrease of ventricular arrhythmia induced by fluoxetine may be related in part to the upregulation of Kv4.2. Further molecular mechanism investigation is needed in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81200139), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei (2011CDC157, 2014CFB793, 2014CFA061), and the National Key Basic Research Development Program of China (The &#x0201c;973&#x0201d; Program, Grant Number: 2012CB518604).
