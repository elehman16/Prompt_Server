Patients of chronic urticaria suffer from the morbidity that arise from irritable itch and weals and are also subjected to a huge antihistamine pill burden. The patients are at constant apprehension of this temperamental disease which at times waxes and wanes.

Autoreactive urticaria is a subgroup of chronic urticaria containing circulating functional autoantibodies and AST effectiveness was determined in this subgroup.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was designed as a single-centre, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial. Institutional Ethics Committee permission was obtained prior to the onset of the study and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The trial bears the registration number of CTRI/2012/12/003204. The duration of study was from March 2011 to March 2012. Adult patients (&#x0003e;18 years) of either sex suffering from chronic urticaria attending the Dermatology out-patient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Eastern India were included. The operational definition of chronic urticaria was taken as itching and weals occurring daily or near daily (&#x02265;3 times/week) for &#x02265;6 weeks.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Pregnant and lactating women, patients suffering from immunosuppression due to drug or disease, advanced diseases of vital organs, inability to come for weekly follow-ups, addicted to alcohol or other substance abuse, machinery operators, vehicle drivers and in whom sleep/wake cycle alteration could be an issue were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Visits</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Screening visit</title><p>At the screening visit, patients were enrolled based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, written informed consent was taken. A run-in period of two days was given prior to the initiation of therapy,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] when patients were asked to discontinue any antihistamines they had been using. A thorough clinical examination was done to note any associated co-morbidities and relevant investigations were done for their confirmation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Baseline visit</title><p>Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed in all study subjects and the result recorded after 30 min (as detailed below). Successive eligible patients were randomized into either treatment arms using a computer generated random number table in 1:1 ratio irrespective of the ASST status. The patients received autologous serum therapy or normal saline as placebo in either treatment group. Cetirizine tablets (5mg) (Brand name: CIT-Z, Manufacturer: Square Pharmaceuticals, Central Medical Store supply, supplied free of cost to the patient from institutional pharmacy) were dispensed to patients in both treatment groups and they were instructed to consume them in an on-demand basis (experiencing wealing or itching) but not more than 1 tablet per day. Any subject experiencing intolerable symptoms of urticaria were instructed to contact the investigator.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>At each successive weekly follow-up, AST or sterile water was given as per randomization for eight consecutive weeks.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] At all these eight follow-ups, the effectiveness and safety parameters were noted. The AST therapy was then discontinued and the patients were followed-up for improvement or recurrence of symptoms weekly for the next four weeks. The patients were again asked to come at the end of 24 weeks post randomization. Cetirizine was administered throughout the study period in an on-demand basis even after completion of AST injections. At baseline and at every follow-up effectiveness and safety parameters were noted. Prednisolone tablet (1mg/kg body wt) was kept as rescue medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Autologous serum skin test</title><p>Five ml venous blood of the patient was drawn with a sterile, disposable syringe from the antecubital vein in sterile BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; (BD, NJ USA) for serum collection. The blood was subjected to centrifugation using centrifuge machine (R-8C laboratory centrifuge, REMI laboratory instruments, Mumbai, India) at the rate of 2000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. 0.05 ml of the serum thus separated was injected immediately intra-dermally into the patients&#x02019; left flexor forearm 2 inches below the antecubital crease and 0.05 ml sterile normal saline as negative control into right forearm using 31G sterile disposable 1ml BD insulin syringe (BD, NJ USA). The bevelled end of the needle was kept in the upwards direction producing a palpable bleb on the skin. Areas which were involved in spontaneous wealing within last 48 h were avoided. A reading of the weal was taken after 30 min. Patients having weal of more than 1.5mm perpendicular diameter than that of control were considered to be suffering from autoreactive urticaria (ASST positive).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Autologous serum therapy</title><p>Two ml of the fresh serum separated from the patients&#x02019; blood (as stated above) was given deep IM into the upper arm for nine successive weeks (baseline and initial eight follow-up visits).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Blinding</title><p>Five ml blood was drawn from all patients irrespective of randomization; serum so separated was injected into the patient in the AST group whereas the patient in the placebo group received normal saline in syringes made opaque by adhesive tape (Leucoplast, Beiersdorf India Pvt. Ltd., Ponda, Goa, India). Thus, all patients were blinded regarding the treatment they received as all of them had their blood drawn and injections given in the same amount and in a similar fashion. The evaluator who assessed the effectiveness and safety parameters at baseline and at follow-ups was another dermatologist who was seated in a separate room and not involved in randomization, drawing, centrifuging, or injection of serum/placebo making the trial double-blind.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Effectiveness parameters</title><p>The primary outcome measures for effectiveness were Urticaria activity score (UAS)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Urticaria total severity score (TSS).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] UAS quantifies disease activity depending on the weal number and size [0: &#x0003c;10 small weals (diameter &#x0003c;3 cm), 1: 10-50 small weals or &#x0003c;10 large weals (diameter &#x0003e;3 cm), 2: &#x0003e;50 small weals or 10-50 large weals, 3: almost whole body covered] and the itch severity score (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). TSS is calculated from the number and size of weals, intensity of pruritus, duration of persistence of lesions, frequency of appearance of lesions and frequency of antihistamine use, with each parameter having a score of 0-3, maximum score being 18. TSS is a more holistic parameter than UAS as it reflects the pill burden along with disease activity; however UAS being simpler to use is more commonly used by dermatologists.</p><p>The pill burden was calculated separately using a score (0-none/week, 1 = less than once or once/week, 2 = 2-3 times/week, 3 = daily or almost daily/week) recorded at every visit. The secondary effectiveness parameters were Patients&#x02019; global assessment of disease activity improvement and Physicians&#x02019; global assessment of disease activity improvement, both recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (0: No improvement, 1: Mild improvement, 2: Moderate improvement, 3: marked improvement, 4: Excellent improvement).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These parameters were assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 24 weeks following randomization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Safety parameters</title><p>Vital signs and spontaneously reported adverse events were assessed at every week of follow-up.

This was calculated considering a conventional trial, to detect a difference of two in TSS between groups, with 80% power and 5% probability of type 1 error, assuming a standard deviation of 3.5 for this parameter and considering possible 20% dropouts. Continuous variables were compared within group by paired <italic>t</italic> test and between groups by independent samples <italic>t</italic> test. For comparison of unpaired and paired non-parametric data, Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test were employed respectively. Friedman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out with non-parametric data for within group repeated measures comparisons, followed by post-hoc Dunn's test. Categorical data were compared between groups by Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as applicable. MedCalc version 11.6 [Mariakerke, Belgium: MedCalc Software, 2011] and GraphPad Prism version 5 [San Diego, California: GraphPad Software Inc., 20057] software were used for statistical analysis.</p><p>Effectiveness analysis was done on modified intention-to-treat basis with subjects reporting for at least one post-baseline follow-up visits.

In recent times antibody to high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI) is identified and is found to degranulate the mast cell by crosslinking the IgE receptors. This entity is regarded as autoreactive urticaria and is found to prevail in 27-61% of chronic urticaria.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study population, 40.5% was found to be suffering from autoreactive urticaria. The gold standard for diagnosing the antibodies to Fc&#x003b5;RI is basophil histamine release and the closest <italic>in-vivo</italic> analogue of it is autologous skin test (ASST).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Degranulation leads to release of both pre-formed and newly formed mediators like histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, cytokines, proteases, etc., The pharmacotherapy for urticaria rests on two important pillars; one being neutralizing the effect of products of degranulation and the other is to prevent degranulation. Antihistamines and leukotriene inhibitors, are till date the mainstay for urticaria management which primarily target two of the many mediators and thus at times insufficient in controlling urticaria. There are times when immunosuppressive agents (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, adalimumab etc.) are needed for controlling urticaria symptoms and they aim to avert degranulation by preventing antibody formation. The use of these agents is limited by virtue of their side-effect profile(s) and/or by their prohibitory cost.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Chronic urticaria is a disease with unpredictable course and the treatment is continued till the disease goes into remission. The need for newer therapeutic modality to supplement the antihistamines and leukotriene inhibitors is long felt and any adjuvant therapy that can reduce the pill-burden while achieving symptom free period is welcome by the patients and physicians alike. Our study explored the long forgotten art of autologous whole blood therapy with some modification. The use of serum in place of whole blood is the modification that has been used by Bajaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Whole blood therapy had been tried any many autoimmune diseases including pemphigus,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] severe dry eye[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (due to Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, etc) and diseases like viral illness like herpes, cancer, allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Potential of whole blood in the treatment of urticaria was documented by Fleck M[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Stuabach <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in separate studies and later use of serum in the treatment of urticaria was highlighted by Bajaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The plausible mechanism of action of AST was thought be induction of anti-idiotypes, which have recently been shown to inhibit the function of disease-inducing antibodies in pemphigus and also to shift the Th2 cytokine profile to Th1 in ASST+ patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The present study revealed that AST has enormous potential in the treatment of urticaria. The symptoms of urticaria showed significant reduction by 5<sup>th</sup> week of initiation of therapy and the control was far better than what could be achieved by on-demand antihistamine use. The reduction in the symptom is accompanied by reduction in pill-burden and decrease in TSS score.</p><p>The reduction in pill-burden gives a sense of well-being that is reflected in the improvement of quality of life (measured by DLQI) which was found to be significant in those receiving AST. The improvement that was evident from 5<sup>th</sup> week of therapy continued even at six months which speaks for itself the usefulness of this therapeutic modality.</p><p>Chronic urticaria patients with a positive ASST (autoreactive subgroup) are more likely to be associated with HLA DR4, to have autoimmune thyroid disease, a more prolonged disease course and may be recalcitrant to H1-antihistamine treatment than those with a negative ASST.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The autoreactive category of patients (40.5%) in our study was higher than that observed by Godse from Mumbai (26.67%)[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and lower than Bajaj from Allahabad (49.5%).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>We found that improvement in urticaria symptoms were evident in both autoreactive and non-autoreactive urticaria patients but those with autoreactive urticaria required more time to experience the benefit of AST. It should be focused that in autoreactive urticaria, a subgroup of urticaria otherwise refractory to conventional therapy, AST has proved itself as an excellent adjuvant therapy. The goal of therapy in chronic urticaria is to maintain a symptom free period and to ensure that the treatment is not associated with least hazards and monetary burden.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with chronic urticaria, AST is a useful adjunct which reduces the pill burden and improves the quality of life. The effect of nine weekly injections of autologous serum was found to persist even four months after cessation of therapy. Autoreactive urticaria patients also benefited from this method and thus AST finds its place in the therapeutic armamentarium of clinicians treating chronic urticaria.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p><bold>What is new?</bold></p><p>Autologous serum therapy (AST) is a useful adjunct to antihistamines in chronic unticaria.
