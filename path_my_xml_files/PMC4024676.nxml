However, it may be associated with significant patient anxiety and discomfort and carries risk of complications such as endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and traumatic cataract.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] As the number of intravitreal pharmacologic agents with sustained delivery systems increase, many patients will require ongoing treatments with monthly or near-monthly injections. Therefore, an ocular anesthesia that will minimize patient discomfort and risk of complication is important to consider when using intravitreally administered drugs.</p><p>Numerous methods of local anesthesia for intravitreal injection have been compared including peribulbar and subconjunctival anesthetic injections as well as the use of anesthetic eye drops, gels, and anesthetic-soaked pledgets.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Today, no method of topical anesthesia for intravitreal injection administration has been proven to make the patient comfortable yet. Levobupivacaine is the isomer of bupivacaine and it is routinely used to provide regional anesthesia. In the current literature, there is no study evaluating the anesthetic effectiveness of topical levobupivacaine for intravitreal injections.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy of topical application of levobupivacaine 0.75% and proparacaine 0.5% in patients undergoing intravitreal drug administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective and randomized study compared the anesthetic effectiveness of Group 1: levobupivacaine 0.75% and Group 2: proparacaine 0.5% for intravitreal injections. The study was carried out at Kirikkale University Hospital. The research was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written informed consent prior to their participation. The study was done in adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All patients who were scheduled to receive intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, Inc.) or triamcinolone acetonide (Kenacort; Bristol, MS) for one eye were evaluated for inclusion into the study. Patients were excluded if they had a history of past ocular surgery or intravitreal injection, a history of thromboembolic events, or a previously known allergic response to the topical anesthetics to be used.</p><p>Patients approved for the study were randomized to one of the two treatment groups. The anesthetic was administered by one of two nurses both having been trained in and experienced with the technique. Two drops of topical anesthetic were applied each time. All intravitreal injections were performed in the supine position under sterile conditions. The eye and the skin around it were washed three times by 4% povidone &#x02014; iodine solution and then dried with sterile gauze. A sterile ophthalmic drape was then used to move the eyelashes away from the ocular surface. A sterile speculum was used to make sure the eyelids remain open. Four percent of povidone &#x02014; iodine was again applied to the conjunctiva. Calipers were used to measure the injection site at 4 mm from the limbus, where ranibizumab or triamcinolone acetonide were injected intravitreally. Each time, the same ophthalmic surgeon (K&#x000d6;) was invited into the treatment room, with the anesthetic concealed, and performed the intravitreal injection. All injections were performed using a straight injection technique with a 30-gauge needle. Mild pressure was applied with a swabstick over the injection site to reduce vitreal reflux and subconjunctival hemorrhage. Three drops of antibiotic was applied at the end of the procedure.</p><p>Immediately following the injection, a study coordinator explained the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and asked the subject the level of pain he or she experienced during the injection. The VAS scale is commonly used for the evaluation of ocular pain severity and relief. Those who could not adequately visualize the scale were prompted to vocalize a number from 0 to 100. A separate pain scale was employed to record physician-perceived pain. The Wong-Baker FACES scale [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] was chosen primarily for its ease of use. It has been studied as an observer scale and has prior use in ophthalmic analgesia. The specialist recorded his perception of the subjects&#x02019; pain experience shortly after the procedure.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Visual analog scale for pain</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-198-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-198-g002"/></fig><p>Demographic and procedural characteristics between groups were compared using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis as appropriate. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the outcomes.

Currently, no method of topical anesthesia prior to intravitreal injection administration has been proven to eliminate pain completely. In PubMed-based search of the current literature, although the efficacy of topical proparacaine has been well documented to date, we were unable to find any studies on the use of levobupivacaine as a topical anesthetic in intravitreal injection procedures.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy of two topical anesthetic agents used in intravitreal injection by comparing the patients&#x02019; subjective pain evaluations and surgeon-perceived pain scores. Both topical levobupivacaine and proparacaine provided satisfactory analgesia during the procedure. The mean VAS pain score in the proparacaine group was significantly lower than that in the levobupivacaine group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between levobupivacaine and proparacaine groups for mean Wong-Baker FACES scores.</p><p>Davis <italic>et al</italic>. have determined that the use of topical proparacaine drops, compared to 4% lidocaine solution or 3.5% lidocaine gel, provided a very effective and cost-effective anesthesia during office-based intravitreal injections.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a study by Blaha <italic>et al</italic>., proparacaine drops had the lowest average combined pain score associated with the intravitreal injection.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Cintra <italic>et al</italic>. also compared topical proparacaine drops, 2% xylocaine subconjunctival injection, and peribulbar injection of 2% xylocaine for anesthesia before intravitreal injection in 60 patients. They reported no significant difference in pain scores between topical drops and subconjunctival injection for both the injection-related pain scores and the entire procedure pain scores.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Levobupivacaine has been introduced into clinical practice within the last few years. As a result of its lower cardiac and neurotoxicity compared to racemic bupivacaine, anesthetists feel safer working with levobupivacaine, than with bupivacaine. In this study, we found that although both anesthetics are effective, pain reported by patients during the injection was less in the proparacaine group. Surgeon-perceived pain scores were similar between the two groups. There were also no differences between the two groups in postoperative corneal epithelial defects, indicating a similar iatrogenic effect of both drugs.</p><p>According to the results of our study, we may conclude that topical proparacaine 0.5% was more effective than topical levobupivacaine in preventing pain during intravitreal injections. No difference was observed in corneal epithelial toxicity between the groups during the study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
