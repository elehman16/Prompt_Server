Anagrelide is used in the treatment of ET, where it has been shown to reduce platelet count. Anagrelide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, and previous studies of the effect of food on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of anagrelide were conducted prior to the identification of the active metabolite, 3-hydroxyanagrelide.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of food and caffeine on the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and its active metabolite, 3-hydroxyanagrelide, to monitor electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters following drug administration, and to document the relationship between palpitations, ECG changes and caffeine intake</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-five healthy subjects who received 1&#x000a0;mg of anagrelide following either a 10-h fast or within 30&#x000a0;min of a standardized breakfast, including two cups of coffee, were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Time to maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of anagrelide was 4.0&#x000a0;h in the fed and 1.5&#x000a0;h in the fasted group (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05); similar results were observed for 3-hydroxyanagrelide. The mean C<sub>max</sub> of anagrelide was 4.45&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.32&#x000a0;ng/mL and 5.08&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.99&#x000a0;ng/mL in the fed/caffeine and fasted groups, respectively; peak concentrations were higher for 3-hydroxyanagrelide in both the fed/caffeine and fasted groups. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were headache (60&#x000a0;%) and palpitations (40&#x000a0;%). There were no serious AEs and all ECGs were normal, although significant reductions in PR interval, QRS length and QT interval were observed in both groups. Heart rate increased after anagrelide administration in both fed/caffeine and fasted states (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01); however, increased heart rate was significantly more frequent in the fed/caffeine state than in the fasted state (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for heart rate increase in the first hour after drug administration). There was a trend towards a greater heart rate increase in subjects reporting palpitations than in those without (mean heart rate&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD at 1&#x000a0;h: 10.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.4 vs. 8.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.4&#x000a0;beats/min [<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35]; at 4&#x000a0;h: 12.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7.5 vs. 9.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.8&#x000a0;beats/min [p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10], respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that food/caffeine delayed absorption of anagrelide. Anagrelide was generally well tolerated and had small effects on ECG parameters and heart rate. Caffeine may be implicated in a higher increase in heart rate and increased frequency of palpitations observed following administration of anagrelide with food/caffeine versus fasting.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] characterized by a sustained elevation in platelet count (thrombocytosis) and megakaryocyte hyperplasia. Anagrelide is used in the treatment of ET, where it has been shown to reduce platelet count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and may, therefore, decrease the incidence of thrombohaemorrhagic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that anagrelide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and produces the active metabolite 6,7-dichloro-3-hydroxy-1,5-dihydro-imidazol[2,1-b] quinazolin-2-one (3-hydroxyanagrelide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Caffeine is a known substrate of CYP1A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the possible effects of the constituents of a normal high-fat breakfast with coffee on the rate and extent of absorption of anagrelide, as well as the rate and extent of formation of the active metabolite, was considered worthy of investigation.</p><p>Clinical experience has shown that palpitations are one of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) associated with anagrelide use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The palpitations are usually benign and non-arrhythmia-related and tend to abate over time, with lower incidences reported during long-term therapy compared with the initial treatment phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is of particular importance with regard to 3-hydroxyanagrelide, as it has been shown to be a potent phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitor. PDE inhibitors are associated with positive inotropy and vasodilation and may, therefore, result in tachycardia and palpitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the present study, when assessing the safety and tolerability of anagrelide in the fed/caffeine and fasted state, it was considered of interest to include the monitoring of cardiac activity by means of heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. It was hoped that by including these assessments an insight into the relationship between anagrelide metabolism, palpitations, ECG changes, and food and caffeine intake would be afforded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy Caucasian subjects aged between 18 and 40&#x000a0;years were eligible for inclusion.

Subjects were required to be non&#x02013;smokers (or have stopped smoking at least 6&#x000a0;weeks prior to study start). All subjects had negative HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, and no clinically significant or relevant abnormalities of medical history, physical examination and ECG, or clinical or laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis). All subjects provided written informed consent prior to entering the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase I, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study, which was approved by the ethics committee at Guy&#x02019;s Hospital, London, UK and appropriate local ethics committees, and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Subjects were restricted from strenuous exercise and consuming alcohol, grapefruit, caffeine or xanthine for 48&#x000a0;h prior to, and for the duration of, each study period. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment sequences and stratified by sex: treatment in a fasted state followed by treatment in a fed state, or treatment in a fed state followed by treatment in a fasted state. The two treatment periods were separated by at least 3&#x000a0;days. Subjects received a single oral dose of anagrelide 1&#x000a0;mg either following a fast of at least 10&#x000a0;h or within 30&#x000a0;min of a standardized high-fat breakfast that contained 150, 250 and 500&#x02013;600&#x000a0;cal from protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively, as well as two cups of black coffee, each containing 58.8&#x000a0;mg of caffeine. Following dosing, subjects were not permitted to lie down for 4&#x000a0;h, and were discharged from the unit 24&#x000a0;h after dosing.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and its active metabolite 3-hydroxyanagrelide (particularly its rate of formation) following administration in fed/caffeine and fasted states. The secondary objectives included assessment of the safety and tolerability of anagrelide when administered in fed/caffeine or fasted states and the determination of the individual levels of CYP1A2 expression by measurement of the plasma caffeine:caffeine metabolite ratio and evaluation of its relationship to observed 3-hydroxyanagrelide exposure.</p><p>The study was conducted at Guy&#x02019;s Drug Research Unit in London, UK.

The 4-h post-dose sample was also used for determination of individual expression levels of CYP1A2 by measuring the ratio between caffeine and its metabolite, paraxanthine. Plasma concentrations were determined by liquid/liquid extraction followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and detection by tandem mass spectrometry. There were eight quality control samples used per test with concentration ranges of 0.05&#x02013;20&#x000a0;ng/mL for anagrelide and 0.1&#x02013;40&#x000a0;ng/mL for 3-hydroxyanagrelide, using a sample aliquot volume of 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L. The concentration levels were 0.15, 8, 17.5 and 35&#x000a0;ng/mL for anagrelide and 70&#x000a0;ng/mL for 3-hydroxyanagrelide (the highest concentration for each agent was diluted one in two before analysis). The upper limits of quantification of the analytical method were 20&#x000a0;ng/mL for anagrelide and 40&#x000a0;ng/mL for 3-hydroxyanagrelide. The lower limits of quantification were 0.05&#x000a0;ng/mL for anagrelide and 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL for 3-hydroxyanagrelide.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration data using WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Professional version 4.01 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: time to reach the maximum (peak) plasma concentration following drug administration (t<sub>max</sub>), maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>), apparent half-life of the terminal elimination phase (t<sub>&#x000bd;z</sub>), lag time before the first measurable plasma concentration (t<sub>lag</sub>) and apparent half-life of the absorption phase (t<sub>&#x000bd;abs</sub>).

The influence of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> and t<sub>&#x000bd;abs</sub> for anagrelide and 3-hydroxyanagrelide was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a two-way crossover design (WinNonlin). The sequence effect was tested using the subject-within-sequence effect, and all other effects were tested using the residual error of the model. All subjects for whom plasma concentration data were available in both the fasted and fed/caffeine states were included in the analysis. The parameters were log-transformed prior to analysis. Average bioequivalence was assessed according to whether or not the lower and upper 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric means lay within the range 0.80&#x02013;1.25.

In this study, anagrelide was shown to be rapidly absorbed after oral administration in fasted subjects, but absorption was significantly delayed and C<sub>max</sub> was slightly reduced in subjects who had received food/caffeine. Furthermore, overall exposure to anagrelide differed between the fed and fasted states.

In our study, the median peak plasma concentration was significantly delayed by food intake. It is possible that this effect of food intake, similar to the delayed-release formulation, might reduce the incidence of AEs. On the other hand, the trend towards an increased incidence of palpitations in the fed/caffeine state versus the fasted state could be related to the ingestion of caffeine with the meal, although food and caffeine could present an opposite effect on the appearance of AEs. Regarding caffeine, the scientific literature is not conclusive on the relationship between caffeine and palpitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

In contrast, a recent observational study suggests that regular coffee consumption is associated with reduced arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this study, the increase in heart rate was slightly higher in the fed/caffeine group, who also tended to present with palpitations more frequently. The small increase in cardiac inotropism and vasodilation and decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may account for this adverse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the Medical Research Council Primary Thrombocythaemia-1 trial, with a median follow-up of 39&#x000a0;months, palpitations were the only cardiac event more common in the anagrelide&#x02013;aspirin arm than in the hydroxycarbamide&#x02013;aspirin arm (16.6&#x000a0;% vs. 1.7&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

However, the possibility that the effect of anagrelide on cardiac rhythm is more pronounced in elderly patients cannot be excluded.</p><p>The data suggest that further studies to better define the relationship between caffeine, anagrelide and palpitations are warranted. The present study was not specifically designed to test the effect of caffeine on AEs and only the combination of food and caffeine has been investigated. Although a standard breakfast was used, food and caffeine could have opposite effects regarding the appearance of AEs. However, our results show that, compared with anagrelide taken in the fasted state, intake with food and coffee produced lower and delayed peak concentrations in blood. Despite this, heart rate and ECG changes were more frequent in the fed/caffeine group. Until further data are acquired, a reduction in caffeine intake may prove to be a worthwhile strategy in patients receiving anagrelide who report palpitations. Other potential non-cardiac causes of palpitations, such as stress/anxiety, alcohol and over-the-counter or prescription medications should also be explored.</p><p>While the reduction in QRS length seen with anagrelide was minimal and did not exceed the normal range, QRS shortening has also been seen with other positive ionotropic agents, such as catecholamines. This effect has been explained by greater synchrony in the onset of activation between different regions of the ventricle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that the effect seen with anagrelide may be intraventricular. The small reduction of QT interval observed with anagrelide has also been described with the catecholamine epinephrine in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and appears unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Moreover, QTc remained unchanged, suggesting that the reduction of QT interval was related to the increase in heart rate. All QT and QTc intervals, as well as all the other ECG parameters, were within the normal range (including ECGs performed in subjects reporting palpitations).</p><p>Case reports have been published regarding the association of anagrelide therapy with reversible high-output heart failure, atypical Takotsubo syndrome and reversible cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, anagrelide has been used in patients with previous acute coronary syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Bearing in mind the ionotropic and chronotropic properties of this drug, it would seem prudent to assess and monitor, as appropriate, those patients receiving anagrelide who have cardiac disease, and to use it with caution in patients with severe cardiac disease. Although numbers were too small to permit any reliable comparison between the AE rates during the fed/caffeine and fasted periods, our results suggest that anagrelide tolerability, especially with regard to headaches, was slightly improved by taking it with food as, in general, AEs were more frequent during the fasted period than the fed/caffeine period. Corresponding to the higher peak concentration of anagrelide and 3-hydroxyanagrelide in fasted subjects, all events of moderate severity occurred during the fasted treatment period.</p><p>Our work is the first to systematically study ECG changes alongside pharmacokinetics in fed/caffeine and fasted subjects receiving anagrelide. These data also provide a potential explanation for palpitations experienced by patients taking anagrelide therapeutically, which were the most common side effect reported in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Anagrelide is generally well tolerated in healthy subjects and has a small effect on ECG parameters and heart rate. The intake of food/caffeine affected the profile of anagrelide exposure. Caffeine was not shown to affect the metabolism of anagrelide by CYP1A2, although it may be implicated in the higher increase in heart rate and increased frequency of palpitations reported after food/caffeine intake.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Terry Noctor and colleagues at York Bioanalytical Solutions for their contribution to the plasma concentration analysis.
