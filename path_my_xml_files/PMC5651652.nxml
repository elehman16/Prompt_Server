Among these anxieties, test anxiety is a common problem.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Test anxiety is a type of performance anxiety that their reasons are fear of failure, lack of preparation, bad experiences of examination, and can cause physical, emotional, cognitive-behavioral symptoms in person.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Test anxiety is a global issue, and every year, affects the academic performance of millions of students worldwide.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Previous studies have reported a prevalence rate of 10%&#x02013;30% for test anxiety in students.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In Iran, a prevalence rate of 17.2% has been reported for test anxiety.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] With an increase in age and level of education, test anxiety increases. In addition, text anxiety is more prevalent in female students than male students.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Test anxiety is associated with emotion regulation strategies. Previous studies indicate that emotion regulation strategies can predict anxiety in high school students and are positively related to test anxiety.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Emotion regulation can have positive effects on a person's adjustment to their environment, can improve a person's satisfaction with their performance, and is also an important factor in reducing anxiety.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Until now, numerous psychological interventions have been used for test anxiety, including muscle relaxation and systematic desensitization, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and Ellis's rational emotive theory.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] All these therapies, especially behavioral therapies,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have been partly effective in reducing test anxiety; however, there have been few studies examining the new generation of behavioral therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).</p><p>MBSR has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of some clinical disorders and physical conditions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It has also been found that MBSR can be helpful in keeping anxiety symptoms in a balanced level in people with anxiety disorders such as test anxiety.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>However, Toneatto and Nguyen reviewed any study that was published in a peer-reviewed journal, used a control group, and reported outcomes related to changes in depression and anxiety by MBSR. They found out when active control groups were used, MBSR did not show an effect on depression and anxiety. Adherence to the MBSR program was infrequently assessed. Beside this, they urged that MBSR does not have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, there is no research to consider the effectiveness of MBSR on test anxiety and emotion regulation using a questionnaire related to these two variables.</p><p>Based on these reasons, the present study is aimed to examine the effectiveness of a MBSR therapy on emotion regulation and test anxiety of students and test the remaining effect of this treatment after 3 month with the related questionnaires.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a randomized clinical trial with a control group, conducted in the academic year 2014&#x02013;2015, from September to late November, in Golpayegan, Iran. Before conducting the research, we obtained the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the Kashan University of Medical Sciences (IRCT No: 2015061122657N1). The statistical population consisted of all students of the highs schools for female students in Golpayegan. A sample size of fifty participants was determined using the Cochran's formula. Participants were selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. In the first stage, two high schools were selected from all high schools in Golpayegan. In the second stage, six classrooms were selected from grades one to three. Then, the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS) was randomly administered to 200 students. Finally, a total of 50 students with a score above 13 in TAS with the lack of diagnostic criteria for other disorders were selected and randomly divided into experimental (MBSR) and control groups. We should note that the two groups were matched for age, gender, and level of education as moderating variables. The study findings were analyzed using analysis of variance with repeated measures.

Every subscale of the CERQ has 4 items and is scored from 4 to 20. A principal components&#x02019; factor analysis revealed nine factors.

As far as we know from a review of previous studies, it seems that the present study is the first work examining the effect of MBSR on emotion regulation using a questionnaire related to this variable and assessing individuals with test anxiety symptoms in the follow-up. The study results indicated that the effects of MBSR lasted through the follow-up, for both of these variables, except for one of the subscales of emotion regulation.</p><p>The results of some other studies are also in line with the study results, with regard to the positive effects of MBSR on reducing anxiety and anxiety disorders in general. For example, van der Riet <italic>et al</italic>., Frank <italic>et al</italic>., Poulin, Zenner <italic>et al</italic>., Bamber and Schneider, and McCloskey showed the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions on test anxiety of students.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] V&#x000f8;llestad <italic>et al</italic>. also found that MBSR can be useful in keeping anxiety symptoms in a balanced level in people with anxiety disorders.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In an examination of the outcomes of mindfulness, Tanay <italic>et al</italic>. found that teaching mindfulness skills can significantly decrease vulnerable mood and anxiety symptoms.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Dekeyser <italic>et al</italic>. showed that four components of mindfulness, i.e. observing, describing, action with awareness, and nonjudgmental acceptance are highly correlated to mindfulness skills and are related to better description and detection of body sensations and anxiety and less distress.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Consistent with the study results, Trent and <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that MBSR training can improve emotion regulation skills of students.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the supporting role of mindfulness in emotion regulation, Mitmansgruber <italic>et al</italic>. also found that in stressful conditions, patient's conscious awareness initially increases and then decreases.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Some other studies have also confirmed the positive effects of mindfulness on emotion regulation; however, we had not find any research inconsistent of our findings. Moreover, the most important difference between our study and previous research is that we used the related questionnaire (CERQ) in our study.</p><p>Finally, we can conclude that MBSR, due to its positive effects on developing a conscious and nonjudgmental attitude, can significantly improve emotion regulation and thus, test anxiety. We can also say that the MBSR techniques have had continued and lifetime effects on students&#x02019; lives, in such a way that these techniques have become a lifestyle for students. In fact, mindfulness, through a moment to moment, nonjudgmental, and step by step control of awareness, can improve patients&#x02019; self-control, self-regulation, and self-monitoring on their behaviors and guide them toward recovery. Hence, educational programs such as MBSR in school psychology improve the quality of life of students and ensuring their physical and psychological health at the pivotal age of adolescence. Different studies have shown that MBSR may not have a similar and permanent effect on different disorders; therefore, it is suggested that future studies examine the effectiveness of this method, on different disorders and in different clinical settings. It is also suggested that from time to time, it is needed to investigate how persistent are the effects of these therapies.</p><p>The present study had some limitations: A small population (Glopayegan city), a sample consisting only of female students, not having a placebo group, unavailability of objective instruments for data collection, and not comparing MBSR with other gold-standard therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Therefore, future studies are suggested to replicate this study in larger populations and with samples consisting of both genders and compare MBSR with other common therapies. It is also suggested that future studies examine the effect of MBSR on other anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>One of the important issues regarding psychological interventions is to determine the effectiveness, durability, and applicability of these interventions in the life of patients. The study results indicated that the effects of MBSR lasted through the follow-up, for both of these variables. Using the results of this study may be proposed school counselors use mindfulness to reduce the anxiety of their pupils and thus improve their academic achievement.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>The study was supported by Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study is part of a research thesis proposal approved by the Kashan University of Medical Sciences on August 29, 2015 with code no. 94056 which was performed with financial support of Research Council of the University.
