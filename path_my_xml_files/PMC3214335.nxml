The aims of this pilot study were to assess the efficacy and safety of silymarin on serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, serum aminotransferases (ALT, AST) levels, liver fibrosis and well-being in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>This prospective self-controlled trial study was conducted from March to September 2006 at Department of Gastroenterology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. 55 patients with HCV (10 female and 45 male) with a mean age of 31.8 &#x000b1; 6.4 years (10-67 years) were participated in the study. Patients received 24 weeks of silymarin (630 mg/day). Baseline virological biochemical, liver fibrosis (by a serum fibrosis markers, including YKL&#x02013;40 and Hyaluronic acid), and SF-36 questionnaire were performed with biochemical tests repeated at the end of the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There was statistically difference in mean of ALT (108.7 &#x000b1; 86.6 vs 70.3 &#x000b1; 57.7) before and after the treatment (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The means of AST were 99.4 &#x000b1; 139.7 and 59.7 &#x000b1; 64.32 before and after the treatment with statistically differences (p = 0.004). After the treatment, nine patients were found with negative HCV-RNA (p = 0.004) and statistically significant improvement in results of liver fibrosis markers were found only in fibrosis group (p = 0.015).

Therefore, many hepatitis C patients use the herb silymarin (milk thistle), an alternative therapy for hepatitis C, in addition to or instead of standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Although the popularity of silymarin has been increased in people with liver disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> but a little evidences with controversial results exist in effect of silaymarin on chronic hepatitis C. In one study in Egypt,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> a dose of 420 mg/day of silymarin has been used for one year. The quality of life of the patients improved very well, but the level of liver enzyme did not change. An exhaustive search strategy identified 148 papers that studied silymarin compounds in liver disease.

The pregnant patients and patients with side effect which confirmed with rechallenge test were excluded. The ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the study and all of participants signed an inform consent after explaining the aims and protocol of the study to them. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01292161).</p><p>After measuring the baseline outcomes, we performed 630 mg/day silymarin a product of Goldaru pharmaceutical Co. Isfahan, Iran for six months. Following serum components were measured before and after the treatment: liver enzymes (ALT and AST), HCV-RNA (with PCR) and markers for liver fibrosis such as YKL 40 and Hyaluronic Acid (HA). YKL 40 was measured with YKL 40&#x02013;EIA Kit, Quaildel comp. San Diego.

Fibrosis activity progress group: YKL 40 &#x0003e; 100 ng/ml or HA &#x0003e; 50 ng/ml more than the level before treatment. Fibrosis activity regression group: YKL 40 decreased more than 75 mg/ml or HA decreased &#x02265; 30 ng/ml compared with before treatment levels. Fibrosis stable group: the level of liver fibrosis markers were not agreed with above level after treatment. For the determination of quality of life, we used the Iranian version of short form healthy survey (SF-36) questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> before and after treatment which it's validity and reliability was established. The SF-36 questionnaire is a generic measure of health that is used to measure quality of life. It consists of 36 questions (items) which altogether score from 0 to 100.</p><p>Data were analyzed with the paired t-test, McNemar, and chi&#x02013;square statistical methods.

Previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> have reported an improvement in a number of liver chemistries, including ALT, following treatment with S. marianum and our results supported their findings. Tanamly et al in a double-blinded trial evaluated silymarin in preventing complications of chronic hepatitis C. Although they showed an improvement in patient's symptoms and quality of life, but no significantly improvement in their liver enzymes, liver fibrosis markers and HCV-RNA was achieved. Our results were not agreed with their findings respectively. The difference might be because of the performed dose of silymarin, the study design and the genotypes of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Gordon et al in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study examined the effects of silybum marianum on patients with chronic hepatitis C and showed no significant effect on serum HCV-RNA, alanine aminotransferase levels, quality of life or psychological well-being.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Our findings did not support their findings respectively.
