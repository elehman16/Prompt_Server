By 2030, this figure is estimated to double. Whilst evidence supports conservative measures for mild symptoms, and early surgery for severe symptoms, controversy remains over the most appropriate management for patients that present with moderate disease, with regard to early surgery or late surgery following steroid injection. Injection versus Decompression for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome-Pilot trial (INDICATE-P) is a feasibility study for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial (INDICATE) to determine whether patients over the age of 18 with moderate CTS should undergo early surgical decompression of the median nerve or a single steroid injection (followed by later surgery if required).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>INDICATE-P is a feasibility study for an open (non-blinded) randomised controlled pilot trial.

Participants will be randomised to one of two possible interventions: surgical decompression or a single steroid injection (followed by surgery later if required). Clinical outcome measures will be captured by postal questionnaire at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-randomisation.

Incidence of surgery for CTS is increasing worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The UK has seen a 34% increase in the number of carpal tunnel decompression surgeries between 1998 and 2015, with the number of operations in 2030 estimated to be 105,000 per year: double the number in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Whilst patients with mild CTS can improve both clinically and neurophysiologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the majority of cases eventually increase in severity over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of CTS depends on severity of symptoms. Severe CTS is defined as presence of thenar muscle wasting and constant numbness. Mild CTS should be treated non-operatively, whilst moderate CTS can be treated either non-operatively (wrist splinting or steroid injecting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) or with surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is no consensus as to the clinical distinction between mild and moderate CTS or how the latter should be treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Treatment</title><p>Steroid injections provide a good initial response in around 70&#x02013;90% of patients with mild and moderate CTS, but relapse is common. The duration of effect reported in the literature varies, but one study showed that 63% of patients had a sustained effect after 6&#x000a0;months, but only 34% after 18&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The risks of injection are small, with the incidence of median nerve injury from intra-neural injection estimated to be &#x0003c;0.1% in competent hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is no evidence to guide treatment following relapse after steroid injection, though if the duration of effect was reasonable, some patients prefer to have further injections and avoid surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Carpal tunnel decompression (CTD) is 90&#x02013;95% effective in permanently relieving pain, paraesthesia and intermittent numbness in CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, it involves higher risk and longer recovery time for the patient than steroid injection. A survey of 4000 patients who received CTD found that 2&#x000a0;years after surgery, only 75% considered the operation a success and 8% were worse off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study shows a clear trend to improved results in patients with moderate CTS compared to mild and severe CTS.</p><p>There is variability in Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) policies and clinician approaches: this stems from the paucity of good evidence. Only two randomised controlled trials have compared steroid injections to surgery. Ly-Pen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], across 163 wrists, found no significant difference 2&#x000a0;years, but no validated symptom score was used, and they found high cross-over between treatment groups. Hui conducted a trial of 50 patients, finding that surgery provided greater relief of symptoms at 20&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A 2008 Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] suggests that it is unclear whether surgery is superior to steroid injection.</p><p>For patients with moderate CTS, the dilemma of whether to opt for surgery or steroid injection remains. The INDICATE study will seek to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of the two approaches to treatment; early surgery or a single steroid injection (with later surgery if required).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><p>Injection versus Decompression for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome-Pilot trial (INDICATE-P) is a pilot study to inform the design of the multicentre, randomised controlled INDICATE study, specifically in terms of feasibility of recruitment and data collection. The aim of the main trial is to assess whether early surgery or a single steroid injection (with later surgery if required) is the better treatment approach for patients with moderate CTS. The objectives of this feasibility study are as follows:</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To assess the feasibility of conducting the INDICATE trial with regards to recruitment, data collection and outcome measurement.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited prospectively at the participating sites. The process of patient identification and recruitment will depend on the local treatment pathways at each participating site: from secondary care (Gloucester, Canterbury and Plymouth, UK) or from primary care using Patient Identification Centres at local General Practices (Gloucestershire, UK). Practices will identify patients by searching their databases on a monthly basis for patients with a new diagnosis of CTS. These patients will be sent a patient information sheet and a letter inviting them to contact the local research team in secondary care if they are interested in participating in the trial. The flowchart in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> details the recruitment process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Patient recruitment flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2017_134_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Post-operative management including dressing changes, advice, exercises, scar management and follow-up appointments should follow local protocols or the surgeon&#x02019;s preference. Specifically, it will not be necessary to have a follow-up appointment in secondary care, if that is not usual local practice.</p><p>The designated investigator at the centre providing the surgery should ensure that the operative data is recorded on the appropriate CRF. The purpose of this form is to collect data on the type of surgery performed and key costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Steroid injection</title><p>All participants allocated to receive a steroid injection will receive the standard injection offered at their site. The technique of the injection will not be standardised, but the practitioner should regularly give injections for CTS and should use the technique with which they are most familiar. Details of this, along with the steroid and its dosage, will be recorded on the injection form.</p><p>Further injections are not advisable whilst the patient is in the study, however, if more than one injection is given, this needs to be recorded as further treatment on the complication form.</p><p>If symptoms recur following either the injection or surgery, participants should contact the local research team by email or by phone. Patients will then be referred to the centre of their choice to discuss further treatment options. This may include surgery as described above. Data about any surgery following injection will also be recorded on the appropriate CRF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Randomisation</title><p>A web-based randomisation system will be provided by the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU). The trial statistician will generate the random sequence, which will be simple block (with varying block size) randomisation, stratified by centre to ensure a similar number of patients are allocated to each treatment arm at each site. The research nurse will randomise participants once they have given informed consent and attended their baseline assessment. The randomisation system will automatically forward to the central study office in Oxford, and this will be sent to the nominated people at each site. The randomised treatment will be recorded on the site&#x02019;s randomisation log. This log will be maintained by the local study team at each site.</p><p>Once a patient has been randomised, a copy of the patient&#x02019;s consent form and the patient details form will be forwarded to the central study office in Oxford to facilitate the postal follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Data collection</title><p>Patient demographics will be recorded on the patient details form. Data recorded will include date of birth, gender, hospital number, and the hand involved in the study.</p><p>Baseline data collected will include information about the patient&#x02019;s pain and function, questions about their general health, duration of symptoms and employment status.</p><p>Neurophysiological testing (nerve conduction studies) are required as a baseline assessment. Results from these will be assessed by local staff using a standardised severity scale, anonymised and sent to Dr Jeremy Bland (co-investigator and neurophysiologist) at East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. He will assess the NCS reports and apply a severity grade to them according to the Bland Criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>If the research clinic is held in a hospital with a neurophysiology department, then ideally the nerve conduction studies will be scheduled at the same time as the baseline appointment to minimise inconvenience to the patient. If the research clinic is held in a hospital that does not have a neurophysiology department then the nerve conduction studies will need to be performed before the patient can be randomised. Specific consent for the studies will be given before they are performed. The patient may not need to return for another appointment, as the research team could proceed with randomisation and liaise with the patient via telephone about their randomised treatment and any further appointments that may be required. Extra appointments will be avoided where possible. A member of the research team will telephone the patient just prior to randomising to re-confirm that the patient still consents to take part.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Follow-up assessments</title><p>Clinical outcome measure time points will be at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months post-randomisation.</p><p>Follow-up for study purposes will be completed via post. Clinical follow-up will occur as per routine practice at each participating centre.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Blinding</title><p>INDICATE-P will be an open study where those delivering the care will not be blinded to the intervention nor will the patient who has received it or the outcome assessors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Analysis</title><p>A single analysis of data will take place once the study has ceased recruiting, and the last patient has reached their final assessment. No interim analysis is planned. Given this is a feasibility study, no formal statistical analysis of the data between groups is planned, i.e. no statistical tests for statistically significant differences in outcomes between trial arms will be performed. Descriptive analyses of outcome data will be carried out using appropriate summary measures (e.g. number of events and percentage for binary measures). Measures will be quantified, and where appropriate an associated 95% confidence interval calculated (e.g. using the Wilson score interval method (or an equivalent one) for binary measures). No imputation of missing data will be carried out.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Patient recruitment data</title><p>The number of patients recruited per month will be presented by centre and overall.

A lack of strong evidence regarding treatment has resulted in significant variability between both regions and individual clinicians, across a range of specialties.</p><p>INDICATE-P will inform design and methodology of the main INDICATE trial. The aim of the pilot study is to assess feasibility of recruitment and data collection, in particular, the number of eligible patients that present over the time period, the number who consent to participate, the number who receive the allocated treatment and complete follow-up, and also reasons for non-compliance. This information will aid in the practical development and application of INDICATE; a large, multicentre RCT that aims to determine whether steroid injection (with late surgery) or early surgery provides the best outcome for patients with moderate CTS.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently recruiting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CCG</term><def><p>Clinical Commissioning Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTD</term><def><p>Carpal tunnel decompression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTRG</term><def><p>Clinical Trials and Research Governance, University of Oxford</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTS</term><def><p>Carpal tunnel syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REC</term><def><p>Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study is sponsored by Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
