Fibrinogen is an essential endogenous component of haemostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the plasma level is associated to bleeding, transfusion and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fibrinogen concentrate is widely used to correct acquired hypofibrinogenaemia, recommended by several guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but evidence is lacking regarding the treatment efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Several trauma resuscitation strategies are currently being employed and investigated internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The concept of haemostatic resuscitation is widely used in which early pre-emptive balanced transfusion therapy with red blood cells (RBC): fresh frozen plasma (FFP): platelets (PLT) are driven according to fixed ratios aiming at 1:1:1. The best evidence for this concept comes from Holcomb and colleagues, showing a beneficial effect of high ratios on haemostasis and short-term mortality due to exsanguination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Copenhagen Concept, Haemostatic Control Resuscitation (HCR), implemented in 2004, is a further adaptation of haemostatic resuscitation comprising of balanced transfusion therapy with transfusion packages equal to a ratio 1:1:1 in the early phase of massive bleeding, and then adjusting the therapy according to viscoelastic haemostatic assay-based algorithms allowing for goal-directed treatment of coagulopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The standard of trauma care in our facility is based on Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) with strong focus on haemorrhage control, and early whole-body computed tomography (CT) if the patient is stable. Tranexamic acid is standard of both pre- and intrahospital care in Denmark according to the CRASH-2 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HCR is associated with improved survival in observational studies, but still, in most resuscitation concepts, including HCR, a low level of fibrinogen is associated with coagulopathy, low clot strength and poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Fibrinogen is a key element not only in secondary haemostasis, where it is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, but also in primary haemostasis by facilitating platelet aggregation and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fibrinogen levels average 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;g/l in healthy individuals and have been shown to be the element of the coagulation system that first reaches low levels during haemorrhage, at least if volume replacement is based on RBC and fluids alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and in conditions with hyperfibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The &#x0201c;critical level&#x0201d; at which acquired fibrinogen deficiency causes a decrease in haemostatic competence is, however, debatable. Studies in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiencies indicate that only levels below 1&#x000a0;g/l cause an increase in bleeding during surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and this level has generally been adopted as a target for substitution in bleeding patients with acquired deficiencies also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A level as high as 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;g/l is now being suggested as the target for substitution since decreased levels have been associated with worse outcomes in bleeding patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In regard to the use of fibrinogen concentrate in bleeding trauma patients, no data from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been published. However, there are another ongoing study (NCT01475344), and the FiiRST study (NCT02203968) that is completed, but with no results published yet. The CRYOSTAT pilot trial showed that cryoprecipitate supplementation containing fibrinogen in trauma is feasible and that a definitive trial is warranted to see the effect on safety, transfusions, morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, cryoprecipitate is more than fibrinogen substitution since all coagulation factors are in there and it may not be comparable to fibrinogen concentrate primarily containing fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Outside trauma, the evidence for use of fibrinogen is also very scarce and most studies are with high risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, in the latest RCT on severe postpartum haemorrhage no evidence to support the preemptive use of 2&#x000a0;g fibrinogen concentrate was found, however no concern related to safety and thromboembolic complications in particular appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of an immediate pre-emptive first-line treatment with fibrinogen concentrate in patients with trauma haemorrhage in need of haemostatic resuscitation. We hypothesize that immediate pre-emptive fibrinogen concentrate administered to adult trauma patients as first-line treatment of traumatic haemorrhage will increase the clot strength as evaluated by thrombelastography (TEG&#x000ae;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a single-centre randomized, double-blinded, controlled, investigator-initiated, pilot phase II trial of 40 haemorrhaging trauma patients admitted to the Level 1 Trauma Centre in Copenhagen, Denmark randomized to administration of fibrinogen concentrate (Riastap&#x000ae;, CSL Behring Scandinavia, Danderyd, Sweden), as compared to placebo (saline), as immediate, pre-emptive first-line treatment of trauma haemorrhage, when haemostatic resuscitation is needed.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The study will include 40 adult (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) trauma patients received directly from the scene of the accident, where an order of at least one blood component transfusion within the first hour of arrival is initiated, and the patient is predicted to need transfusion package therapy during the first 2&#x000a0;hours (activated massive transfusion protocol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Randomization was performed using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Treatments (fibrinogen concentrate - Riastap&#x000ae; or placebo/saline) were arranged in two groups of 20 patients in a single column in a systematic order. Each block of six patients included three fibrinogen concentrate - Riastap&#x000ae; and three placebo/saline patients.

Secondary outcomes (number 7, 9, 10; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) are all categorical and will be analysed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and effects quantified using frequency tables and risk ratios.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Missing data</title><p>If for any of the analyses mentioned above there are less than 95&#x000a0;% of the observations which are complete, we will employ multiple imputation techniques for that analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The multiple imputation approach will be based on chained equations. If more than 95&#x000a0;% of the observations are complete, we will only employ complete case analysis.</p><p>The power calculation is based on local data finding of a TEG&#x000ae; FF MA mean 13.6&#x000a0;mm (SD&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.6) on arrival in trauma patients not surviving for 30&#x000a0;days. Administering 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mg/kg fibrinogen concentrate will result in an approximate increase of 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;mm in TEG FF MA according to Tanaka and colleagues, which corresponds to increasing the fibrinogen level with approximately 1&#x000a0;g/l and to a level of above 2.3&#x000a0;g/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To detect the above difference with a power of 0.90 (1-&#x003b2;) and alpha of 0.05 requires n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19 patients in each group. We have chosen to include 40 patients, 20 evaluable patients in each randomization group in case of attrition, in the present trial. Patients who drop out or are withdrawn for any reason before hour 24 will be replaced.</p><p>No interim analysis is planned. The actual statistical power will be a bit higher as the primary end point is a change value and we adjust the analysis for baseline values. However, the exact size of this additional power cannot be readily assessed as we do not have reliable information about the intra-person correlation of TEG&#x000ae; FF MA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patient withdrawal</title><p>Participation in the trial is strictly voluntary.

The Pilot Randomized trial of Fibrinogen in Trauma Haemorrhage (PRooF-iTH) is the first randomized controlled trial of fibrinogen in trauma. Furthermore, the first trial to address whether first-line, pre-emptive fibrinogen concentrate treatment will increase the clot strength, and influence transfusion requirements and survival in adult trauma patients in need of haemostatic resuscitation. Included patients will have critical or massive bleeding in need of activation of our massive transfusion protocol.</p><p>When administering a pro-haemostatic drug such as fibrinogen concentrate, there is a possible risk of thromboembolic events. In seven randomized controlled trials on the use of fibrinogen concentrate as a pro-haemostatic drug, six of these were in cardiac surgery carrying an inevitable increased thromboembolic risk, and only one trial has reported two cases of thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, in a 22-year pharmaco-surveillance programme with more than 1,000,000&#x000a0;g of fibrinogen concentrate administered, only nine cases of thrombosis possibly related to the treatment have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, in a recent randomized controlled trial using 2&#x000a0;g fibrinogen substitution or placebo in 249 patients with severe postpartum haemorrhage done by our group, we saw no thromboembolic events and no serious adverse events or reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In conclusion, the risk of thromboembolic events seems negligible when fibrinogen is used in a relevant population, with potential important benefits.</p><p>The dose of fibrinogen concentrate in the present trial is 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mg/kg and was chosen based on the reported findings of low concentration of fibrinogen in actively haemorrhaging trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and it is estimated that the chosen dose will increase the functional fibrinogen maximal amplitude by 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;mm resulting in significantly higher overall clot strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Importantly, no clinical or preclinical data indicate that administration of fibrinogen concentrate to patients having a normal fibrinogen leads to a hypercoagulable or pro-thrombotic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this trial we wish to include pregnant women and find that advantages outweigh possible risks. These trauma patients are bleeding critically and therefore receive many blood transfusions, and 20&#x000a0;% are expected to die from their injuries. It will not be possible to investigate for pregnancy prior to administration of trial medication, as this will delay immediate and life-saving treatments. The active substance in Riastap&#x000ae; is of human origin and is eliminated in the same manner as the native protein. Harmful or toxic effects in relation to reproduction or foetal toxicity are not expected, and fibrinogen concentrate has safely been used for postpartum haemorrhage in more than 100 women without any serious adverse reactions or events even though this is not the same as being pregnant. Despite the several measures taken to screen for and inactivate viruses and bacteria, the risk of non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19, which may be serious for pregnant women, cannot be completely excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Overall, we strongly believe that the advantages of including pregnant women outweigh possible risks and adverse reactions. Based on this, the inclusion of pregnant women was approved by the Danish health authorities.</p><p>The future of trauma resuscitations warrants further investigation. Currently, the best evidence from randomized controlled trials supports haemostatic resuscitation aiming at delivering blood products in a ratio 1:1:1 of red blood cells, plasma and platelets during resuscitation of bleeding. These results comes from the Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelets and Plasma Ratios trial (PROPPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], showing a reduction in numbers of patients exsanguinating, a lower 6-hour mortality and tendency towards a better 24-hour mortality. The PRooF-iTH will test whether immediate pre-emptive fibrinogen concentrate administered to adult trauma patients as first-line treatment of trauma haemorrhage will increase the clot strength as evaluated by thrombelastography (TEG&#x000ae;), transfusion requirements and survival, as compared to placebo in patients receiving standard of care resuscitation. In brief, the standard of trauma care in Copenhagen is performed according to the ATLS principles and resuscitation is done according to the Damage Control Resuscitation principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the PROPPR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the developed Copenhagen Concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] where we limit the use of fluids and initiate a 1:1:1 ratio-driven transfusion therapy of RBCs, FFP, and platelets during the initial phase of massive bleeding. Viscoelastic haemostatic assay (VHA) is performed on arrival and repeated accordingly, allowing for an early shift towards VHA-guided therapy using blood products, pro-haemostatics and coagulation factor concentrates subsequently. Simultaneously, tranexamic acid is administered according to the CRASH-2 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and efforts are made to correct and reverse augmenting factors of coagulopathy and shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was started in February 2015, and participants are currently being recruited.

The patients considered to be included in the trial will be temporarily incompetent because of acute, severe illness related to traumatic haemorrhage needing immediate stabilization. Patients in haemorrhagic shock will usually have impaired consciousness and are at risk of circulatory arrest and respiratory failure, and approximately 20&#x000a0;% of these patients are expected to die. The intervention tested in this trial is pivotal to be administered immediately in the early phase of ongoing bleeding and resuscitation where coagulopathy is present in order to have the expected beneficial effect on haemostasis, bleeding and transfusions. Hence, it is necessary to include unconscious patients as the treatment has to be initiated at the earliest possible time after the traumatic haemorrhage diagnosis i.e., at a time point where patients are temporarily incompetent and the next of kin may not have reached the hospital yet. In Denmark, the consent process can be performed in three independent steps. The first step is to allow for immediate inclusion in trials testing emergency interventions by use of proxy consent by two independent physicians (an entity-entitled scientific guardian consisting of two physicians independent of the research group and one of these needs specific knowledge of the condition investigated). The second step is for the principal investigator or his designee to obtain written informed consent from the next of kin as soon as possible and then the patient&#x02019;s general practitioner. Patients who, during the course of the trial, become able to give consent, will be asked to participate and give their consent as the third step of the consent process. The higher order of consent step replaces the lower order of consent, i.e. consent from relatives and general practitioners replaces the consent obtained from the scientific guardian and so forth. Each patient or next of kin must receive full verbal and written patient information from the investigator or his designee and allowed to be accompanied by an assessor during this. Furthermore, sufficient time will be given to consider possible participation before giving consent. The results of this trial will be communicated to each patient if they consent to this information. The trial is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 2 and is approved by the local research ethics committee (Capital Region, Centre for Health, Health Law), the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and the Danish Data Protection Agency according to Danish legislation. The trial is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, to ensure monitoring (visits), data verification and handling, and audit if necessary. The patients are covered by patient insurance, covering all treated patients in the event of study-related injury or death occurs in accordance with applicable law and with the CPMP Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice.
