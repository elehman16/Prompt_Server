Anesthesiologists in training require up to 50 intubation opportunities to achieve a 90% success rate and become competent in performing intubations&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the current training environment, pediatric residents have been reported to have an average of three&#x000a0;neonatal intubation opportunities during the course of their residency&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;Due to changes in delivery room practices, improvement in clinical care, and limitations on the time spent in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), the opportunities to perform endotracheal intubation, specifically in neonatal patients, have become exceedingly limited for pediatric trainees&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Despite the life-saving nature of this procedure and the adverse consequences associated with inadequate performance, best practices on intubation training have been developed from expert opinion, and few empirical studies have examined which technical skills are required and how these skills should be taught&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most training programs currently rely on bedside teaching, online training modules, animal labs, or simulation based training to educate their novice intubators.</p><p>Video laryngoscopy (VL) is a form of indirect laryngoscopy where visualization of the larynx is performed through the aid of a camera attached to the tip of a laryngoscope blade. VL offers a novel alternative to traditional intubation teaching strategies by allowing the trainee and the instructor to share a view of the airway in real time. It has been shown in simulated settings that trainees using VL and direct laryngoscopy (DL) have similar rates of intubation success&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the role of VL as a teaching aid remains unclear and the high cost associated with the device&#x000a0;further warrants rigorous study before recommending widespread use in neonatology. The objective of our study is to determine whether a VL-assisted curriculum, compared to a traditional intubation curriculum that uses DL, improves neonatal intubation performance in a simulated setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This is a single-center, randomized controlled trial of an educational intervention aimed at novice intubators. The study was conducted at the University of Texas at Houston Surgical and Clinical Skills Center from 06/2013&#x02013;08/2013. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of University of Texas at Houston.</p><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Novice intubators including Pediatric residents, Neonatology fellows and Respiratory Therapy students with previous experience of five or fewer successful neonatal intubations were invited to participate in this study. The study details were presented to all pediatric trainees at the beginning of their NICU rotations as well as at resident noon conferences. Enrollment was voluntary and interested volunteers were given additional information regarding study-related procedures. Trainees with history of five or fewer successful neonatal intubations were considered to be novice intubators for the purpose of this study.&#x000a0;Consented study subjects&#x000a0;were randomly assigned either to the intervention arm, to receive VL assisted curriculum or the control arm, to receive DL intubation curriculum. Block randomization method, with a block size of 10, was used to ensure that all groups undergoing the training sessions at any given time were similar in size. Once randomized, participants stayed in the assigned group for the remainder of the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>Study participants were asked to complete a brief survey that prompted them to describe demographic information such as residency class, year of training, and subspecialty as well as their previous experience with intubations. All subjects participated in their assigned intubation curriculum and completed the following three components. First, a didactic session was conducted using a pre-recorded power-point presentation and covered the basics of neonatal airway management, indications for endotracheal intubation, equipment set up, and intubation technique. While all participants viewed the same basic presentation, those randomized to VL curriculum viewed an additional segment that included VL-derived intubation footage from previously performed patient intubations. Participants then attended a skills session where they were given approximately 15 minutes to practice the skills and techniques that were outlined in the presentation. Newborn intubation heads and intubation equipment were made available for this practice session. An expert intubator was&#x000a0;present during these sessions to assist with equipment use and to provide coaching. Each participant was allowed to practice their intubation skills at their own discretion, without any restriction on number of attempts or successful intubations during the 15-minute window of time. Those in the video laryngoscopy group had access to a Storz C-MAC&#x000a0;VL (Tuttlingen, Germany) and DL to use at their discretion. Participants then moved to the next station for an evaluation session where they were asked to intubate a SimNewB&#x000ae; manikin (Laerdal, NY, USA ) using DL. The number of intubation attempts, outcome of each attempt, and the time required for successful intubation were recorded. Successful intubation was defined as passage of the endotracheal tube into the trachea, as confirmed by the simulator. A maximum of five&#x000a0;attempts were allowed by each subject and those unable to intubate successfully within these attempts were designated as unsuccessful intubations.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes of interest</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was intubation success on first attempt (yes/no). Secondary outcomes included the time to successful intubation (time from first introduction of the laryngoscope into the manikin's mouth to the passage of the endotracheal tube into the trachea) and number of attempts required to achieve successful intubation of the SimNewB&#x000ae; manikin.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>In order to detect a 30% difference in intubation success between the two study groups, we needed 49 subjects per group and a sample size of 98. Due to abundant interest in the study, we allowed volunteers to enroll in our study beyond the planned sample size since subjects in both study arms would receive a potentially beneficial training experience. Data was analyzed using Fisher's exact test, linear, logistic and Poisson&#x000a0;regressions&#x000a0;where appropriate. Odds ratios were calculated to compare the odds of intubation success with exposure to VL curriculum vs. exposure to DL curriculum. The data was analyzed using Stata 13.0 (StataCorp LP, TX, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 123 subjects voluntarily participated in the study and 62 were randomized to the control or DL group and 61 to the intervention or VL group.

Although&#x000a0;not statistically significant and the effect size is small, the likelihood of intubation success as well as the number of attempts and the time required for successful intubation were better among the subjects exposed to a DL-intubation curriculum.</p><p>Overall, subjects in both groups required more than 20 seconds to perform a successful intubation, which is the time frame recommended by the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. Similar findings have been reported by previous studies that evaluated the utility of VL in teaching neonatal intubation. When a VL system called GlideScope&#x000ae; (Verathon Inc, WA, USA) was studied, none of the study participants were able to intubate successfully within 20 seconds [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The reported times in their study are similar to values observed in ours and are concerning as we expect simulated intubations to take less time than the ones done in the clinical setting.</p><p>Our study is distinct from the body of literature available on neonatal VL in several important ways. The randomized controlled trial study design is rarely used for educational interventions and by using it we were able to ensure that our study groups were comparable in important baseline characteristics and that our intervention was studied in a rigorous fashion. Our choice of VL equipment is unique as many of the previous studies have used GlideScope&#x000ae; brand of VL. After examining the existing VL market, we realized that the intubation experience varies notably depending on the brand of equipment in use. We chose the Storz&#x000ae; CMAC brand as it resembled the direct laryngoscope more than the other VLs and would therefore limit the challenges associated with translating skills learned via VL to DL. Furthermore, our intervention utilized VL as an educational tool rather than a direct intervention. We realize that the cost associated with VL does not permit routine use of the device in all delivery rooms. And&#x000a0;it is important for trainees to be comfortable with equipment they will encounter during real world intubation experiences rather than the VL equipment that may only be available at certain centers. With this intent, we designed a curriculum that would aim to teach sustainable and translatable skills that can be utilized in the post-training, real world setting.&#x000a0;We also evaluated our subjects&#x02019; performance using traditional equipment in order to assess the impact of our training curriculum on DL-based intubation procedures. Finally, our subject pool was also unique in that we included respiratory therapy students and pediatric trainees of varying specialties. This composition of novice intubators enhances the external validity of our results since an intubation curriculum can be potentially beneficial to all providers who perform procedures in the NICU.</p><p>Our study has several&#x000a0;important limitations, including the simulated nature of the setting in which intubation skills were taught and evaluated. While we used equipment and airway models that mimic the real world experience as much as possible, we could not simulate factors such as airway secretions that might impair the view of the glottis or bradycardia/desaturations that might limit a provider&#x02019;s ability to perform the procedure.&#x000a0;It is unclear at this time how simulation-based interventions such as these correlate with real world procedural outcomes. The hypothetical advantage of teaching with VL is the ability to enhance the view of the airway, thereby improving the likelihood of proper endotracheal tube placement. However, there may be factors related to VL use that alter the learning process. Since the VL is designed to perform intubation while viewing the airway on a screen, it requires a different set of skills than an intubation done with direct visualization. Therefore, it is possible that while novice intubators may benefit from better familiarity with airway structures, learning the intubation skills using VL may not translate into improvement in intubations done using DL.</p><p>In addition, any potential educational benefit gained from improved visualization and recognition of the airway structures may not have been captured by the outcomes we measured in our study and in the setting in which subjects were evaluated. It is unknown whether VL-assisted training might have beneficial effects on patient intubations, rather than the simulated ones done on a manikin. The longer time required to perform successful intubations and the increased number of attempts necessary for successful intubations that we noted in the VL group may be reflective of the transition from using VL to DL equipment. The generalizability of our study results is therefore limited by the simulated nature of our study, and the utility of the VL as a teaching tool may be underappreciated in this setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We did not find an improvement in trainee intubation performance with the use of a VL-assisted intubation curriculum, compared to a standard intubation curriculum that uses traditional equipment. The value of video laryngoscopy as a training aid and its influence on neonatal patient intubations needs to be further explored.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><fn
