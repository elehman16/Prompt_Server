In order to decrease the side effects of the nCPAP management placed in noninvasive-non-cycled respiratory support. Noninvasive-cycled respiratory support mechanism have been developed such as N-BiPAP.

A3 The total number of newborns was 70. Newborns were divided into two groups with the sample size of 35 patients in each, according to odd and even document numbers. One group was treated with N-BiPAP and the other with Bubble-CPAP. Patients were compared according to the length of treatment with noninvasive respiratory support, length of oxygen intake, number of surfactant doses administered, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, apnea, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and death.

In BiPAP system, injector is just only based on IFD and the system creates two levels of PAP (Positive airway pressure) with flow control. The highest level of pressure, which is called IPAP (Inspiratory PAP) and the lowest level of pressure, which is called EPAP (Expiratory PAP), together with the sigh mechanism can revive the alveolus, improve FRC, avoid probable atelectasis, and finally decrease the work of breathing, and they can have potential advantages compared to non-cycled-NIV.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The aim of this research is to show probable clinical preference of N-BiPAP compared to Bubble-CPAP, in treatment of preterm newborn's respiratory distress syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>R2 The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and informed consent was obtained from the parents after explaining the aim and protocol of the study. This research is a randomized clinical trial done on preterm newborns with 1,500 grams or less affiliated with the RDS at Alzahra and Beheshti hospitals under the authority of Isfahan Medical University from April 2011 to March 2012. Inclusion criteria includes newborns with weight of 1,500 grams or less, together with clinical symptoms of RDS (tachypnea, intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, granting) who needed fractional inspired oxygen more than 21%.

The duration of need for oxygen supplement after weaning also showed a decrease in N-BiPAP group compared to Bubble-CPAP. Pneumothorax incidence was less than half in N-BiPAP than in Bubble-CPAP group. The incidence of need for administration of the next dose of surfactant, PDA, IVH, and death in the group treated with Bubble-CPAP was higher than the N-BiPAP group, though this difference did not have any meaning.</p><p>This study could not reach any meaningful difference in non-invasive respiratory support in newborns affiliated with RDS, under treatment by N-BiPAP in comparison with newborns treated with Bubble-CPAP. However, in the study by Lista <italic>et al</italic>. the newborns treated by N-BiPAP showed a meaningful decrease in duration of respiratory support than newborns in nCPAP group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] We should note that in Lista's study, the gestational age of newborns was considered to be 28-34 weeks, but the gestational age of newborns in this study was considered to be 26-33 weeks. A11 Considering this fact, we should say that in Lista's study, the average gestational age of newborns is higher, so it might have had an effect on the decrease of the severity of RDS disease in these newborns. On the other hand, Lista <italic>et al</italic>. used Ventilator derived CPAP to administer nCPAP.</p><p>In a research done by MIgliori <italic>et al</italic>., newborns affiliated with RDS showed a meaningful decrease in need for FIO<sub>2</sub> using N-BiPAP rather than nCPAP. A12 The increase in FIO<sub>2</sub> can be accompanied with some side effects for e.g. Retinopathy of prematurity, and the surfactant damage, development of chronic lung disease. So, it is obvious that the decrease in FIO<sub>2</sub> will lead to the decrease of these side effects.</p><p>A reason for the apnea incidence in newborns treated with continuous distending pressure (CDP), was increase in work of breathing. In a study done by Ali <italic>et al</italic>., they discovered that the work of breathing in newborns treated with non-Invasive pressure support ventilation (NI-PSV) showed a decrease compared to newborns treated with nCPAP.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the study done by Aghayi and <italic>et al</italic>., there was also a decrease in work of breathing in newborns treated with SNIPPV (Synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation) compared to nCPAP group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A13 In two separate studies, Ali <italic>et al</italic>., and Aghayi <italic>et al</italic>., like our study, put a group in a non-cyclic non-invasive respiratory support, in comparison with the other group being treated with cyclic non-invasive respiratory support, the decrease in apnea incidence in cyclic non-invasive respiratory support group was obvious, but due to the low number of the sample size in our study, this decrease could not become meaningful. In our study, apnea incidence shows an increase in Bubble-CPAP than N-BiPAP group; however this difference is not significant.</p><p>In a study done by Kishore and <italic>et al</italic>., the need for Invasive mechanical ventilation in preterm newborns affiliated with RDS treated with NIPPV (Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation) was less common than the nCPAP group. However in his study, the gestational age for preterm newborns was considered 28 to 34 weeks of gestation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this study, mechanical ventilation in N-BiPAP group had a lower incidence than Bubble-CPAP, but the difference was not significant. A14 It seems that the lack of sufficient sample size in our study caused insignificance of meaning in our study.</p><p>Bhandari and <italic>et al</italic>., showed in a study that the CLD incidence in newborns affiliated with RDS with weights lower than 1,250 grams, who were treated with SNIPPV was lower than those newborns with the same conditions treated with nCPAP.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, our study did not show such result.</p><p>No similar studies were found on the issues of pneumothorax incidence, the need for administration of the second dose of surfactant, PDA, IVH, and death.</p><p>Studies done on potential benefits of N-BiPAP seem to be limited at the moment. However, considering the significant results of this study, it can eventually initiate further studies in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our study showed a decrease in duration of treatment and need for oxygen supplement in N-BiPAP group rather than Bubble-CPAP, R5 though this decrease was meaningless. Apnea, pneumothorax, need to administer the second dose of surfactant, PDA, IVH, and death R5 were insignificantly lower in N-BiPAP group compared to Bubble-CPAP group. Considering the lack of meaning for these criteria, and regarding the potential benefits of noninvasive respiratory supports of Cycled type in treatment of newborns, we suggest that more studies be done in the similar field with larger sample sizes, since the results are more probable to get a statistical meaning with larger sample sizes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We hereby thank all the residents of pediatrics who helped us with this study, and we also thank all the NICU nurses in Alzahra and Beheshti hospitals whom without their help we could not run this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bhandari</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Finer</surname><given-names>NN</given-names></name><name><surname>Ehrenkranz</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Saha</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network.
