training improves balance, gait ability, and falls efficacy in stroke patients. [Subjects]
Firty patients who met the selection criteria and agreed to participate in research at
hospital N were randomly allocated and enrolled in this study. Twenty of the subjects were
assigned to an experimental group that participated in combined stepping exercise, and the
other twenty subjects were assigned to a control group that received general physical
therapy. [Methods] In the two groups, balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale,
gait ability was measured using the 10-m Walk Test, and falls efficacy was measured using
the Falls Efficacy Scale before training and after 6 weeks of training. [Results]
Comparative analysis of the experimental group&#x02019;s pretest and post-test results showed
statistically significant differences in the Berg Balance Scale, 10-m Walk Test, and Falls
Efficacy Scale scores. There were significant between-group differences in the Berg
Balance Scale, 10-m Walk Test, and Falls Efficacy Scale scores. [Conclusion] The results
suggest that a combined stepping exercise can be an effective intervention to improve the
balance, gait ability, and falls efficacy in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Multidirectional stepping training</kwd><kwd>Falls efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>After onset of stroke, patients commonly show symptoms of hemiplegia and loss of
visuospatial perception due to impairment of the function of the central nervous system with
respect to integration of visual information with information about the sense of position
received through the proprioceptor<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Consequently, these patients exhibit asymmetric body balance, gait, and weight shifts, as
well as defects in voluntary movements. In particular, as the center of gravity shifts to
the unaffected side, symmetric weight shifts against external sway do not occur, leading to
reduced balance ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegic
stroke patients show conditions in which approximately 61% to 80% of the entire body weight
is concentrated on the lower extremity on the unaffected side in standing postures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These asymmetric postures reduce gait
velocity, obstruct independent gait, and may result in falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falling is one of the most common complications in stroke
patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls can result from such
declines in physical functions, including balance and gait abilities, and psychological
functions, such as falls efficacy. Reports indicate that after experiencing a fall, a
patient&#x02019;s fear of falling again, that is a decline in falls efficacy, increases the his/her
risk of falling even if the he/she has not previously sustained any physical injury<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Falls efficacy is an individual&#x02019;s power to continue certain behaviors, in other words, the
self-confidence to successfully perform certain behaviors<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and refers to the confidence or will not to fall during activities.
Recently, it has been reported that, in the case of stroke patients residing in communities,
the variable of fall related self-efficacy is predominant over physical functions such as
spasticity, motility, balance, and paretic side muscle strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and is closely related to balance ability and quality of
life<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As development of methods for improving hemiplegic patients&#x02019; balance and gait ability has
been ongoing there have been increasing reports on weight shift training based on
neurodevelopmental scientific treatment methods, 3D visual feedback, gait training through
task-oriented approaches, and obstacle stepping training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When walking, patients with hemiplegia due to stroke should feel confident that the leg on
the paretic side is prepared to generate the muscle force necessary to accommodate the
entire body weight or step at a speed concordant with the leg on the non-paretic side<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the performance of appropriate
motions, muscle force is associated with the interaction between voluntary stepping control
and automatic body balance control<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Because the decrease in the bearing surface while one leg is lifted may cause a critical
reduction in balance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, muscle force is
useful in improving balance ability. Therefore, in the present study, to prevent falls that
may suddenly occur in the course of daily living, stepping exercises were used to improve
muscle force as well as balance ability through posture alignment, whole body muscle
strength, paretic side recognition ability, and functional motility, including control of
direction changes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most studies that have been conducted on the improvement of gait ability in hemiplegic
patients have had a tendency to concentrate on specific training using expensive equipment.
The present study, however, aimed to implement combined stepping exercises, which are low in
cost and maximize temporal and spatial efficiency, to determine their effects on hemiplegic
patients&#x02019; balance and gait abilities and falls efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The present study was conducted on 40 patients at N hospital located in
Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea. The subjects were assigned either to a combined
stepping training treatment group of 20 subjects or to a control group of 20 patients who
received general physical therapy and respective training programs were implemented.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) individuals diagnosed with hemiplegia due to
stroke, (2) individuals who had been affected for at least six months, (3) individuals
whose scores on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination were at least 25
points, (4) individuals who could walk independently for at least 10 m, (5) individuals
who could understand the purpose of the present study and could perform the movements as
instructed, and (6) individuals who agreed to participate in the study. All subjects
provided written informed consent prior to participation according to the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Weight shift training for 10 minutes followed by multidirectional stepping training for
20 minutes was applied in the experimental group. Combined stepping was used in the
designs of two training exercises: (1) In the first exercise, stair-shaped footholds
(10&#x02005;cm) were placed in the 12 o&#x02019;clock and 3 o&#x02019;clock (or 9 o&#x02019;clock) directions, and the
non-paretic side foot was placed on the footholds in the two directions alternately and
moved back to the original position repeatedly while the paretic side foot was fixed on
the ground. (2) In the second exercise, a weight rod (2&#x02005;cm in diameter and 100&#x02005;cm in
length) was placed between the two feet, and the non-paretic side foot was repeatedly
moved to cross the weight rod, placed next to the paretic side foot, then moved back to
the original position. Subjects were allowed to rest for two minutes between the two
tasks. This training was implemented for 30 minutes per session, five times per week for
four weeks.</p><p>The control group received general physical therapy, including gait and balance training,
for 30 minutes per session, five times per week for four weeks (the same schedule as
applied in the experimental group).</p><p>Balance ability was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS is used clinically for patients with senile
disease or hemiplegia resulting from a stroke to evaluate their balance ability either in
a standing position or during movement. This scale consists of 14 items, each with a score
from 0 to 4, giving a possible total maximum score of 56.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was also used to evaluate balance. This test is used to
evaluate movements that require dynamic balance by evaluating balance ability, as well as
the abilities to stand up and move, walk short distances, and rotate, by measuring the
time it takes for the subject to stand up from a sitting position in an arm chair, walk
3&#x02005;m on a flat surface, pass the halfway point, come back, and once again sit in the
armchair<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The 10-m Walk Test (10-m WT) was used to evaluate gait ability. This test generally
evaluates the gait velocity of patients with neurological damage<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and shows high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability
(r=0.89&#x02013;1.00)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, the subjects were instructed to comfortably walk 13 m; the time taken for 10 m,
excluding the first 1.5&#x02005;m and the last 1.5 m, which take into account acceleration and
deceleration, was measured in units of seconds<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) developed by Tinetti et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to evaluate falls efficacy. This scale measures an
individual&#x02019;s degree of confidence related to fall prevention in daily living using a total
of 10 questions. The score can range from 10 to 100 points; higher scores mean higher
levels of falls efficacy. The reliability of this scale when it was developed was high
(Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x00251;= 0.84).</p><p>The experimental subjects in the present study were randomly selected in order to enhance
the study&#x02019;s objectivity and reliability. All statistical analyses of the collected data
were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (ver. 20.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). and the statistical significance level was set to 0.05. Differences between before
and after the training in each group were analyzed by conducting paired t-tests, and the
changes in individual groups were compared by conducting independent sample t-tests. All
statistical significance levels for the data were set to 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 40 subjects participated in this study, with 20 subjects in the experimental

intervention would affect stroke patients&#x02019; balance and gait abilities.</p><p>According to the results of the study, the experimental group that received combined
stepping training showed greater improvement in balance and gait abilities and self-efficacy
than the control group that received general physical therapy.</p><p>In the present study, the BBS and TUG test were used as measures of balance ability.
Changes in the BBS scores between before and after training both in the experimental and
control groups were compared; the results indicated a significant difference (3.01 &#x000b1; 1.19
points in the experimental group and 0.55 &#x000b1; 0.52 points in the control group) (p&#x0003c;0.05).
The changes in the TUG values between before and after training in the experimental and
control groups were compared, and the results showed a significant difference between the
two groups&#x02014;1.78 &#x000b1; 0.86&#x02005;s and 1.12 &#x000b1; 0.63&#x02005;s in the experimental and control groups,
respectively (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results are considered attributable to the fact that, when
crossing obstacles, the experimental subjects subconsciously adapted to implement motor
skills and their central nervous systems automatically developed strategies to maintain body
balance and apply mobility patterns to actual requirements<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chang et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
studied the correlation between plantar pressure and gait velocity and reported that the
improvement of weight bearing ability of the lower extremity on the paretic side increased
gait velocity. Consistent with this report, a significant difference was found when changes
in the 10-m WT results between before and after training in the experimental and the control
groups were compared (2.01&#x02005;s and 1.05&#x02005;s, respectively (p&#x0003c;0.05). Olney et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that gait velocity may be improved
by increases in stride length or step count per minute. After implementing functional
strength training, Kreb et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that increases in gait velocity were the result of improvement in the weight bearing ratio
of the two lower extremities following improvement in balance control ability.</p><p>The improvement in gait velocity of subjects in the experimental group in the present study
is considered attributable to the fact that the unilateral combined stepping exercises using
a foothold and a weight rod enhanced the level of mobility of the lower extremity on the
non-paretic side the movement of which had been restricted after the onset of stroke.
Through dynamic movement of the lower extremity of the non-paretic side, the subjects
improved balance ability by bearing weight on the lower extremity of the paretic side, and
the weight shift exercises improved gait ability through improvement of muscle strength<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby enhancing automatic development
of the ability to control the two lower extremities and the trunk. These balance and gait
abilities are closely related to the risk of falling<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, after the interventions using a foothold and
weight rod, the changes in the falls efficacy scores between before and after training in
the experimental and control groups were compared, and the results showed a significant
difference: 21.20 &#x000b1; 17.76 points and 11.03 &#x000b1; 15.13 points, respectively (p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>This result is considered to be attributable to the fact that improvement in balance and
gait abilities through step training in diverse directions led to an increase in the
subjects&#x02019; confidence.</p><p>The training program with repeated steps in diverse directions used in this study is not
restrictive in terms of time and space and is not burdensome in terms of cost. Most stroke
patient treatments implemented with passive postural control and weight shift training led
by a therapist result in low satisfaction in terms of cost and efficiency. Therefore, new
exercise programs that are cost-effective and efficient and that enable active patient
participation should be developed based on the results of the present study, which confirms
