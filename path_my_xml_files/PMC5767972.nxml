From one hundred ninety-one potential participants twenty-eight refused to participate, therefore, one hundred thirty-one (mean age 68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;years), and 88% female, were randomly assigned to an intervention group - IG (home exercise and sleep hygiene, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;65) and a control group - CG (sleep hygiene only, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;66). Sleep assessment tools were used: PSQI, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and clinical questionnaire of Berlin.

Among the main health problems observed in elderly population, with the incidence increasing proportionally with age, sleep disorders are among the most prevalent, and more than 50% of the elderlies complain about their sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">For this specific population, the pharmacologic therapeutic approach still is the most commonly used to treat sleep disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the frequent use of sleeping pills alter sleep architecture and they are associated to several adverse effects such as sedation, excessive drowsiness daytime, increased risk of falling and higher functional dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which usually are frequently observed in elderlies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to improve the quality of sleep in this population. The physical exercise of mild to moderate intensity, presents positive results in the sleep quality of elderlies and it is recommended as one of the key features of preventive and therapeutic non-pharmacologic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, despite scientific evidence demonstrating the benefits of physical exercise in health and quality of life, yet there is little adhesion to this strategy by the elderlies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The difficulty in the transfer to the location of the exercises, schedule conflict with household tasks, conditioning difference between participants and the limited supply of free programs associated to the low economic power of this population, are possible explanations for the low adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These difficulties presented by the majority of the elderlies in supervised exercises, associated with the benefits of their practice, encourage the development of other feasible programs which allow greater adherence. In a recent systematic review, the authors concluded that home-based exercise programs show better adherence when compared to group programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, according to our knowledge, a single reference was located on the practice of semi-supervised home exercise and quality of sleep of elderlies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In view of the foregoing and considering this knowledge gap, the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that an alternative program of activities, through physical exercise performed at home, semi-supervised, easy to perform and low cost, improves the perception of sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness of sedentary elderly people in the community who present sleep disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par16">It is an analytical, experimental, randomized, controlled, single blind study conducted according to the CONSORT stands for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par17">The study involved elderly aged 60&#x000a0;years or older, living in the city of Senhor do Bonfim - BA in the Brazil Northeastern region, in the period from May to September 2017.

This randomization was of the closed type, with concealment of the allocation, generating two groups, being one the control group (CG) and the other the intervention group (IG).</p><p id="Par20">All the elderlies involved in the present study participated in a 40-min presentation with explanations about the experimental procedure and they received educational leaflets containing guidelines on life habits related to feeding, hydration and sleep hygiene. The IG participants were informed that they should follow lifestyle guidelines and conduct a home physical exercise program. For that, they participated in a theoretical-practical training aimed at the adequate accomplishment of the proposed exercises and received a primer developed by the researchers, with illustrated and written guidelines on the accomplishment of the exercises, as well as a journal to record the weekly frequency of its accomplishment. The researchers, after making sure that the subjects could perform all the exercises adequately, guided the family members to help and stimulate the practice and encouraged the elderlies to call in situations of problems or doubts. The participants of the CG were informed that they should only continue with their activities of daily living and follow the guidelines related to their habits of life.</p><p id="Par21">Previously, before the beginning of the study, there were systematic trainings of assistants, five students of the physiotherapy course, exclusively for the evaluation, and ten other assistants, also students of the physiotherapy course, for home monitoring of the elderlies, five visited the subjects of the IG and the other five visited the elderlies of the CG.

It is an instrument that allows estimating the weekly energy expenditure of physical activities related to labor, transportation, domestic tasks and leisure, performed for at least 10 continuous minutes with moderate and/or vigorous intensity during a normal/usual week. This variable was dichotomized, and those who performed less than 150&#x000a0;min per week of moderate and/or vigorous physical activity were considered non-active and active those who performed more than 150&#x000a0;min per week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par29">The home exercise program was based on American College of Sports Medicine recommendations for exercise and physical activity with the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The exercise program was composed by a combination of aerobic exercises, muscle strengthening, balance, coordination and flexibility, prioritizing exercises involving large muscle groups. The protocol lasted 12 consecutive weeks, with minimum frequency of three weekly sessions, predicted time of 40&#x000a0;min and performing 2&#x02013;3 sets with 5&#x02013;15 repetitions for each exercise, a target effort rate of 13&#x02013;15 (&#x0201c;a bit difficult&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;difficult&#x0201d;) in the range of perceived exertion Borg 6&#x02013;20 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], being the exercise performed in the convenience turn chosen for the elderly. The exercises were performed individually at home by&#x000a0;each participant, having no supervision during implementation; however, receiving guidance through home visits every 15&#x000a0;days.

After three months, the participants of both groups were re-evaluated and at the end of protocol the elderlies of the IG were encouraged to continue with the exercises, while the CG was made available the follow up of the home exercises for the same period performed with the IG.</p><p id="Par38">The adherence to the exercise was verified through the weekly records filled out by the subjects themselves, with the help of family members and certified by the assistants during the home visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par39">The sample size calculation based on recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] demonstrated that it would take 63 participants per group to obtain a statistical power of 80% in the detection of 2-point difference with 5% alpha, considering a standard deviation estimated 4 points. The principle of intention-to-treat analysis was respected and for the missing data the sensitivity analysis was performed through simple imputation using the mean of the variables. To detect if randomization produced comparable groups, the characteristics of both groups were compared before the intervention using the Student&#x02019;s t-test for independent samples in relation to the numerical variables and the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables. To test the normality of the data, the histogram, mean and median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis were analyzed and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used for confirmation.

However, these studies used exercise programs with professional supervision during their execution, in addition to being performed in training and/or rehabilitation centers, which is a limiting factor for the participation of the elderlies, as they present difficulties in relation to the transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">However, in the present study, a home physical exercise program was applied, with only one-week supervision, easy to apply and low cost, which proved to be safe and feasible, since no injuries related to training were observed as well as high frequency rates (mean of 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;days per week) and small loss of follow up (4.5%).</p><p id="Par51">It has already been demonstrated in the literature that physical exercise performed at home may result in important health benefits for the elderly and, because it is appreciated by the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], there is still greater adherence and continuity after the end of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">However, the knowledge regarding the effects of home exercises on sleep quality of the elderly is still very incipient. In the present study, the elderly who participated in the home exercise program during the 12-week period showed significant improvement over the primary endpoint, self-reported quality of sleep, represented by a reduction of 4.9 points in the overall PSQI score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The significant reduction in all components of PSQI assessment, especially in relation to sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), characterizes a relevant clinical improvement, being the results consistent with the study performed by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The authors used a similar methodology to demonstrate the effectiveness of home physical exercise, by practicing the &#x0201c;Baduanjin&#x0201d; exercise technique in the self-reported quality of sleep. In that study, 56 elderly people (mean age 71.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.1) were randomized, and the IG performed the &#x0201c;Baduajin&#x0201d; exercise in their households and the CG did not perform any specific activity. The IG received a videotape, an educational booklet with pictures about the performance of the exercises, and they were instructed to perform 30&#x000a0;min of exercise 3 times a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks and received telephone follow up twice a week. After this period, the IG showed a statistically significant improvement when compared to the CG in relation to the overall PSQI score and in 5 of the 7 evaluation components, similar to the results found in the present study.</p><p id="Par53">The secondary endpoint, excessive daytime sleepiness, recognized as an important public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], was evaluated through the ESS demonstrating that the elderlies who practiced physical exercise presented a significant reduction of excessive daytime sleepiness, when compared to the CG, in which the reduction was not significant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), being consistent with the results of other studies which used supervised exercises of Yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Tai Chi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which also demonstrated a significant reduction of excessive daytime sleepiness in the exercise group, using of the same rating scale.</p><p id="Par54">The analysis of variance performed in the age subgroups has showed a significant improvement in sleep quality, however there was no significant difference, demonstrating that the home exercise program was effective in the different age groups of the elderly involved in the present study.</p><p id="Par55">One of the strengths of our study is that, after random allocation of subjects, both groups were periodically given the same orientations and stimuli in relation to life habits such as feeding, hydration and sleep hygiene. These positive results presented in our study are also related to the fact that, in addition to the program being carried out at home and composed of dynamic and easy to be performed physical exercises, the elderlies received visits every fortnight and then they were encouraged and oriented, by the research assistants and their relatives, in relation to practice of the exercises, contributing to the high rate of adherence and small loss of the participants. We also highlight the lack of reports of adverse events during the exercise period.</p><p id="Par56">Previous studies have suggested that a direct contact with participants via phone, internet or personal visits increases the adherence to home exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Follow up losses did not interfere in the results, since they occurred at random, their characteristics are homogeneous both in terms of quantity and quality of losses, since they corresponded to less than 10% of the total sample and presented reasons similar in both groups, besides the characteristics of those who remained in the study are comparable to those who did not remain.</p><p id="Par57">All these results should be interpreted taking into account some limitations of the present study. Firstly, recruitment was performed with elderlies of the community with self-reported sleep disorders, however the results may be more clinically reliable if the participants are clinically diagnosed for the disorders. There is a predominance of females in the sample, which is justified by the feminization of the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the prevalence of sleep disorders in the female elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], however the randomization generated equivalent distribution between groups. The inability to blind participants in relation to the intervention may have been tempered by the fact that each group (CG and IG) was accompanied by different assistants, minimizing the excitement bias applied by the IG assistants during home visits. The monitoring of the frequency of the exercises was self-reported, however to increase the reliability of that information, in addition to monitoring the frequency register during visits, family members were recruited to assist in collecting information. The quality of sleep was measured in a non-objective instrument, by means of validated questionnaire, that represented as perceived by the individual.</p><p id="Par58">Future studies are needed to evaluate the effects of semi-supervised home-based exercise programs with long follow up periods and using objective strategies for assessing sleep quality, and to monitor and to quantify treatment efficacy, making outcomes clinically more reliable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">The results of the present study suggest that the regular practice of semi-supervised physical exercises at home is effective in improving the self-reported quality of sleep and the reduction of daytime sleepiness in sedentary elderly people with sleep disorders in various age groups of the elderly population. Therefore, it may be considered as a therapeutic, non-pharmacological, easy-to-implement and safe resource for improving the quality of sleep of the elderlies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESS</term><def><p id="Par8">Epworth Sleepiness Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p id="Par9">International Questionnaire of Physical Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OSA</term><def><p id="Par10">Obstructive Sleep Apnea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p id="Par11">Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors are especially grateful to the elderlies who accepted to participate in the study, to the Department of Education - Campus VII, of the State University of Bahia - UNEB for providing the necessary equipment for the evaluation of the participants, the members of the QUALES research group for dedication in collecting the data and in the accompaniment of the elderly throughout the intervention period.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par60">This study was funded by the State University of Bahia, through the Support Program for the Training of Teachers and Administrative Technicians (PAC); LVFO receive grants Research Productivity, modality PQIB; Process no. 313053/2014&#x02013;6 of National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (local acronym CNPq), Brazil.
