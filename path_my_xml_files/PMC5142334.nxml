It is estimated that 2.5 million people are living with MS worldwide. Diagnosis of MS is typically between 20 and 40&#x000a0;years of age, three quarters of whom are female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MS has a range of consequences on mental health. Depression and anxiety have been found to be common in individuals with MS and have been reported to be at clinically high levels especially in the early stages of the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence of depression among individuals with MS has been found to be 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and point prevalence rates range from 15 to 26% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, anxiety affects between 16 and 45% of the MS population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and has been associated with younger age of onset, disease severity, fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and severity of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Two studies suggest that up to 36% of MS patients continue to have high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the first years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>CBT for the treatment of depression in people diagnosed with MS have demonstrated significant reductions in depression. A review of seven CBT studies (individual (3 studies), group (3 studies) and by computer (1 study)) found a medium treatment effect of 0.5 SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One study compared individual CBT with sertraline and group therapy and found that those in the CBT and the sertraline groups showed greater improvements in their levels of depression compared to those in group therapy. In addition, those in the individual CBT group displayed improvements in mood, coping, and suicidal ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Askey-Jones, David, Silber, Shaw and Chalder (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] also examined the effectiveness of a CBT delivered intervention and found that CBT resulted in statistically significant decreases in depression and anxiety with large effect sizes. More recently, Fischer et al., (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] conducted a RCT comparing a CBT based online intervention with a waitlist control group for the treatment of depression in a sample of 71 outpatients who were diagnosed with MS for a mean length of 8&#x000a0;years. The researchers found that those who completed the 9-week online CBT program reported lower BDI-II scores at post and 6&#x000a0;months follow up compared to those in a waitlist control group.</p><p>To date, there are no published studies of early provision of tailored CBT for the treatment of depression in the first five years of a MS diagnosis with interventions focused on those with established disease (greater than 8&#x000a0;years). There are good reasons for early provision of CBT for the treatment of depression in those newly diagnosed with MS. Firstly, the time around receiving a MS diagnosis has been shown to be when individuals experience significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Two studies suggest that up to 36% of MS patients continue to have high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the first two years after a diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and are at greater risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Psychological factors are likely to be contributing. For example, MS is diagnosed at a time point when individuals are typically establishing careers, relationships and families. Individuals may also be adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, the burden of uncertainty and dealing with the loss of physical and cognitive functioning, changes in interpersonal relationships, social and work roles and social support and a reduction in positively reinforcing activities. Secondly, if left untreated depression will worsen and contribute to further deterioration having an impact on the course of MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] resulting in exacerbation of MS relapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and contribute to higher suicide rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Treating depression with CBT can contribute to the alteration of disease outcomes. For example, depression has been found to be related to neurological changes in the brain due to the demyelination process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], treatment adherence to medical advice and treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], immune functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and MS disease exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, early provision of treatment of depression may lead to improvements in adherence with possible positive impacts on disease processes i.e., potentially reduce exacerbations and influence longer term MS progression via increased treatment adherence and reduce markers of MS inflammation and deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thirdly, studies have demonstrated that early recognition and treatment of depression can improve social function, increase productivity and decrease absenteeism in the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. At the social level, early intervention has been supported because the longer a person remains depressed the more strained the interpersonal and occupational roles may become.</p><p>An intervention at the time of first diagnosis, with the potential to modify the trajectory of psychological morbidity, has not been explored. In light of the burden of depression in the early stages of disease, the aims of the study were to assess the efficacy of a tailored 8-week individualized CBT intervention in the treatment of depressive symptoms (primary outcome) in individuals who are within five years of a MS diagnosis. Secondary aims were to examine improvements in levels of anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep quality, quality of life, coping, MS illness acceptance and resilience (secondary outcomes) at post and 20&#x000a0;week follow up time points and evaluate satisfaction and adherence to the tailored intervention (tertiary outcome).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a 2-group RCT with an allocation ratio of 1: 1: (1) Tailored CBT intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15); and (2) TAU (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15).

Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases. All participants responded positively to two screening questions for depressive symptoms. Participants were recruited from October 2013 to December 2014. The study was approved by the Melbourne Health ethics committee. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> outlines the flow of participants through the trial and reasons for ineligibility. Forty-seven people were approached and screened and took part in the study. 17 of the 47 screened were not eligible for the trial giving a participation rate of 64%. Fifteen participants were randomly allocated to the CBT group and 15 to the TAU control group. There were no drop outs. All participants completed the pre, post and 20&#x000a0;week follow up questionnaires. Follow up assessments ended April, 2015.

The allocation sequence was concealed from the clinician enrolling and assessing participants in opaque, sealed envelopes that were numbered in advance and opened sequentially. All clinicians were blind to the group allocation sequence. The assignment to the CBT intervention or TAU group schedule was locked away in a locked filing cabinet at the hospital. Blinding of staff and participants after assignment to interventions was not maintained.

One female senior clinical psychologist and one male provisional clinical psychologist undertook assessments. During this baseline interview, the goals and procedures were explained in detail and written consent was obtained from all participants. The <italic>Structured Clinical Interview of Disorders- Research version</italic> (SCID-I/P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was used to screen out patients with psychotic disorders and substance dependency. Participants who were eligible were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Tailored CBT intervention</title><p>The aim of the 8-week tailored intervention is to significantly decrease level of depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, fatigue and pain impact and to contribute to improvements in levels of quality of life, sleep difficulties, MS illness acceptance, active coping skills, social support and resilience (secondary outcomes) in those newly diagnosed with MS. Additionally, the pilot trial aimed to assess the adherence and acceptability among participants (tertiary outcomes) of the tailored CBT program for individuals with MS. The tailored CBT intervention lends from Beck&#x02019;s cognitive theoretical model for the treatment of depression in adults. Participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions. All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5&#x000a0;h) were 1&#x000a0;h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital. A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.</p><p>The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. For the intervention, a therapy manual was developed by the first author, which included tailored modules and skills for MS patients. Relevant and targeted treatments have been found to be more effective and preferred over generic CBT interventions among individuals with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MS specific issues such as addressing grief over MS-related losses and use of relevant examples during therapy were included in the tailored program. The intervention also focused on facilitating acceptance of MS illness and adjusting to living with MS and the final therapy session was dedicated to relapse prevention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Treatment as usual (TAU)</title><p>Participants in the TAU group did not obtain any psychological treatment for depressive symptoms or anxiety for the entire length of their involvement in the trial (20&#x000a0;weeks) and received usual medical care from their neurologist which may include 1&#x02013;3 visits for medication review during the course of involvement in the current trial.

The between group effect sizes at post treatment (range between 0.57 and 1.63) and at 20&#x000a0;weeks follow up (range between 0.44 and 1.06) strongly supported the benefits of early intervention.</p><p>Individuals in the CBT intervention reported being satisfied with the tailored 8-week intervention and adhered to the therapy.

Of note, participants indicated that the CBT intervention should be offered as part of routine care to everyone who is newly diagnosed with MS. Adherence data suggested that all participants in the CBT intervention completed all of the 8 modules including all the readings and homework and there were no drop outs suggesting individuals were self-motivated to receive the treatment. All participants also reported a strong therapeutic alliance with their therapist.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This research has several strengths. First, this study used a randomized, controlled pilot intervention design with clearly defined outcomes, and to the best of our knowledge, the first study to test an early tailored CBT intervention for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals who are within five years of being diagnosed with MS. Second, the research was conducted within a large MS clinic in a hospital service increasing the likelihood that the findings may be applicable to a wider MS population. Third, the sample was homogenous in terms of age, level of ambulation, length of MS diagnosis, MS type, education level and marital status. There were some limitations to this research. As a preliminary pilot study, it had a small sample size. Only two therapists conducted the CBT intervention. The majority of the study sample was educated and employed which may limit the generalizability of the results. The study mostly relied on self-report measures and as such there is a chance that participants may under or over report their symptoms. The current study did not compare the CBT intervention to an active comparative intervention. Future research should consider comparing the current treatment to a supportive counselling intervention which may control for non-specific therapeutic effects such as time and attention from a caring health professional. This will help to determine whether the specific components included in the CBT intervention are more effective in treating depression and resulting in broader based improvements or whether the therapeutic elements of seeing a psychologist, participating in a research study or coming in for regular appointments are just as effective in producing these improvements in those newly diagnosed with MS. The assessment period was limited to 3&#x000a0;months and it is not known if the benefits are sustained or if further &#x02018;top up&#x02019; therapy is required. Larger studies with extended follow up and adequate disease measures are required in order to determine if the current intervention can impact disease progression. Monitoring of treatment fidelity (treatment implementation) was not done by an independent rater and no audio recordings of therapy sessions were undertaken which did not allow for therapist competency ratings. Also there were only two clinical psychologists who undertook all assessments and provided the intervention. In addition, future trials should include blinding of psychologists undertaking assessments and those providing the intervention and have separate people involved with the generation and allocation concealment, enrollment of participants and implementation and monitoring of the intervention. Further studies are required to assess the cost effectiveness and efficacy of the tailored CBT intervention among larger samples in order to promote it as part of routine care for individuals newly diagnosed with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current preliminary results provide novel evidence for the benefits of early intervention for the treatment of depressive symptoms in patients newly diagnosed with MS. The tailored early CBT intervention was found to be an acceptable and effective treatment for depression in a sample of individuals newly diagnosed with MS within a hospital outpatient facility. It also had broader benefits on anxiety, fatigue and pain management, MS illness acceptance, sleep quality, MS related quality of life, coping, resilience and social support in these individuals.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACHC</term><def><p>Acceptance of chronic health conditions scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI-II</term><def><p>Beck depression inventory &#x02013; version 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDSS</term><def><p>Expanded disability status scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAQ-II</term><def><p>Helping alliance questionnaire -version 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MFIS &#x02013; 5</term><def><p>Modified fatigue impact scale &#x02013; 5 item</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MS</term><def><p>Multiple sclerosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSQOL-54</term><def><p>Multiple sclerosis quality of life &#x02013; 54 item</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PES</term><def><p>Pain effects scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSSS</term><def><p>Perceived social support scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSA</term><def><p>Resilience scale for adults</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID/IP</term><def><p>Structural clinical interview of disorders &#x02013; research version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical package for social sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAI</term><def><p>State trait anxiety inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WCQ</term><def><p>Ways of coping questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all participants, neurologists and staff at the MS clinic at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and all the MS related websites who assisted in advertising this pilot trial.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a University of Melbourne Neurosciences and Behavioural Science domain research grant.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The dataset used and analysed during the current study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LK, TK, AH contributed to the design of the study.
