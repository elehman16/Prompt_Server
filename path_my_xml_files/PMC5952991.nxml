The clusters were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IPT with DP or standard care (control) by restricted randomisation to ensure balance by geography and school type. Children in intervention schools received IPT monthly for up to six rounds (June to December, 2014). We did cross-sectional community surveys in randomly selected households at baseline and in January to April, 2015, during which we measured participants' temperatures and obtained finger-prick blood smears for measurement of parasite prevalence by microscopy. We also did entomological surveys 1 night per month in households from 20 randomly selected IPT and 20 control clusters. The primary trial outcome was parasite prevalence in the final community survey. The primary entomological survey outcome was the annual entomological inoculation rate (aEIR) from July, 2014, to April, 2015.

We assessed titles and abstracts and found no studies that had investigated the effects of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria in schoolchildren on malaria transmission at the community level. One systematic review had assessed the efficacy and safety of IPT in schoolchildren. This review included five studies, including four individually randomised trials and one cluster-randomised trial, which were done in 2002&#x02013;12 in Kenya, Mali, and Uganda, but none reported population-level health effects. Three later studies of school-based malaria interventions included one individually randomised trial of IPT for malaria and helminths in Ghana, one individually randomised trial of IPT for malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and one cluster-randomised trial of IPT for malaria plus distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in Mali. Again, none assessed population-level outcomes. One stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised trial in Senegal assessed community-level outcomes but with seasonal malaria chemoprevention in schoolchildren and not IPT. In that trial, children younger than 10 years received amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, administered by community health workers via health posts. No reduction in all-cause mortality (the primary outcome) was seen, but the incidence of confirmed malaria in community residents too old to receive seasonal malaria chemoprevention reduced significantly by 26%. These results were encouraging, but the intervention, method of assessment, and outcome measures differed substantially from those in our trial, precluding direct comparisons.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">This study in Jinja, Uganda, makes an important contribution to the limited evidence on use of IPT as a tool to reduce malaria transmission. The use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for IPT of malaria in schoolchildren was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and annual entomological inoculation rate, but these were of borderline significance. Intervention coverage, however, was lower than expected.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">Evidence on the effects of providing IPT of malaria to schoolchildren is limited, but promising. Schoolchildren are major contributors to the infectious reservoir, and providing IPT in schools offers an operationally attractive and potentially sustainable intervention that could be integrated with currently deployed malaria control methods. Additional studies are needed to explore these findings further, including assessments of the population-level effects with greater intervention coverage.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para100">In the School-based Treatment with ACTs to Reduce Transmission of malaria (START-IPT) trial, we investigated whether IPT for malaria with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in schoolchildren would affect community-level indicators of malaria transmission in Jinja district, Uganda. DP is highly efficacious and well tolerated, and is more effective than other artemisinin-based combination therapies in preventing new infections because of the long half-life of piperaquine, making it an attractive option for IPT.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We hypothesised that malaria transmission, as measured by the prevalence of asexual parasitaemia in the community and the annual entomological inoculation rate (aEIR), would be reduced by the intervention compared with no IPT.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design</title><p id="para110">START-IPT was a cluster-randomised controlled trial.

If catchment areas for more than one school overlapped, one school was selected: if a cluster contained public and private schools, public schools were prioritised, and if schools were the same type, one was chosen randomly. Clusters were assigned 1:1 to receive IPT or standard care (services typically provided by the Ministries of Health and Education; control) in a parallel design. We used restricted randomisation to ensure balance across clusters for geographical location by subcounty and school type (public or private).

Eligibility criteria were ability to locate a parent or guardian, being enrolled in an intervention school, age 5 years or older, no known allergy to DP, no menarche, no history of cardiac problems or fainting, no family history of long QT syndrome, not currently taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, and willingness of the parent or guardian to provide written informed consent. If these criteria were met, study personnel interviewed children individually at school to assess the final eligibility criteria: ability to locate the student, no menarche, weight 11 kg or greater, and provision of written assent by student if aged 8 years or older. After screening, students underwent a brief physical examination, including measurement of temperature (tympanic membrane), height, and weight. We recorded participants' fingerprints to facilitate future identification for DP treatment.</p><p id="para160">The DP preparation was full-strength Duo-Cotexcin tablets (Beijing Holley-Cotec Pharmaceuticals, Beijing, China), containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine and taken orally. IPT was delivered to students in intervention schools by study personnel, with doses given once daily for 3 days per month (one round of treatment), according to weight-based guidelines (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>), for up to six rounds of treatment. All treatments were directly observed and recorded.</p><p id="para170">To assess safety we monitored all intervention participants for serious adverse events, and a subset of participants selected by convenience sampling for cardiac monitoring.

Detailed results on safety will be reported separately.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Assessments</title><p id="para180">Cross-sectional community surveys were done in households randomly selected from each cluster at baseline (March to June, 2014) and after the intervention (January to April, 2015). The sampling frame for the baseline survey was generated from the digital enumeration done to generate clusters, and for the final survey from a census of clusters. Each survey was done in a different random sample.</p><p id="para190">Study personnel visited households for both community surveys to identify those with an adult resident available to do the survey who met the following eligibility criteria: a usual resident present on the night before the survey, age 18 years or older, and agreement to provide written informed consent. Households were excluded if the dwelling could not be found or was vacant or if no adult resident was at home on more than three visits. If selection criteria were met, a household questionnaire was administered to the head of the household or their designate to gather information on all residents, ownership and use of all bednets, and proxy indicators of wealth.</p><p id="para200">The target sample sizes of age groups varied because of age-related differences in parasite prevalence. Thus, recruitment of household residents into the community clinical surveys was stratified by age. For the baseline survey, all members of a household were eligible for inclusion. For the final survey, all members of a household aged 4 months to younger than 5 years or older than 15 years were eligible for inclusion, but for residents aged 5&#x02013;15 years, only one per household could be included, and was chosen at random by random number tables. To participate in the clinical survey, household residents were reviewed for selection criteria, including being a usual resident of the household on the night before the survey, ability to locate the resident, appropriate age, provision of written informed consent for adults or parents or guardians of children, and provision of written assent from children aged 8 years and older.</p><p id="para210">At the time of the survey, we measured each participant's temperature and obtained a finger-prick blood sample that was used to prepare a thick blood smear to measure haemoglobin concentration with a portable spectrophotometer (HemoCue, &#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden) in children younger than 5 years. Samples were stored on filter paper for future molecular testing. Rapid diagnostic testing was done with CareStart Malaria HRP2 for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (ACCESSBIO, Somerset, NJ, USA) in participants who had fever (tympanic membrane temperature &#x02265;38&#x000b7;0&#x000b0;C) or history of fever in the previous 48 h.</p><p id="para220">We did an entomological survey in 200 households, five per cluster in 20 of the IPT clusters and five per cluster in 20 of the control clusters. The clusters and households were randomly selected before the survey started. Selection criteria were as follows: the ability to locate the household; residence in the subcounty for the previous 6 months; and provision of written informed consent by the head of the household (or designate). Participating households were sampled one night per month with miniature Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (Model 512, John W Hock Company, Gainesville, FL, USA).

To detect a relative reduction of 35% in the intervention group compared with the control group in each age group and in 22% of respondents overall, we calculated that we would need to recruit 119 individuals per cluster (minimum total 9996), including 73 children younger than 5 years, 15 children aged 5&#x02013;15 years, and 31 individuals older than 15 years (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p id="para270">Sample size calculations for the final community survey were informed by data collected in the baseline survey. Calculations accounted for correlation among clusters by calculating the coefficient of variation (k).<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> We conservatively assumed a k value of 0&#x000b7;5. The number of clusters was fixed at 84. Assuming significance of 5% and power of 80%, we calculated that 105 individuals per cluster (minimum total 8820) would allow detection of a relative reduction in parasite prevalence of 29%, based on 21% prevalence in the control group. This estimate was supported by mathematical modelling estimates<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> that we adapted to simulate the START-IPT trial design and setting. This relative difference in parasitaemia would correspond to an absolute difference in parasite prevalence of 6% (21% <italic>vs</italic> 15%). Additionally, we weighted the sample sizes of age groups to ensure 80% power to detect a relative difference in parasite prevalence of 30&#x000b7;0% between study groups for children younger than 5 years (n=64), 34&#x000b7;5% for children aged 5&#x02013;15 years (n=14), and 40% for individuals older than 15 years (n=27).</p><p id="para280">For the entomological survey, we calculated a k value of 0&#x000b7;57 for variation between houses, based on preliminary data from Uganda (Dorsey G, unpublished).

Thus, all community residents were classified as participating in the intervention or control irrespective of whether they (or their children) received the intervention. For all analyses, we used statistical methods that allowed for within-cluster correlations, and analysed data with STATA/IC version 12.1. All outcomes were assessed at the individual level because of the large number of clusters per study group.</p><p id="para300">For binary prevalence outcomes, we used generalised linear Poisson models with log link function. We compared the effects of the intervention between groups with prevalence risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. The probability of selection for the final community survey was related to the sampling frame, which was determined by the expected parasite prevalence in the age categories younger than 5 years, 5&#x02013;15 years, and older than 15 years. Therefore, the age structure of the study population was not representative of the community population overall. To account of this discrepancy, we assigned individuals one of three weights based on their age, calculated as the inverse of the percentage of people in each age group in the census survey. Population estimates of prevalence were obtained with svy commands in STATA, with the cluster as the primary sampling unit.</p><p id="para310">The annual human biting rate was calculated as total number of female <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp mosquitoes captured/number of house-nights of collection&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;365&#x000b7;25 days per year. The sporozoite rate was calculated as the number of mosquitoes positive for sporozoites&#x02008;/&#x02008;the number of mosquitoes tested. The aEIR was the product of the annual human biting rate and the sporozoite rate. We compared aEIRs between study groups with negative binomial regression (to account for overdispersion), with random effects for clusters and repeated measures. The number of mosquitoes positive for sporozoites was used as the outcome with an offset variable of the natural log of the number of house-nights of capture and having a coefficient constrained to 1. Households selected for the entomological survey were randomly selected and, therefore, needed no weighting. We did a subgroup analysis to assess whether the effect of the intervention changed over time in three time periods after the intervention was first implemented: 1&#x02013;3 months (July to September, 2014), 4&#x02013;6 months (October to December, 2014), and 7&#x02013;10 months (January to April, 2015).

In this cluster-randomised trial, monthly IPT with DP provided to children in primary schools in a population with high insecticide-treated net coverage was associated with reductions in measures of malaria transmission, including parasite prevalence in community residents and sporozoite rate, compared with in the control group, although these differences were of borderline significance. However, given that coverage (43%) was substantially lower than desired targets, they are notable. Additional studies of IPT in schoolchildren to investigate the community-level effects with greater IPT coverage are warranted.</p><p id="para400">Despite an erratic history, chemoprevention is likely to be an important addition to existing malaria control strategies, partly because of renewed interest in treating asymptomatic individuals to reduce transmission. Chemoprevention can be delivered in various ways to communities, including mass or intermittent screening and treatment, mass drug administration, and IPT of specific high-risk populations. Mass drug administration reduces malaria parasitaemia and transmission,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and WHO recommends mass drug administration in specific settings, including elimination campaigns and epidemics, and to control the spread of drug-resistant parasites.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> A study of the short-term effects of two rounds of mass drug administration with DP in Zambia showed community-wide reductions in parasite prevalence, particularly in low-transmission areas.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Nevertheless, the effects of mass drug administration are temporary unless treatment is repeated or delivered in the context of highly effective vector control,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> raising concerns about feasibility and sustainability. The potential for mass drug administration, and to a lesser degree other drug-based interventions, to suppress naturally acquired immunity and contribute to rebound infections and to accelerate the development of drug resistance, are other concerns.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Studies of mass screening and antimalarial treatment to individuals who tested positive for malaria infection in Burkina Faso and Zambia had little effect,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> due partly to the poor sensitivity of diagnostic tools available for use in field trials.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> By contrast, IPT of young children, which is highly effective against morbidity and mortality and has been operationalised as seasonal malaria chemoprevention in west Africa, has had a dual effect: in Senegal, chemoprevention delivered to children up to age 10 years reduced the incidence of malaria in children in the wider community by 60% and in older residents by 26%. This strategy might, therefore, have a role in transmission reduction, particularly if the age range of recipients is extended.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The results from our trial contribute to the growing body of evidence of the effectiveness of IPT for malaria in older children,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and suggest that reducing the infectious reservoir could have positive effects on the surrounding community. Operationally, IPT of schoolchildren is likely to be more feasible than community-based delivery programmes, and should be considered as a strategy for malaria control in school-aged children and a sustainable approach to reduce transmission. Further research is needed to explore feasibility and effects on larger scales.</p><p id="para410">Achieving high coverage is key to the success of chemoprevention programmes.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In this study, coverage was well below the target. Several factors contributed to the low uptake of the intervention, including community perceptions about IPT and the multistep informed consent process. We sensitised key stakeholders before recruiting study participants by meeting with individuals from health and education sectors at the national and district levels. We also established a community advisory board that included representatives from across Jinja district. Nevertheless, we found recruitment of children in the 42 intervention schools difficult. Screening was done over at least two sessions, first with parents at parent-teacher association meetings (or at home), followed by interviews with students at school. The parent-teacher association meetings were poorly attended because parents were often at work, and parents or guardians were frequently unavailable for home visits and were difficult to trace. This experience is similar to that in another school-based study done in Kenya.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Additionally, some community members were initially suspicious of the IPT intervention and the motives behind it, as has been seen in other studies.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Intensive community engagement was needed to address these attitudes, which prolonged recruitment but increased success. Intervention coverage increased throughout the study, and might be improved in future research projects and IPT programmes by streamlining the consent process and including dialogue with community members to improve understanding of their perspectives and concerns and to address tensions and rumours.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In a pilot study in Malawi, the addition of malaria treatment to an existing mass drug administration programme for neglected tropical diseases was well received, and coverage among children was 87%.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In Uganda, and potentially in other countries, if IPT of schoolchildren were to be scaled up to a national programme with support of the Ministries of Health and Education, community perception and intervention coverage might be improved and the challenges of obtaining consent minimised.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="para420">We saw no effect of IPT on the secondary outcomes, including prevalence of parasitaemia assessed by microscopy and LAMP, gametocytaemia, or anaemia. Our approach to selecting samples for LAMP assessments, which was done in only 25% of samples negative on microscopy in children younger than 5 years and 50% of negative samples in those older than 15 years, might have affected our results. Although we accounted for our sampling approach in our analysis of the data, the selected samples might not have been representative of the population overall. The lack of effect of IPT on low-density infections identified by LAMP might also reflect that IPT works by preventing incident infections rather than by treating chronic low-density infections. Gametocytaemia was determined from thick blood smears, which is less sensitive than molecular amplification of specific sexual stage genes,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> but we did not have the resources to do molecular tests. IPT of schoolchildren with amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Kenya and Mali substantially reduced the prevalence of anaemia,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> but in Uganda, anaemia is primarily seen in children younger than 5 years. The lack of effect on anaemia in this study is unsurprising with the low coverage of IPT and the multifactorial nature of anaemia, in which helminth infections and poor nutrition are likely to be important contributing factors.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p id="para430">This study had several other limitations. First, because of the challenges related to recruitment, the number of children participating in the intervention group increased gradually. Ideally, enrolment would have been completed before IPT was started to enable high coverage for all six rounds of treatment. Second, attendance at cluster schools by children in the school catchment areas was surprisingly low, possibly because of travel to school and absenteeism. In 2006, 82% of primary-school-aged children in Uganda were reported to attend school, but absenteeism, particularly in rural areas, was an issue.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Clear mapping of catchment areas of schools would facilitate improved assessment of intervention effects. Third, we opted not to provide a placebo to children enrolled in the control schools, which might have affected treatment-seeking behaviour of schoolchildren or community members. Fourth, our approach to microscopy (examining slides at up to 100 high-power fields before classifying them as negative) could have lacked sensitivity for low-density infections. Examinations at magnifications of up to 200 or 500 high-power fields might increase sensitivity. Finally, we opted to exclude girls at menarche in attempt to avoid administering DP in early pregnancy. Although this approach had operational advantages, it also denied these girls the potential health benefits of IPT and had the unexpected consequence of raising suspicion within the community regarding the reasons for excluding older girls.</p><p id="para440">Targeted IPT of schoolchildren with DP as an approach to malaria control at the community level in Jinja district, Uganda, might have a positive effect on malaria indicators. Coverage in our study, however, was lower than expected and differences between groups were only of borderline significance. This study makes an important contribution to the evidence for the use of IPT as a tool to reduce malaria transmission. Schoolchildren are major contributors to the infectious reservoir. In high transmission areas, innovative approaches to malaria control will be needed to reduce and ultimately eliminate the burden of malaria. IPT of schoolchildren offers an operationally attractive and potentially sustainable intervention that could be integrated with currently deployed malaria-control methods. Future studies should investigate how to achieve high coverage, methods to integrate IPT with other school-based programmes and control measures, the potential effects on naturally acquired immunity and risk of rebound, and the risk of accelerating antimalarial drug resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
