The primary assessment was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 16. Secondary outcome measures included psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) and dactylitis and enthesitis assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 16, 86.3% of patients receiving infliximab plus methotrexate and 66.7% of those receiving methotrexate alone achieved an ACR20 response (p&#x0003c;0.02). Of patients whose baseline PASI was 2.5 or greater, 97.1% receiving infliximab plus methotrexate compared with 54.3% receiving methotrexate alone experienced a 75% or greater improvement in PASI (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Improvements in C-reactive protein levels, DAS28 response and remission rates, dactylitis, fatigue and morning stiffness duration were also significantly greater in the group receiving infliximab. In the infliximab plus methotrexate group, 46% (26/57) had treatment-related adverse events (AE) and two patients had serious AE, compared with 24% with AE (13/54) and no serious AE in the methotrexate-alone group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with infliximab plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients with active PsA demonstrated significantly greater ACR20 response rates and PASI75 improvement compared with methotrexate alone and was generally well tolerated.

Active disease was defined as the presence of five or more swollen joints, five or more tender joints and at least one of the following: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 28 mm/h or greater; C-reactive protein (CRP) 15 mg/l or greater, or morning stiffness for 45 min or more. Patients were naive to methotrexate, infliximab and other biological agents, and those with known contraindications to methotrexate or infliximab were excluded from participation. Leflunomide and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) could not be used within 6 months or 12 weeks, respectively, before study screening. Tacrolimus and ciclosporin could not be used in the 4 weeks before screening. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and oral steroids (maximum dose 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was allowed if the dose was stable within 4 weeks before screening and kept stable throughout the study. Patients could not be included if they had active or untreated latent tuberculosis, opportunistic or other uncontrolled infections, a history of lymphoproliferative disease or malignancy in the 5 years before screening, or any other significant and uncontrolled disorder. A tuberculin skin test and chest x-ray were performed during screening within 30 days of receiving a first infliximab infusion and/or dose of methotrexate.</p><p>The study was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each of the participating study sites. All patients provided written informed consent before participating in any study-related activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase IIIB, randomised, prospective, open-label study conducted in 25 centres in Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and Turkey. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms (1:1) to receive either infliximab 5 mg/kg infusions at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14 plus methotrexate 15 mg/week, or methotrexate 15 mg/week alone. In both groups, methotrexate could be increased to 20 mg/week at week 6 if improvement of 20% in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria (ACR20) was not achieved. Assessments were performed at weeks 2, 6 and 14. The final study visit was at week 16.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR20 response from baseline at week 16. Secondary efficacy endpoints included proportions of patients with ACR50 and ACR70 responses, 75% improvement in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) in subjects whose baseline PASI was 2.5 or greater, and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. All rheumatologists were trained to perform PASI scoring. Change from baseline was investigated for the individual ACR core domains (ie, physician and patient global assessment of disease activity, patient self-reports of pain and disability, and CRP), PASI and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) scores, number of digits with dactylitis, Maastricht ankylosing spondylitis enthesitis score, fatigue (visual analogue scale), duration of morning stiffness, ESR and CRP. As measures of clinical remission/minimal disease activity (MDA), the following outcomes were reported at week 16: absence of swollen joints, tender joints, enthesitis and dactylitis; normal CRP; DAS28 remission (&#x0003c;2.6); PASI90 response; and published criteria for MDA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Axial disease was not assessed.</p><p>Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reporting, changes in physical examination findings, clinical laboratory test results and vital signs at all visits. Investigators assessed AE severity and relationship to study treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>It was determined that a sample size of 216 (108 per treatment group) would allow detection of a 20% difference in the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response with 85% power. This assessment was made assuming the use of a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with a significance level of 0.05 and assuming a 50% response for infliximab plus methotrexate and a 30% response for methotrexate alone. To allow for dropouts (the anticipated dropout rate was 10%), up to 243 subjects were to be enrolled.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomly assigned subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had baseline as well as at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. The efficacy-evaluable per-protocol (PP) population included all of the subjects who followed the protocol and had both baseline and week 16 efficacy data. Protocol violators were identified and the PP population decided before database lock based on a blinded review of the data. The ITT population was the primary population for the superiority analyses. As the rate of exclusion due to protocol violations exceeded 5% in each treatment group, a PP population was also analysed.</p><p>A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the proportions of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at week 16. To limit bias and capture the difference in response between the infliximab plus methotrexate and methotrexate-alone groups, the study protocol specified that non-responders were patients: with missing ACR data; who withdrew due to lack of efficacy or loss of response; who received additional treatments or study medication doses outside the protocol; and who underwent surgical joint procedures. This method was chosen over non-responder imputation, which is criticised in the statistical literature for being biased and invalid even under highly restrictive assumptions about patterns of missingness, such as data that are missing completely at random.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>

These post-hoc analyses were requested during the journal peer-review process.</p><p>Change from baseline in the PASI score was compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance with baseline values as the covariate. Similarly, change from baseline in DAS28 and all other secondary endpoints were compared using analysis of covariance with baseline values as the covariate, unless there were analysis methods more appropriate for the observed distribution. The difference in EULAR response between groups at each visit was assessed by testing between treatments in mean ridit scores.</p><p>The safety population included all subjects who took at least one study dose. No formal statistical testing was performed to compare the safety data between treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Results</title><sec id="s7"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>As a result of the restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment was slow (May 2006&#x02013;March 2008) and was halted at 115 subjects: 57 randomly assigned to infliximab plus methotrexate, 58 to methotrexate alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Four subjects in the methotrexate group withdrew consent before receiving study treatment.

A greater degree of improvement was demonstrated with infliximab plus methotrexate therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy for every measure examined. This was an open-label study; therefore these results must be confirmed in a blinded fashion.</p><p>In the first IMPACT study, the mean disease duration of PsA was 11 years or greater and all patients had failed treatment with at least one DMARD (approximately 50% had failed with two or more DMARD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> In IMPACT 2, disease duration was approximately 8 years, 79.5% of patients had used at least one DMARD, and 68.5% of patients had used methotrexate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> In the current study, patients had a relatively short disease duration (mean duration 2.8&#x02013;3.7 years), and the majority were naive to methotrexate and most other DMARD. Observed levels of baseline disease activity and disability were similar to those observed for IMPACT patients in terms of swollen joint count, tender joint count, disease activity score, health assessment questionnaire&#x02013;disability index and patient/physician global assessments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In this earlier treatment setting there is a strikingly larger treatment effect at week 14 on joints and skin. ACR20 response rates in the IMPACT 1 and 2 studies were 67.3% and 58.0%, respectively, for infliximab (with or without methotrexate) and 11.3% and 11.0% for placebo, whereas they were greater than 80% for infliximab plus methotrexate and greater than 60% for methotrexate in the current study. PASI75 response to infliximab was 68.0% at week 16 for IMPACT 1 and 63.9% at week 14 for IMPACT 2, whereas they were less than 5% for placebo in both studies. In the current study, the PASI responses are again significantly higher for both combination therapy and methotrexate alone.</p><p>The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations for PsA support the use of disease-modifying therapy in all patients with moderate or severe peripheral arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Furthermore, the recommendations state that there is no evidence to support the use of conventional DMARD ahead of TNF inhibitors and that TNF inhibitors could be considered as first-line therapy in patients with a poor prognosis even if they have not failed treatment with a standard DMARD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The EULAR recommendations for the management of PsA are more conservative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> While noting that few studies have investigated the use of DMARD in PsA, they recommend that patients with active disease despite NSAID receive a DMARD &#x02018;early&#x02019; (ie, a few weeks to 1 year) and methotrexate is the first choice. Upon DMARD failure and non-achievement of target low-disease activity, TNF inhibitors may be considered in patients with still-active disease.</p><p>In the present study, the high ACR20 and PASI75 response rates in methotrexate-alone patients support GRAPPA and EULAR recommendations to use methotrexate in active PsA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> In light of the paucity of data for methotrexate and considering the severity of the population, this study provides important new evidence further establishing the efficacy of this DMARD in PsA. Differences between the infliximab plus methotrexate and methotrexate-alone groups were larger when more difficult to achieve outcomes such as ACR50, ACR70 and MDA were evaluated. This supports the GRAPPA recommendation to use combination therapy including an anti-TNF agent in poor-prognosis patients even if methotrexate alone has not been tried.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Until now, there has been little evidence for any treatment providing effective relief for dactilitis and enthesitis associated with PsA. GRAPPA suggests that high-quality evidence is available only for TNF inhibitors in the treatment of severe enthesitis and dactylitis, and at present infliximab is the only TNF inhibitor recommended for the treatment of dactylitis on the basis of available evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Our study supports this recommendation and demonstrates that infliximab plus methotrexate is more effective than methotrexate monotherapy, although enthesitis only differed numerically between the two treatment groups.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Recruitment was slow and, for practical reasons, was halted before attainment of the target number (216 patients). The slow pace was due to the requirement that subjects be methotrexate naive and have active PsA, as defined by the protocol. The smaller sample size is a study limitation because large studies produce narrow confidence intervals and more precise results. Significant results in a small study highlight the effect size of therapy. Some bias is introduced because of the open-label design, as many of the outcome measures were self-reported and subjective or were assessed by non-blinded evaluators. This probably had an effect on the compliance with methotrexate use and may very well have inflated the response rates in both treatment arms. Although subjective measures were used to assess many of the outcomes in this study, the objective measures, such as CRP and ESR, also significantly differed between the treatment groups. In addition, the significant differences between the two groups in remission/MDA outcomes suggest robust results despite the open-label design. It is possible that a longer study period and better compliance with treatment would have revealed increasing efficacy of methotrexate. Confirmation of methotrexate efficacy in this population via a blinded, placebo-controlled study and comparison of infliximab and methotrexate monotherapies clearly merit additional research.</p><p>Infliximab plus methotrexate treatment was generally well tolerated. Although there was a higher reported incidence of AE and withdrawals due to AE, this was consistent with the previously reported safety profile for infliximab, and no new safety signals were observed.</p><p>The use of infliximab plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients with PsA achieved greater improvements in all clinical outcomes measured than the use of methotrexate alone. Response was more rapid with combination therapy, and it accomplished profound disease suppression in a significantly larger proportion of patients by week 16 compared with methotrexate monotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Jacqueline M Mahon, MA, provided editorial assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> Financial support for this study was provided by Schering-Plough Corporation, now Merck, Sharp &#x00026; Dohme Corporation, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, USA.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> A Baranauskaite, H Raffayov&#x000e1;, N Kungurov, A Kubanova, and A Venalis have nothing to disclose.
