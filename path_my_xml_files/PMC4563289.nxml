normal daily lives and perform intended activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, difficulty with balance and postural control in stroke
patients leads to defective movement ability, interferes with detailed performance of upper
limb functions, and disables walking and activities of daily living<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, balance is the most basic requirement to prevent
falling, undertake the activities of daily living, and maintain an independent life in
stroke patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To restore the balance
of poststroke hemiplegic patients, motor learning methods have been used, such as lateral
weight shifting<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, a method using
balls<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, raising the foot of the
unaffected side on a board at a certain height<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, visual feedback training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and auditory feedback training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance training on an unstable surface has also been used. Training on an unstable surface
rather than a stable surface can generate more external sway, thus improving postural
control ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, can induce more diverse
motions and muscular uses, can increase proprioceptive senses, and can potentially change
the neuromuscular mobilization pattern<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The training requires the subject to maintain their balance and posture or shift their
weight on unstable surfaces, such as a sling, a rocker board, a Swiss ball, a balance ball,
and a balance pad. Furthermore, as another approach to balance training, task-oriented
training repeats functional movements that are required for actual living. There are various
studies that have found better results for gait or gait-related functions of stroke patients
with the application of task-oriented training rather than simply increasing the movement of
hemiplegic limbs<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, focusing
on repeated functional tasks helps to improve the motor functions of stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many activities of daily living require the performance of more than one task at a
time<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and include dual tasks that
involve the simultaneous performance of two movement tasks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Performing one task while simultaneously performing another task
or performing two or more tasks continuously and simultaneously is referred to as &#x0201c;dual-task
performance&#x0201d;<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. When put into a
situation of dual-task performance, people whose cognitive or physical functions are not
smooth, such as stroke patients and the aged, lose their physical abilities or experience
physical injuries, such as falls<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, studies are being
conducted on the application of dual-task performance for subjects such as stroke patients
and aged people<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yang et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> observed a reduction of actual movements
in patients with neurological injuries due to various tasks and emphasized the importance of
performing dual tasks through behavior enhancement by performing two exercise tasks
simultaneously in a complex environment. Furthermore, Canning et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that two exercise tasks must be performed
simultaneously to effectively carry out complex tasks, such as the activities of daily
living, and Erickson et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that training in dual-task situations resulted in more positive results, such as an increase
in cerebral blood flow, than training in single-task situations. Dual-task training methods
include performing a cognitive task, such as calculating numbers or guessing an answer while
performing a functional task, or simultaneously performing two or more exercise tasks, such
as moving things or throwing and holding balls, to promote functional activities<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study by Yang et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
application of exercises based on dual tasks to chronic stroke patients, improved their gait
ability. In a study by Schwent et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>,
12 weeks of dual-task training in dementia patients improved their dual-task performance
abilities compared with a control group. Furthermore, Canning et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that application of multi-task training for 8
weeks to patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease resulted in improved confidence in performing
multiple tasks, decreased mental and physical fatigue, reduced senses of difficulty and
anxiety, and enhanced gait speed in multiple tasks. These results of previous studies were
brought about by formation of the ability to integrate multiple exercise tasks into complex
environment of daily living. This was achieved by performing exercise tasks while already
performing another task<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most
studies on dual-task training have focused on enhancement of task performance abilities, and
there are few studies on the effects of dual-task training on improvement of balance
ability.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, the effects of dual-task training on the balance ability of
stroke patients were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke diagnosed
by a rehabilitation doctor practicing in N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a dual-task training group (DTG; 9 male, 11 female) and a
single-task training group (STG; 12 male, 8 female). The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight
of the DTG was 55.37 &#x000b1; 20.6&#x02005;years, 165.00 &#x000b1; 9.53&#x02005;cm, and 64.12 &#x000b1; 14.12&#x02005;kg, respectively.
Eleven of the patients had right hemiplegia, and nine had left hemiplegia. The onset period
was 14.75 &#x000b1; 6.06 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the STG was 57.10 &#x000b1;
7.83&#x02005;years, 162.20 &#x000b1; 9.21&#x02005;cm, and 63.20 &#x000b1; 11.26&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eight of the patients had
right hemiplegia, and 12 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.30 &#x000b1; 3.40 months. The
inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the vestibular
organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, the ability to understand
and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or higher on the
Mini-Mental State Examination&#x02014;Korean version. This study was approved by the University
Institutional Review Board, and all the subjects understood the purpose of the study and
provided written informed consent prior to participation, in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The training method was as follows. The subjects in the single-task traing group stood in a
comfortable position on the therapy room floor, faced a therapist, then threw a Swiss ball
back and forth. During this training, the therapist adjusted the direction and speed of the
ball in such a way that the center of gravity of the patients would move out of the base of
support (BOS) and then return to its original position<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Next, the subjects performed balance training, which involved
raising and lowering two ankles while facing the forward<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> or moving objects from one table to another table in a standing
position<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lastly, the subjects
performed balance training while facing forward in a tandem standing position. The patients
were accompanied by a support therapist or guardian, who simultaneously performed the
training near them to ensure that they did not trip or fall. The DTG performed dual tasks,
which involved performing a task on an unstable surface using a balance pad (Airex,Sins,
Switzerland). Their tasks were identical to those of the STG.</p><p>The participants (n = 40) were randomly divided into the STG (n = 20) and the DTG (n = 20).
Both groups completed 30 minutes of exercise each day, five times a week for 8 weeks. For
measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 BioRescue, RM
Ingenierie, Rodez, France) was used to determine weight bearing, sway length, anterior range
LOS (limit of stability), and posterior range LOS on the affected side in a static standing
position. For the measurement of dynamic balance, we used the Berg Balance Scale (BBS).</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, a
paired t-test was used to compare the variations in weight distribution on the affected side
when standing, sway length, anterior LOS, posterior LOS, and BBS scores. The significance of
differences between the two groups was investigated using an independent t-test. Statistical
significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the DTG and the STG showed significant differences between before and after the

high-intensity training and appropriate practices that allow volutary use of specific
motions and functions that are similar to actual tasks<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, adjusting the patient&#x02019;s pelvic movement is critical because dynamic balance is
controlled by the harmonious movement between the pelvis and the upper body as well as by
the muscles around the hip joint; the weights of the head, upper limbs, and trunk is
transferred to the lower limbs through the pelvis<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a therapeutic method for restoration of this function,
dual-task training is very popular, and active research is being conducted on the
performance of dual tasks that reduce postural sway and improve postural stability.
Therefore, in this study, stroke patients were classified into two groups: an STG that
performed various training exercises on the floor, and a DTG that balanced on a balance pad
and performed various training exercises. As a result, both the DTG and the STG showed
improvements in static balance and dynamic balance. This result agrees with the report of
Sackley and Baguly<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, who showed that the
amount of body sway significantly decreased in hemiplegic patients trained to shift their
weight to a target that moved within the range of the individual&#x02019;s stability limit. The
reason for this is the increase in weight shifting and dynamic balance movements, which
effectively restore dynamic balance, as a result of the various training methods performed
in the STG, such as moving the center of the body out of the base of support and then
returning it to its original position.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that the balance ability of the DTG
increased more significantly compared with the STG. This was similar to the results of
Irion<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that a balancing
exercise on an unstable surface promoted postural control and dynamic balance compared with
training on a stable surface. Smania et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>reported that stroke patients who had performed a balancing exercise
on a stable surface for 2 weeks followed by a balance exercise on an unstable surface,
showed significant differences in balance and gait speed after their experiment.
Furthermore, a study that compared a group that performed a balance exercises on an unstable
surface with a control group reported that there were significant differences in BBS scores
and Activities-specific Balance.</p><p>Confidence Scale scores between their experimental group and control group. Soo-Chan Bae et
al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that significant
improvements in postural sway and left and right weight support rates appeared after balance
exercise on an unstable surface in stroke patients. Balance exercises on an unstable surface
sensitizes muscle spindles through the gamma motor neurons, resulting in the improvement of
motor output, which influences the stiffness of joints<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. The result of improved balance ability after training on an
unstable surface is similar to the results of previous studies, but the objective of this
study was to investigate whether the dual- task training on an unstable surface improves
dynamic balance as well as static balance in stroke patients. The results of this study are
supported by the previous study of Dennis et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that the test results for standing up and walking (of
the experimental group) improved compared with the control group as a result of circulation
and gait tasks (including dual tasks performed by chronic stroke patients). A study by
Kramer et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when
different balance control training programs were applied to three groups, the balance of the
group that performed dual tasks improved, which also supports the findings of this study.
These previous studies&#x02019; results were brought about by formation of the ability to integrate
multiple exercise tasks in the complex environment of daily living by performing an exercise
task while already performing anothe task<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most fundamental goal of treatment in stroke patients is to return the patients to
society. For this reason, the recovery of balance ability in stroke patients has been a very
important goal of physical therapy and has been regarded as having a high research value.
Furthermore, enhancement of the balance ability of patients through dual tasks has clinical
significance in several areas. As patients show diverse reactions to the level of dual
tasks, assessment of dual tasks can be very important for stroke patients and can contribute
to the individual therapy plans of patients.</p><p>Furthermore, compared with the traditional single-task exercise task, dual tasks are
performed in activities of daily living and, therefore, they can be a better indicator of
functional daily living in the stroke patient.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Horak</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical measurement of postural control in
