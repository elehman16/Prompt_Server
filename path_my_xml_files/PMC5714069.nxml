Some of these activities are aerobic in nature, while others are of high intensity and short duration, such as cross-country skiing sprint races. Cross-country ski races involve intense, physiological stress, taxing the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscular systems.</p><p>Peripheral vasoconstriction, influence by thermoreceptors in the skin, and bronchoconstriction play important roles in athletes&#x02019; physical performance during cold exposure by changing peripheral blood flow patterns and pulmonary gas exchange. In fact, numerous authors have reported that both anaerobic and aerobic performance is significantly reduced during cold exposure.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr4-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Patton and Vogel<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> noted a 38% decrease in the time to exhaustive exercise at 78% maximal oxygen uptake during &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C cold exposure.

The use of a heat and moisture exchange (HME) mask, worn over the mouth and nose, aids in warming inspired cold air. The airway chamber of the mask contains a thermal medium of copper that acts as a heat sink by trapping expired heat and water vapor. Heat is released via latent transfer upon cold air inhalation. Thus, the inspired cold air is warmed and humidified as it passes through the chamber in the mask. Warmed, humidified air reduces cardiovascular and respiratory stresses compared to cold air alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>With the high ventilations observed during high-intensity work, it is plausible that cold air inhalation could negatively affect performance. It is not known, however, if an HME will warm and humidify the cold air sufficiently to have an influence on high-intensity exercise performance. Thus, this study investigated the influence of a HME on cardiopulmonary function during repeated sprint performance exercise in the cold and further to compare sprint performance in the cold to room temperature (RT). We propose that the use of an HME may result in an improved performance and lower cardiopulmonary stress compared to no mask. Furthermore, exercising in a cold condition could affect performance when compared to RT exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-2050312117740985"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section7-2050312117740985"><title>Subjects</title><p>The intention of this prospective, non-randomized study was to investigate the recovery benefits of performance and hemodynamic and pulmonary function parameters of using a HME mask during sprint exercise in a cold environment. Based on data from previous studies, mean and standard deviations were used with a power analysis of the chosen endpoints in this study to establish that eight subjects were required for this study. Following written approval from the Institutional Review Board prior to enrolling subjects, eight healthy (two females and six males) subjects volunteered to participate. This study commenced and was completed during February and March. Written informed consent was provided by the subjects prior to data collection. Subjects ranged in age from 21 to 28&#x02009;years (mean 23.4&#x02009;years) and were accustomed to high-intensity exercise. The average height of the subjects was 1.79&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07&#x02009;m, average weight was 75.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.4&#x02009;kg, and their average body mass index (BMI) was 23.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9. Three subjects were competitive cross-country skiers, two were competitive cyclists, and three were well-trained, but non-competitive, exercisers.</p><p>Subjects refrained from exercise, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages for 24&#x02009;h before their trials. Subjects were instructed to maintain similar dietary habits and to refrain from exercise for 24&#x02009;h prior to the trials. Each subject was instructed to eat and drink 3&#x02009;h prior to the scheduled testing. All exercise trials were conducted 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;h post prandial, but were consistent within each subject. Layers of clothing were similar for both cold trial arms. The insulated clothing was only worn during the rest periods, which consisted of a base layer, sweatshirt, ski jacket, mittens, ski pants, and a ski hat at rest. For each exercise session, the subjects wore the base layer, sweatshirt, mittens, ski hat, and tights on their legs. Subjects removed their jackets for the exercise. Subjects were dressed in shorts and t-shirt for the RT trial.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2050312117740985"><title>Procedures and equipment</title><p>Exercise consisted of cycling three 35-kJ test sprint sessions and one practice trial, all of which were performed with a resistance of 4% of body weight on a Monark #868 ergometer (mean resistance: 3.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;kg). Following collection of baseline data (blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), vital capacity (VC), inspiratory capacity (IC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)), all subjects were given a 10&#x02009;min warm up at 100&#x02009;W immediately before the first sprint session, and in addition, a 2&#x02009;min warm up was employed before each subsequent sprint trial period. Each sprint session was separated by a 20&#x02009;min seated rest period, as determined from previous studies.</p><p>As previously stated, subjects completed one practice sprint session at RT and three experimental sprint trials. The practice trial was used to minimize the learning effect. The three trials were counterbalanced and each trial was separated by at least 1&#x02009;week.

Sprint performance in the cold was enhanced when an HME was worn compared to no mask. The HME also produced benefits in measured cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters, as well as an improvement in some measured parameters of pulmonary function while exposed to cold air compared to the CNM trial. The performance and physiological responses in the cold during the HME trial were similar to those from the RT trials.</p><p>Hackney et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported that anaerobic sprint performance decreased significantly during cold exposure performed before and after 4.5&#x02009;days of military field operations in a temperature range from &#x02212;2&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;22&#x000b0;C. These authors noted that unavailable substrates, buffering insufficiency, muscle tissue damage, and dehydration may have led to the decrement in anaerobic sprinting performance, not necessarily limited to exercise in the cold. There may be an alternative explanation from those put forth by Hackney et al., which could account for the performance decrement observed only in the CNM trial and not the HME arm of this study. It is unlikely that subjects in this study suffered from the same acute effects as noted by Hackney et al. since they completed the exercise protocol, on average, 4&#x02009;h post prandial, ingested 200&#x02009;mL of water 60&#x02009;min prior to exposure, and did not exercise for 24&#x02009;h before their trials. Similarly, Faulkner et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and Ferretti et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> noted detrimental changes in muscle performance with decreases in temperature during exercise. Faulkner et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> observed a decrease in force production as muscle temperature decreased, while Ferretti et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> reported that anaerobic power has a direct relationship with temperature since adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis was reduced when muscle temperature decreased by 8&#x000b0;C. Although not measured in this study, it is doubtful that the cyclists&#x02019; muscle temperatures decreased to the extent noted by Ferretti et al. because of the short duration of the rest periods between the sprints and subjects who wore insulated clothing during the rest period. Since there were no statistical differences in performance and physiological variables between HME and RT trials, the most plausible explanation for enhancing performance is to minimize physiological stress by warming the cold inspired air during the rest or recovery periods. Theoretically, the results of this study suggest that the inhalation of cold air influenced sprint performance by effecting changes in vascular and bronchial diameters due to temperature-generated reactivity.</p><p>Kippelen and Anderson<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> state that maintenance of airway integrity is very important due to its role as a physical barrier against the environmental toxins and injuries. These epithelial cells also play a role in modulating inflammation and our immune response.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Certain conditions or states can injure our airway epithelium, such as high-level exercise or when one exercises in cold dry air or in polluted air. The subsequent injury-repair scenario can contribute to the development of bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which has been observed in elite athletes.</p><p>Recovery from exercise in the cold can produce a vasoconstrictive effect in the peripheral vasculature when blood flow is shunted from the periphery to the core, which ultimately can influence peripheral perfusion. Ferretti et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> reported blood flow, and perfusion of the peripheral tissue beds are reduced as temperature decreased during cold immersion. If blood perfusion is reduced, oxygen supply diminishes with metabolic byproduct accumulation. Presumably, it was airway cooling that significantly changed physiological function during the CNM trial in this study. All subjects wore appropriate attire during both cold trials, so peripheral cooling from skin exposure was minimal compared to the airway cooling. Cold air inhalation and cooling of the body can induce a state of vascular tissue reactivity and bronchoconstriction.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The mechanisms responsible for cold-induced vascular hyperreactivity and bronchoconstriction are multifocal. Two hormones appear to be strongly related to this constriction. Cruden et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> reported that cold exposure, and not exercise, can lead to a significant increase in endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels. Airway cooling produces and releases ET-1.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Endothelial cells of the pulmonary vessels and heart produce ET-1 levels during cold exposure, increased central venous pressure, and altitude.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Riska and Seifert (unpublished observation) observed that cold air inhalation led to a significant increase in ET-1 concentration. ET-1 increased by 24% from baseline when subjects were exposed to &#x02212;16&#x000b0;C temperature, but ET-1 concentrations were maintained at baseline levels when subjects wore an HME. Additionally, significant correlations of ET-1 with BP measurements (positive) and HR (negative) were also observed when subjects did not wear an HME.</p><p>Cold exposure may also activate the production and release of norepinephrine.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Norepinephrine stimulates the adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle, which results in localized peripheral vasoconstriction. However, Watt et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported that ET-1 is a significantly more potent vasoconstrictor than norepinephrine.

However, systolic BP and MAP increased by 15% and 13% from baseline and HR was 10&#x02009;bpm lower during the HME and RT trials compared to the CNM trial. This decrease in HR may indicate the presence of a greater circulating central blood volume, as has been reported by previous authors.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As central blood volume increases, stroke volume can increase with a decrease in HR.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2050312117740985" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> BPs were maintained during the CNM trial in this study until approximately 38&#x02009;min of cold exposure.

Reasons for the improved performance during cold exposure with the HME are multifactorial; however, the maintenance or improvement in both cardiovascular and pulmonary functions can be preserved by minimizing heat loss via respiratory tract, most pronounced during exercise in cold environments.</p><sec id="section13-2050312117740985"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This design of this study was not able to blind the subjects to the experimental conditions.
