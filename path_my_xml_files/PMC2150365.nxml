Weekly EEPFL treatment consisted of a concomitant boost of etoposide 40 mg m(-2) i.v. over 30 min, epirubicin 10 mg m(-2) i.v. over 5 min to a backbone regimen, weekly PFL chemotherapy with cisplatin 25 mg m(-2), 5-FU 2200 mg m(-2), leucovorin 120 mg m(-2) given simultaneously by 24-h i.v. infusion. Response, survival and toxicity were evaluated. Forty-two patients were studied. Median age was 69 (range 31-84) years. Twenty-six per cent of patients showed complete response and 45% partial response. The overall response rate was 71% (95% confidence interval 58-84%). For a total of 507 weekly EEPFL cycles delivered, the incidence of grade 4 leucopenia was 1% of cycles. One patient died of neutropenia septicaemia. There was no other grade 4 toxicity. Grade 3 and 2 leucopenia occurred in 7% and 14% of cycles. The incidence of grade 3 and 2 mucositis was 1% and 3% of cycles. Grade 3 and 2 diarrhoea occurred in 0.4% and 1.6% of cycles. Overall median survival was 10 months (range 3-41+ months). Weekly EEPFL chemotherapy is an effective regimen with tolerable toxicities in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. A randomized controlled clinical trial to formally assess the efficacy and benefit of EEPFL chemotherapy is under way.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00087-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1984" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00087-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1985" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00087-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1986" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00087-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1987" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00087-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1988" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
