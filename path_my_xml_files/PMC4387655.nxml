As stroke causes lifelong complications in nervous system,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] it is counted as one of the common health problems.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] About 5.5 million people die of this disease each year worldwide, an it is known as the third cause for mortality in the world of which two thirds occur in developing countries such as Iran.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The incidence of stroke was reported as 139 out of 100,000 in Iran,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which is notably higher than in the western countries.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] As stroke is usually accompanied with functional dependency, the above rate of prevalence cannot show the real impact of cerebral vascular accident(CVA) alone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It is the cause for a high number of lifelong and serious major disabilities,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and is the main cause that results in an increase the number of the patients with sensory and motor defects as well as absence of function.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>About one-third of stroke patients experience a lifelong disability.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Stroke is the most common disabling disorder in the nervous system that leaves a deep impact on the patients and their families. The patients think their personality and life style have been changed after stroke.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Although about 80% of the stroke survivors are discharged from hospital after passing the acute stage of the disease and having a stable condition,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] they suffer from numerous social, physical, sensory, conceptual, mental, psychological, cognitive, and[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] social complications such as a defective consciousness, motor disorder, paralysis, muscular atrophy, imbalance, dysphasia and its risk of aspiration pneumonia, incontinency, constipation,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] pressure sore, dermal irritations, urinary retention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thromboembolim, pulmonary embolim, unstable hypertension, and shoulder pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Among the other complications, immobility, spasity, problem in standing and walking, hemiplegia, and oral and motor disorders can be counted.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These disorders result in loss of patients&#x02019; independency and an increased dependency on relatives, reduced self-confidence, mental complications such as depression, a reduction in satisfaction and QOL,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a disorder in appropriate function and individuals&#x02019; independency during participation in everyday life activities.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These problems are the major challenges for such patients and their caregivers after their discharge from hospital.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, making a vast range of functional changes in various biological, psychological, mental, and social dimensions of human beings, especially in biological dimension, stroke causes some internal changes including individuals&#x02019; reaction and usage of coping mechanisms against these changes to adapt with. These reactions are coping strategies in terms of active and passive behavioral and cognitive efforts in response to stressful conditions (diseases), as well as overcoming the disease-related challenges, reduction of their negative outcomes,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and tolerating the impacts of stroke to preserve the personal value and integrity of patients&#x02019; personality.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the one hand, human being is a psychobiological and social creature and a stimulation imposed to any of his/her dimensions influences the other dimensions. On the other hand, he/she is constantly changing in response to the environmental, physical, social, and mental changes, and should have interactions with them and show adaptive reactions toward them. Individuals&#x02019; power in preservation of their health depends on having the ability and needed energy to positively adapt with the stimulations.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Adaptive responses reduce the needed energy for coping with existing situations in patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Adaptation also results in feeling of safety, and in case of an imbalance in adaptation, the patients experience stress, anxiety, and lack of safety.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In such situations, as adaptation strategies are weakened and individuals&#x02019; usual efforts for adaptation are inefficient, nursing care is needed,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as nurses play a pivotal role in supporting the patients with chronic diseases.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Meanwhile, there are numerous challenges in this regard. The first and most important question that flashes in nurses&#x02019; mind in a clinical setting is how they can help their clients and give them care. In this regard, scholars have suggested several important models and strategies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] One of the nursing models that has vastly and deeply worked on adaptation in psychobiological and social dimensions in chronic disease is Roy adaptation model,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which aims at administration of nursing interventions for improvement of adaptive responses in each dimension (physiological, self-concept, interdependence, and role function).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Research showed the positive effect of Roy adaptation model on improvement of disease control and increase of adaptive responses in chronic diseases.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Based on Roy adaptation model, the patient is precisely detected and his/her adaptive behaviors are increased through nursing intervention and manipulation of their causes as their stimulants, and consequently, a better physiological and psychological adaptation is obtained. It goes without saying that adaptation with a chronic disease is a dynamic process through which the patients can achieve more appropriate self-control by increasing their physical and cognitive adaptation level, as an ultimate goal in the management of chronic diseases.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Based on this model, detection of unknown behavioral stimulants leads to precise exploration of the causes of patients&#x02019; maladaptive behaviors and helps the nurses to design an accurate care plan to solve the patients&#x02019; problems (through adaptive behaviors). Therefore, it is predicted that adaptive behaviors (healthy behaviors) are increased in patients by application of a care plan that is designed based on this model, which results in a reduction in complication, the most important goal in stroke patients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] With regard to vast involvement of stroke patients&#x02019; biological dimension, one of the interventions that could be administered by nurses is giving care in this dimension.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Search conducted in several databases revealed the absence of this model among the nursing interventions provided in taking care of stroke patients in Iran, especially in biological dimension. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of biological dimention care plan on stroke patients&#x02019; physiological adaptation level base on Roy adaptation model, in order to make suggestions to the nursing society based on its findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a two-group (study and control), two-stage, before&#x02013;after clinical trial. The sampling followed was convenient sampling. The researcher attended Al-Zahra and Kashani hospitals in Isfahan and selected the patients who met the inclusion criteria and were hospitalized in neurology wards as the subjects. Those who were interested to participate filled the informed consent form, and then the demographic characteristics form. After selection of the patients through convenient sampling, they were randomly assigned to two groups of study (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 25) by random number [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Then, 2 weeks after discharge and by making necessary coordination, Roy adaptation questionnaire was filled by researcher's referral to the patients (at their home, physician's office, or a clinic) in both groups. After filling the questionnaires, the researcher reviewed the data obtained using Roy questionnaires in two stages. At the first stage, subjects&#x02019; maladaptive behaviors were detected in biological dimension. At the second stage, stimulants for each of these maladaptive behaviors were determined in this dimension. After investigating the data and determination of the patients&#x02019; maladaptive behaviors and the related stimulants in biological dimension, the researcher designed the care plan. It was tried to follow Roy adaptation model steps in designing the care plan. Researcher formed a health care team including a nurse (the researcher), neurologist physician, and a psychologist. Then, in the study group, the subjects were divided into four- or five-member groups, if there was no limitation for an interventional plan (determined by the related physician), and the theoretical and practical care plan, in addition to an educational booklet, were given to them. This care plan included four 60&#x02013;90 min educational sessions held during 2 weeks (twice a week) for the stroke patients and their families.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the frequency distribution of demographic characteristics of patients with stroke in both study and control groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-275-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The administered care plan contained an educational regular protocol including theoretical and practical education.

Research tools included Roy adaptation assessment form and a demographic questionnaire. Roy assessment form was designed through library resources and internet search and consideration of related tools. To determine face and content validity, it was distributed to 10 academic members of Isfahan Nursing and Midwifery School and two academic members in the School of Medicine, and necessary modifications were made based on their indications.</p><p>Reliability of the questionnaire was established by conducting a pilot study and calculation of Cronbach's alpha (76.6) among 10 patients. This form included patients&#x02019; assessment in physiological dimension. Roy recognition and assessment form consists of 28 items in patients&#x02019; physiologic dimension, including questions on activity, rest, nutrition, defecation, circulation and oxygenation, fluids and electrolytes, and endocrine system. These items are scored through a five-point Likert's scale (0 = never, 1 = for a short time, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = always). Each subject obtains scores ranging 0&#x02013;112 in physiologic dimension. Maladaptive behaviors and their stimulants in physiologic dimension were determined and compared once before intervention and another time after administration of the care plan in the two groups using this form. The subjects in the control group underwent conventional and routine care, and after 8 weeks, their adaptation was assessed using the form again. After the end of the study, an educational booklet was given to them and they received necessary explanations in a session. Care plan was designed and administered in four sessions with regard to determination of maladaptive behaviors (unhealthy behaviors) and their stimulants in the subjects of the study group to achieve the study goal (development of healthy behaviors).</p><p>The first session included patients&#x02019; awareness of the disease, its signs, and familiarization with personal health obedience to do everyday life activities.</p><p>In the second session, the education was on exercises of the limbs in their range of motion, balance, self-care methods in cases of sensory and motor disorders, and defecation and urinary disorders.</p><p>The third session contained psychological counseling to cope with anxiety and depression and the subjects were referred to a psychologist if needed. In the fourth session, the group of nutrients and the diet were discussed and patients were educated. At the end of the course, all presented materials were given to the patients in form of an educational booklet; a phone call was made to the patients in the study group once a week for a month,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and their questions on their condition and motor exercises were answered. In fact, a sort of feeling of being supported was formed among the patients.

In order to ensure homogeneity of the groups concerning personal characteristics and baseline variables, the groups were investigated before intervention and statistical tests showed no significant difference. A review on Roy adaptation assessment showed that mean adaptation score in physiologic dimension increased from 49.7 before intervention to 50.7 after intervention, with no significant difference in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.21).

The present study pursued the same goal to investigate the effect of one of the nursing models, Roy adaptation model. The results showed that a self-care plan, designed based on this model, could efficiently influence stroke patients&#x02019; physiologic condition. Roy (2002) emphasizes that physiologic adaptation is a factor that stabilizes chronic disease process and prevents its complications.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our results showed a significant increase in mean adaptation score in physiologic domain in the study group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Meanwhile, in the control group, the increase was not significant. Therefore, it can be stated that the designed care plan increased the level of adaptation in physiologic dimension among stroke patients. As patients&#x02019; participation in care-related intervention, as a team work with the cooperation of nurses and other professionals such as psychologists and nutritionists, is a valuable action in disease control, it was used in the present study to fulfill patients&#x02019; needs with the coordination of nurses and their constant support, and a notable change was observed in patients&#x02019; adaptation during 2 months of intervention.

He held a weekly 1 h educational session in the form of a 15-member class for 12 weeks. Physical and physiological dimensions were measured through measurement of level of physical activity and function. Finally, the intervention resulted in a 6-min walk increase in patients, reduction of hypertension, and an increase in their muscular power and modification of their balance.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Burns, in a study on physical and psychological dimension of adaptation in hemodialysis patients, measured and recorded their BP, weight, and potassium level before dialysis. The patients used various adaptation mechanisms such as trusting God, positive thinking, positive attitude toward God's blessing in life, thinking about positive issues in life, being humorous, listening to relaxing music, and calling up the family members. They finally observed no significant association between intervention using adaptation mechanisms and the incidence of physiologic problems including the ones in BP, level of potassium, and weight (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Romino <italic>et al</italic>. studied parental presence during anesthesia induction in children based on Roy model.
