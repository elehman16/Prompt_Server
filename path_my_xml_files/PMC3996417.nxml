and pulmonary function and the effectiveness of respiratory feedback training according to
walking ability in children with cerebral palsy (CP). [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-three
children with spastic CP were enrolled in the final analysis and were divided into an
independent walking group (n=12) and non-independent walking group. All children received
respiratory feedback training for four weeks. Before and after the training, respiratory
muscle strength was measured and a pulmonary function test was performed. [Results]
Comparison of respiratory pressure and pulmonary function test results between the two
revealed that the independent walking group had significantly higher respiratory function
than the other group in all variables except peak expiratory flow. In comparison of
changes in respiratory function between the two groups, the independent walking group
showed significantly higher improvement of respiratory function in terms of maximal
inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, and forced vital capacity. [Conclusion]
These findings showed that children with independent walking ability had better
respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function compared with children without
independent walking ability. Understanding respiratory function and the effectiveness of
respiratory training according to walking ability will be valuable clinical information
for respiratory assessment and therapy in children with CP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd><kwd>Walking ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Respiration is an essential physiologic component for maintaining vital functions and

cardiopulmonary systems<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the major neurological diseases that cause physical

induces paralysis or weakens respiratory muscles, and this gives rise to an abnormal
distorted chest, restriction of physical activity, and delayed development of the
cardiopulmonary system<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For recovery of
these respiratory symptoms, respiratory training programs have increasingly been view as
clinically necessary. Recent studies have revealed that physiological function related to
respiration was preserved via walking ability by enabling subjects to perform a variety of
vigorous physical activities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results suggest that walking ability may be
associated with preservation or development of respiratory functions. However, to our
knowledge, little previous literature concerning comparison of the effectiveness of
respiratory training according to walking ability has been published.</p><p>Therefore, in the current study, we attempted to compare differences in respiratory
pressure and pulmonary function and the effectiveness of respiratory training depending on
walking ability in children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-five children who suffered from spastic hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy were
recruited in this study, according to following inclusive criteria: (1) children with
spastic hemiplegic or diplegic cerebral palsy diagnosed by a pediatric neurologist from
their brain MR image, (2) communicative disability in language or intellectual problem
capable of measuring respiratory function, (3) no psychiatric or neurological symptoms
except cerebral palsy, and (4) belonged to levels I, II, and III of the Gross Motor Function
Classification System (GMFCS). According to independent walking ability considering the
GMFCS level and clinical assessment by a physical therapist with over five years of
experience, they were divided into an independent walking group and non-independent walking
group. The independent walking group contained subjects classified into GMFCS levels I and
II, and the non-independent walking group contained subjects classified into GMFCS level
III. Twelve and 13 children with CP belonged to the independent walking group (6 boys, mean
age 9.5&#x000b1;2.1) and non-independent walking group (7 boys, mean age 10.5&#x000b1;1.5), respectively.
All parents of children provided written informed consent before participation in this study
in accordance with the Helsinki declaration, and this study was approved by the local ethics
committee.</p><p>All children took part in respiratory training using feedback for 20 minutes per day, 3
times a week for 4 weeks, and received conventional physical therapy for 30 minutes per
visit, 2 to 3 times a week, which focused on gross motor tasks and functional activities
including independent sitting, walking, stair climbing, and so forth. A SpiroTiger (Idiag
AG, Volketswil, Switzerland) was used as the device for biofeedback respiratory training;
this device is designed to improve respiratory function by providing feedback on the
subject&#x02019;s performance. Children sat on a chair comfortably with their head and trunk
straight, took the mouthpiece into their mouth, and placed a nose clip on their nose,
ensuring that breathing occurred exclusively through the device. They were instructed to
watch the monitor and to inhale when the red bar reached &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; on the display panel of the
device and they heard a beep sound, whereas they were instructed to exhale when the red bar
reached &#x0201c;out&#x0201d; on the device and they heard a beep sound. Visual and auditory feedback
provided through the device play an important role in restricting the subject&#x02019;s breathing to
the threshold value of isocapnia. When symptoms of fatigue or hyperventilation were observed
in a subject during respiratory training, training was stopped, and the subject was allowed
to rest.</p><p>To evaluate the effect on respiratory function after respiratory training for 4 weeks,
respiratory pressure was measured and a pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed. All
children were positioned in a chair sitting with their head and trunk straight up and the
hip and knee joints flexed at 90&#x000b0;. Measurements of respiratory pressure and pulmonary
function were performed by the same examiner throughout the entire experiment. The
respiratory pressure was measured using a MicroRPM Pressure Meter (Micro Direct Inc.,
Lewiston, ME, USA), which assessed the highest pressure that respiratory muscles are able to
generate against an occlusion at the mouth. Children were asked to inhale or exhale against
the obstructed mouth piece, with maximal voluntary effort, while keeping the lips sealed
tightly around the mouthpiece. In the best of these trials, the values of maximal
inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were acquired. The PFT was
performed using a spirometer (Vmax 229, SensorMedics, USA). All children were instructed to
breathe in and then to breathe out via a mouth piece as deeply and fast as possible. The
test was conducted a total of three times with an appropriate rest period for prevention of
hyperventilation. In the best of these trials, the values of forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and peak expiratory flow (PEF)
were acquired.</p><p>All data were analyzed using statistical software, PAWS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The
c<sup>2</sup> test was conducted to examine differences in gender distribution between the
two groups. The Independent t-test was performed to compare demographic data (i.e., age,
weight, height, chest circumference, heart rate, and respiratory rate) and dependent
variables (i.e., MIP, MEP, FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PEF) between the two groups. The alpha
level for statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic information for the independent walking and non-independent walking groups are

walking ability possessed stronger showed better improvement of respiratory muscles and
pulmonary function compared with children without independent walking ability. Respiratory
pressure and the PFT have been used to measure the strength of respiration muscles and lung
capacity, which is one of routine procedures for measurement of respiratory function, along
with PFT. These findings are supported by several previous studies, indicating that children
who were capable of more vigorous physical activity showed better respiratory function
compared with children without independent walking ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The low cardiopulmonary capacity in CP is due to restrictive lung
dysfunction resulting from limited movement and not because of parenchymal lung
dysfunction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we deduced
that children who were capable of more vigorous physical activity showed better respiratory
function.</p><p>In the second findings, the two groups showed improvement of all variables after 4 weeks of
respiratory training. However, in comparison of the changes in respiratory function between
the two groups, the non-independent walking group showed significantly better improvement of
MIP, MEP, and FVC compared with the independent walking group. We think that this might be
attributable to the ceiling effect in the independent walking group. In other words, the
independent walking group may have already reached the upper level of their capacity in
respiratory function, whereas the non-independent walking group may have had more potential
for its improvement.</p><p>It is a generalized fact that walking disability can accompany respiratory dysfunction in
children with CP, which together result in disturbance of normal motor development and
restriction of functional activity in daily life<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elucidation of differences in respiration function and
effectiveness of respiratory training according to walking ability is an important clinical
issue. Therefore, we expect that our results will be valuable for physical therapists in
evaluating respiratory function and applying training programs in children with CP. A
limitation of this study is the small sample size due to difficulty in recruiting children
with CP. Further study will be required to consider this limitation and other clinical
issues, such as differences in respiratory function according to level of walking ability
and metabolic equivalence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant (2012).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Buchanan</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Timing, sleep, and respiration in health and
