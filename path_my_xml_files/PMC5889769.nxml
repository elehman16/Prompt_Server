</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par8">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adults worldwide. First-line pharmacological management is with psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which are Schedule II controlled substances (C2, per the US Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA]). While C2 stimulants are highly effective for ADHD, stimulants are misused recreationally with both diversion and abuse being common problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, not all individuals respond optimally to or tolerate C2 stimulants because of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Non-stimulants (e.g., atomoxetine and &#x003b1;-2 agonists such as long-acting clonidine and guanfacine) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for ADHD, but efficacy, overall, is not as robust as with C2 stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, the tolerability profile is not necessarily superior to stimulants. Thus, further treatment options are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Mazindol (5-[<italic>p</italic>-chlorophenyl]-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazo-[2,1-a] isoindol-5-ol; brand names: Sanorex, Mazanor) is an imidazo-isoindole agent that was first approved by the FDA in 1973 and then in the European Union (EU) in the 1980s for the treatment of obesity in adults; however, it was voluntarily withdrawn from both the US and EU markets by the early 2000s because of low sales. Mazindol immediate release (IR) is still approved in Mexico/Central America, Japan, and Argentina (where there is also a sustained-release formulation) for the short-term treatment of obesity. Mazindol IR has been available in the EU for compassionate use in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnias for several decades, with a favorable benefit/risk ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When marketed in the US, mazindol IR was classified as Schedule IV by the DEA, meaning that it was considered to have a low potential for abuse and addiction.</p><p id="Par10">A recent open-label study of mazindol IR (1&#x000a0;mg/day for 7&#x000a0;days) in 21 school-aged children with ADHD yielded a change in parent-rated ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) mean total score of &#x02212;&#x000a0;24.6 (<italic>p&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), with&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90% improvement from baseline; there were mild to moderate adverse events (e.g., decreased appetite, headache, abdominal pain) without significant changes in laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Since the completion of the open-label study, a controlled release (CR) formulation of mazindol has been developed; this formulation can be administered once daily (QD), has a time to maximum concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) of&#x02009;~&#x02009;4&#x000a0;h and a half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) of&#x02009;~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on in vitro binding studies at 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M (&#x0003e;&#x02009;600&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;maximum concentration [<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>] at 16.5&#x000a0;nM after mazindol 3&#x000a0;mg), mazindol is a serotonin-, noradrenaline-, and dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), with&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;99% binding at each of the three transporters, and an agonist with&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% binding at the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, muscarinic receptors, the histamine H1 receptor, and the &#x000b5;-opioid receptor. Notably, mazindol also has 39% binding at orexin-2 receptors (i.e., partial agonist). The potency of the hydrolysis metabolite (2-[2-Aminoethyl]-3-[<italic>p</italic>-chlorophenyl]-3-hydroxyphthalimidine) is similar to the parent compound (data on file).</p><p id="Par12">Although the exact mechanism of action is uncertain, the pharmacologic profile of mazindol suggests that it might be useful for treating ADHD. Mazindol CR is unique from other available medications for ADHD because none of the currently approved pharmacological treatments are considered SNDRIs, nor do they promote a regulatory effect on 5-HT1A, 5-HT7, or the hypothalamic orexin system. Orexin fibers are dense in brain regions crucial for wakefulness and arousal, particularly the locus coeruleus that contains adrenergic, noradrenergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic neurons. Orexin neuropeptides are known to play important modulatory roles in sleep/wake regulation, motivation, reward, as well as emotional and attentional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">A well controlled phase II study of mazindol CR in adults with ADHD was designed based on what is known about the mechanism of action and dosing requirements for mazindol IR, previous compassionate use in the treatment of narcolepsy in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the large safety database from previous and present worldwide use, and positive preliminary data for pediatric ADHD&#x02014;all with the IR formulation. The goal of this 6-week study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of mazindol CR in adults with ADHD. The primary hypothesis was that adults with ADHD receiving mazindol CR dosed flexibly from 1 to 3&#x000a0;mg QD compared with placebo would show greater improvement in ADHD symptoms as measured by the DSM5 ADHD-RS mean total score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par14">This was an outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive oral mazindol CR or placebo QD. Eighty-four subjects were planned to be randomized (42 to each of two treatment arms) at seven clinical sites in the US. The study was approved by Schulman Institutional Review Board and was performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines (ClinicalTrials.gov Registration No. NCT02808104).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title><p id="Par15">Subjects were 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years of age, with a primary diagnosis of ADHD based upon the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 (MINI) with the ADHD module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This interview, updated for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM5) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], was performed by licensed clinicians trained in its administration. In addition, clinicians were trained to administer the ADHD-RS for DSM5 (ADHD-RS-DSM5), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale (CGI-S), the Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I), and the Target Impairment Scale. Adults had a minimum score of 28 on the ADHD-RS-DSM5 and a minimum score of 4 (moderate) on the CGI-S when not taking any ADHD medications for at least 14&#x000a0;days. They were in good general physical health; tested negative for pregnancy (urine; females only); used acceptable methods of contraception (females of child-bearing potential only); were fluent in spoken and written English; were able to follow protocol requirements; and provided informed consent.</p><p id="Par16">The MINI 7.0 was also used to help make a diagnosis of other psychiatric conditions. Subjects were excluded if they had any current DSM5 disorder other than ADHD which required treatment, or a lifetime history of bipolar disorder or other psychotic disorder; were taking any prohibited concomitant medication (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anti-epileptics, cardiovascular agents, sedating antihistamines or decongestants, sensitive CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, and concomitant gastric pH modulators) including other ADHD medications (if not discontinued for at least 14&#x000a0;days); or had any concurrent condition that would interfere with study procedures; clinically significant ECG abnormality or a QTc (Bazett correction) interval&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;450&#x000a0;ms; resting sitting SBP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;mmHg or DBP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;mmHg; body mass index&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18 or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; positive urine drug screen (UDS); pregnant or lactating; active suicidal ideation within 3&#x000a0;months of screening or suicidal behavior within a year of screening (i.e., score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 on the ideation subscale of the Columbia&#x02013;Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]); clinically significant out-of-range laboratory value, medical history, or physical examination finding that contraindicated enrollment; significant drug allergy or systemic allergic disease; or any known/suspected hypersensitivity to any form of mazindol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par17">A screening visit occurred within 4&#x02013;21&#x000a0;days prior to randomization. All subjects were treated for a total of 6&#x000a0;weeks and had visits on Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 to undergo assessments for efficacy and safety. Each visit (except Day 0) occurred within&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;days of the scheduled weekly visit. A follow-up phone call occurred 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days after the last dose of study treatment.</p><p id="Par18">Mazindol CR was dosed flexibly. On Day 0, subjects began taking mazindol CR 1&#x000a0;mg or placebo QD for the first week. Depending upon clinical response and tolerability, investigators could increase the dose of mazindol CR (or corresponding blinded placebo) to 2&#x000a0;mg QD for the second week, and possibly again to 3&#x000a0;mg QD for the third week. At each visit, the dose could be held or reduced per the investigator&#x02019;s clinical judgment. Dosage adjustments could not exceed increments of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;mg/day/week. Participants were to remain on a fixed dose for the final 4&#x000a0;weeks (similar to most acute ADHD trials of stimulants), with dose reductions allowed due to lack of tolerability (which occurred in four subjects).</p><p id="Par19">Mazindol CR was administered as 1&#x000a0;mg, 2&#x000a0;mg, or 3&#x000a0;mg tablets, all (including placebo) manufactured to look identical. Medication containers were to be returned at each study visit for drug accountability. Compliance was assessed by tablet counts; noncompliance was defined as being off study medication for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6 consecutive days during the study.</p><p id="Par20">The rationale for the dose selection for this study was based on (1) predicting a dose in adults that would have a sufficient probability of achieving an area under the curve during a dosing interval (AUC<sub>0-<italic>&#x003c4;</italic></sub>) and maximum plasma concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) that were similar to those achieved in pediatric subjects receiving mazindol IR 1&#x000a0;mg QD, where efficacy had been demonstrated in an open-label trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; (2) predicting a dose of mazindol CR that would result in exposures (AUC<sub>0-<italic>&#x003c4;</italic></sub>) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> that did not exceed 1/5th the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for dogs in at least 97.5% of subjects; and (3) the extensive safety data outlined in the summary basis of approval for Mazanor and Sanorex for doses up to 3&#x000a0;mg daily (administered as divided doses). The upward sequential dose titration was chosen to mimic standard clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments and Endpoints</title><p id="Par21">Efficacy was assessed weekly using the ADHD-RS-DSM5, the CGI-I scale, and the Target Impairment Scale (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The Target Impairment Scale collected clinically meaningful information from each participant, in a standardized manner, on three functional deficits deemed to be meaningful for that individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Target Impairment Scale was used to establish a common understanding with each subject concerning treatment goals related to ADHD symptomology, and to provide an individualized measure of functional outcome. The ADHD Target Impairment Scale provided both a contextual and functional anchor for the subsequent clinician administration of both the ADHD-RS-DSM5 and the CGI-I at each weekly visit, and provided an additional method to assess response to treatment. The degree of correspondence (Pearson correlation) between the Target Impairment Scale and both the CGI-I (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.818) and the ADHD-RS-DSM5 (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.824) was strong and suggestive of good concurrent validity.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>ADHD Target Impairment Scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40263_2018_503_Tab1_HTML" id="MO1"/></table-wrap></p><p id="Par22">The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) of mazindol CR versus placebo in the ADHD-RS-DSM5 score at Day 42.

The proportion of responders with a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% CFB in ADHD Target Impairment scores for mazindol CR versus placebo was an exploratory endpoint.</p><p id="Par23">Safety assessments included spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs); vital signs, body weight, and the C&#x02013;SRSS at all visits; 12-lead ECG (most visits); and physical examination and clinical laboratory evaluations (at screening and Day 42).</p><p id="Par24">Resting vital signs (HR, SBP, and DBP) were collected at predose and 2&#x000a0;h postdose on Days 1 and 42 and at non-specified times at each visit, with each recording made after the subject had been sitting for at least 5&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par25">Pharmacokinetic assessments were obtained at predose, 1 and 2&#x000a0;h postdose on Day 1 and Day 42, and at a single time point on Days 7, 14, and 21.

The statistical analysis plan stated that model assumptions were to be examined and alternative analyses (e.g., analysis after data transformation or non-parametric analysis) could be performed as appropriate. In actuality, no alternative analyses were performed, as model assumptions were tested and were found to be appropriate to the chosen analysis. Least squares (LS) means, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), <italic>p</italic> values of the treatment comparisons (across and within visits), and basic arithmetic summary statistics were provided. The analysis was repeated for the per protocol (PP) population (those in the ITT population with no major protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy variable, defined prior to unblinding) who completed the protocol.</p><p id="Par27">For sensitivity analyses only, the primary efficacy endpoint using observed data and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) was assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors for treatment, sex, and baseline ADHD-RS-DSM5 score. In addition, analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were examined in relation to sex, age, baseline CGI-S score, and ADHD clinical presentation.</p><p id="Par28">The placebo-adjusted effect size was calculated using the mean difference in ADHD-RS-DSM5 scores between arms from baseline to Day 42 and dividing this by the pooled standard deviation on Day 42. In terms of total ADHD-RS-DSM5 score, for a two-sample pooled <italic>t</italic> test of a normal mean difference with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a common standard deviation of 14, a sample size of 42 per group has a power of 0.804 to detect a mean difference of 8.7. This power calculation is based on previous data where the mean change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV for an approved ADHD agent is &#x02212;&#x000a0;19.7, while the mean change from baseline for placebo is &#x02212;&#x000a0;11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">For responder analyses, repeated measures over time were fit using generalized estimating equations and the procedure for generalized linear models in SAS. Factors included in the model were treatment, sex, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline ADHD-RS-DSM5 score. As sensitivity analyses, logistic regression models were fit on all four responder endpoints on Day 42. In the sensitivity analysis, subjects who did not complete the double-blind period were considered non-responders.</p><p id="Par30">Subjects were to be randomized 1:1 to mazindol CR or placebo, stratified by sex, with the constraint that no more than 75% of the total randomized subjects were male and that no more than 45% were female. Interactive Response Technology (IRT) was utilized as the central screening and randomization methodology to maintain the balanced allocation of treatment across sex stratification by sex, and preserve the blind to avoid bias. A technical programming error in the IRT system development resulted in the enrollment of more females than planned (49 females; 36 males), and a human error during subject registration in the IRT system ultimately resulted in the enrollment of 85 rather than 84 subjects. Analysis of unblinded data by sex showed an evenly balanced treatment allocation of subjects across sexes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Mazindol CR had a robust effect on ADHD symptoms, with a large placebo-adjusted effect size of 1.09. The magnitude of this effect was comparable to what is typically seen with stimulants, such as methylphenidate CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], lisdexamfetamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], d-amphetamine extended release (XR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and mixed amphetamine salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and much higher than for atomoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The LS mean difference between mazindol CR and placebo on Day 42 was found to be consistent across all sensitivity analyses, establishing that the large effect size was not biased by any of the statistical methods used.</p><p id="Par47">In addition, onset of action was rapid; separation from placebo was seen at the first post-treatment data point, after 1&#x000a0;week of treatment. Further, there was a significantly higher proportion of excellent responders (&#x02265;&#x02009;50% reduction in baseline scores) and responders on the CGI-I (much or very much improved) by Day 14; this finding stands in contradistinction to time to onset of effect for FDA-approved nonstimulant agents (e.g., atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), which can take up to 4&#x000a0;weeks to achieve efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since subjects received mazindol CR 1&#x000a0;mg QD for the first 7&#x000a0;days, these findings indicate that there was a clinical response at even the lowest dose. However, most subjects received 2&#x000a0;mg QD for the next 7&#x000a0;days and then 3&#x000a0;mg QD starting on Day 14. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the maximum benefit is likely observed within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks of beginning the most efficacious dose (typically 2 or 3&#x000a0;mg) based on the weekly dose titration approach used in this study.</p><p id="Par48">One unique feature of this study was the use of an individualized measure to identify functionally relevant impairment (the Target Impairment Scale). It is noteworthy that mazindol CR produced improvement in this measure as well as the symptom ratings. Linking symptomatic improvement to functional outcomes has considerable importance for understanding the impact of treatment on the day-to-day lives of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Mazindol CR was well tolerated, with no serious AEs reported, no discontinuations due to TEAEs, and no effects on QTcF. Not surprisingly, mazindol CR had a small effect on HR and a minimal effect on BP. The changes in HR and BP after mazindol CR are in the range of those reported in several studies of C2 stimulants (e.g., mean changes of +5 to 15.8&#x000a0;bpm with lisdexamfetamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and methylphenidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) and atomoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Mazindol CR resulted in a small mean decrease in body weight (~&#x02009;1.7&#x000a0;kg) by Day 42. This is not surprising, since mazindol was initially approved for the short-term treatment of obesity. However, in the past, the effects of mazindol IR on weight loss were found to be short-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and it is assumed that the weight loss with mazindol CR seen in this study would similarly be short-lived. This awaits further study in longer-term trials.</p><p id="Par51">The new pharmacokinetic finding in this study was that the hydrolysis metabolite had trough concentrations at steady-state that were higher than that of mazindol. Given the activity of the hydrolysis metabolite in the in vitro binding study (data on file), it is possible that the hydrolysis metabolite contributes to the clinical profile of mazindol CR.</p><p id="Par52">Results of this study should be considered in light of several potential limitations: (1) the sample size in this study was relatively small, though very solid for a phase II trial. Larger <italic>n</italic> studies more typical of phase III should be undertaken. (2) A flexible dose design was used, replicating the approach used in clinical practice. However, this design does not aid in determination of the optimal dose of mazindol CR. Future research should include a fixed-dose trial. (3) The highest dose studied here was 3&#x000a0;mg. A few subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) had an optimal response to 2&#x000a0;mg, but most continued to 3&#x000a0;mg. However, given the generally favorable tolerability profile, it is possible that a higher dose might have been tolerated and might have produced a larger response in some of the remainder of the subjects who received 3&#x000a0;mg. (4) This study used a weekly dose titration design, and only evaluated the efficacy of mazindol CR versus placebo at weekly intervals. Therefore, time to onset of effect cannot be determined from these data; it is possible that response could be achieved faster than it was in this study if a different titration approach were used. (5) The current study was designed to demonstrate acute effects of mazindol CR, and was therefore limited to 6&#x000a0;weeks. Longer-term efficacy will need to be confirmed in later clinical trials. (6) In this study, women were over-represented (58% of the sample). However, it is generally thought that gender does not moderate the phenotypic presentation of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], nor is it thought to moderate treatment response. (7) Although it is well known that adults with ADHD often present with a number of comorbid disorders, the potential impact of comorbidity is not studied until phase IV because if subjects had other psychiatric disorders it would not be possible to know whether the improvement seen with mazindol CR was specific to its effect on ADHD. The approach used here, restricting co-morbidities, is standard for drugs in development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study in adults with ADHD showed a large magnitude of effect for mazindol CR (effect size 1.09), comparable to what has previously been reported in C2 stimulants, and with good tolerability. The potential availability of a novel medication that has robust efficacy and is well tolerated represents an important unmet need in ADHD. Phase III studies are planned to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of mazindol CR, and to more specifically evaluate dosing recommendations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored by NLS-1 Pharma AG.
