The strategies consisted of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) administered to either one or all of the steers within a pen, followed by feeding or not feeding a therapeutic dose of chlortetracycline (CTC). Eighty-eight steers were randomly allocated to eight pens of 11 steers each. Both treatment regimens were randomly assigned to the pens in a two-way full factorial design. Non-type-specific (NTS) <italic>E. coli</italic> (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1,050) were isolated from fecal samples gathered on Days 0, 4, 12, and 26. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using a microbroth dilution technique. PCR was used to detect <italic>tet</italic>(A), <italic>tet</italic>(B), and <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> genes within each isolate. Chlortetracycline administration greatly exacerbated the already increased levels of both phenotypic and genotypic ceftiofur resistance conferred by prior CCFA treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The four treatment regimens also influenced the phenotypic multidrug resistance count of NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> populations. Chlortetracycline treatment alone was associated with an increased probability of selecting isolates that harbored <italic>tet</italic>(B) versus <italic>tet</italic>(A) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05); meanwhile, there was an inverse association between finding <italic>tet</italic>(A) versus <italic>tet</italic>(B) genes for any given regimen (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The presence of a <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene was associated with an isolate exhibiting reduced phenotypic susceptibility to a higher median number of antimicrobials (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;289, median&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6; 95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4&#x02013;8) compared with the <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;208, median&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3; 95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3&#x02013;4). Results indicate that CTC can exacerbate ceftiofur resistance following CCFA therapy and therefore should be avoided, especially when considering their use in sequence. Further studies are required to establish the animal-level effects of co-housing antimicrobial-treated and non-treated animals together.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The field trial was funded by United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nifa.usda.gov/">http://www.nifa.usda.gov/</ext-link>), Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant numbers: 2008-35201-30235 and 2008-35201-04682).

Antimicrobials are widely used in animal agriculture as therapeutic, prevention, control, and growth promotion agents <xref rid="pone.0080575-VandenBogaard1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although not without controversy, several reports have indicated that antimicrobial use in food animals has been associated with subsequent development of resistance to antimicrobials in bacterial pathogens from humans <xref rid="pone.0080575-Fey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Angulo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lyons1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Various intervention strategies have been proposed or established by regulatory organizations around the world in an attempt to address this problem. Such strategies include: 1) banning of antibiotics as agricultural growth promoters <xref rid="pone.0080575-Grave1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Wierup1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 2) removing certain antibiotic classes from the market, and 3) recommending that some classes of antibiotics never be approved for food animal use <xref rid="pone.0080575-U1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. An outright ban or removal of antimicrobials is speculated to eventually result in reduced antimicrobial resistance among bacteria, but such actions may also impede veterinarians' or producers' ability to prevent, control, and treat diseases; paradoxically, this could actually increase public health risk <xref rid="pone.0080575-NationalAcademyof1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The need is urgent to better understand factors that contribute to the dissemination, propagation, and persistence of antimicrobial resistance determinants among both commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria and to design treatment strategies at the animal, pen, and farm levels to control and mitigate this global problem <xref rid="pone.0080575-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Ceftiofur, a third generation cephalosporin, belongs to the same general class of antibiotics as ceftriaxone and is classified as a critically important antibiotic by the World Health Organization <xref rid="pone.0080575-World2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Ceftriaxone is highly valued in human medicine, especially for treating invasive salmonellosis in children <xref rid="pone.0080575-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Resistance to ceftiofur is regarded as problematic because shared resistance determinants may confer resistance to ceftriaxone. This paper describes a study designed to evaluate the effects of two different sets of treatment strategies on phenotypic and genotypic ceftiofur resistance among non-type-specific (NTS) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> isolates in feedlot cattle. The first set of treatment strategies was to evaluate the differential effect of whole-pen versus individual-animal level ceftiofur treatment (ceftiofur crystalline-free acid: CCFA, a long-acting ceftiofur formulation). The whole-pen treatments with CCFA were meant to mimic a &#x02018;metaphylaxis&#x02019; or &#x02018;control&#x02019; label use such as for a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) outbreak in feeder cattle. On the other hand, single individual-animal treatment in a pen of otherwise untreated and healthy cattle were meant to mimic the sporadic treatment of BRD cases. Among pens in which only a single animal received the CCFA therapy, the remaining animals were expected to serve as a ready source of more susceptible enteric bacteria, which could help repopulate the gut flora of treated cattle. Agreement is far from unanimous, but many scientists accept that antibiotic-resistant bacteria carry resistance genes at a relative fitness cost <xref rid="pone.0080575-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Cottell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Readily available susceptible bacteria &#x02014; bacteria devoid of the resistance gene &#x02014; may help promote rapid re-colonization of the host gut (treated animal) by outcompeting resistant bacteria that tend to dominate post-treatment periods <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lipsitch1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This study exploited these principles to determine if re-colonization was affected by higher levels of exposure to susceptible bacteria, or even to those bacteria resistant to other antimicrobials.</p><p>The second set of treatment strategies was either to feed or not feed chlortetracycline (CTC) at therapeutic doses following CCFA treatment. Our previous work demonstrated that CTC resulted in a temporary decrease in the prevalence of ceftiofur resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>, especially while it was being administered in the feed <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Chlortetracycline treatment without prior CCFA administration in the study by Platt <italic>et al</italic>. (2008) appeared to differentially favor <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates that were singly resistant to tetracycline versus those that exhibited both ceftiofur and tetracycline resistance. Those earlier results suggested that CTC might help minimize the proliferation and accumulation of ceftiofur resistant bacteria in animal agriculture settings. Our second treatment strategy was designed based on those results. We hypothesized that CTC would expedite the return of ceftiofur resistance to baseline levels among non-type-specific (NTS) <italic>E. coli</italic>, whether following metaphylaxis or individual therapy indications. Our focus was on pen-level interpretations, both for treatments and for outcomes. This is consistent with aiming to reduce the overall carriage of resistant bacteria in truckloads of cattle shipped to slaughter.</p><p>The effects of these two sets of treatment strategies (i.e., differential CCFA treatment and subsequent CTC administration) were determined by examining the susceptibility profiles and the differential selection and co-selection of ceftiofur and tetracycline resistance genes among NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates from cattle feces. Further, associations of the resistance genes among themselves and with the various phenotypic multidrug resistant (MDR) counts were evaluated. The phenotypic MDR counts in this study were defined as the number of antimicrobials (present on a single 15-drug panel) toward which individual isolates exhibit phenotypic resistance. These observations were explored to better explain the phenomena observed in the current study as well as the earlier trial by Platt <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This approach aided in understanding of the factors contributing to the development and accumulation of MDR determinants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>A 26-day randomized controlled trial was conducted at a research feedlot located at West Texas A&#x00026;M University in Canyon, TX.

This is the recommended labeled dose and route of administration for treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and bovine foot rot and for control of BRD. Two of these pens each received three separate 5-day regimens (with a 1-day break in between) of 22 mg/kg CTC (Aureomycin&#x000ae;, chlortetracycline complex equivalent to 220.5 g of chlortetracycline/kg, Alpharma, Bridgewater, NJ) <italic>via</italic> top-dressing after the morning feed was delivered according to the label directions and starting at Day 4.

Briefly, 200 milligrams of fecal sample was mixed with 1.8 milliliter of buffered peptone water, and the suspension was streaked onto MacConkey agar (BD Difco&#x02122;, Sparks, MD). Plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0; for 18&#x02013;24 hours. Three separate and distinct colonies (slightly convex, magenta-colored colonies surrounded by a dark pink area) were streaked on three separate MacConkey plates and incubated for 18&#x02013;24 hours.

These samples were obtained from three pens in which all animals received CCFA treatment. <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates arising from these fecal samples were most likely to harbor the ceftiofur resistance genes, which have been shown to be almost exclusively plasmid borne in North America <xref rid="pone.0080575-Rankin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Winokur1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Folster1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The results revealed an extremely high level of agreement (median &#x003ba;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.93) between the susceptibility results obtained from either a single, or double passage for all 15 antimicrobials. The paired t-test, comparing the MIC values and testing resistant proportions between the two groups, also revealed no significant differences between the results obtained from the two passage approaches (p&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore, we concluded that an extra passage did not lead to significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility results, but it aided in ensuring we had pure cultures to perform further phenotypic and genotypic analyses. An indole spot test was performed on each isolate. Although not definitive for <italic>E. coli</italic>, when combined with the prior probabilities that arise from the selective medium and the morphological selection (including lactose fermentation) the post-test probabilities are well in excess of 99% <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Previous work <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> has suggested that little is gained from biochemical confirmation of NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates over simple morphological selection of a typical colony obtained from MacConkey agar; in that study, biochemical assays confirmed 99.9% of the typical colonies on MacConkey agar to be <italic>E. coli</italic>. A single colony from each of the three MacConkey plates was streaked onto three separate Tryptic soy agar plates (BD Difco&#x02122;, Sparks, MD) and was incubated for 18&#x02013;24 hours.

Basic descriptive statistics were computed by cross-tabulating each of these outcomes across four sampling days for each treatment group. The phenotypic MDR count of an isolate was determined by establishing the total number of antimicrobials, out of the 15 antimicrobials tested on the NARMS panel, to which an isolate was phenotypically resistant. The overall frequency distribution of the phenotypic MDR counts among isolates in all four groups was examined. These distributions were compared to evaluate the treatment effect. Similarly, the presence (or, absence) of the three resistance genes was cross-tabulated by treatment and day, as well as with the phenotypic MDR counts obtained from the NARMS panel. Significance of associations was determined by likelihood ratio chi-square test.

Phenotypic MDR count was defined in this study as the number of antimicrobials, out of the panel of 15 antimicrobials tested on the NARMS panel, toward which an isolate exhibited (binary) resistance. The treatment groups in which all steers received CCFA were observed to have a significant decrease in the proportion of isolates that were pan-susceptible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g008">Figure 8</xref> A, Day 4). There also was a significant effect of CCFA treatment on increasing the likelihood of recovering penta- or deca-resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g008">Figure 8</xref> B &#x00026; C, Day 4). This was in marked contrast to the groups in which only 1 animal among 11 in a pen received CCFA treatment. Less markedly, but also significant, was that feeding of CTC lowered the probability of isolates being pan-susceptible compared with pens of cattle that did not receive CTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g008">Figure 8</xref> A, Day 12). Chlortetracycline administration was also associated with increased odds for recovering both penta- and deca-resistant isolates, and this was especially notable when prior CCFA treatment was administered to only 1out of 11 steers within the pen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g008">Figure 8</xref> B &#x00026; C, Day 12).

This combined with a concurrent, although transient, expansion of the ceftiofur-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> fraction following CCFA administration, resulted in an observed increase in prevalence <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In our study, the total <italic>E. coli</italic> CFU/g of feces also dropped by approximately two logs following CCFA treatment (data not shown) and remained lower than baseline for approximately 8&#x02013;12 days <xref rid="pone.0080575-Norby1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A third study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> reported a similar transient increase in the animal-level prevalence of ceftiofur resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> immediately following ceftiofur treatment. However, they did not observe a herd-level association between levels of ceftiofur use and increased shedding of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates. These authors did not report the variations in the total <italic>E. coli</italic> load among samples collected during the study period; thus, their results could have been biased by ignoring the decrease in background susceptible bacterial population. The fourth study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Tragesser1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> did not observe the animal-level associations between the ceftiofur use and prevalence of <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone; however, while a significant herd-level association was associated with use versus non-use, no dose-response was detected among herds that used ceftiofur. This was a cross-sectional prevalence study conducted in only 18 dairy herds. Herds reporting ceftiofur use had a significantly higher prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance isolates among cattle fecal samples than the herds that did not use ceftiofur. The individual ceftiofur-treated cattle themselves did not exhibit an increased risk of shedding of <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates that had reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone. This result may easily be attributed to the study design; the time duration between ceftiofur treatment and fecal sample collection was not controlled. The increase in shedding of resistant isolates is typically found to be transitory, and resistance levels usually return to baseline levels soon after selection pressures are removed <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Therefore, the probability of finding a significant relationship between ceftiofur treatment and resistant bacteria in the post-antimicrobial washout phase is low within a pen or herd. On the other hand, herd-level associations suggest that a significant treatment- and time-dependent shift in ceftriaxone resistance baseline levels could occur after a product is first introduced into a herd <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, subsequent CTC treatment starting on Day 4 was not associated with a decrease in ceftiofur resistance as was seen in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Instead, CTC greatly delayed the return of ceftiofur resistance to baseline levels following CCFA treatment. Steers from both studies were housed in the same research feedlot at West Texas A&#x00026;M University. The bacterial load was not quantified in the previous study. In the present study, the total NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> load was quantified by measuring CFU counts <xref rid="pone.0080575-Norby1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It was determined that, overall, CTC treatment slightly increased the NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> population. Therefore, CTC treatment might also have led to an expansion of the ceftiofur-resistant population instead. This was in direct contrast to the hypothesis of the present study.</p><p>Although the results were unexpected, they can be explained by simple mechanistic considerations of co-selection. The genotypic analysis of the isolates obtained from this study revealed certain associations: CTC treatment in the absence of prior CCFA treatment significantly increased selection of the <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene over the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene; the two <italic>tet</italic> genes were found to be negatively associated with each other; and the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene was found to be strongly associated with the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene. The CTC treatment in the previous study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> may have differentially selected for isolates with <italic>tet</italic>(B) genes over <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene. The <italic>tet</italic>(B) and <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> genes, not being significantly associated with each other, may have led to the finding of the previous study suggesting that CTC treatment resulted in a preferential selection of tetracycline resistant isolates over isolates co-resistant to both tetracycline and ceftiofur <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, in the present study, pens (or animals) receiving CCFA treatment selected for <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> positive isolates. This expanded population likely also favored the <italic>tet</italic>(A) over the <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene. Subsequent CTC treatment in the present trial may have further expanded this population (isolates harboring <italic>tet</italic>(A) along with <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> genes); therefore, the reduction in ceftiofur resistance was not seen in these pens. A major difference between the present study and that of Platt <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) was that the latter did not include prior &#x02018;priming&#x02019; of the bacterial population with CCFA, either at the pen-level or of single individuals within those pens. Furthermore, the &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; prevalence of resistance to ceftiofur in the experimental feedlot has increased steadily over the years from 2003 through the present as traced from Lowrance <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> through Platt <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although one of our treatment groups closely mimicked the previous study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; that is, where CCFA was administered to 1 among the 11 steers within pens and then later on Day 4 all animals were exposed to CTC treatment, CTC in those pens too was not observed to reduce ceftiofur resistance. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of CTC as an intervention strategy to control ceftiofur resistance, and the difference in study design compared with Platt <italic>et al.</italic> may have caused some of the disparity. However, it is extremely unlikely to have caused all of the disparity. The <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates from both studies are being further characterized to better explain the study discrepancies, especially as relates to the earlier assumptions about the expected associations among <italic>tet</italic>(A), <italic>tet</italic>(B), and <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> genes.</p><p>Over the entire study period, the frequency of phenotypically ceftiofur-resistant NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates was always higher than the prevalence of isolates harboring <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub>. All earlier work in North America suggested that the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene dominated and explained almost 100% of the resistance to ceftiofur in feeder cattle populations <xref rid="pone.0080575-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Alcaine1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. As time moves forward, it is expected that there can be other genetic determinants such as ESBL genes that will contribute to explain the disparity between phenotypic expression and genotype. One previous study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Gow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> indicated that the phenotypic and genotypic disparity could be attributed to other resistance determinants that were not tested for or could be due to the inability of the resistance genes to be turned on, in order to express phenotypic resistance. The isolates in the present trial were further characterized to explain the observed discrepancy between phenotypic expression and genotype. Twenty-nine out of 88 steers tested positive for the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CTX-M-32</sub> gene over the study period <xref rid="pone.0080575-Cottell2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The presence of the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CTX-M-32</sub> gene and <italic>ampC</italic> promoter mutation among NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates almost completely explains the higher frequency of phenotypic ceftiofur resistance observed among isolates as opposed to that predicted by <italic>bla</italic>

A similar effect has been observed elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0080575-Lowrance1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Akwar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Also at the genotypic level, the prevalence of isolates harboring tetracycline resistance genes increased with CCFA treatment. Chlortetracycline treatment further increased the frequency of tetracycline resistance. In this study, in the situation where the vast majority of steers in a pen were not primed with CCFA before CTC treatment, there was a differential selection of isolates harboring the <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene over the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g007">Figure 7</xref> D). Chlortetracycline treatment effects on tetracycline resistance prevalence have been previously investigated <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. One of those studies <xref rid="pone.0080575-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> detected no significant increase in tetracycline resistance following CTC treatment. The authors attributed this result to the gap in sampling time and a low initial prevalence of tetracycline resistance. The other study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> observed a significant increase in the likelihood of recovering tetracycline resistant isolates during and immediately following CTC administration. The effect was transitory, and the prevalence of the isolates with reduced susceptibility returned to baseline levels by 17 days post-treatment.</p><p>Pens in which all animals received CCFA treatment had significantly higher pen-level ceftiofur resistance compared with pens in which only 1 of 11 animals were CCFA-treated. A previous study <xref rid="pone.0080575-Boyer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> in which ceftiofur-treated and non-treated dairy cattle were co-housed, reported a small increase in the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene copy numbers in fecal community DNA of the non-treated animals. The authors attributed this effect to co-mingling of treated and non-treated animals. Those results suggested horizontal transmission of bacterial strains/resistant determinants among the cattle that were housed together. In our study, the non-treated animals were expected to supply susceptible enteric bacteria into the environment within pens when treated and non-treated animals were housed together. The treated animals also were in constant exposure to these susceptible bacteria. These bacteria were expected to improve the microbial ecology of the treated animals by more rapidly returning the gut flora to baseline or equilibrium levels of resistance. However, the present study was not designed to evaluate the animal-level effects of co-housing of treated and non-treated animals; rather, the effects were assessed solely at the pen-level with sufficient statistical power to meet our stated objectives. Further studies are required to establish any individual animal-level effects because insufficient statistical power is present in this study design to evaluate &#x02018;mixing&#x02019; effects on the individual steers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4 total) receiving CCFA among 11 in a pen.</p><p>Antimicrobial pressure exerted both by CCFA and CTC selected for isolates with higher phenotypic MDR counts. The effects of CCFA on co-selecting for other phenotypic antimicrobial resistances besides cephalosporins were more profound than CTC treatment. At the genotypic level, the presence of the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene seemed to have a similar effect on co-selection. Isolates harboring the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene showed phenotypic resistance to a higher median number of antimicrobials when directly compared with isolates that did not harbor this gene. Studies in the United States on <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolates derived from bovine, porcine, and human origin have indicated that the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene is usually located on a large IncA/C plasmid that harbors several other resistance genes <xref rid="pone.0080575-Rankin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Winokur1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Overall across all treatment groups and days, isolates harboring the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene also showed phenotypic resistance against a higher median number of antimicrobials than those isolates carrying the <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene. One previous study instead indicated an association of <italic>tet</italic>(B) genes with more multiple drug resistances when compared with isolates harboring the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene <xref rid="pone.0080575-Blake1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, that was a cross-sectional prevalence study conducted at the farm-level. In this randomized controlled trial, pretreatment (Day 0) results suggested no significant difference between these two <italic>tet</italic> genes with respect to the carriage of multiple phenotypic antimicrobial resistance. CCFA administered on Day 0 selected for isolates harboring <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub>, and this gene was associated with resistance against many other antimicrobials. Importantly, the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene exhibited a positive association with the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene. There was likely to have been co-selection of isolates harboring <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> and <italic>tet</italic>(A) genes because of the initial CCFA treatment. It is also possible that isolates harboring the <italic>tet</italic>(A) gene demonstrated a higher multidrug phenotypic resistance count due to prior CCFA exposure and selection. Therefore, in our study <italic>tet</italic>(A) positive isolates exhibited an overall higher MDR profile than <italic>tet</italic>(B) positive isolates.</p><p>A negative association was found between <italic>tet</italic>(A) and <italic>tet</italic>(B) genes among NTS <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates. Only 0.01% (14 isolates) harbored both the <italic>tet</italic>(A) and <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene. Previous studies also have indicated a negative association between these two <italic>tet</italic> genes <xref rid="pone.0080575-Gow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Blake1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Sengelov1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The negative association between the tetracycline resistance determinants has been suggested by some to be due to the incompatibility of the plasmids that carry these genes <xref rid="pone.0080575-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This possibility is currently being investigated <italic>via</italic> plasmid-typing of these 1,050 isolates. Only three isolates harbored only the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene without the presence of either the <italic>tet</italic>(A) or <italic>tet</italic>(B) gene. Earlier studies in North American cattle have reported that the <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>CMY-2</sub> gene is usually present with at least one other resistance gene. However, we must acknowledge the high probability that there were other unexamined resistance factors present with the gene (beyond those few we examined); in fact, the phenotypic resistance profile suggests this was likely to have been the case, although not always to have been associated with the usual IncA/C plasmid <xref rid="pone.0080575-Cottell2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Carattoli1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>The present system of classifying antimicrobial susceptibility data into susceptible or resistant has been critiqued before <xref rid="pone.0080575-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Such a system does not easily allow for analyzing the trends of changes in MIC values statistically. The changes in the MIC values, both above and below an internationally accepted cut point (e.g., CLSI in North America; EUCAST in Europe), cannot readily be evaluated by the binary coding system. In addition, such cut points are subject to change, especially when they are not based on epidemiological breakpoints. Survival analyses using non-parametric assumptions such as the Kaplan-Meier method <xref rid="pone.0080575-Hidalgo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Hidalgo2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> or Cox proportional hazards model <xref rid="pone.0080575-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> have been proposed as alternative approaches for analyzing MIC data. These methods use the entire dilution range of antimicrobials tested and also deal effectively with the large number of right-censored observations (i.e., isolates that grow beyond the upper limit of antibiotic concentration included on commercially available plates). The resulting survival curves illustrate and compare the proportion of bacteria that are uninhibited at each specific concentration of antimicrobial used, given that these bacteria have survived up to that concentration. In addition, statistics such as the MIC<sub>50</sub> (median MIC) and MIC<sub>90</sub> (90<sup>th</sup> percentile MIC) are readily visible. The drawback of a traditional survival approach is that the proportional hazard and the continuous time data assumptions are typically not met. Instead, we analyzed our MIC data using a logistic model adapted for discrete-time survival data <xref rid="pone.0080575-Hesketh1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Willett1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Hosmer1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080575-Rollo1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Discrete time in our analysis was analogous to the specific concentrations (dilutions) of the antimicrobials on a log<sub>2</sub>-transformed scale (plus four to avoid negative values). The recorded event was the inhibition of the bacterial growth at an observed minimum concentration.</p><p>Fitted survival curves from the discrete-time regression model indicated that administration of both CTC and CCFA selected for higher proportions of isolates that could grow (i.e., were not inhibited) at higher <italic>in vitro</italic> ceftiofur concentrations. The CCFA treatment effect on MIC distributions was much more profound than the CTC treatment effect. Pens in which all animals received both CCFA and CTC treatments had 26% of the isolates that were still able to grow at the highest ceftiofur concentration on the NARMS panel (right-censored on survival curve, MIC above the highest concentration used (8 &#x000b5;g/ml)). Meanwhile, isolates obtained from pens in which only one animal received CCFA treatment, and without subsequent CTC treatment, had almost all of their isolates inhibited by the highest ceftiofur concentration. Differences also emerged among the treatment groups at much lower ceftiofur concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080575-g009">Figure 9:</xref> 2 and 3 on the X-axis, corresponding to concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml, respectively). These curves provide useful information and permit direct comparison of overall trends of the MIC distribution over the entire antimicrobial dilution range for all four groups, rather than simply comparing the proportion resistant/susceptible among the four treatment groups.</p><p>In conclusion, CTC treatment resulted in an increased probability of recovering ceftiofur resistant isolates both at phenotypic and genotypic levels. Chlortetracycline appears to greatly exacerbate ceftiofur resistance levels following CCFA therapy and therefore should be avoided, especially when used in sequence. Unsurprisingly, pen-level ceftiofur resistance was lower in the groups with individual CCFA-treated and other non-treated animals co-housed. Further studies are required to establish the effects on the levels of antimicrobial resistance in individual animals of co-housing antimicrobial-treated and non-treated animals at these and other varying ratios.
