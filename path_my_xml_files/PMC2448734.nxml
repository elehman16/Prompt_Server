Postoperative visual analogue scores over the first 24 hours, using a 10 cm scale, ranged from 3.2-0.5 in the diclofenac group, 2.7-0.85 in the ketorolac group and 2.8-0.5 in the piroxicam group. The scores did not differ significantly between the three groups (p &#x0003e; 0.05). Mean time (SD) to first analgesia was 27(94) minutes in the piroxicam group, 16 (30) minutes in the diclofenac group and 62 (120) minutes in the piroxicam group. Six out of twenty patients in the diclofenac group required further analgesia compared to nine out of twenty in the other two drug groups. This difference was not significant. There were no reports of increased bleeding, bronchoconstriction, bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, renal impairment or pain from the intra-muscular injection site in any of the groups. The administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to patients presenting for laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative pain. There were no obvious differences between the agents used.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00065-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="51" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00065-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="52" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00065-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="53" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00065-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="54" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
