We conducted this study to determine the baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in children suffering from intrathoracic tuberculosis and its association with type and outcome of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Children with intrathoracic tuberculosis, diagnosed on the basis of clinico-radiological criteria, were enrolled as part of a randomized controlled trial on micronutrient supplementation in paediatric tuberculosis patients. Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D were measured in serum samples collected prior to starting antitubercular therapy by chemiluminescent immunoassay technology.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred sixty six children (mean age of 106.9 &#x000b1; 43.7 months; 57.1% girls) were enrolled. Chest X-ray was suggestive of primary pulmonary complex, progressive disease and pleural effusion in 81 (30.5%), 149 (56%) and 36 (13.5%) subjects, respectively. Median serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was 8 ng/ml (IQR 5, 12). One hundred and eighty six (69.9%) children were vitamin D deficient (serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D &#x0003c;12 ng/ml), 55 (20.7%) were insufficient (12 to &#x0003c;20 ng/ml) and 25 (9.4%) were vitamin D sufficient (&#x02265; 20 ng/ml). Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D were similar in all three types of intrathoracic tuberculosis, and in microbiologically confirmed and probable cases. Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D did not significantly affect outcome of the disease. Children who were deficient or insufficient were less likely to convert (become smear/culture negative) at two months as compared to those who were 25-hydroxy vitamin D sufficient (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Interpretation &#x00026; conclusions:</title><p>Majority of Indian children with newly diagnosed intrathoracic tuberculosis were deficient in vitamin D.

The next relevant issue is whether vitamin D deficiency has any detrimental effect on the response and outcome of standard anti-tubercular therapy. The answers to these queries could direct us in planning vitamin D supplementation in TB patients and also in deciding whether all levels of deficiency of vitamin D need to be corrected. There are only a few studies which have addressed these issues, none so in the paediatric population.</p><p>With this background, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were measured in children who had been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effect of micronutrient supplementation in paediatric intrathoracic tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels with the types and outcome of intrathoracic tubercular disease.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in 266 children enrolled in a placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial on micronutrient supplementation in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis. All consecutive children of either sex, between 6 months to 15 yr of age, suffering from probable pulmonary and/or pleural tuberculosis were recruited in 2009-2011 from the Paediatric TB Clinic of two tertiary care centres of New Delhi (All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Kalawati Saran Children Hospital); ethical approval was obtained from both institutions. Diagnosis of probable intrathoracic tuberculosis was based on clinico-radiological criteria<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. After obtaining written informed consent from the parents, children with probable TB were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Induced sputum and gastric lavages were collected on two consecutive days and examined for acid fast bacilli (AFB) by Ziehl-Neelsen (Z-N) staining and cultured on automated BACTEC-MGIT 960 system, (Becton, Dickinson &#x00026; Company, USA). Cell count, biochemistry, Z-N stain, and culture for AFB and bacteria were performed on pleural fluid. The procedures were performed at both the sites. Pleural fluid was collected from children who had a pleural effusion.</p><p>Based on chest X-ray findings, children with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis were categorized into three categories: primary pulmonary complex (PPC), progressive pulmonary disease (PPD) and pleural effusion (PE)<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. PPC included lymph node with small alveolar shadow; PPD group included consolidation, cavitatory lesion, miliary tuberculosis and multiple mediastinal adenopathy with or without parenchymal lesion.</p><p>Outcome of antitubercular therapy was measured in two groups: cured and extension of therapy. Children were declared &#x0201c;cured&#x0201d;, if there was significant resolution of radiologic findings (&#x0003e;2/3<sup>rd</sup>) and symptoms at six months of therapy and the treatment was discontinued. Extension of therapy included children whose category I therapy was extended or changed to category II/ second line antitubercular drugs for persistent symptoms or poor resolution of radiographic findings. Induced sputum/ gastric lavage conversion at two months was also assessed in the group of children who had a microbiological confirmation of diagnosis at baseline. All children with diagnosis of tuberculosis were treated with daily antitubercular therapy and were monitored as per standardized protocol<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Detailed history, clinical examination and anthropometric measurements were recorded for all enrolled patients.</p><p><italic>Measurement of 25-hydroxy vitamin D</italic>: Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D were measured together for all samples after the RCT had ended. About 3 ml blood was collected prior to starting antitubercular therapy in plain zinc free tubes for micronutrient estimation. Serum was separated within one hour and one aliquot of 300 &#x003bc;l was stored at -20&#x000b0;C till further analysis. Similar sample collections were also performed at two and six months of therapy. Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were measured from the stored serum samples by chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology using Liaison<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 310600 system (DiaSorin Inc; USA) following the manufacturer's protocol<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The analytical measurement range for the DiaSorin LIAISON 25-hydroxy vitamin D Total Assay is 4 to 150 ng/ml. The lowest reportable value is 4 ng/ml, based on an inter-assay precision that approximates 20 per cent CV.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Children were classified into three groups according to circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. Those with serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level &#x0003c;12 ng/ml were grouped as deficient, 12 to &#x0003c;20 ng/ml as insufficient and &#x02265;20 ng/ml as sufficient<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Analysis was done using the software Stata, version 9 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test and ANOVA were used for categorical and continuous variables as appropriate. The baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were log transformed and then we calculated the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. Height-for-age (HA) and weight-for-age (WA) &#x02018;Z&#x02019; scores were computed using the nutritional anthropometry module of Epi Info version 5 software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, US), based on the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) - WHO reference curves<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.

We are unable to comment whether this is because of association of low 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels with tuberculosis or simply reflects the vitamin D deficient or insufficient status of the general population. It has been reported that 75-85 per cent of Indian school-going children have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>Many studies have evaluated the association of tuberculosis with low serum vitamin level and the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. But there are no reports available on association of severity of vitamin D deficiency and types of tubercular disease in children. A study conducted on South Korean adults showed that baseline serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were low in all patients with tuberculosis and levels did not differ between patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In our study, we did not observe any difference in the serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the three types of the tuberculosis (PPC, PPD and PE).</p><p>There has been speculation on whether vitamin D supplementation can hasten the cure of tuberculosis when used in conjunction with standard antitubercular therapy. If 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels can be shown to have any correlation with the outcome of tubercular disease, this mode of intervention may be logical. In our study, a relation was observed between sputum conversion at two months with the baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. We observed lower baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in children who did not show sputum conversion than who did. There are a few other studies which have looked into this aspect of relationship between vitamin D and tuberculosis and they have also displayed a poor outcome in the 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficient population. A Japanese study conducted by Sato <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> has suggested that low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level may not only increase the risk of developing active TB but may also be related to the poor treatment outcomes, which was measured by time taken to obtain three consecutive negative sputum smears or TB bacteria cultures. This study included only 38 subjects with tuberculosis and because of small sample size, results of this study cannot be extrapolated to whole population. Rathored <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> studied 354 multidrug resistant (MDR) and 338 drug sensitive Indian TB patients and found that 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were lower in MDR group than the drug sensitive TB patients. Also in MDR-TB, smear conversion time was negatively correlated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Spearman's &#x003c1; coefficient &#x02212;0.14, <italic>P</italic>=0.03), but culture conversion time did not show any such significant relationship<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. An older Indonesian study on 40 patients of pulmonary tuberculosis documented that the disease was less extensive in patients who had higher 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Sputum conversion rate at two months have been considered as a predictor of relapse of tuberculosis in adults with longer time to conversion being associated with higher relapse rates<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>.</p><p>Since this study was a subset of a randomized control trial, almost half of children received vitamin D as a part of micronutrient supplementation. This supplementation did not affect the outcome or influence the effect of vitamin D deficiency as demonstrated by multivariate analysis. Our children were biochemically deficient/insufficient in vitamin D, but they did not manifest as clinical rickets. None of these children were given therapeutic vitamin D supplementation as all assays were done after the completion of clinical trial and the children did not have clinical signs/symptoms of rickets.</p><p>The strengths of this study included a large sample size and the use of a sensitive technique for 25-hydroxy vitamin D level estimation. But the study had some limitations. We did not estimate vitamin D intake, duration of sun exposure and degree of skin pigmentation, all of which might have helped in explaining the low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. The study was carried out in children enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and not as an independent study. We did not enrol healthy controls, which would have helped us determine the role of low 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in predisposing to development of tuberculosis in children. The number of children with poor outcome was small; a much larger sample size will be needed to have the appropriate power to determine the differences in vitamin D status.</p><p>In conclusion, majority of the enrolled children with microbiologically confirmed and probable intrathoracic tuberculosis demonstrated low serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (deficient and insufficient levels) and the levels were not associated with type and outcome of TB. However, children who did not demonstrate sputum conversion after intensive phase of antitubercular therapy had lower baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels as compared to those who did.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors thank Prof. R.M.
