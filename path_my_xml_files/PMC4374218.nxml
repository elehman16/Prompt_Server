After informing the Ethical Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all the participants, 20 patients of either sex, aged between 70 and 80 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I and II, undergoing herniorrhaphy, dynamic hip screw fixation for inter-trochanteric fracture femur, open reduction internal fixation for distal femoral fracture, interlocking nailing for fracture tibia and hip replacement were included. The patients having metabolic disorder, psychiatric illness, neurologic disease, on cardiovascular medications, those with history of hypersensitivity to clonidine or local anesthetics, alcoholics, also patients with a body weight of &#x0003e;120 kg, a height of &#x0003c;150 cm, and those with conditions that preclude spinal anesthesia were excluded from the study. Preanesthetic check-up of the patients under the study, were done a day before surgery and were counseled regarding adequate starvation, sedation, local anesthesia, the operative procedures and also were educated about the visual analog scale (VAS)[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] regarding the rate of experience with the analgesia.

Investigations were done according to the institution's protocol. Patients were not premeditated. On arrival in the operation theater, multipara monitor was connected (Philips-Intellivue MP20) for recording the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), heart rate (HR), electrocardiography, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Intravenous (IV) line was established with an 18-G bore cannula and IV preloading was done with 15 ml/kg of Ringer's solution about 15 min before the intended time of intrathecal drug administration. Under all aseptic and antiseptic precautions, spinal anesthesia was administered in sitting position at the L3-L4 interspace using midline approach with a 25 gauge Quincke spinal needle. After ensuring a free flow of cerebro spinal fluid, the Clonidine group (group I) received a single dose of 15 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) plus 7.5 &#x003bc;g of preservative free clonidine. The patients in the Control group (group II) were given 15 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) mixed with an identical volume of saline. Patient was then made to lie down immediately and the level of sensory block was assessed by pin-prick method using a 25-G short beveled needle and reassessed every 3 min for 15 min to record the highest level of block and the time taken to achieve the highest level. Degree of motor block, at the same intervals as sensory block, was assessed as per modified Bromage scale:[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>

</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>It was shown that clonidine suppresses the generation of action potentials in tonic-firing spinal dorsal horn neurones, and therefore could contribute to increase both sensory and motor blocks of local anesthetics[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] by 30-50% using doses as high as 1 or 2 &#x003bc;g/kg. This is possibly due to the fact that &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists induce cellular modification in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and facilitate the local anesthetic action. Prolongation in sensory block can be due to vasoconstrictive effect of clonidine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Improved analgesia, at these doses is associated with systemic side effects such as sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Following intrathecal administration of clonidine, its analgesic effect is mediated spinally through activation of post synaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -receptors in substantia gelatinosa of spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Clonidine administered through neuraxial route also has a local effect on sympathetic nerves in the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -adrenergic agonists reduce arterial blood pressure and produce sympathicolysis through effects at specific brainstem nuclei and on sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. These effects are counteracted by direct vasoconstriction resulting from the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -adrenergic agonists on the peripheral vasculature. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -adrenergic agonists in combination with local anesthetic can potentially increase the degree of sympatholysis resulting hypotension.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Clonidine thus affects arterial blood pressure in a complex manner because of opposing actions at multiple sites.

The data obtained from our study indicates that addition of 7.5 &#x003bc;g of clonidine to 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine in a sample size of septuagenarians significantly prolongs the analgesia and motor block and thus reduces the postoperative analgesic requirement.

It is pertinent to mention that the dose of intrathecal clonidine, in our study, is significantly low than the studies conducted by Racle <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Niemi,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Acalovschi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Filos <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] De Kock <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We observed that peak sensory level was comparable among the groups in our study and the findings were similar to the study conducted by Van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study longer duration of analgesia observed was same as with Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] when their dose of clonidine was 15 &#x003bc;g and motor block was also similar to Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] when they used even higher doses. Incidence of fall of MAP was there in the studies done by Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] starting from 45 min post spinal, though in our septuagenarians, the fall was from 20 min post spinal but only 1 patient required intervention. No patient in our study complained of dryness of mouth unlike Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or nausea vomiting unlike Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study, no septuagenarian was observed having sedation unlike the subjects of Niemi[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Acalovschi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] because patients in their studies received clonidine in higher doses. Our study thus implies that it is possible to achieve equally good analgesia without side effects when clonidine is used in dosages as low as 7.5 &#x003bc;g intrathecally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To prolong spinal anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing sub-umbilical surgeries, alternative anesthetic techniques such as epidural or combined spinal-epidural, may be technically difficult and time consuming. In addition, the motor blockade during epidural anesthesia is often not as satisfactory as during spinal anesthesia. So we emphasize on that, in septuagenarians for sub-umbilical surgeries, the addition of clonidine to bupivacaine in the dose as low as 7.5 &#x003bc;g (approximately 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg) significantly increases the duration of spinal analgesia with clinically insignificant influence on hemodynamic parameters and level of sedation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
