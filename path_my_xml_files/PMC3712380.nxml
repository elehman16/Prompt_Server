Patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were told about the study and informed consent was taken from subjects who agreed to participate in the study.</p><p>Randomization was done by computer-generated numbers using the n Query advisor program. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: (1) The group which followed only the standard therapy for diabetes (Standard group). This group had 28 patients. The standard therapy included dietary advice, brisk walking for 45 minutes daily and oral antidiabetic drugs. (2) The other group (SKY group) underwent a comprehensive yogic breathing program in which they were taught SKY and Pranayam. This group continued the standard therapy as well.

It can also be taught in a short course of 12 h over 3 days. This short course was used in the present study. Sudarshan Kriya is a rhythmic cyclic breathing of slow, medium, and fast cycles done 3 times in a count of 20, 40, 40 respectively. It is preceded by a 3-stage Pranayam in Ujjayi breath, Bhastrika: Rapid inhalation and exhalation; and brief chanting. These processes are practiced while sitting with the eyes closed and the awareness focused on breathing. This process ends with rest in a tranquil supine position.</p><p>It has to be learnt under guidance of a certified teacher. This course includes yogic movements and postures (asanas), relaxation practices, meditation, group processes, and discussion of stress-relieving principles.</p><p>Comprehensive yogic breathing program was a 3-day 12 h course in which the breathing techniques were taught. The group undergoing yogic breathing training was told to practice it every day and to attend weekly follow-up at the assigned centers. They were asked to fill a follow-up diary, in which they were marking the days on which they did breathing techniques at home and got it countersigned by a relative or attendant daily and by the yoga teacher each time they attended the weekly follow-up.</p><p>Patients underwent fasting plasma glucose (FBS), post prandial plasma glucose (PPBS), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) at baseline and 3 and 6 months post randomization.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Deep breathing test: The patient sat quietly and was instructed to breath smoothly, slowly, and deeply at 6 breath/min. (5 seconds inspiration and 5 seconds expiration), a rate which produces maximum variation of heart rate. Heart rate was measured from electrocardiogram Delta heart rate was the difference between maximal and minimal heart rate during inspiration and expiration, averaged for 6 cycles. E: I ratio was the ratio of longest distance between two r waves (R-R interval) and shortest R-R interval, averaged over 6 cycles.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Valsalva maneuver: The subject sat quietly and blew into a mouth piece attached to a sphygmomanometer generating a pressure of 40 mm Hg for 15 s. At the end of 15 s, the pressure was released. Due care was taken to prevent deep breathing before and after the maneuver. Valsalva ratio was calculated from longest the R-R interval during phase IV to the shortest R-R interval during phaseII.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sustained handgrip test: The baseline blood pressure (BP) was recorded in the subject. Then, the patients were asked to grip the handgrip dynamometer using maximum force with their dominant hands for a few seconds. The value was noted down and the procedure was repeated thrice. The maximum value of the 3 readings was considered as their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). A mark was made on the dynamometer at 30% of MVC of the subject. The patient was then instructed that he/she had to maintain the grip on the dynamometer up to the mark for 4 min. After the patient had started, the BP was measured on the contra-lateral arm at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> min. It was calculated by subtracting from their highest diastolic BP during the test to the baseline diastolic BP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cold pressor test: The baseline BP of the subject was recorded. The subjects were advised to immerse their hand in cold water of temperature 10&#x000b0;C up to the wrist for 1 min. The BP was taken just before the hand was taken out of the water. It was calculated by subtracting from the highest diastolic BP during the test to the baseline diastolic BP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lying to standing test: This test was conducted after 10 min of supine rest. Then the patient was told to stand within 3 s and BP and heart rate were recorded at baseline and at 2<sup>nd</sup> min. 30:15 ratios were calculated as the ratio between longest R-R at or around the 30<sup>th</sup> beat and shortest R-R at or around the 15<sup>th</sup> beat.</p></list-item></list>

Pre- and post-intervention heart rate changes during deep breath, 30:15 ratio, and E: I ratio were done in 60 subjects. Valsalva ratio could be done for 47 and 48 patients pre- and post-intervention. Sustained hand grip could be done for 59 patients pre- and post- intervention. Similarly, 58 and 59 subjects were able to perform cold presser test pre- and post-intervention respectively.
