therapies on cognition, depression, and activities of daily living in elderly patients
with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six participants comprised 2
groups. The experimental group (n=13) received combined fine motor skill and cognitive
therapy, and the control group (n=13) received only general medical care. [Results] The
experimental group showed improvements in cognition, degree of dementia, depression, and
activities of daily living compared to the control group. However, there were no
significant differences between the two groups. [Conclusion] These results suggest that
combined fine motor skill and cognitive therapy improves cognition, degree of dementia,
depression, and daily living in elderly patients with AD. These therapies would therefore
be effective as general medical care strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dementia is characterized by impairment of cognitive function, which continually
degenerates. It is a complex clinical syndrome that involves memory impairment, behavioral
disorders, and personality changes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
main features of dementia are reduced cognitive ability, neurological and psychiatric
symptoms, and functional disability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) has a similar clinical presentation to vascular dementia, but they
differ because the onset of AD typically occurs in old age. Typical symptoms include memory
loss and functional language deficits. In addition, AD symptoms are irregular and
fluctuating<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, which includes frontal
lobe symptoms such as impairments in executive cognitive functions such as attention,
planning, and cognitive processing speed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
As a result, people with AD experience severe behavioral changes such as depression,
behavioral delay, psychomotor slowness, and anxiety<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. AD is associated with damage to the hippocampus and entorhinal
cortex<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, which progresses to the
prefrontal, right parietal posterior, occipital, and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex,
as well as to the nigrostriatal cells<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As elderly patients with dementia age, they show reductions in abilities such as sight,
balance control, vestibular function, and proprioceptive sensation. These reductions
contribute to physical inactivity, cognitive impairment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, increased muscle stiffness, and functional limitations, which
result in reduced activities of daily living, weight gain, and muscle loss. Physical
weakness therefore increases<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
emotional disorders that occur in 40&#x02013;50% of elderly patients with dementia decrease quality
of life, negatively impact other health conditions, and impair cognitive function<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The complicated characteristics of elderly patients with dementia
are interrelated and contribute to progressive impairment. Therefore, an integrated approach
is necessary in order to improve health and preserve functional ability and quality of life
and for elderly patients with dementia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study investigated the effects of combined cognitive and fine motor activity
therapies on the degree of dementia, depression, and activities of daily living in elderly
patients with the AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants were 26 patients with AD who were at least 65&#x02005;years old, and who attended the
Gyeonggi S Senior Center. Inclusion criteria were as follows: no exercise habits, CDR 0.5&#x02013;5
points, a diagnosis of AD, no regular cognitive rehabilitation treatment after onset of
dementia, and ability to understand simple verbal instructions. Participants were excluded
if they had vascular dementia by stroke, diagnosis of other dementia, fracture or
musculoskeletal disorder<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, or brain
surgery. The present study was approved by Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board
(SYUIRB2014-027) and each subject was able to follow instructions and gave informed consent
by signing an approved consent form; thus, the rights of human subjects were protected.</p><p>Characteristics of the combined fine motor skill and cognitive therapy group were: 3 males
and 10 females, mean age of 80.15 &#x000b1; 5.21&#x02005;years, mean height of 156.15 &#x000b1; 10.38&#x02005;cm, mean
weight of 54.08 &#x000b1; 9.32&#x02005;kg, and duration after AD onset of 5.46 &#x000b1; 3.71&#x02005;years. Characteristics
of participants in the control group were: 2 men and 11 women, mean age of 80.00 &#x000b1;
6.90&#x02005;years, mean height of 151.46 &#x000b1; 6.94&#x02005;cm, mean weight of 53.46 &#x000b1; 12.24&#x02005;kg, and duration
after AD onset of 5.77 &#x000b1; 3.41&#x02005;years. There were no significant differences in participant
characteristics between the groups.</p><p>Thirty-nine participants were divided into either the cognitive intervention group with
fine motor activities (n = 20) or the control group (n = 19). Four of 29 participants in the
experimental group had limited participation, and 3 participants in the experimental group
abandoned the study. In the control group, 6 of 19 participants were excluded due to
deteriorating health. Both groups were treated with 5&#x02005;mg donepezil just prior to sleep, once
daily for 12 weeks. Participants in the experimental group engaged in fine motor activities
for 60&#x02005;min, thrice a week for 12 weeks.</p><p>Cognitive therapy with fine motor activities consisted of coloring, singing<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, matching picture cards, playing
instruments, physically interactive games (ball toss, bowling, and ring toss), doing
puzzles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, chopsticks games, janggial
football, and a fishing game. Therapy was conducted using a chair or a wheelchair with
armrests and back, a desk, and small tools. First, a physical therapy program occurred for
5&#x02005;min in order to release shoulder and neck tension by stretching and clapping. Next, fine
motor activities occurred for 50&#x02005;min. Finally, cool down exercises were performed for
5&#x02005;min.</p><p>Dementia was assessed using the Korean Convenience Mental State Examination (Korean-Mini
Mental State Examination, K-MMSE). K-MMSE primarily assesses cognitive ability, is highly
reliable (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.98), and consists of scales to assess disorientation, memory,
visual ability, concentration, calculation, verbal language, writing, reading, and
configuration abilities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The degree of dementia in elderly patients with AD was assessed using the Clinical Dementia
Scale (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR). The CDR assesses both Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia and the
severity of different types of dementia. It consists of 6 subscales, including memory,
orientation, judgment and problem-solving, social activities, family life and hobbies, and
personal hygiene. CDR data are analyzed with a complex algorithm and yield scores from 0&#x02013;5
points, with higher numbers indicating more severe dementia (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.90)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Overall degeneration associated with dementia was assessed with the Global Deterioration
Scale (GDS). The GDS is most widely used as the basis for determining drug therapy for
patients with dementia. It evaluates declining cognition and social functioning, and
consists of subscales for memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving skills, social
activities, family life and hobbies, and hygiene or grooming (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.93)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Korean form of the Geriatric
Depression Scale (KGDS) was used to assess depression. The KGDS is useful for administration
to elderly people who are healthy, ill, or have impaired cognition, and consists of 30 scale
items. Depression is classified as mild (14&#x02013;18 points), moderate (19&#x02013;21 points), or severe
(22 points or more) (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.94)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Caregivers of the study participants completed the KGDS.</p><p>Daily living skills were assessed using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The MBI consists
of the following 10 subcategories: personal hygiene, bathing, eating, toileting, climbing
stairs, dressing, adjustable stool use, urine control, walking or wheelchair use, and
transferring to chair or bed, which are scored to a maximum total of 100 points (Cronbach&#x02019;s
&#x003b1; = 0.90)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data were analyzed with SPSS version 19.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted as a test of
normality. Descriptive statistics were used to describe participant characteristics, and
independent sample t-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests assessed homogeneity between groups.
Paired t-tests were used to evaluate changes before and after the K-MMSE, CDR, GDS, KGDS,
and MBI. Independent t-tests were used to test differences in demographic characteristics
between groups. Values of p&#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>K-MMSE, CDR, GDS, KGDS, and MBI scores improved in the experimental group but only KGDS
scores improved for participants in the control group. However, there were no significant

motor activities on cognition, degree of dementia, depression, and activities of daily
living in elderly patients with AD. Physical activity affects cognitive function of elderly
patients with dementia as they age<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>K-MMSE scores significantly increased following cognitive therapy with fine motor
activities. Scores were significantly decreased between the experimental and control groups.
CDR scores and GDS scores were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared to
the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). In a previous study, Spector<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> administered a cognitive stimulation program that included using
money, a ball game, and a word game, which was realistic training for patients with
dementia. The training was conducted for 45&#x02005;min twice per week for 7 weeks. Patients were
assigned to either the experimental group (n = 115) or the control group (n = 86). The
experimental group participated in the cognitive stimulation program and the control group
received only general medical intervention. There were significant increases in the
experimental group MMSE scores compared to the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Yamanaka<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed a cognitive
stimulation program for patients with dementia, which also occurred for 45&#x02005;min twice per a
week for 7 weeks. The experimental group (n=26) participated in a cognitive stimulation
program that included word puzzles, word games, physically interactive games, puzzles, using
tools, number card games, and using money. The control group (n=30) was observed only. MMSE
scores were significantly increased in the experimental group compared to the control group
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Jean<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 22 patients with
dementia, who had mild cognitive impairment. Eleven participants in the experimental group
were participated in face-name associated training with errorless learning and spaced
retrieval training, as well as memory training. Eleven participants in the control group
participated in face-name associated training with errorless learning, as well as memory
training. All participants completed 6 45&#x02005;min sessions. CDR scores significantly decreased
in both groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). This study showed increased cognition, similarly to the
findings of Spector<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> and Yamanaka<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The degree of dementia also decreased,
similarly to the findings of Jean<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
order to increase cognitive functioning, aerobic exercise or strength training is thought to
be fundamental. However, a recent study demonstrated that the effects of exercise are
mediated via synaptic plasticity mechanisms or neuron generation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study
also considered that fine motor activities can enhance cognitive functioning. Brain areas
responsible for the hand function are utilized, so fine motor activity should improve
cognitive functioning due to stimulating both the premotor cortex and also the nerves of the
other cortex. The degree of dementia in elderly patients with AD is thought to significantly
decrease because of increasing the cognitive function.</p><p>Depression can occur at any age, and it is a mental illness with both social and personal
effects. Cognitive impairment and dementia risk increase in elderly patients with
depression<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yoon<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 20 patients with dementia. An experimental group
(n = 11) was offered exercise programs with cognitive activities for 20&#x02005;min thrice a week,
for 12 weeks. A control group (n = 9) was provided only with cognitive activities for 20&#x02005;min
thrice a week, for 12 weeks. General physical therapy was offered to both groups for 30&#x02005;min,
5 times a week, for 12 weeks. Depression in patients with dementia was assessed by GDS. Both
groups had significantly decreased GDS scores (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but there was no difference
between groups.</p><p>Kerse<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> used the Otago program with 193
elderly people with depression, for 30&#x02005;min thrice a week, for 6 months. The experimental
group (n = 97) participated in upper extremity exercise programs from the Otago exercise
program and the control group (n = 96) had only a social visit. As a result, GDS-15 scores
significantly decreased in both groups (p &#x0003c; 0.001), but there was no difference between
groups. In this study, KGDS was used to assess depression in elderly patients with
Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia. KGDS scores decreased significantly in the experimental group compared
to the control group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The present study found decreased depression, similarly
to the results of Yoon<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kerse<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Depression includes impairment in
cognitive functioning and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living due to
Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia. However, cognitive treatment with fine muscle activity improved not
only cognitive function and the ability to participate in activities of daily living, but
also decreased depression.</p><p>The variation in findings between studies likely results from differences in study
durations, participants, and treatment methods. Physical activity is necessary to the
elderly, who are often concerned about the possibility of declining health, including social
support, lack of exercise, discomfort, and falls. Decreased abilities of elderly patients
with dementia to perform activities of daily living contribute to difficulties with walking
or climbing stairs, which increase the probability of a fall, followed by entering a medical
institution, and incurring the associated medical costs<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Tsolaki<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated gait and balance
in 176 elderly people with mild cognitive impairment. There were 20 sessions once a week for
12 weeks. The experimental group (n = 104) participated in cognitive training, including
naming objects and numbers backwards. The control group (n = 72) was primarily observed
only. Activities of daily living significantly increased in the experimental group (p &#x0003c;
0.001). In the present study, the MBI measured ability of elderly patients with AD to
perform daily living tasks, and found that MBI was significantly increased in the
experimental group compared to the control group. There was a significant difference between
groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Our findings demonstrating increased activities of daily living are
similar to results reported by Tsolaki<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Fine muscle activities with cognitive therapy improved hand manipulation for elderly
patients with AD, improved sensation and function of the hand, and improved performance of
activities of daily living. Although not a replacement for a walker, a cane, or other
suitable balance treatments, improved hand function contributes to reducing fear to perform
activities of daily living for elderly patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. In addition,
activities of daily living were enhanced by improved cognitive functioning. Executive
function in elderly patients with AD was advanced due to various activities such as
coloring, using chopsticks, Jenga and block play, mosaics, puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, playing
instruments, singing, and tossing a ball. MBI scores increased through these processes. MBI
scores of 50&#x02013;74 points indicate a moderate level of independence in daily life. Therefore,
although the MBI scores increased from 5.38 points to 60.92 points for elderly patients with
AD in the present study, these patients still require assistance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Benzi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Moretti</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Is there a rationale for the use of acetylcholinesterase
