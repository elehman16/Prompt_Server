relation to lying positions of experimental participants. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty
participants participated in this experiment. Measurements were taken in the supine
position, the left side-lying position, the right side-lying position, and the prone
position. Vital capacity (VC) was evaluated using a Fit mate. [Results] A comparison of
four lying position showed significant differences in participants&#x02019; VC. In comparison of
four position, supine and left sidelying, and between supine and right sidelying, and
between supine and prone, between left sidelying and prone. [Conclusion] In conclusion,
changing the participants lying position produce changes in pulmonary functions. The
greatest change occurred with a supine lying position. We presume that ventilation is
affected by body structures. The results provide objective data for establishing the most
suitable positions for stroke patients performing respiratory exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Position</kwd><kwd>Change</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The posture of the body affects the distribution of ventilation and perfusion because of
gravity and non-gravity factors in humans<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, which induces a maximum air exchange depending on the gravity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Posture also affects the operation of the
respiratory muscles by changing the length of the muscles, even though they stay stable<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These changes are known to be influenced by
the skeletal structure, the elasticity of the soft tissue around the thorax, and the power
of the operating muscles in the respiratory system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated the respiratory function of normal individuals in a
supine position. For example, Townsend<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>
stated that a reclining position causes blood congestion in the pulmonary blood vessels, as
the abdominal organs put pressure on the diaphragm, pushing it toward the head, and the
venous return increases; in this situation, lung volumes are relatively reduced. Allen et
al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that, in a reclining
position, the amount of blood in systemic circulation, which moves to pulmonary circulation,
increases. This scenario decreases the volume of the thorax, and abdominal contents press on
the diaphragm, leading to labored breathing. When the respiration influenced by the activity
of the rectus abdominis is measured, the pulmonary function is significantly improved in the
sitting posture compared to the lying posture<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Morgan et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
noted that a reclining position weakens the back muscles, which subsequently reduces lung
capacity. In addition, Song et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Hong et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that normal
individuals in a lying position showed an overall larger increase in lung capacity than
those in a standing position. This finding indicates that pulmonary function is reduced due
to changes in physical structures and the effects of gravity.</p><p>While considerable research has examined the effect of gravity on lung capacity in the
lying posture, little research has compared the lung capacity of various lying postures.
Therefore, this paper analyzes the lung capacity in various lying postures to obtain
specific and objective data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were 20 university students attending N University in Cheonan, Chungnam.
The participants were selected from among those who had no particular history of lung
diseases and smoking; had no accompanying damage, such as congenital deformation of the
chest; and had not received any particular treatment to improve pulmonary functions. The
participants understood the purpose of this study and consented to participate. This study
was approved by the International Review Board of the Korea Nazarene University and was
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects (n=20)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.7 &#x000b1; 3.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">171.7 &#x000b1; 9.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.8 &#x000b1; 15.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SD.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the general characteristics of group.</p><p>In this study, the participants lay down on a bed within a treatment room maintained at an
average temperature of 20&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. They relaxed to encourage expansion of the thorax and movement
of the abdominal walls. A curtain was drawn over the participants to help them maintain
psychological stability. The participants straightened out their legs on the bed and kept
their head and trunk straight. After that, the participants changed their position to lie on
the left side and their lung capacities were measured. After a five-minute break, they were
measured again lying on the right side. If a participant complained of fatigue or dizziness
during respiration measurement, a break was taken and the exercise resumed some time later.
Prior to the measurement, the tester taught each participant the proper method for
respiration measurement 2 or 3 times to ensure the participant was comfortable performing
it<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pulmonary function of the participants was measured in a sitting position using a tool
called Fitmate (COSMED, Sri, Italy). To ensure accurate measurements, the tester explained
and demonstrated the exercise to each participant beforehand. Experimental group was
instructed to use the mouthpiece and to block the nostrils during the measurement so that
air was neither inhaled nor exhaled through the nose. Starting from exhalation, the
participants slowly exhaled to maximum level following the tester&#x02019;s signal and then slowly
inhaled; volume capacity (VC) were measured at this time<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS Version 12.0 program for Windows. To compare and analyze
chest mobility and pulmonary function in relation to position, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed. For post-analysis, to show differences among the positions, Fisher&#x02019;s
least significant difference (LSD) test was used. The statistical significance level, a, was
chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We review the comparison of pulmonary function during maximal inspiration according to the

male and female university students in their twenties. The participants were asked to lie on
their backs, right sides, left sides, and prone, and the changes to their lung capacity were
measured to examine the pulmonary function in each posture. As lung capacity is a
fundamental measure to evaluate respiratory function and it varies in each posture, for
accurate evaluation of the respiratory function, it is necessary to compare the lung
capacity according to postural changes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the standard suggested by Scot
and Jan<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, the lung capacity value was
selected as the average of three time measurements. From the standardization of experimental
participants, sufficient intervals between each posture is required<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; thus, approximately 10 minutes were assigned to postural
changes during the experiment. The measurements of the changes in lung capacity in the lying
postures indicated that lung capacity is highest in the supine posture and lowest in the
prone posture. The verification test of changes in lung capacity found a significant
difference between lying supine and other lying postures, and a significant difference was
also evident between left side-lying and lying in the prone position. When participants lay
in the prone position, the top surface of the bed and the gravity disturbed the movement of
the diaphragm, which directly affected the functionality of the thoracic wall and diaphragm
and thus deteriorated the participants&#x02019; ventilation. During inspiration, the contraction of
the diaphragm and other muscles were disturbed; thus, a significant change was caused by the
restricted increase of volume in the thoracic cage. As a result, the change in lung capacity
was more remarkable when the participants lay supine compared to the other positions.</p><p>In the study by Kim et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
postural change of obese participants affected the movement of the respiratory muscle, so
that the change in the lung capacity was diversified in each posture. Lying on the side was
disadvantageous for normal ventilation compared to lying on the back. Badr et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the maximal expiratory flow rate
and the respiration volume. These changes can be caused by the skeletal system, elasticity
of the soft tissue around the thoracic cage, and the power of the muscle operating the
respiratory system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Morgan et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that a reclining position weakens back
muscles, which subsequently reduces lung capacity. He suggested the theory of abdominal
activity that the gravity was supported by the abdominal muscles in the standing posture;
meanwhile, the contraction of the diaphragm increases the movement of intercostal muscles.
Song et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that normal
individuals in a lying position showed an overall larger increase in lung capacity than
those in a standing position. In the study of Ko et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the contraction of the diaphragm caused limited expansion in the
volume of the thoracic cage and changed the volume around the abdomen, thereby decreasing
the elasticity when the participants lay on their back because of the influence of gravity.
The result of Ko&#x02019;s<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> study of pulmonary
function was similar to the result in this paper. Therefore, the result of the study
suggested that lying on the back is the most efficient and stable posture for the
respiratory function both in the clinic and everyday life in bed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This Research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hildebrandt</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Long-term spiroergometric studies of paraplegics during
