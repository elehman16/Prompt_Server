Hence we chose to examine the effects of two proprietary fish oil products with different EPA&#x02236;DHA ratios (EPA-rich, high EPA&#x02236;DHA; DHA-rich) on mental processing speed and visual evoked brain activity. We proposed that nonlinear multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP) would be sensitive to any alteration of the neural function induced by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, because the higher order kernel responses directly measure the degree of recovery of the neural system as a function of time following stimulation. Twenty-two healthy participants aged 18&#x02013;34, with no known neurological or psychiatric disorder and not currently taking any nutritional supplementation, were recruited. A double-blind, crossover design was utilized, including a 30-day washout period, between two 30-day supplementation periods of the EPA-rich and DHA-rich diets (with order of diet randomized). Psychophysical choice reaction times and multi-focal nonlinear visual evoked potential (VEP) testing were performed at baseline (No Diet), and after each supplementation period. Following the EPA-rich supplementation, for stimulation at high luminance contrast, a significant reduction in the amplitude of the first slice of the second order VEP kernel response, previously related to activation in the magnocellular pathway, was observed. The correlations between the amplitude changes of short latency second and first order components were significantly different for the two supplementations. Significantly faster choice reaction times were observed psychophysically (compared with baseline performance) under the EPA-rich (but not DHA-rich) supplementation, while simple reaction times were not affected. The reduced nonlinearities observed under the EPA-rich diet suggest a mechanism involving more efficient neural recovery of magnocellular-like visual responses following cortical activation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>While the cardiovascular benefit of dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is generally accepted, direct benefits to neural and cognitive function are controversial. Omega-3 PUFAs are one of the major components of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes in the brain. DHA (22&#x02236;6 n-3, docosahexaenoic acid) in particular, is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) - in grey matter and myelin and is found in high concentration in the outer segment of retinal photoreceptors <xref rid="pone.0028214-SanGiovanni1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It is also well accepted that diets deficient in DHA affect electoretinogram (ERG) response amplitudes in animal models <xref rid="pone.0028214-Weisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and young infants <xref rid="pone.0028214-Birch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. By comparison, EPA (20&#x02236;5 n-3: eicosapentaenoic acid) is present in very low amounts in the brain and retina <xref rid="pone.0028214-SanGiovanni1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and has been reported to inhibit the production of vasoregulatory, pro-aggregatory and pro-thrombotic eicosanoids such as thromboxane 2 and prostaglandins. Such inhibition is likely to lead to a reduction in blood viscosity and platelet aggregation <xref rid="pone.0028214-Pascoe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further, EPA supplementation has also been reported to improve mood and alleviate the intensity of psychiatric symptoms in disorders such as schizophrenia and depression (reviewed <xref rid="pone.0028214-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). However to date the neurophysiological effects of EPA have not been explored.</p><p>Omega-3 fatty acid supplementations containing EPA and DHA in varying amounts have been reported to improve visual attention <xref rid="pone.0028214-Vaisman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Fontani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Fontani2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-DeGroot1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> information processing speed <xref rid="pone.0028214-Fontani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, literacy <xref rid="pone.0028214-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, memory and learning <xref rid="pone.0028214-DeGroot1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, in young children and adults. However, while such cognitive changes have been interpreted in terms of alterations in the functionality of cortical regions involved in attention <xref rid="pone.0028214-Fontani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-McNamara1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, they could also be the result of improved cerebral blood perfusion and increased oxygen supply to the brain <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sinn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, reduced inflammation <xref rid="pone.0028214-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, or could derive from changes in synaptic transmission <xref rid="pone.0028214-Holtzheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, or neural plasticity <xref rid="pone.0028214-Calderon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This research area is still controversial as some studies have not found any beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0028214-Antypa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-VandeRest1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Stough1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>A previous fMRI study exploring the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on neural activity reported that DHA-supplementation leads to an increase in functional activation (blood-oxygen-level dependent - BOLD response) in dorsolateral prefrontal areas and a decrease in the left middle frontal gyrus, temporal and occipital areas in healthy children <xref rid="pone.0028214-McNamara1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These results however, also need to be viewed in terms of other possibilities. A change in the BOLD response could be due to direct changes in neural function, or it could be due to other effects, such as changes to the arteriolar perfusion of oxygenated haemoglobin affecting the significance of BOLD signal change when comparing task versus rest conditions.</p><p>Hence, we wished to investigate the effects of omega-3 oils on brain processing using direct measures of neural function, under different dietary conditions. The nonlinear multifocal Visual Evoked Potential (mfVEP) is ideal in this regard. Using pseudo white-noise binary visual stimulation (pseudo-random flicker between two luminance levels), the multifocal Wiener kernel method enables a complete spatio-temporal analysis of response to stimulation <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sutter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. While the first order Wiener Kernel of the VEP provides a temporally linear estimate of the difference in response to the two stimulus levels, the second order kernel responses of the VEP gauge the effect of previous flash stimuli on subsequent visual responses, and can be interpreted as indices of how rapidly the cortex recovers after stimulation <xref rid="pone.0028214-Baseler1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Klistorner1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, greater recovery of a neural system would be indicated by reduced amplitudes of the second order kernel responses. Hence, the relationship between amplitudes of the first and second order kernel responses is of great interest in terms of interpreting the physiological mechanisms underlying any changes observed.</p><p>The major wave of the first slice of the 2<sup>nd</sup> order kernel response (K2.1, measuring the effect of the previous stimulus, some 13 ms prior) has previously been attributed to visual magnocellular (M) activity on the basis of similarity of the contrast response function to that of the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) M response (high contrast gain, contrast saturation and short latency). The major waveform of the second slice (K2.2 - measuring the effect of the stimulus two frames back, or 26 ms prior) is thought to reflect P activity (lower contrast gain, the absence of saturation and a longer latency to peak than the M input) <xref rid="pone.0028214-Klistorner1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The role of the M pathway in cortical processing has been related to visual cognitive tasks such as visual attention and global processing of visual stimuli (reviewed <xref rid="pone.0028214-Laycock1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). In particular, the nonlinearity associated with the magnocellular contribution to the mfVEP has recently been shown to be abnormally delayed in individuals with high autistic tendency <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, possibly explaining the deficient global processing in these individuals. Thus, given the reported cognitive benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, we predicted that any change in neural function due to omega-3 supplementation would most likely be revealed in differences in the second order kernel slice responses.</p><p>The contrast reversing pattern VEP has been used previously to demonstrate a beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the speed of development of the visual system in infants and young children <xref rid="pone.0028214-Birch2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Jacques1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, in cases of PUFA deficiency such as in phenylketonuria in children, fish oil supplementation has been shown to reduce latencies of VEP potentials <xref rid="pone.0028214-Koletzko1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, both sets of findings could be related to the availability of DHA in the photoreceptor outer segments, reducing latency of visual information output from the retina (conforming with PUFA deficient animal models <xref rid="pone.0028214-Weisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). In addition, the effects of EPA on visual processing have not been explored.</p><p>Thus, the main aim of this study was to evaluate whether two omega-3 fatty acid supplementations differing in terms of EPA and DHA levels would alter magnocellular and parvocellular cortical function, as measured by components of the nonlinear multifocal VEP showing strong similarity to primate magno and parvocellular physiology. Further, based on the prediction that these changes should be reflected in the performance on visual tasks, we also investigated the effects of the two supplementations on mental processing tasks measuring motor reaction times to both simple and complex (choice) visual stimuli, such tasks having already been shown to be sensitive to the effects of nutritional supplementation <xref rid="pone.0028214-Pipingas1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Recruitment and data collection were carried out May 2007 - September 2009.

The derivation of the binary kernels and kernel slices is by means of cross-correlation between the m-sequence controlling the binary stimulus and the visual response (for additional information on pseudorandom sequences and Kernel extraction please refer to Sutter's reviews <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sutter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sutter2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). Three kernel measures were investigated: the first order response, the first slice of the second order response and the second slice of the second order response. The computation of the first order response (K1) is equivalent to adding all the response epochs in response to visual stimulation. For example if a patch can assume black (B) and white (W) colours, the sum of response epochs to black stimuli (R<sub>B</sub>) are subtracted from the sum of response epochs (R<sub>W</sub>) to white stimuli (K1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;R<sub>W</sub>&#x02212;R<sub>B</sub>). The first slice of the second order kernel (K 2.1) represents the effect on a flash response from a response occurring in the immediately preceding visual stimulation to the response to the following stimulus. K2.1 is calculated by subtracting the sum of responses where a white stimulus is followed by a black stimulus and the sum of responses where a black stimulus is followed by a white stimulus, from the sum of response epochs to two continuous white stimuli and two continuous black stimuli (K2.1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;R<sub>WW</sub>&#x0002b;R<sub>BB</sub>&#x02212;R<sub>WB</sub>&#x02212;R<sub>BW</sub>). The second slice of the second order response (K2.2) represents the effect on a flash response from a response occurring in the visual stimulation to the stimuli presented two visual stimuli prior (with frames of either polarity in between). IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego) was utilized to produce grand mean average VEP kernel waveforms (first order, K1, and the first and second slices of the second order responses - K2.1 and K2.2 respectively) for the central (foveal) stimulus patch, and for identification of individual peak amplitudes and latencies. Window settings for each of these peaks were established after visually analyzing the data (e.g. for the K2.1 high contrast response, the window setting for the P1 was 75&#x02013;125 ms), in order to include all participants' major positivities and negativities.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mental processing speed and mfVEP data was analyzed using a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS Statistics (IBM, version 19) and JMP (SAS corporation v9).

At high stimulus contrast, VEP nonlinearities suggested to be generated by the M pathway, were reduced after EPA-rich supplementation compared with measurements made at baseline. The smaller N1 and P1 amplitudes of the first slice of the second order response (high stimulus contrast) reflect a more rapid recovery of M pathway functioning under the EPA-rich compared with the No Diet conditions. This interpretation is further supported by the negative correlation between the amplitude differences of the major P1 positivity of the K1 and K2.1 responses observed for the EPA-rich supplementation.</p><p>While this is the first use of nonlinear VEP to investigate the neural effects of PUFA supplementation, attribution of the VEP changes observed to magnocellular processing need to be closely investigated. Other techniques purportedly measuring magnocellular and parvocellular function generally do so by interpreting changes in the evoked response to modification of the stimulus parameters. Thus Butler et al. <xref rid="pone.0028214-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> used a stimulus pedestal approach with steady-state responses (SS-VEP) to investigate schizophrenic versus control participants, finding reduced magnocelluar-biased response amplitudes in the schizophrenic group. However, this approach has been criticized <xref rid="pone.0028214-Skottun1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> on the basis of the difficulty of using contrast response relationships alone to identify magnocellular and parvocellular responses under different stimulus conditions with the one assay (the SS-VEP). The Wiener kernel approach, used here, has a second-order kernel structure with two major waveforms, separated by interaction time into different slices of the kernel, showing differences in contrast gain, amplitude saturation and latency <xref rid="pone.0028214-Klistorner1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> expected from primate physiological studies. Thus at any stimulus contrast, magnocellular and parvocellular responses can be recorded simultaneously with this approach.</p><p>Given that previous studies have shown that PUFA deficient diets affect the electroretinogram, what evidence is there that the results observed are due to alteration in cortical rather than retinal processing? The answer lies in a comparison of physiological and behavioural parameters. PUFA deficient animals show differences in the implicit times of the ERG components &#x02013; which then should translate into altered latencies for cortical response. However, there were no such differences observed between supplementations either at high or low contrast for the N1 peak of the K1 or K2.1 responses &#x02013; i.e. magnocellular afferent latency to cortex was unaffected by either supplementation. Secondly, the differences found in choice, but not simple reaction times suggests the involvement of cortical processes. If there had been a photoreceptoral advantage of one supplementation over another, then it would be expected to contribute to both choice and simple RTs. Finally, primate studies indicate that the temporal nonlinearities are stronger in cortical neurons than in retinal or geniculate neurons, with higher cut-off temporal frequencies for retinal ganglion cells than for cortical neurons <xref rid="pone.0028214-Shapley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that if changes in nonlinearities are observed, the major contribution will come from cortical regions.</p><p>On the basis that EPA-rich supplementation significantly reduced nonlinearities related to magnocellular but not to parvocellular activity, and considering that the magnocellular pathway anatomically projects to cytochrome oxidase-rich, highly metabolically active areas of the primary and secondary visual cortex (reviewed <xref rid="pone.0028214-Nassi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>), we propose that the improved neural recovery observed in this study under high contrast conditions is likely to be the result of alteration in the energy supply for peak metabolic activity. Liu and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0028214-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> showed, using fMRI, that magnocellular activating tasks result in greater levels of deoxygenated hemoglobin than do parvocellular activating tasks. As a consequence, M-connected neurons would be more vulnerable than P-connected neurons to changes in glucose or oxygen supply under conditions of maximal demand.</p><p>While improved availability of energy is likely to be the result of increased cerebral blood perfusion <xref rid="pone.0028214-Sinn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, other mechanisms could impact. These include the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory cytokines, already noted in depression (reviewed <xref rid="pone.0028214-Pascoe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>), as well as direct effects of PUFAs on the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic clefts <xref rid="pone.0028214-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Grintal1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> through astroglial involvement in the glutamate/glutamine cycle. Thus, further investigation of the interaction between PUFAs , eicosanoids and neurotransmission is indicated.</p><p>While the crossover design used possesses marked sensitivity benefits in terms of within subject comparison across the supplementation conditions for the complex VEP waveforms, one concern in terms of supplementation is that DHA is cleared from plasma more slowly than EPA <xref rid="pone.0028214-Arterburn1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Rapoport1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028214-Marangoni1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, the randomised order of supplementations appears to have controlled for the variation in washout. The differential relations observed between K2.1 and K1 amplitudes (and the motor response times) for DHA-rich and EPA-rich diets support this contention.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings provide evidence of improved neuronal magnocellular recovery following stimulation at high contrast couple with faster reaction times for complex but not simple reaction times in response to visual stimuli following an EPA-rich supplementation. In addition, we show significant differences in the effect of the two supplementations, in terms of the relation between first and second order VEP responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028214.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Module one, core application form and checklist for the protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0028214.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028214.s002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Module 2f: Detailed protocol for projects involving drugs and therapeutic devices.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0028214.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Rachel Gold and Laura Sellick for help with data collection and analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>IB and AP have been paid honoraria by the study sponsor Novasel Australia to speak at a pharmacolology conference.
