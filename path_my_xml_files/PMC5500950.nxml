Interventions included a physiotherapy treatment program that was semi-standardised and consisted of (i) manual therapy; (ii) hip strengthening and functional retraining; and (iii) health education. Control treatment encompassed individualised health education sessions. The primary outcome measure was feasibility, which was reported as percentage of eligible participants enrolled, adherence with the intervention, and losses to follow-up.

The identification of physiotherapy interventions that can reduce the symptomatic progression of hip OA is important and may limit the public health burden seen in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hip joint pathology is a common cause of hip pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] amongst people aged 18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and may represent early hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The increase in hip arthroscopic surgery in countries such as Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] has increased the diagnosis of hip joint pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There have been a number of clinical protocols (level 5 evidence, which is the lowest form of research evidence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that have described physiotherapy programs following hip arthroscopy. These protocols describe weight-bearing progression, range of motion exercise, gentle strength exercise, and return to activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, level 5 studies have described the development of non-surgical treatment protocols for femoroacetabular impingement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite this, there is no level 1 evidence to support physiotherapy rehabilitation programs following hip arthroscopy.</p><p id="Par7">Chondropathy, which may indicate early-onset hip OA, is a common finding in people who undergo hip arthroscopy and is associated with worse pain, difficulty participating in physical activity, and reduced quality of life compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, people with early-onset hip OA demonstrate reduced hip joint range of motion (ROM) and hip muscle strength compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as well as poor performance and reduced balance on functional tasks such as single-leg squat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Better performance in hip joint ROM and muscle strength is associated with better quality of life outcomes in people with early-onset hip OA after hip arthroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, interventions that target physical impairments may improve quality of life outcomes in this patient group.</p><p id="Par8">As full-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are expensive, it was important to establish feasibility before undertaking such a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. No RCT examining the effects of a physiotherapy intervention had been undertaken in this population, and therefore, adherence with the intervention, patient and therapist willingness to participate, feasibility of recruitment, and acceptability of interventions were unknown. Therefore, before committing to the expense of a full-scale RCT, an understanding of the feasibility of such a study was required. The primary aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility of a future definitive study, estimate the sample size for such a definitive study, and offer recommendations regarding research design.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">The results of this study suggest a full-scale RCT is feasible. Thirty-five percent of eligible participants were randomised; there was excellent study treatment adherence and no loss to follow-up at the end of the study treatment period. Participants and treating physiotherapists expressed a willingness to take part in future studies and offered suggestions for improvement. An estimated sample of 142 participants would be required in a full-scale RCT.</p><p id="Par39">The successful completion of a RCT evaluating a physical intervention faces a number of challenges. Clinician barriers include time constraints, lack of staff training for treating therapists, concern for patients&#x02019; welfare, loss of professional autonomy, difficulty with the consent procedure, and lack of rewards and recognition. Patient barriers include additional time demands of taking part in a trial for the baseline and follow-up assessment and concerns about information and consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Funding constraints meant that the number of intervention sessions was capped at eight visits regardless of symptoms and constrained to 12&#x000a0;weeks of duration during a late-stage period of rehabilitation when the longer-term gains from manual therapies may have plateaued. Based on feedback from participants, greater availability of appointments and increased number of supervised exercise sessions would improve motivation and compliance. In order to achieve this, additional funding is likely to be required to support a full-scale study.</p><p id="Par40">The rate of recruitment in this feasibility study was modest, with 17 participants out of 48 (35%) prospective subjects participating. While many studies do not report their rate of recruitment, other RCTs examining physiotherapy intervention cite from 32% for OA total knee joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and 62% for OA hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Full RCTs examining physiotherapy treatment effects on musculoskeletal conditions have utilised much larger sample sizes designed to detect statistically significant changes based on the MCI of the measuring tool used as well as allowing for a 10&#x02013;15% drop out rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The results from this study suggest that a sample of 142 participants would be required, allowing for 10% loss to follow up. To progress this study to a full-scale RCT, with recruitment occurring over 2&#x000a0;years, 405 eligible patients would need to be invited to take part to achieve adequate numbers from 35% recruitment rate. As such, the number of participating surgeons would need to be increased to recruit adequate numbers within an acceptable trial period. For this study, we recruited five patients per month from a single surgeon and single physiotherapy centre. If a full-scale RCT was conducted in a single centre, recruitment would take 28&#x000a0;months. If the number of surgeons and physiotherapy centres was doubled, we estimate recruitment into a full-scale RCT would be achieved in 14&#x000a0;months. Additional recruitment and retention incentives could be employed to enhance these aspects of a full-scale RCT.</p><p id="Par41">Participants recruited into this study were aged 31&#x000a0;years on average, with a normal to slightly overweight BMI. We used inclusion criteria for early-onset hip OA as chondropathy greater than or equal to Outerbridge grade 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which is equivalent to OARSI grade 2 (chondral surface continuation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This stage of OA is generally not visible on radiographs, and therefore, our patients are younger than those with early to moderate hip OA using radiographic OA grading systems such as the Kellgren and Lawrence scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Even taking these differences into consideration, it is possible that participants in future studies, and patients seen in clinical practice, will be older, with greater BMI and more advanced hip OA than those included in this study. In an older, more overweight group, with more advanced OA, improvements in outcomes and differences between groups may be smaller. As such, in older patients, a larger sample size than the 106 people recommended in this study may be required. Future studies may choose to stratify groups based on factors such as age or treatment centre, and the required sample size would need to be increased to reflect this. Greater improvements in PRO in this feasibility study are promising for physiotherapy rehabilitation intervention, and this supports a larger study, with recommended participant numbers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;142) to detect a between-group difference in change scores.</p><p id="Par42">Flexion ROM did not improve in either group. Improving hip flexion was a target of the evaluated physiotherapy intervention/treatment since greater flexion ROM was independently associated with better scores in both HOOS-Q and IHOT-33 12 to 24&#x000a0;months post-hip arthroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is unclear why flexion ROM did not improve in the current study. It is possible that the patients in this study, who were up to 18&#x000a0;months post-hip arthroscopy, may have reached the ceiling in their potential hip flexion ROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The current study was also most likely underpowered to detect a statistically significant change in ROM. Clinical guidelines and anecdotal evidence suggests that clinician-administered mobilisations might be effective in patients with hip pain, but there is little evidence to support this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Future studies with larger patient groups that have adequate power to detect an improvement are required.</p><p id="Par43">Muscle strength gains were minimal in the current study. Improving muscle strength was a key component of the physiotherapy intervention. The training program was based on the best available knowledge of impairments in people post-hip arthroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The number of sets and repetitions were deemed adequate to introduce changes in the muscular system in previously untrained subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and strength gains were expected within a 12-week time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The lack of measured muscle strength change in the intervention group may be due to a number of factors: (i) the specificity of the strength exercises, while improving functional ability, may not have transferred to improved strength using open-chain, isometric testing. &#x02018;Transfer of training&#x02019; is a term used to describe the effectiveness of adaptations from a strength exercise transferring to functional performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In this study, testing force production in an isolated manner may have reduced the validity of the overall force capabilities of the participant&#x02019;s leg musculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. (ii) It is possible that more marked strength, coordination, and neural adaption gains may have already occurred during earlier phases of rehabilitation, prior to patients entering this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A systematic review of rehabilitation following hip arthroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] categorises the rehabilitation phase from 3 to 7&#x000a0;months post operation as &#x02018;return to sport&#x02019; meaning that for the recruits in this study, most of these neural adaptions may have already occurred. (iii) Progressive overload of the exercise is necessary for maximal muscle fibre recruitment, and consequently, muscle fibre hypertrophy and strength increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Variations in load, length or volume of training programmes affect the rate of strength gain. It is possible that while the exercises in this study contained progressive resistance, they were not optimally progressed or were too easy in terms of repetitions and load to induce hypertrophy and strength change. (iv) Numerous resistance-training studies have shown frequencies of 2&#x02013;3 alternating days per week in previously untrained individuals to be an effective initial frequency whereas 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days per week appear to be an effective maintenance frequency for those individuals already engaged in a resistance training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The frequency and compliance to frequency of exercise in this study may have been too low to optimise strength gains. (v) Finally, while reported compliance was good, it is possible that participants did not fully engage with the programme when outside the supervision of the treating physiotherapists. Future studies that are adequately powered need to utilise current knowledge in strength and conditioning and surrounding technologies to optimise the opportunity for strength gains. Exercise programs should be commenced earlier; there should be greater incentives for compliance, with more focus on monitoring home exercises; treating therapists should more actively monitor the progression of exercise program, possibly with physiotherapist-supervised exercise sessions. If future studies include participants who are older and heavier, the length of the intervention may need to be increased to accommodate the likely slower gains in strength expected.</p><p id="Par44">As well as addressing the criteria of a high quality RCT, this study had a number of strengths including the willingness of the study population to remain in the trial and use of the same practitioners in the same environment for both treatment groups to minimise sources of variation. The PRO measures used have been demonstrated previously to have the best psychometric properties for use in a post-hip arthroscopy cohort. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] Additionally, the measurement tools for ROM, strength, and function are reliable, with predetermined MIC levels. The majority of potential limitations of this study have been outlined above. As no strength changes were observed, it is possible that the duration, content, and load variables of the exercise programme may not have been optimal. In addition, this study did not collect information on adherence to the home exercise program. Further, we did not determine acceptable thresholds of feasibility a priori; instead, we chose to explore these aspects to inform the design of future, fully powered RCTs. It is important that these results are not interpreted as definitively supporting one intervention over the other, given the very small sample used in this study. Finally, the participants in the education control group were unblinded and were aware with their treatment group allocation, given the differences in treatments. All efforts were made to minimise the impact of this through the same treatment location, frequency, and duration of treatment applying to both groups. In addition, the same treating physiotherapists treated patients from each group. However, this may have resulted in more negative follow-up scores in the control group. Future full-scale RCTs may choose a control intervention that more closely resembles the physiotherapy intervention. These limitations should be considered from the viewpoint that the aim of a feasibility study is to determine the viability of continuing with an adequately powered RCT and identify potential improvements to the study protocol and procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">Feasibility results support a full-scale RCT to determine the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions in people with early hip OA. Participants were willing to take part and offered suggestions for study improvements. For a full-scale RCT, at least 142 participants would need inclusion. In addition, we recommend a number of modifications to the intervention to enhance its effectiveness. Timely recruitment would be enhanced by using at least two surgeons and physiotherapy centres in a full-scale study. This study provided encouraging results for the physiotherapy intervention in the areas of improved PROs (iHOT-33 and HOOS) affecting symptoms, pain, and activities of daily living. Flexion ROM was also improved by a minimal amount in the physiotherapy intervention group while muscle strength did not change. The results of this feasibility trial suggest that a full-scale RCT with participant numbers appropriate to achieve statistical power and strength programme modification is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Mr Michael Pritchard MBBS FRACS for his assistance in patient recruitment and Bodysystem Physiotherapy PL for assistance in delivering the treatment interventions.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par46">This study was funded by the Australian Physiotherapy Research Foundation Beryl Haynes Memorial Tagged Grant (T13-BH007).
