According to the German Federal Statistical Office, changes will result in a shortage of more than 150,000 full-time nurses in Germany in 2025.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One possible strategy to cope with a nursing shortage would be to postpone the retirement age. However, only a few nurses want to keep practising until they reach the official retirement age due to the physical and social demands of the profession. Other important factors that lead to early retirement include work-related stress and impaired mental health.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Compared to other professions, nurses frequently suffer from emotional distress or mental disorders.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] According to results of the nurses&#x000b4; early exit (NEXT)-Study, which had more than 28,000 participants from 10 European countries, a high psychological burden the strongest factor associated with an intention to leave (ITL) the profession. Comparisons among various age groups suggest a higher mental strain in older nurses than in their younger colleagues.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, effective preventive intervention programmes addressing the nursing staff workforce aged 45 and older are required to reduce work-related distress in order to maintain mental health until retirement age.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, interventional studies that focus on the challenges of ageing workers are insufficient.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Regarding healthcare workers, there is no single efficacy study on interventions that focus on the special needs of nursing staff aged 45 and above.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, the process of successful ageing has been studied both theoretically and empirically. Gerontologists have been concerned with the study of theories of successful ageing during the last decades.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The most prominent construct&#x02014;the Selection, Optimization and Compensation (SOC) model [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]&#x02014;has been largely investigated in the context of occupational health.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Overall, the SOC model suggests that available resources can be used more efficiently by selecting fewer but carefully chosen goals (S), pursuing these goals optimally (O), and addressing barriers through compensatory means (C).[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Exploratory research has shown that SOC is helpful in promoting employees&#x02019; psychological health across their work-life span[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, SOC can explain how older employees continue functioning despite the loss of resources.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a recently published paper, M&#x000fc;ller et al. demonstrated for the first time that training based on the principles of SOC could enhance the psychological well-being of nurses in a small sample with a mean age &#x0003c;45.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Against this background, we primarily aimed to examine the efficacy of a small-group intervention for older nurses (aged &#x02265;45) that combined elements of an occupational health intervention [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] based on SOC with several strategies for stress prevention (such as group dynamic principles and cognitive-behavioural techniques) in a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial. A framework proposed by the Medical Research Council for designing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used to develop the intervention. In addition, the costs of the intervention were calculated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study centres and design</title><p>We conducted a two-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two conditions, namely, a small-group intervention of seven weekly sessions of 120 min with a booster session after six weeks and a waiting list condition (WLC). The intervention group (IG) received the training, while the remaining participants formed the control group (WLC group), which received the training after the intervention group had finished the training.</p><p>The study was carried out at four trial sites in Germany. The medical hospitals of the University of Heidelberg, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, and Ulm as well as a community hospital in Aalen (county of Baden-Wuerttemberg) were the participating centres.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Procedure and ethical approval</title><p>Participants were recruited in accordance with the staff council and the nursing management of all trial sites. Following the approval of the staff council and the nursing management, all nursing employees aged &#x02265;45 were invited by email to participate in the study with the help of the respective human resources departments, which provided the lists of all relevant employees. In cooperation with the nursing directors, the staff council and the department heads, nurses were further intimated through information meetings, placards and written information about the intervention. The study purpose (Intervention to promote &#x0201e;healthy aging at work&#x0201c;) was explained in the informed consent and additional written materials as follows: &#x0201c;the aim is to explore your own resources, reflect your working biography, and improve personal resources and skills to maintain quality of life.&#x0201d;</p><p>It was agreed with the Staff Council that the survey and group training participation would take place during working time. All outcomes were measured via validated self-report questionnaires. No interview survey was performed. We have adhered to the ethical principles in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects of 2013. Written, informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Participation was voluntary, and participants could withdraw at any time without any consequences. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Medical Faculties of the University of Ulm (ID: 358&#x02013;11), the University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf (ID: 4537R; ID: 4675R), and the University of Heidelberg (ID: S-663/2013) in March 2014 (3-24-2014). The study was registered retrospectively in the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN14793147). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. In accordance with the study protocol that was approved by Ethics Committees before enrollment, the timetable (but not the content or dose) of the intervention was slightly modified. In a preliminary qualitative and a pilot study with the aim to test the intervention's feasibility and acceptance, participants advised an adaption of the manual from 10 sessions, 90 minutes a week and one booster session after 4 weeks (990 minutes) to a format with 7 sessions, 120 minutes a week and one booster session after 6 weeks (960 minutes). Details of the development and pilot process of the intervention have been published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In short, as the intervention was performed during working time, nursing staff needed a format with less appointments. A timetable with 7 sessions and one booster session after 6 weeks was more compatible with the rotating shift schedule of the participants. Ethical approval for the altered version of the timetable of the intervention was obtained in April 2014 (4-29-2014) before the study started. The Intervention started in June 2014. Further, the following deviations from the study protocol were made: Nursing staff criticised the length of the assessment. Three of the initially defined secondary outcome measures were rejected by the nursing staff and were therefore eliminated: the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Nordic questionnaire, and the work related self-efficacy scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants</title><p>We included currently employed nurses aged &#x02265;45 who had sufficient skills in reading and writing German and had submitted written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: membership in a respective management team or leadership position, occupational disability (i.e. the continuing inability to continue working with patients due to physical or psychological impairment), cognitive impairment (i.e. not being able to follow the informed consent or other indications that the contents of the intervention cannot be followed) and serious physical or psychiatric illnesses at the time of recruitment. Symptoms of serious physical illness were defined as follows: untreated diseases requiring urgent diagnostics and further treatment such as severe shortness of breath, dizziness or angina pectoris. Severe psychiatric symptoms were defined as follows: requiring an immediate treatment such as acute suicidal tendencies, psychotic symptoms, dissociation or flash backs and severe addictive diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Randomisation procedure</title><p>Participating nurses were randomised to either the IG or the WLC group. Participants received a sealed envelope addressed to each personally and containing additional information about the study and the baseline questionnaire. To enable individual matching of the measurements, each participant was assigned digit codes to ensure pseudonymisation. Randomisation was performed after baseline assessment using a web-based randomisation program by an independent researcher who did not have any information about the participants. The intervention was not blinded as the participants were aware of their allocation to either the intervention or control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Intervention and control condition</title><p>Following comprehensive development (according to the guidelines of the Medical Research Council [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), we conducted a two-armed RCT. The detailed procedure of intervention development has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Small groups were led by one to two trainers (a psychologist and/or a doctor trained in psychotherapy and as a group leader). The minimum qualification was a degree in medicine or psychology and training or experience in psychotherapy/group leading with a working experience of at least two years. Approximately 10 employees comprised one group. The training included seven sessions, 2 hours a week, for a period of seven weeks. After a six-week break, there was another booster session. The WLC group received the same treatment after a break of one week after the IG&#x02019;s booster session.</p><p>The key components of the single sessions have been described in detail in previous publications [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, in the following section we would like to outline briefly the essential theoretical background and contents of the individual sessions:</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Session one</title><p><bold>Introduction to the subject: &#x0201e;ageing in care professions&#x0201d;.</bold> The first session had the aim to raise and to share consciousness of the mental health related risks of the nursing profession by giving information and discussing personal experiences. The first session also was developed to give the members of one group the possibility to create group cohesion. Apart from getting to know each other as a group, the discussion centered on what aging in care professions meant to participants, what difficulties they encountered and what personal resources they experienced. In the light of the health belief model, participants were encouraged to explore personal risk factors and resources (protective factors) to trigger internal cues of action. In terms of the trans-theoretical model of Behavior Change, we intended to reach the stage of contemplation, in which the participant&#x02019;s awareness about the causes of high mental strain, that could be influenced by them increased.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Session two</title><p><bold>Reflecting the working biography.</bold> Biography work was chosen to stimulate new self-understanding and, in turn, to awaken interest in the experiences of the other group members (in order to deepen the contents of the first group meeting). Group cohesion was strengthened. Against the background of the social cognitive theory [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the session was created to share resources and experiences of overcoming barriers. It was hypothesized that an exchange with each other could strengthen personal self-efficacy and perceived collective efficacy. One key message (result) at the end of the session could be formulated as follows: &#x0201c;We have already overcome difficult situations during our careers and we are able to change our environment&#x0201d;. Exchange of working life experiences and the reframing of difficult memories may be an important intervention component.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Session three</title><p><bold>Coping with stress and the concept of mindfulness.</bold> In terms of the transactional model of stress (Lazarus and Folkman), the intervention comprised several components of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping.

During the third session, participants were taught emotional coping strategies such as mindfulness based stress reduction and other relaxation techniques. The mentioned strategies served as methods to improve emotional states. According to Bandura&#x000b4;s Social Cognitive Theory we hypothesized that participants accomplish a certain level of capability to improve emotional states in difficult situations.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Session six</title><p>In the sixth session, the focus was on reflecting age stereotypes and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of work between different generations including new perspectives on ageing.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>SOC-focused sessions (four, five, seven, and booster session)</title><p>The SOC model was implemented in a problem focused way [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In terms of human action regulation, SOC can be defined as a combination of goal-related action strategies (goal setting theory [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). In this action-theoretical formulation of SOC, the focus is on active strategies of life management. It is adaptive to set goals, acquire and invest means into the pursuit of these goals, and do so persistently even in the face of setbacks and losses. [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, the main component of the implementation of SOC within the intervention was to establish a personal SOC-project that aims toward more effective coping with individual job demands. Another aim was to activate an individually valued job resource. Participants define a specific goal (selection), develop an action plan to achieve this goal in an optimal way (optimization), and consider alternative strategies in cases of external or internal hindrances during goal accomplishment (compensation). Within the small group setting the participants worked together on setting goals and solving problems together in their peer group whenever barriers in achieving their goals occurred.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Outcome parameter</title><p>All outcomes were measured via validated self-report questionnaires.

Despite the aforementioned challenges of an ageing workforce in nursing with a high ITL the job because of mental strain, almost no intervention has focused on the specific requirements of ageing nurses. Our study shows that it is possible to achieve participation of ageing workers by using approaches that are tailor-made for the specific needs of that population. The results of our work show statistically significant small effects on different mental health-related outcome measures such as mental health-related quality of life and irritation. No significant differences between groups were found for well-being, depression and anxiety symptoms or work-related outcome measures such as the WAI and TAA.</p><sec id="sec039"><title>Prevention in healthcare workers</title><p>The reported results support the effectiveness of our intervention in reducing work-related mental strain and improving mental HRQOL. The reported effect sizes are comparable to those from other studies in the health care sector not focusing on our target population of ageing workers [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. No effect of our intervention was found on well-being. Well-being that was measured with the WHO-5 Well-being Index has strong negative associations with depression measures. The items of the WHO-5 comprise three core symptoms of depression, such as &#x02018;(lack of) positive mood, interests and energy&#x02019;.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The lack of statistically significant differences between the IG and the WLC group regarding well-being could be due to a ceiling effect. Compared to a clinical sample, the participants of our study did not have a high mental health burden. Therefore, we were unable to generate significant changes in the well-being scores through our intervention.</p><p>However, the levels of irritation were significantly reduced through our intervention. At baseline, the mean levels of irritation were higher than the norm sample (n&#x0003e;4000) from working and general populations [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This corresponds to the findings of many studies that have indicated a higher risk for mental strain and impaired mental health in nurses than that in the general population. Furthermore, this finding is in line with data that suggests a higher mental strain in the older compared to the younger workforce [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. No effects on anxiety and depression symptom severity were detected. This finding could be a result of moderately elevated depression and anxiety symptoms before the start of the intervention; thus, it could also be explained by a ceiling or a floor effect. Another explanation could be that the clinical outcomes of depression and anxiety are less sensitive to change in the context of our preventive intervention.</p><p>With regard to healthcare professionals, several individual training and organisational intervention approaches aimed at preventing or reducing work-related stress have been investigated in RCTs [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, in a recently published Cochrane review, the authors rated the quality of the evidence of general preventive interventions in healthcare workers as low because of a lack of well-designed randomised controlled trials. For example, in comparison to our study, power calculations were often missing, or studies were not registered [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, many of these studies faced high attrition and had only few participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec040"><title>Selective vs. indicative approaches</title><p>Promoting health in the workplace is the most important part of prevention. Prevention programs offered at the workplace provide a good opportunity to reach people at high risk for mental strain. Preventive interventions can be administered to individuals at high risk (selective prevention) or to individuals with subclinical symptoms (indicated prevention).[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Contrary to indicative prevention studies,[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] we did not choose a high level of mental strain as an inclusion criterion. Instead, we invited all employees aged &#x02265;45 interested in participating. A major advantage of our selective (instead of an indicative) approach is that stigmatisation due to mental health-related problems was precluded. From a scientific perspective, the major disadvantage of a selective approach is the loss of statistical power to detect changes in clinical outcome measures.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] However, stigmatising attitudes towards employees with mental disorders seem to be a major reason for the delay in seeking help and could serve as an explanation for the attrition reported in other studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec041"><title>Preventive interventions for the ageing workforce</title><p>Even regarding other occupations, there is little evidence on interventions targeting the successful ageing of the working population.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] In a recently published review, Cloostermans et al. noted a dearth of studies in the area of an ageing workforce.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Compared to our study, the researchers chose a relatively low cut-off age of 40 years and could only identify four studies that met their inclusion criteria. Moreover, of the four studies, only two specifically targeted ageing workers (&#x02265;40 years), while the other two studies performed subgroup analyses of participants aged &#x02265;40. It can be concluded that there is a paucity of interventional studies with regard to the ageing workforce. What could be the reason for this? It must be noted that not only mental health-related issues but also the focus on an ageing workforce is possibly stigmatising and could prevent employees from participating in (age-) specific interventions. Negative (deficit-oriented) age stereotypes are widespread in western societies [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191000.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and could also be a reason for the lack of interventional research on this important topic. Theoretical and empirical findings from gerontology, biological science, mental and social aspects of ageing, could serve as an inspiring source for intervention development as shown by the present study and the &#x000b4;Alternsgerechte Pflegearbeit&#x000b4; (ALPA) study conducted by M&#x000fc;ller et al.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec042"><title>Theories of successful ageing</title><p>Gerontologists have formulate a several theories for successfully dealing with ageing.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Our study shows that these theories can be successfully transferred to the practical field of occupational health prevention, focusing particularly on older nurses. In our study, ageing was considered in the context of a popular theory of successful ageing: SOC, a strength-based (instead of a deficit-based) approach enabling a positive, resource-oriented view on the process of ageing. [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Research has shown that SOC at work is a useful strategy for maintaining mental health across the work-life span[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ALPA study conducted by M&#x000fc;ller et al. already demonstrated that an intervention based on SOC could increase nurses&#x02019; well-being. However, compared to our work, the study did not provide sufficient means to detect statistically significant changes.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, compared to our work, the mean age of participants was below 45 years, and the study was conducted in a single community hospital with a smaller sample. In our study, we included some components of the ALPA study and performed a multicentre trial that led to a large sample of &#x0003e;100 participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of our study is its design of a randomised controlled trial, based on a comprehensive developmental process already published [<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A detailed description of the components of the intervention has also been made available through publication. In cooperation with researchers/clinicians from occupational medicine, psychosomatic medicine and occupational and organisational psychology, we performed a multicentre study that was successfully applied at three different academic and one community hospitals. Further, we used several work-related and clinical outcome measures. Most prior studies did not account for the important outcome variable of HRQOL.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Quality of life has become an important outcome in clinical studies and should also matter to occupational health researchers: &#x02018;Occupational medical research has been fairly late in coming to consider quality of life as a focus of investigation&#x02019;.[<xref rid="pone.0191000.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]</p><p>However, our study has certain limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results. First, we could not reach the expected sample size. Therefore, our study could be limited and could therefore have failed to detect significant effects on well-being and other mental health-related variables, such as anxiety and depression. In a future study, the RCT should be replicated in a larger project undertaking a larger number of experiment centres, including community hospitals.</p><p>Second, as our intervention consisted of several components that have been described in detail elsewhere, it seems difficult to identify the single components and reasons responsible for the observed effects of our intervention. However, from a clinical and a health services research perspective, we are convinced of the combination of multiple components in the prevention of mental health.</p><p>A noteworthy limitation of our study is that some nurses suffering from very high mental strain or even depression (those with the strongest need for intervention) maybe could not be reached by voluntary participation. However, employees with more severe psychological burden should be placed in regular treatment such as psychotherapy or a combination of psychotherapy and drug therapy after careful examination and diagnosis. We had to offer the intervention to all nurses aged 45 and older to prevent any discriminatory practice. However, our study compares favorably with many others who did not recruit as many nurses as we did. It should also be emphasized, that we could not exclude spill-over effects, since participants were working in the same hospital. However, the risk of contamination is estimated to be very low in a three-shift system with a high workload and a large number of employees. Further, if it had occurred it would have induced a negative bias, resulting in an underestimation of a true intervention effect.</p><p>Another limitation is that the long-term effects of the intervention remain inconclusive. For example, a relevant and interesting outcome that can be effectively addressed by preventive interventions in an older adult workforce is the reduction of early retirement. To deal with this important issue, further studies with long-term follow-up measurements in the health care sector are required.</p></sec><sec id="sec044"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this randomised controlled multicentre study indicated that participants in a small-group intervention based on a theory of successful ageing for nurses aged &#x02265;45 showed significant improvements in several mental health-related outcomes. Thus, our study shows that the ageing workforce can be reached through specifically designed preventive interventions. Future studies have to examine if the components of our intervention can be easily adapted to the belongings of other professions. Our results suggest that these components should be evaluated in various settings outside the healthcare sector.</p><p>For this purpose, our study may provide a possible blueprint for future occupational interventions addressing the consequences of demography.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec045"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Development paper.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol&#x02013;English.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol original&#x02013;German.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Consort checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Variables.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Data with replaced missing values.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191000.s007"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Data with missing values.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191000.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants who made this study possible.
