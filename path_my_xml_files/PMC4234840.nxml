These changes, subsequent to the publication of the protocol in <italic>Trials</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], result from discussions within the research team, recommendations from one author&#x02019;s (CS) PhD examiners, and procurement of additional funding to conduct further follow-up. The changes were agreed and we informed <italic>Trials</italic> on 12 June 2014 prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan and sealing the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Changes to 4-month analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be restricted to participants with available follow-up data. This is a more common approach to trial analysis and is standard in trials of interventions designed to increase contraception use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This change will therefore facilitate comparison of our results with other studies. The primary outcome remains the same: use of an effective modern method of contraception at 4&#x000a0;months post-abortion. For the primary analysis, we originally planned to consider all participants lost to follow-up as non-users of contraception. This is clearly an extreme-case scenario and is likely to underestimate contraceptive rates, as it is unlikely that all subjects lost to follow-up will be non-users. We now consider that this would be more appropriate for a sensitivity analysis. While the subset of subjects with follow-up data might not be representative of all subjects, comparison across arms should provide an internally valid comparison, providing follow-up rates are similar in the intervention and control arms.</p><p>In addition to the secondary outcomes outlined in the protocol, we will assess the effect of the intervention on long-acting contraception. Marie Stopes International Cambodia considers implant, intra-uterine device and permanent methods to be long-acting contraception. We anticipate that this additional secondary analysis will be of value to family planning service providers. The researchers conducting the data analysis will be blind to treatment allocation. A second independent researcher will check the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Long-term trial follow-up</title><p>At recruitment, participants were given the option to consent for additional self-report follow-up of primary and secondary outcomes at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months, subject to the trial&#x02019;s obtaining additional funding. All 500 trial participants provided consent for this potential additional follow-up. Subsequently CS obtained a Medical Research Council Population Scientist Fellowship, which included some funds for long-term MOTIF trial follow-up.</p><p>We obtained self-report follow-up data on 86.2% of participants at 4&#x000a0;months. Six participants withdrew from the study. This follow-up was conducted by two research assistants over a 5-month period.</p><p>To assess the long-term effect of the intervention, we plan to conduct 12-month trial follow-up on the remaining 492 trial participants, commencing July 2014. The follow-up questionnaire will be similar to that used at 4&#x000a0;months. We will collect information on current contraceptive use, repeat pregnancy or abortion, and contraception use over the 12-month post-abortion period. In addition, we will ask participants using contraception where they obtained it. We anticipate that it will take several months to conduct 12-month follow-up. Having achieved 86.2% follow-up at 4&#x000a0;months, we anticipate increased attrition at subsequent follow-up. Owing to limited resources, we will not complete follow-up at 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Outcome measures and analysis will be similar to those at the 4-month follow-up. The primary outcome at the 12-month follow-up will be use of an effective modern contraceptive method at 12-months post-abortion. This will be considered a second primary outcome, in addition to effective modern contraceptive use at 4&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include long-acting contraception use, self-reported pregnancy, repeat abortion, and contraception use over the 12-month post-abortion period (to estimate the point prevalence of contraception use at any given time and of contraceptive discontinuation rates).</p><p>For the primary outcomes and for secondary outcomes with binary outcome measures we will estimate risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and give a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value for statistical significance using the chi-squared test. We will perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to assess contraceptive discontinuation rates.</p><p>We will perform sub-group and sensitivity analysis as per the 4-month analysis. For sub-group analysis, we will assess whether the effect of the intervention varies according to age, urban versus rural residence, level of education and socioeconomic status. We will use the chi-squared test for heterogeneity at a 5% level of significance. If statistically significant overall heterogeneity is identified, relative risks and 99% confidence intervals will be estimated. Sensitivity analysis will include counting those lost to follow-up as non-users, per-protocol analysis, and analysis of clustering among participants from each clinic, as for the 4-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval for this additional follow-up has been granted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ethics committee (reference number 6378&#x02013;01), the Marie Stopes International ethics committee (reference number 002-13-Am14), and the Cambodia Human Research ethics committee (reference number 0193 NECHR).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Restricting the primary analysis to those with follow-up data is the standard approach for trial analysis and will facilitate comparison with other trials of interventions designed to increase contraception uptake or use.
