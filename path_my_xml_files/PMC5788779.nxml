program on satisfaction, upper limb function, self-esteem, and depression in elderly
residents of a long-term care facility. [Subjects and Methods] This study included 12
elderly subjects, aged 65 or older, residing in a nursing home. The subjects were divided
into an experimental and a control group. Subjects in the control group received leisure
activities already provided by the facility. The experimental group participated in a
client-centered leisure activity program. The subjects conducted individual activities
three times per week, 30 minutes per session. The group activity was conducted three times
per week for eight weeks. Each subject&#x02019;s performance of and satisfaction with the leisure
activity programs, upper limb function, self-esteem, and depression were measured before
and after the intervention. [Results] After participating in a program, significant
improvements were seen in both the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and upper
limb function in the experimental group. Also after the intervention, the subjects&#x02019;
self-esteem significantly increased and their depression significantly decreased.
[Conclusion] A client-centered leisure activity program motivates elderly people residing
in a long-term care facility and induces their voluntary participation. Such customized
programs are therefore effective for enhancing physical and psychological functioning in
this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Client-centered leisure activity program</kwd><kwd>Elderly people</kwd><kwd>Satisfaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The elderly population in Korea currently accounts for 13% of the total population of 50
million, and this percentage is increasing<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, 89.2% of elderly Koreans suffer, on average, from 2.6
chronic diseases, thus supporting this population represents a social issue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Korea introduced the long-term elderly care
insurance system in 2008 in order to reduce the burden on elderly people<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, the number of recipients of
long-term care services surged, and the rate of those applying for the service rapidly
increased from 0.5% in 2008 to 4.2% in 2011<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This has increased the number of long-term care facilities and more
than doubled the number of elderly occupants<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, the quality of services provided by these nursing
facilities has suffered from a lack of evidenced-based policies<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, admission to these facilities is most often
decided unilaterally by family members, who feel burdened by the support required. In
addition, elderly people living in nursing facilities have less choice about how to utilize
their time and less available leisure activities compared to those living within the
community. As a result, elderly people often have difficulty adapting and develop emotional
problems such as depression and anxiety<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research has previously examined the
effects of insufficient leisure activities on elderly people in nursing facilities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The leisure activities in these studies,
however, were largely conducted in groups, failing to account for the individual&#x02019;s
characteristics and preferred activities. To improve the life satisfaction of elderly people
in long-term care facilities, leisure activities customized for each individual are
necessary<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study provided a client-centered leisure
activity program to elderly residents of a long-term care facility and examined its effect
on satisfaction, self-esteem, depression and upper extremity strength and flexibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 12 elderly residents of a nursing home (experimental group: 7, control

facility for at least six months prior to the start of the study, the ability to
communicate, no severe physical disabilities such as an auditory or visual disability, and
the ability to independently sit in a chair or a wheelchair for at least 30 minutes. All
protocols were approved by the University of Hanseo. Before participation, the procedures,
risks, and benefits were explained to the participants, who gave informed consent.
Participant rights were protected according to the guidelines of the University of Hanseo.
This study was conducted from September to November 2016. The control group performed
existing leisure activities provided by the nursing facility and the experimental group
conducted customized leisure activities (for individuals and groups) in addition to the
existing leisure activities. Existing leisure activity programs provided to experimental
group and control group were horticultural activity, folk song activity, art activity and
were given once a week for 60 minutes each. The individual leisure activity program was
composed of activities based on the participant&#x02019;s preferences determined from a face-to-face

minutes per session. The group leisure activity program was composed of a warm-up exercise
for 10 minutes, an elastic band resistance exercise for 15 minutes, and a cool-down exercise
for five minutes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For group activities,
the experimental group was divided into small groups consisting of three to five members.
Each group conducted activities three times per week for eight weeks. The Senior Fitness
Test Manual (lifting a dumbbell and holding the hands behind the back), the Rosenberg
self-esteem scale (RSES), and the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI)
were used in order to examine changes in the subjects&#x02019; upper extremity function,
self-esteem, and depression after the leisure activities. In addition, the Canadian
Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used to examine participants&#x02019; performance of and
satisfaction with the leisure activity program<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pre-test for the experimental group was conducted during the
first week of the experiment. Subjects underwent a total of 24 sessions of the customized
leisure activities for eight weeks and the post-test was conducted during the 10th week.
Likewise, the pre-test for the control group was conducted during the first week of the
experiment, and these subjects participated in existing leisure activities provided by the
long-term care facilities for eight weeks with the post-test conducted during the 10th week.
Subjects in the control group were assured that once the effectiveness of the experiment was
verified, the customized leisure activities would then be provided to them as well. The
experimental results were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). Frequency analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized in order to examine the
subjects&#x02019; general characteristics. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to verify
differences before and after the experiment in each group. The statistical significance
level chosen was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group&#x02019;s COPM performance scores improved from an average of 1.71 &#x000b1; 0.49

program on satisfaction, upper limb function, self-esteem, and depression in elderly
residents of a long-term care facility. The client-centered leisure activity program was
comprised of individual and group activities. Performance of and satisfaction with

depression also both significantly improved after the client-centered leisure activity
program was implemented in the experimental group. This result is consistent with previous
research demonstrating that elderly people who participated in leisure activities exhibited
higher self-esteem and reduced depression<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the contrary, self-esteem and
depression in the control group did not change. Thus, it is clear that individual programs
based upon an individual&#x02019;s preferences are more effective for improving their participation
in and satisfaction with leisure activities.</p><p>These results demonstrate that a program composed of activities customized to an individual
resident can effectively improve their voluntary participation, which in turn decreases
their depression, increases their self-esteem, and improves their physical functioning. The
end result is that elderly residents have more satisfaction with the facility and a better
quality of life.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that only activities applicable to long-term care
facilities were used. In particular, dynamic activities with a high risk of fall, expensive
activities, and activities provided by public facilities were excluded. In the future,
prospective studies should seek to identify different strategies for improving elderly
nursing facility residents&#x02019; ability to adapt and their overall quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">Statistics Korea: Koreans
