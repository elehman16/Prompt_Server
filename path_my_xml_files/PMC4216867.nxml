By contrast, the very recent CHAMPION Phoenix trial<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> provides a more realistic scenario of expectable ischaemic complications during and after PCI. More than 11&#x02005;000 patients with oral clopidogrel loading, including the whole clinical PCI spectrum (56% stable coronary artery disease (CAD), 26% non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), 18% ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)), were preinterventionally randomised to receive an intravenous bolus and infusion of cangrelor, a fast acting reversible ADP receptor blocker. Ischaemic complications in the whole study cohort occurred in 5.3%, including a definite stent thrombosis (ST) rate of 1.1% during the first 48&#x02005;h.

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> From November 2008 to May 2009, patients with HPR were reloaded with clopidogrel 600&#x02005;mg up to three times according to the Bonello protocol.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> After prasugrel<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> became available in June 2009, HPR to clopidogrel was treated with prasugrel (Efient/Effient) loading, depending on the degree of the residual ADP-induced platelet reactivity: cases with ADP &#x0003e;80&#x02005;U received 60&#x02005;mg, ADP 60&#x02013;79&#x02005;U 30&#x02005;mg and ADP 50&#x02013;59&#x02005;U 10&#x02005;mg of prasugrel. This staged approach was chosen in order to avoid potential bleeding complications due to the observed over-response (ie, very &#x02018;flat&#x02019; ADP and ASPI curves, &#x0003c;10&#x02013;15&#x02005;U) after a routine prasugrel 60&#x02005;mg loading in patients with borderline clopidogrel response (ADP 50&#x02013;60&#x02005;U). In patients older than 75&#x02005;years or weighing less than 60&#x02005;kg, the maintenance dose (MD) of prasugrel was reduced to 5&#x02005;mg according to the manufacturer's specification, with MEA testing 1&#x02005;week later and dose adjustments, if necessary. In cases of contraindications to prasugrel (history of stroke), clopidogrel reloadings were performed, until ticagrelor (Brilique/Brilinta) became available. STEMI patients younger than 75&#x02005;years and weighing more than 60&#x02005;kg without history of stroke were primarily loaded with 60&#x02005;mg prasugrel due to the local standard operating procedure of the Viennese STEMI network. After ticagrelor<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> became available in March 2011, HPR to prasugrel and HPR to clopidogrel in patients with contraindications to prasugrel were treated with 180&#x02005;mg ticagrelor loading. In cases of contraindications to ticagrelor (history of intracranial haemorrhage), clopidogrel reloadings were performed. Special care was taken to limit the possibility of HPR at the time of PCI by clopidogrel loading at least 12&#x02005;h prior to PCI, with reloading, if necessary, either prior to PCI in case MEA testing was already known, or at the latest 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;h after PCI. In case of no oral ADP receptor blocker loading, or only within 4-6 h, pre-PCI was given (eg, STEMI or urgent invasive non-STEMI (NSTEMI) patients), bolus-only administration of a glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitor (GPI) (intracoronary abciximab (0.25&#x02005;mg/kg; Reopro) or intravenous eptifibatide (180&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/kg, Integrilin)) was performed. Thereafter, serial MEA measurements were taken for up to 7&#x02005;days to allow determination of the level of oral ADP receptor inhibition. Details of this blocking and bridging strategy have been published previously.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> At discharge, all patients should be within the therapeutic range of platelet inhibition (ie, non-HPR).</p><p>Individualisation of ASA treatment was conducted as follows. Stable patients without chronic ASA treatment were loaded with 300&#x02005;mg ASA orally once the day before angiography. Patients with ACS were loaded with ASA intravenous: 500&#x02005;mg was used in ASA na&#x000ef;ve patients and 250&#x02005;mg was used in cases of chronic ASA treatment. HPR to ASA was defined as &#x0003e;35&#x02005;U AA-induced aggregation. This cut-off represents a mean derived from published data<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and the MEA manufacturer's recommendations. ASA reloading was performed with either 300&#x02005;mg orally once or 250&#x02005;mg intravenous. In cases of HPR to ADP and ASA, first ADP receptor blocker reloading was performed with ASA reloading if necessary after MEA testing the next day.</p><p>PCI was performed according to the current standard guidelines. The type of stent implanted was at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist. In cases of drug eluting stent (DES) implantation, only second generation DESs were used (Biolimus-eluting: Biomatrix; Everolimus-eluting: Promus Element and Xience; Zotarolimus-eluting: Resolute). All patients received 100&#x02005;IU/kg of unfractionated heparin, with adjustments according to measurements of activated clotting time, except in cases of GPI bolus administration, where only 70&#x02005;IU/kg were given.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Impedance aggregometry</title><p>Whole blood aggregation was determined using MEA, a new-generation impedance aggregometer (Multiplate Analyzer, Roche, Munich, Germany).

Three patients died in cardiogenic shock within 24&#x02005;h after successful PCI without evidence of ST at autopsy. Only one subacute definite ST, which also accounted for the only myocardial infarction, occurred within 30&#x02005;days (0.09%). This patient had multivessel PCI for NSTEMI, and developed diarrhoea and Gram negative sepsis. On the seventh day post-PCI, an attempted resuscitation was unsuccessful. Acute thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent was confirmed at autopsy. Two sudden deaths without autopsy occurred after discharge in NSTEMI patients, which have been classified as probable ST according to the ARC criteria. However, both patients also suffered from ischaemic cardiomyopathy, which would suggest a primary rhythmogenic cause for their sudden deaths. MACE number equals cardiovascular deaths (n=18; 1.8%) as all three cases of ST died. Cardiogenic shock was the cause of cardiovascular deaths in the majority of cases (88%), without differences in groups. Concerning bleeding complications, no increase in individualised patients occurred (2.6% TIMI major and minor bleedings in both groups). Slightly more than half of the bleeding complications (54%, n=14) were related to the access site (&#x02018;instrumented&#x02019;), requiring surgical intervention in three cases (21% of instrumented complications; 0.3% of patients). The majority of spontaneous bleeding complications were gastrointestinal (67%, n=8).

First, routine efficient peri-interventional individualisation of DAPT with MEA, incorporating the newer generations of ADP receptor blocker (prasugrel and ticagrelor), is able to minimise early ischaemic events after PCI in an all-comers population including STEMI patients by nearly abolishing early definite ST. Second, intensifying platelet inhibition in patients with HPR does not increase bleeding complications compared to patients without HPR under DAPT. Third, there is indirect evidence for synergistic roles of ADP-dependent and ASA-dependent platelet activation.</p><p>For interpretation of the very low ischaemic complication rate observed during the 30&#x02005;days after PCI, the most recent literature on the incidence of real world early ST in PCI for all-comers<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and STEMI patients,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> as well as the complication rate in the randomised CHAMPION Phoenix trial,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> should be considered. We could show that adjusting the level of platelet inhibition reduced the rate of early definite ST to 0.09%, which is about sevenfold lower than observed in PCI for all-comers<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and about 25-fold to 35-fold lower than in primary PCI for STEMI,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> even with contemporary second generation DES. Monitored intensification of platelet inhibition by bolus-only administration of GPI and individualised DAPT resulted in a yet more favourable outcome in our STEMI population, as no early thrombotic events occurred. Furthermore, even under randomised study conditions such as the CHAMPION Phoenix trial,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the definite ST rate after clopidogrel loading was 1.4% within 48&#x02005;h, or about 14-fold higher than in our study. Immediate ADP receptor blockade with cangrelor, however, showed a benefit with reduction to 0.8% (p=0.01), which is still about eightfold higher than what was achieved with our individualisation protocol. In addition, ischaemic complications were not only not driven by urgent patients with ACS (4.1%), but were also numerically higher in stable CAD (7.4%). By contrast, individualisation of DAPT in our stable CAD cohort, with 600&#x02005;mg clopidogrel loading the day before PCI and MEA guided individualisation (the latest within 2&#x02005;h after PCI), resulted in no early ischaemic events.</p><p>Three randomised multicentre trials<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> failed to show a clinical benefit of individualising DAPT with the VerifyNow assay. Among the most common raised limitations, those in study design, protocol implementation and efficacy of platelet inhibition are the most important. Concerning study design, the late randomisation of patients (more than 12&#x02005;h after PCI) in GRAVITAS<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and TRIGGER-PCI<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> excluded acute procedural complications attributable to insufficient platelet inhibition. This occurred even in stable patients with CAD, as is impressively shown in CHAMPION Phoenix.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Concerning protocol implementation, the ARCTIC trial<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> discharged 1.3% of patients in the active study arm without any ADP receptor blocker medication, and lost nearly 9% of patients to follow-up. TRIGGER-PCI<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was stopped prematurely, leaving an underpowered study population. Concerning efficacy of platelet inhibition, 40% of patients in GRAVITAS<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 16% in ARCTIC<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> remained in HPR due to primary reloading with clopidogrel (100% in GRAVITAS and 90% in ARCTIC). By contrast, 100% of our patients were included prior to PCI and discharged with DAPT, 99.9% could be followed up at 30&#x02005;days and only 0.3% remained in HPR. Together, this resulted in a 1.7-fold lower rate of ST (definite and probable) than in the high-dose clopidogrel arm of GRAVITAS<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and a 3.5-fold lower rate than in the monitored arm of ARCTIC,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> despite our higher risk population, including STEMI patients.</p><p>Concerning bleeding complications, our concept of using the newer generations of ADP receptor blockers, primarily for intensifying platelet inhibition in patients with HPR to clopidogrel rather than upfront for all patients with ACS without contraindications, seems beneficial. In contrast to TRITON<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and PLATO,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which featured significantly increased non-CABG related bleeding rates under prasugrel and ticagrelor, no increased bleeding occurred in the individualised patients compared to those on clopidogrel without HPR. The observed 1.5% TIMI major bleeding rate in our ACS cohort compares favourably to the non-CABG related TIMI major bleeding rates in the clopidogrel arms of TRITON (1.8%) and PLATO (2.2%). Furthermore, even in the highest bleeding risk group, the STEMI patients, our blocking and bridging strategy with GPI bolus-only administration resulted in fewer TIMI major and minor bleeds (6.4%) than in the GPI arm with bolus and infusion (9.6%) of the HORIZON AMI trial.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Although our number of patients is admittedly far too low to draw this conclusion, GPI bolus-only administration seems suggestively comparable to the bivalirudin arm (5.9%).</p><p>Concerning the regulation of platelet activation, it is already known that thrombin-mediated (via the protease activated receptor-1) and ADP-mediated (via the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor) platelet activation play a synergistic role in haemostasis and thrombosis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We provide indirect evidence for a synergistic role of ADP-dependent and ASA-dependent (cyclo-oxygenase) platelet activation. We observed an interplay between AA-induced and ADP-induced platelet aggregability, as HPR to AA was significantly associated with HPR to ADP, and solitary reloading with ADP receptor blocker in patients with HPR to ADP and AA was able to successfully resolve intermediate levels of HPR to AA without ASA reloading.</p><p>Limitations of our study include primarily the non-randomised nature of the registry without a control group concerning efficacy, and the monocentric design, leading to the need for a high number of indirect comparisons, with all its known shortcomings, in order to discuss and put our findings in perspective.</p><p>In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that HPR represents a modifiable risk factor that can be used for tailoring treatment in PCI patients, rather than a marker of higher risk only. Effective individualisation of DAPT for PCI under MEA guidance is able to minimise early ischaemic complications to a so far unreported degree. Further properly designed randomised multicenter trials utilising MEA seem warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e187" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005781.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e188" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005781.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Carina Gruber and Julia Macura for data acquisition, and Doris Langenau and Gabriela Zimmerman for their technical laboratory support.
