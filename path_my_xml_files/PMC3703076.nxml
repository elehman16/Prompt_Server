In the face to face group, 2 educational sessions were accomplished during dialysis with a 1-week time interval. In the video-based education group, a produced film, separated to 2 episodes was presented during dialysis with a 1-week time interval.

In Iran the special disease center reported the number of patients undergoing hemodialysis to be 15,000 cases till the end of 2005.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Although hemodialysis improves health and survival rate of these patients, it does not fully replace the function of kidneys or change the disease progress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Hemodialysis patients have many problems resulting from the disease itself and treatment process, which change their quality of life, cause depression, and sometimes even lead to suicide and early death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Self-care behaviors in these patients includes control of fluids, diet and medication intake, participation in care, effective communication, self-efficacy, and role acceptance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Adherence to diet and fluids, combined with dialysis is the cornerstone of renal failure treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Following recommended treatments (diet and fluid restriction) by the patient is not one of the most important issues in the health care programs. The most difficult stressful factor is fluid adherence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Adherence to diet and fluid improves health, reduces treatment costs, reduces risk of complications and increases quality of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Some studies show that various factors, such as age, gender, dialysis adequacy, duration of hemodialysis, patient&#x02019;s knowledge about the disease and its treatment, smoking, social support, and patients&#x02019; knowledge of hemodialysis guideline are related to bad adherence to diet and fluid programs in these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Accommodation with diet, fluids, and medication is very difficult for many patients and failure to keep them might result in many dangerous consequences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Different methods of self-control and education have been arranged to help patients keep up with life style modifications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Patient education is one of the most important aspects of nursing care and it can improve health and prevent complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] By informing hemodialysis patients we can help them have a proper diet and reduce mortality and complications of toxins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Face to face education is one of the most common methods of training in health care system.

Advantages of video-based education is the ability to create continuity in the data storage and easy application and cost-effectiveness but one of the disadvantages of this modality is that it is virtual and we have no present active educator in the program with no actual effective method in achieving educational goals.

</p><p>After determining the educational needs of hemodialysis patients about diet and fluid problems and also reviewing new articles on the basis of Self-Care Model of Orem, a training manual was developed with the help of nephrologists, educationists, and nutritionists.

After filming with the help of educational technologists, a video tape was prepared which was capable to comply with all media types.</p><p>Study was implemented in 4 stages (preintervention, intervention, second week postintervention, and fourth week postintervention). The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups regarding the day of the week and the dialysis shift. After introduction and brief explanation of the purpose and methods of work, eligible cases were selected. In this phase after fulfilling the inclusion criteria, questionnaires about diet and fluids in hemodialysis patients were completed as a pre-test. In face to face group, two 30-45 min sessions were run with 1 week gap during the dialysis. In the other group a tape with 2 totally different episodes were broadcasted with a 1 week gap also during dialysis. Again the questionnaire was completed by interviews at the end of weeks 2 and 4, by the 2 groups. Then, the average of all the measurements were taken in three stages and SPSS software version 11.5 was used for analysis.</p><p>Our questionnaire is a framework of 22 questions about attitudes related to diet and fluid adherence in hemodialysis patients and how it affects their lives.
