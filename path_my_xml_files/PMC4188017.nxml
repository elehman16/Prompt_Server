Postprocedural amniotic fluid leakage is the strongest predictor of subsequent fetal loss (Saltvedt and Almstrom, 1999). Instrument size influences the created defect in the fetal membranes and the subsequent risk for amniotic fluid leak and miscarriage. Traditionally, 20 and 22G spinal needles have been used for amniocentesis, although remarkably, this was not based on experimental data. More recently, a new needle was designed and marketed specifically for invasive intrauterine procedures (23G: Cook echotip&#x000ae;, Spencer, Indiana, USA). This smaller 23G needle potentially represents less trauma to the uterus and fetal membranes. Additionally, the specifically designed tip (echotip&#x000ae;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#x02008;1</xref>) is designed to enhance ultrasound visualisation and could reduce the sampling time, and therefore the discomfort for the patient and risks of the procedure. The aim of this study was to compare this new needle type with a standard 22G spinal needle in terms of defect size created in the fetal membranes and time needed to perform an invasive intrauterine procedure.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Above: 22G needle.

Membrane patches of 100&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;50&#x02008;mm were excised and divided in two equal parts. Each membrane patch was wrapped around the bottom of a plastic tube and secured with an elastic ring. The tube was fixed in a vertical position and then filled with Hartmann&#x02019;s solution or amniotic fluid at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The fluid pressure was kept constant at 15&#x02008;cm H<sub>2</sub>O representing a physiologic value for amniotic pressure in pregnancy (Fisk et al., 1992). The membranes were punctured by introduction of the needle at an angle of 90&#x000ba; 1 to 1.5&#x02008;cm deep through the bulging membranes using either a 22G or 23G needle. The characteristics of the needles used are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The duration of the puncture was 1 second. After the experiment, the membrane was detached and the wound edge stained with India ink to facilitate recognition during microscopic evaluation. We calculated the size (mm<sup>2</sup>) of the defect using a microscope (Zeiss, Oberkauchen, Germany), at magnification (20&#x000d7;) and adapted software (KS 100 3.0, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). In cases where sliding of the amnion and chorion against each other had resulted in a smaller net defect, this net defect through both the amnion and chorion, was measured.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> model for amniocentesis using human fetal membrane patches secured to the bottom of a plastic tube.

The needle type was determined before each procedure by randomisation (sealed envelopes). All procedures were performed on a cordocentesis simulator (Limbs &#x00026; Things Ltd, Bristol, United Kingdom). This simulation model allows for the combination of realistic ultrasound visualisation as well as mock blood sampling from an anterior or posterior placenta with umbilical cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Ultrasonography was performed using the same machine we use for all our invasive intrauterine procedures, an Acuson Sequoia (Mountain View, Ca) with a 2.5-6&#x02008;MHz transducer. Each operator performed four cordocentesis procedures (single operator, two hands technique) with each needle. In total, 24&#x02008;procedures were performed with each needle. Each operator performed only one procedure per day. For each procedure, we measured the procedure time, defined as the time from puncturing the cordocentesis simulator to successfully collecting 2&#x02008;ml of artificial blood, in seconds. We therefore recorded each procedure on video. After completion of the project, measurement of the procedure-times was performed from the videotapes by two co-workers blinded to the type of needle that was used during the experiment.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A: Limbs &#x00026; Things model.</p><p>B: Puncturing the model with ultrasonographic guidance.</p><p>C: The ultrasound image.

In today&#x02019;s clinical practice, most fetal medicine specialists use 22G spinal needles to perform amniocentesis (Eisenberg and Wapner, 2002). We have shown that this needle creates a small defect in the fetal membranes reducing subsequent fluid leakage, as compared to bigger needles (Devlieger et al., 2002). Smaller needles with a diameter of 24G and 26G are associated with increased sampling time, which results in relatively larger defects, probably as a result of increased manipulation and physiologic tremor (Devlieger et al., 2002). Additionally, these very thin needles can be blocked by particles in amniotic fluid leading to unsuccessful sampling. Larger needle diameters are associated with slightly shorter sampling time, but exponentially larger defects in the fetal membranes (Devlieger et al., 2002). Therefore, a 22G needle appears to provide a good compromise between sampling time and defect size. Only recently, needle diameters, shape and ultrasonographic properties have been designed and adapted specifically for invasive intrauterine procedures, especially amniocentesis. The 23G needle with echo-tip&#x000ae; has several theoretical advantages, but these were not confirmed in this experimental study.</p><p>First, the specially designed echotip was expected to give a better ultrasonographic image than the needles currently used. This should help the operator in determining the location of the needle inside the amniotic sac and lead to a decrease in sampling time. However, most operators did not have shorter sampling times with the 23G needle, on the contrary: 4 out of 6 operators performed better with the 22G needle. In general, the oblique tip of a standard needle sufficiently enhances sonographic visualisation. The additional reflections created by the 23G echotip&#x000ae; not only seem unnecessary, but may even have a negative effect on precisely localizing the needle tip. A possible limitation of our study could be the use of both an excellent ultrasound machine and a good model; we cannot exclude that the echotip&#x000ae; could be of more value with the use of less advanced equipment or in procedures done in obese patients.</p><p>Secondly, the defect created by the 23G needle was not significantly smaller than the fetal membrane defect created with a 22G needle. Theoretically, the cross-sectional area of the needle determines the minimal size of the created defect. This cross-sectional area relates to the needle diameter according to the equation &#x003c0;r<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the relationship between needle diameter and defect size can be expected to be exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Defects created by both 22G and 23G needles are in the horizontal part of this exponential curve (Devlieger et al., 2002), explaining the small differences measured. Of course, the relatively small sample size used in this study could also contribute to the fact that no significant difference was noted in our experiments.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Theoretical defects (mm<sup>2</sup>) created in fetal membranes by needles of different sizes.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="FVVinObGyn-2-115-118-g004"/></fig><p>Using the cordocentesis model however has a few limitations. There are only two different placentas with one anterior and one posterior cord insertion. Therefore, operators may get to know the model after a few procedures. Also, procedures performed on the model are not complicated by a moving fetus and complications like PROM do not occur. Nonetheless, with the blinded randomised design, we would not expect the results of our study to be different if performed in the actual clinical setting.</p><p>In summary, a 23G needle with adapted tip for enhanced ultrasound visualisation did not, in comparison with a 22G spinal needle, result in decreased defect size in the fetal membranes or decreased sampling time in a randomised experimental setting. Therefore, the claimed advantages of the more expensive 23G needle over the 22G needle are not supported by our study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Devlieger</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gratacos</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Ardon</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Factors Influencing the Flow Rate Through a Surgical Defect in Human Fetal Membranes</article-title><source>Prenat Diagn</source><year>2002</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>205</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11920894</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R02"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Wapner</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical Procedures in Prenatal Diagnosis</article-title><source>Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol</source><year>2002</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>611</fpage><lpage>627</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12475543</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R03"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fisk</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name><name><surname>Ronderos-Dumit</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Tannirandorn</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Normal Amniotic Pressure Throughout Gestation</article-title><source>Br J Obstet Gynaecol</source><year>1992</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>18</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1547165</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R04"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saltvedt</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Almstrom</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fetal Loss Rate After Second Trimester Amniocentesis at Different Gestational Age</article-title><source>Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand</source><year>1999</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9926885</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R05"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name><name><surname>Kambich</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Midtrimester Amniocentesis.
