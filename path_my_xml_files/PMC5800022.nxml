Adults with symptomatic internal rectal prolapse, unresponsive to prior conservative management, will be eligible to participate. They will be randomised to three arms with different delays before surgery (0, 12 and 24 weeks). Efficacy outcome data will be collected at equally stepped time points (12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks). The primary objective is to determine clinical efficacy of LVMR compared to controls with reduction in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) at 24 weeks serving as the primary outcome. Secondary objectives are to determine: (1) the clinical effectiveness of LVMR to 48 weeks to a maximum of 72 weeks; (2) pre-operative determinants of outcome; (3) relevant health economics for LVMR; (4) qualitative evaluation of patient and health professional experience of LVMR and (5) 30-day morbidity and mortality rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">An individual-level, stepped-wedge, randomised trial serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the waiting-listed participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date.

Chronic constipation (CC), usually defined as more than 6 months of symptoms, is less common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but results in 0.5 million UK General Practitioner (GP) consultations per annum. A proportion of the population suffers symptoms that are both chronic and more disabling (probably about 1&#x02013;2% of the population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such patients, who are very frequently female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], are usually referred to secondary care with many progressing to tertiary specialist investigation. Patient dissatisfaction is high in this group; nearly 80% feel that laxative therapy is unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the effect of symptoms on measured quality of life (QOL) is significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CC consumes significant healthcare resources. In the USA in 2012, a primary complaint of constipation was responsible for 3.2 million physician visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] resulting in (direct and indirect) costs of US$1.7 billion. In the UK, it is estimated 10% of district nursing time is spent on constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the annual spend on laxatives exceeds &#x000a3;80 million, with a cost of &#x000a3;17.4 million for prescriptions in 2012 (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pathophysiological basis of chronic constipation</title><p id="Par66">The act of defaecation is dependent on the coordinated functions of the colon, rectum and anus. Considering the complexity of neuromuscular (sensory and motor) functions required to achieve planned, conscious, and effective defaecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], it is no surprise that disturbances to perceived &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; function occur commonly at all stages of life. Clinically, such problems commonly lead to symptoms of obstructed defaecation (e.g. straining; incomplete, unsuccessful or painful evacuation; bowel infrequency and abdominal pain and bloating). After exclusion of a multitude of secondary causes (obstructing colonic lesions, neurological, metabolic and endocrine disorders), the pathophysiology of CC can broadly be divided into problems of colonic contractile activity and thus stool transit and problems of the pelvic floor. Thus, with specialist radio-physiological investigations (hereafter referred to as INVEST in this protocol), patients may be divided into those who have slow colonic transit, evacuation disorder, both or neither (no abnormality found with current tests). Evacuation disorders can be then subdivided into those in which a structurally significant pelvic-floor abnormality is evident, e.g. rectocele or internal prolapse (intussusception), and those in which there is a dynamic failure of evacuation without structural abnormality, most commonly termed functional defaecation disorder (FDD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chronic constipation management overview</title><p id="Par67">Management of CC is a major problem due to its high prevalence and lack of widespread specialist expertise. In general, a step-wise approach is undertaken, with first-line conservative treatment such as lifestyle advice and laxatives (primary care) followed by nurse-led bowel re-training programmes, sometimes including focused biofeedback and psychosocial support (secondary/tertiary care). Although these treatments may improve symptoms in more than half of patients, they are very poorly standardised in the UK and are not universally successful. Patients with intractable symptoms and impaired QOL may subsequently be offered a range of costly, irreversible surgical interventions with unpredictable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], sometimes resulting in major adverse events or a permanent stoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overall rationale for the CapaCiTY programme</title><p id="Par68">The current trial forms part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded programme (PGfAR, RP-PG-0612-20001). This programme aims to develop the evidence base for the management of CC in adults, which is currently lacking. This is in contrast to the management of CC in children for which National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance has been recently published (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg99">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg99</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and for adults with faecal incontinence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/faecal-incontinence">http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/faecal-incontinence</ext-link>). Thus there are considerable variations in practice, particularly in specialist services. With a number of new drugs gaining or seeking National Health Service (NHS) approval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and technologies at a horizon scanning stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it is timely that the currently limited evidence base is developed for resource-constrained NHS providers to have confidence that new and sometimes expensive investigations and therapies are appropriate and cost-effective. A cost-conscious pathway of care may help reduce healthcare expenditures by appropriately sequencing the care provided, while targeting more expensive therapies at those most likely to benefit. Such data will inform the development and commissioning of integrated care pathways. An overview of the CapaCiTY programme is provided as a scheme (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and includes a series of interlinked studies that answer the important questions for patient care. A rolling programme of national recruitment will provide a large cohort of well-defined patients for three subsequent studies over 5 years. The focus will be on generating real-life evidence from pragmatic studies that will provide valid clinical outcome measures, and address patient acceptability and cost. Armed with such data it will be possible to develop an NHS management algorithm for CC, which will meet patient, clinician and policy aims.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Specific clinical background to the trial of laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR)</title><p id="Par69">In most UK practices, patients are first referred to specialist nurses for a variety of nurse-led behavioural interventions to improve defaecatory function. A range of cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] attest to the general success of this approach. Specific methodological issues are being addressed by CapaCiTY study 1. Patients failing behavioural interventions may progress to anal irrigation (CapaCiTY study 2). However despite these approaches, some patients will have persistent intractable symptoms.</p><p id="Par70">When non-surgical therapies fail, a decision must be made whether to offer surgical intervention. Decision-making is greatly influenced by local expertise, commissioning and personal enthusiasm for particular interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], balanced against poor results in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Currently, there is thus large and difficult-to-justify variation in surgical practice according to need and type of procedure. The need to reduce variations in practice, based on available evidence, has been a perpetual theme of recent national speciality group discussions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] with various initiatives proposed. A Multidisciplinary Decision Team (MDT), incorporating expertise from nurses, gastroenterologists, urogynaecologists, colorectal surgeons and psychologists to promote appreciation of the whole pelvic floor (bladder, vagina, uterus and bowel), could reduce the potential for inadequately-informed and potentially harmful interventions in poor surgical candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but the utility of this approach has not been formally tested. Further, there are few data on outcomes in well-characterised patient cohorts or rational criteria for patient selection.</p><p id="Par71">In practice, there are few pelvic-floor procedures that are commonly employed in patients with CC, these being forms of rectopexy and rectocele repair in conjunction with urogynaecological approaches to other organ prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Such problems are then very difficult to correct by any method.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par84">Such is the debate on LVMR that almost all international coloproctology meetings have whole sessions dedicated to its discussion (especially the issue of mesh complications); a recent consensus report has also been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. It is clear that while these complications may be limited by good technique and perhaps choice of mesh, they will not be eradicated. Thus, it can be argued that the future of LVMR depends not on the very small observed differences in long-term mesh complications (e.g. 1.0&#x02013;2.0% of patients) but on a fundamental evaluation of whether the procedure is actually clinically beneficial, i.e. whether these complication rates would be deemed acceptable (provided patients are consented to the risk) if the patient benefit was sufficiently large. The aim of the proposed trial is to address this knowledge gap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Specific study rationale</title><p id="Par85">The overall rationale is to address the main objectives (see below) within a controlled trial. We have used a stepped-wedge, randomised trial design which permits observer-masked data comparisons between patients awaiting intervention with those who have undergone surgery. Contrary to most stepped-wedge trials individual patients are randomised rather than clustered. In brief (more detail below), eligible participants based on clinical evaluation and radio-physiological investigations (INVEST) will be randomised to three arms with different lengths of delay before surgery (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In all arms there will be a period of 4 weeks post-eligibility to arrange the logistics of surgery (time (T)&#x02013;4 weeks to T0) and ensure that patients have returned to their normal life routine after various assessments. LVMR will be performed at T0 in group I; T12 (12 weeks) in group II and T24 (24 weeks) in group III. Unavoidably, participants will be aware when surgery is undertaken: this, however, fortuitously meets the assumptions of the stepped-wedge design, i.e. no effect of treatment is expected until surgery has been performed. Efficacy outcome data will be collected at equally stepped time points (T0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks).</p><p id="Par86">This is, in effect, a modification of a standard, parallel-arm, wait-list control design, but with several advantages. First, a stepped-wedge design is more efficient and thus improves recruitment feasibility (the bane of nearly all surgical trials). Despite the multicentre approach of this study, the problems of recruitment cannot be underestimated. Simulation demonstrates that a parallel-arm design requires a much larger sample size than that proposed for the current study at the same power. Secondly, the trial design means that there is only a one in three chance (rather than one in two for a parallel arm) of waiting 6 months for surgery, which is more acceptable to patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Risks and benefits of participation</title><p id="Par87">The risks of trial participation are considered very low over and above standard surgical risks. The intervention proposed is already offered to patients in specialist centres throughout the UK and internationally. The only difference conferred by participation is that the intervention will be randomly allocated by time and very carefully assessed. CC is a chronic condition (especially by the time conservative treatments have failed) and thus allocation to waiting times of up to 24 weeks poses no clinical risk. Radio-physiological tests (INVEST) are required to select patients with appropriate structural pelvic-floor problems for surgery. These would be performed in routine clinical practice in all patients undergoing LVMR and will also be mandated for the trial using specified techniques and equipment. While this may lead to slight variance from normal practice, the fundamental tests and their safety remain unchanged. Such tests have been performed daily in most specialist centres for up to 30 years without any recorded complication (Barts Health experience is over 10,000 patients). A small ionising radiation dose is required for two tests (covered below). A number of questionnaires contain personal questions about bowel problems and the effect of these on QOL and psycho-behavioural functioning; however, all have been used in studies of similar patients previously. The design of the study requires data collection at time points additional to those required for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. However, this streamlines the logistics and management of the study participants through the course of the study whilst ensuring blinding is maintained and eliminating observer bias. This small additional burden on participants has been carefully balanced against the obvious benefits of the design and efficiencies of sample size gained, reducing the overall number of participants required to undergo surgery.</p><p id="Par88">The benefits of participation are that patients will receive a very high standard of surgery (the most experienced UK surgeons will be participating). Further, by design, the fidelity of surgical technique will be standardised and tightly scrutinised (including by preceptorship and mentorship if required); they will also receive a high standard of monitored care as a consequence of the detailed protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Design/methods</title><p id="Par89">This is a stepped-wedge, randomised trial of LVMR in adults with chronic constipation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;114), which follows the &#x0201c;Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials&#x0201d; (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

Special care is taken not to damage the right hypogastric nerve. Denonvillier&#x02019;s fascia is incised and (in women) the rectovaginal septum is broadly opened. Limited rectal mobilization and lateral dissection is performed as required to expose the distal rectum and pelvic floor. A strip of trimmed mesh (biologic or synthetic) is inserted. Using non-absorbable or slowly absorbable sutures (polydioxanone (PDS) is recommended), the mesh is sutured to the ventral aspect of the distal rectum and further fixed to the lateral seromuscular borders of the rectum proximal and distal to the incised pouch of Douglas +/- pelvic floor. The mesh is fixed upon the sacral promontory using either sutures or an endofascia stapler. Limited traction is exerted on the rectum as required to obliterate the intussusception +/- rectocele. If deemed necessary, the posterior vaginal fornix may be elevated and sutured to the anterior aspect of the mesh; this allows closure of the rectovaginal septum and correction of a mid-compartment prolapse, if present. The lateral borders of the incised peritoneum are then closed over the mesh. This elevates the new pouch of Douglas over the colpopexy and completely covers the mesh with peritoneum. No drain is usually required. Ports should be closed directly (endoclose for lateral ports) owing to the high risk of early and late port site hernias in this group of patients with potential connective tissue laxity.</p><p id="Par162">Post-operative management will be as per routine clinical care. This is usually an overnight hospital stay followed by urinary catheter removal, mobilisation and discharge. Post-operative laxatives use is standardised to a weaning course of Movicol/Laxido three times daily (TDS) immediately post-operative for 1 day, then reduced according to ease of bowel movements. Medication will be post-operatively recorded on a drug chart by the anaesthetists. This prevents post-operative constipation from immobility, narcotics and general anaesthesia, which if left untreated may cause painful straining on the mesh and thus protracts in the sacral promontory periosteum, potentially leading to readmission. The surgeon should aim to discharge patients 1 day post-operative. Length of stay will, however, be determined by clinical evaluation and may be longer if required.

For a chronic condition such as CC, a difference of 1.0 point in the primary outcome (score range&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;4) can be considered clinically important and also the notional minimum required to justify the cost and invasive nature of LVMR, or of a more complex and expensive treatment.</p><p id="Par212">Previous trials have shown a 1-point decrease in PAC-QOL from pre-operative to 48 weeks (1 year) post-surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Allowing for a 10% loss to follow up, a sample size of 38 is needed per arm (i.e. a total sample size of 114 patients across the three arms). Should the correlation between repeated assessments be lower than 0.5, a sample size of 114 will still provide at least 90% power for the study.

If deemed &#x0201c;non-adherent&#x0201d; to the standardized technique, the site will be notified that a step needs to be corrected. The PI must submit the unedited and anonymised video of the LVMR performed in the second patient enrolled in the CapaCiTY study 3. In case of &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d; to comply with the standardized surgical technique for LVMR or following a second judgment of &#x0201c;non-adherence&#x0201d; to the standardized technique, this will trigger an on-site training and monitoring session for the site. Monitoring will continue until adherence is achieved. Otherwise a third &#x0201c;non-adherence&#x0201d; or second &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d; judgement will result in withdrawal of the site/PI from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Random monitoring</title><p id="Par279">All PIs must record and submit the unedited and anonymised video of the LVMR performed in a randomly selected patient enrolled in the CapaCiTY study 3 (one in five at site level).

This advisory group will comprise eight patients and two lay members from London and Durham. This group will have geographical diversity (north and south) and a disease-appropriate demographic (eight women, two men). The CRAG will review participant information sheets, booklets, diaries and advertising/marketing materials, provide lay representation on the PSC, conduct parallel qualitative analysis, produce lay summaries for dissemination of results, present at local research events and conduct patient focus groups and workshops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par331">An individual-level stepped-wedge randomised trial serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait-listed participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date. In keeping with the basic ethical tenets of this design, the average waiting time for LVMR (12 weeks) will be shorter than that for routine services (24 weeks). We acknowledge that availability of beds may represent a major bane for this trial. However, we have attempted to overcome this by allowing a 4-week run-in post-eligibility to arrange the logistics of surgery and a 2-week tolerance interval from the scheduled intervention date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec74"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par332">Recruitment is ongoing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec75"><p>
