Assessments were carried out at hospital admission (T0), hospital discharge/baseline (T1), postintervention (T2; 9 months after baseline), 9-month follow-up (T3; 18 months after baseline). The primary outcome, abstinence from binge eating and compensatory behaviors during the 2 months preceding T2, was analyzed by intention to treat, using logistic regression analyses. Frequencies of binge eating and vomiting episodes, and episodes of all compensatory behaviors were analyzed using mixed effects models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At T2, data from 167 women were available. There were no significant differences in abstinence rates between the TAU group (n=24, 18.9%) and the IN@ group (n=27, 21.4%; odds ratio, OR=1.29; <italic>P</italic>=.44). The frequency of vomiting episodes in the IN@ group was significantly (46%) lower than in the TAU group (<italic>P</italic>=.003). Moderator analyses revealed that both at T2 and T3, women of the intervention group who still reported binge eating and compensatory behaviors after inpatient treatment benefited from IN@, whereas women who were already abstinent after the inpatient treatment did not (<italic>P</italic>=.004; <italic>P</italic>=.002). Additional treatment utilization was high in both groups between baseline and follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, data from this study suggest moderate effects of IN@. High rates of outpatient treatment utilization after inpatient treatment may have obscured potential intervention effects on abstinence.

For a substantial proportion of patients, the long-term course is chronic; depending on outcome criteria and follow-up duration, less than half of the patients achieve full recovery [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several studies indicate that higher frequencies of binge eating and purging at baseline, postintervention, and follow-up are negative prognostic factors [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the past decades, a number of effective psychological treatments for BN have been developed and are available [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both US (APA) and European guidelines [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) as first-line treatment. Meta-analytic reviews [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] show good effects for eating disorder attitudes and moderate remission rates ranging between 20% and 30% for CBT. However, relapse rates within the first months of treatment are high even after significant reduction of core BN symptoms [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and some women may even be reluctant to seek further treatment after experiencing relapses [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Maintaining treatment gains remains a challenge especially for the more severe and chronically ill BN patients [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Outside the eating disorders field, technology-enhanced approaches (ie, interventions delivered through the Internet or mobile apps) have been increasingly utilized as aftercare interventions following in- or outpatient treatment across mental health disorders (eg, [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) or for specific disorders such as bipolar disorder [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or pain disorder [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Compared with face-to-face interventions, Web-based interventions offer several potential advantages [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They can overcome existing barriers such as cost, service availability, wait time, transportation, and stigma, thus countering health care&#x02013;related disparities, and can be easily tailored to individual needs. Greater anonymity may encourage individuals to seek help and reveal more sensitive health information. Finally, Web-based programs might be more cost-effective compared with face-to-face interventions [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and have high user acceptability.</p><p>In the field of indicated prevention of eating disorders, Web-based approaches have proven to be efficacious in reducing core symptoms of eating disorders, including high weight and shape concerns, body dissatisfaction [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], binge eating [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], new onset of full-syndrome eating disorders [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and shown promise for improving low body weight and restrained eating [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, at the time of initiation of the current trial, no technology-based intervention was available for the maintenance of in- or outpatient treatment gains and prevention of relapses, and in the meantime, very few randomized controlled trials have utilized and tested the efficacy of technology-enhanced interventions following in- or outpatient treatment.</p><p>In an aftercare program based on text messaging [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], 165 German patients with BN were randomized to an intervention group (16-week short message service (SMS)&#x02013;based maintenance) or a treatment as usual (TAU) control group following inpatient treatment. Remission rates at 8 months after hospital discharge were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the TAU group, independent of utilization of outpatient treatment. For patients of the intervention group who did not use any additional outpatient treatment, remission rates were even higher. Another German study [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] examined the efficacy of a Web-based relapse prevention program (RP) over 9 months after inpatient treatment in 258 women with anorexia nervosa (AN), randomized to the RP or TAU condition. At postintervention, RP completers had gained significantly more body weight (0.62 BMI points) than patients in the TAU condition and showed significant improvements in specific eating-related cognitions and behaviors. At 9-month follow-up, the subgroup of participants with high adherence to the program (&#x0201c;full completers&#x0201d;) achieved further improvements in body mass index (BMI) [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Finally, following an earlier pilot study with promising results conducted in Hungary, the effects of a Web-based support program following routine outpatient and inpatient care were also evaluated in a recent larger, randomized controlled trial [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A total of 105 women with BN and eating disorders not otherwise specified were randomly assigned to an immediate Web-based support program over 4 months or to a 4-month waiting-list TAU control condition. Both groups showed significant reductions in eating disorder-related attitudes at postintervention compared with baseline, with no significant effects of intervention on improvement.</p><p>Overall, the results of studies directed at the maintenance of treatment gains for different ED symptoms using technology-based interventions are encouraging, but do not show clear superiority for a relevant outcome measure. These trials also demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients (28-93%) had utilized additional treatment [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Encouraged by the high acceptance [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and efficacy of previously evaluated, Web-based indicated prevention programs for eating disorders [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we decided to develop an Web-based aftercare program (IN@) for women with BN following inpatient treatment [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this program in maintaining or achieving abstinence from core BN symptoms in comparison with a TAU control group. We hypothesized that the aftercare intervention would lead to larger and more stable effects in core BN symptoms compared with TAU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>We conducted a randomized, controlled efficacy trial in women with DSM-IV BN. The trial protocol, summarizing details on study design and intervention, has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Over a 4&#x000bd;-year period, patients were screened and recruited from 13 psychosomatic hospitals offering specialized inpatient treatment for eating disorders throughout Germany. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 17 years or older, fulfilled DSM-IV-TR criteria for BN at hospital admission, and had successfully completed inpatient treatment, defined by a reduction of binge eating and compensatory behaviors by at least 50% based on the past 2 weeks before discharge compared with admission. Patients were excluded if their BMI had dropped below 17.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> during the inpatient treatment or if local hospital staff regarded them as unfit to participate in a Web-based program (eg, due to psychotic symptoms, acute suicidality, severe personality disorders, or language barriers).</p><p>Assessment points were as follows: prebaseline (T0; hospital admission), baseline (T1; hospital discharge), postintervention (T2; 9 months after baseline), and 9-month follow-up (T3; 18 months after baseline). Patients received up to 80&#x020ac; for participating in all assessments, whereas there were no monetary incentives for using the Web-based intervention.</p><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee of TU Dresden and by ethics committees of all other federal states in which participating hospitals were located. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and&#x02014;in case of minors&#x02014;their legal guardians. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice principles.</p><p>Quality-control methods comprised case-report forms, independent data management, on-site monitoring, and documentation of adverse and severe adverse events. Data management was provided by the independent Clinical Trials Center in Marburg and included regular checks for consistency and plausibility, and queries if inconsistencies or missing data became evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>Concealed randomization was carried out centrally by the independent Clinical Trials Center in Marburg after patients had been enrolled in the study and had given informed consent in a ratio of 1:1. The randomization was done with permuted blocks stratified by Center. Patients and psychologists involved in the moderation of the aftercare program could not be masked to intervention allocation. Assessors who carried out T0-T3 diagnostic assessments were blind to intervention allocation and neither involved in the moderation of the intervention nor in the final data analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Within the first 2 weeks after hospital admission, potentially eligible patients were contacted by hospital staff and informed about the study. Patients willing to participate were interviewed over the phone by trained interviewers at TU Dresden to confirm a DSM-IV diagnosis of BN and to assess comorbidity and received login data to access the password protected Web-based trial platform. During the week before or after discharge, patients were interviewed and asked to complete the Web-based assessments again. Patients who had reduced their core BN symptoms by 50% compared with hospital admission were then randomized to the IN@ or TAU condition.</p></sec><sec><title>The Intervention IN@</title><p>We designed IN@ to target the maintenance of inpatient treatment gains and reduce relapses after discharge. The intervention was based on principles of cognitive behavioral treatment for BN [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and covered topics such as, eating behaviors and core bulimic symptoms, healthy exercise, body image, self-esteem, emotional and social skills. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the program content. Additional interactive features of the program were a monitoring log for bulimic symptoms, a body image, and a personal diary. Three clinical psychologists trained in behavior therapy for eating disorders guided the program, that is, provided individualized email feedback to entries in diaries and offered up to 9 monthly real-time individual chats of approximately 1 hour per participant. The program consisted of 11 Web-based sessions over 9 months with fortnightly sessions scheduled during the first 2 months after hospital discharge and monthly sessions thereafter.</p><p>The program&#x02019;s home page also provided an overview of all participating hospitals and CVs of the program moderators once patients had logged in to facilitate the credibility of the intervention. Screenshots of the intervention are provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendices 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment as Usual (TAU)</title><p>Patients assigned to the TAU group were assessed at all assessment points but did not receive additional treatment recommendations from the research team. However, most hospitals recommend some form of outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment. For ethical reasons, we did not interfere with these recommendations and subsequent decisions on concomitant treatment but documented it at all assessment points for both treatment

Information on the primary outcome was derived both from the Structured Interview for Anorexia and Bulimia nervosa (SIAB-EX) and the weekly symptom checklists. If there was contradictory information from these two sources, the patient was classified as nonabstinent. Secondary outcomes were abstinence from any core BN symptoms in the 2 months before follow-up (T3) as defined earlier, the frequencies of episodes of binge eating, vomiting, and all compensatory behaviors per week in the past 3 months before postintervention (T2) and follow-up (T3), and recovery defined as not fulfilling DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder anymore at postintervention (T2) and follow-up (T3). As abstinence rates are strongly influenced by definitions of abstinence [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we chose to align our definition of abstinence with previous recommendations [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Regarding the frequencies of binge eating and compensatory behaviors as well as recovery, we aligned our definitions with the DSM-IV-TR criteria.</p><p>Because hospitals were located nationwide and patients lived in and returned to different parts of Germany, all interview assessments were carried out over the telephone. At all assessment points, trained assessors blinded to patients&#x02019; group assignment assessed eating disorder-specific and general psychopathology. We applied the SIAB-EX [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to measure eating disorder symptomatology and general psychopathology and ascertain the diagnosis of BN at all assessment points. The interview was slightly modified by adding continuous items measuring the absolute frequencies (rather than categorical items of frequency spans) of binge eating and compensatory behaviors over periods of 2 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months. At prebaseline, we also used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I mental disorders (SCID-I [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) to measure psychiatric comorbidity. All interview documentations were monitored and checked for plausibility by the study coordinator and the independent monitor, and assessors received regular feedback based on this monitoring.</p><p>Questionnaire assessments (for further moderator as well as mediator analyses) and the weekly symptom checklists were integrated into the Web-based platform that also hosted the intervention. Patients in both the intervention and the TAU group were prompted regularly to report the frequencies of all core BN symptoms.</p><p>At T2 and T3, we also assessed the amount of any additional in- and outpatient treatment patients had utilized during the IN@ intervention and the follow-up period (in-, out-, day-patient therapy, days of treatment, number of outpatient treatment sessions, and number of therapists).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on average rates of patients who do not remain abstinent of binge eating and compensatory behaviors after having achieved abstinence during treatment [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We assumed an average abstinence rate of 15% for TAU and of 35% for IN@, that is, we considered a difference of 20 percent points between groups, a clinically relevant reduction in core BN symptomatology. Using standard sample size formulae for the comparison of two rates by Fisher exact test at an alpha-level of 5% (two-sided) and statistical power of 85%, we calculated the minimum sample size to be n=90 for each group or a total of N=180 patients. Assuming a dropout rate of 30% at postintervention, a total of N=258 patients had to be included in the study.</p><p>We analyzed the primary outcome by intention to treat (ITT), which included all patients who had been randomized, using logistic regression analyses adjusted for prebaseline binge eating frequency, frequency of compensatory behaviors, BMI, SIAB general psychopathology, and baseline abstinence. If no data (from SIAB-EX or weekly symptom checklist) were available for a patient or if data from both sources were contradictory, she was considered nonabstinent (worst case imputation). The primary outcome was also analyzed using the complete cases (CCs) that included only women who had completed postintervention assessments and the per-protocol sample (PP) which included all women of the IN@ group who had completed postintervention interview assessments and had actively engaged with the intervention, that is, opened at least 25% of program pages or participated in at least two one-to-one chats. For the TAU group, the PP was identical with the CC. Abstinence at follow-up was analyzed in the same manner. Group differences were analyzed by logistic regression analyses, adjusting for prebaseline binge eating frequency, frequency of compensatory behaviors, BMI and SIAB general psychopathology, and baseline abstinence.</p><p>We analyzed the frequencies of episodes of binge eating, vomiting, and of all compensatory behaviors per week in the past 3 months preceding baseline (T1, discharge), postintervention (T2), and follow-up (T3) using mixed effects model to account for the nested data structure of three observations across time within individual participants [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Longitudinal mixed effects modeling is the method of choice for intent-to-treat analyses to assess clinical trial outcomes [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Multiple imputation before conducting longitudinal mixed effects modeling does not add value and is not necessary [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Episodes of binge eating, vomiting, and other compensatory behaviors were measured as count data and modeled as log-linked dependent variables to estimate intervention effects on change in rate from baseline to T2 or T3.</p><p>The percentage of women who did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for any eating disorders at T2 and T3 were compared between the groups by Fisher exact test.</p><p>Moderator analyses were performed for abstinence (from binge eating and compensatory behaviors) at postintervention and follow-up using mixed effects model. Because IN@ represents a novel aftercare approach and findings on patient characteristics as predictors of outcome for ED treatment are inconclusive, we decided to employ an exploratory approach as proposed by the MacArthur Foundation [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Accordingly, in a first step, we calculated correlations (Kendall&#x02019;s Tau) between all available prebaseline and baseline variables and abstinence at postintervention and follow-up. A variable was considered a potential moderator if the correlation between the variable and abstinence at postintervention or follow-up was &#x0003e;.20. In a second step, each candidate moderator variable was entered separately into a mixed effects model. A variable was considered a moderator if there was a significant group &#x000d7; variable interaction effect on either postintervention or follow-up abstinence. Finally, if abstinence was moderated by more than one variable, all moderators were entered in a mixed effects analysis to determine the final prediction model. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and HLM7 (Scientific Software International, Inc., Skokie, IL).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient Flow and Characteristics</title><p>Between 2007 and 2012, about 2500 patients were admitted for eating disorder treatment to collaborating hospitals and assessed for eligibility. A total of 431 women gave written informed consent to participate in the trial, of which 364 were reached for the prebaseline assessments, and of those, 315 fulfilled DSM-IV-TR criteria for BN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and recruitment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v19i9e321_fig1"/></fig><p>Inpatient treatment comprised CBT-oriented (22%) and mixed (psychodynamic with CBT-elements; 78%) treatment approaches. At T1, 274 patients completed the baseline assessment and of those, 253 patients had reduced their core BN symptoms by at least 50% and were thus included in the trial (which would still result in 84% power under the initial planning assumptions); 126 were randomized to IN@ and 127 to TAU. At T2, 88 patients of the intervention group and 79 patients of the control group had completed postintervention assessments resulting in a dropout rate of 30% in the IN@ group and 38% in TAU. At T3, 82 patients of the IN@ group and 81 of the TAU group had completed follow-up assessments resulting in an overall dropout rate of 34.9% in IN@ and 36.2% in TAU.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> summarizes baseline characteristics of all patients. There were no relevant baseline differences between groups regarding BMI, age, illness duration, frequency of core BN symptoms, and frequency of any prior (in- and outpatient) psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment. However, a history of AN was more prevalent in the TAU group (45.6% vs 32.5%), whereas a current anxiety disorder was more prevalent in the IN@ group (46.0% vs 32.3%) and a current substance use disorder was more prevalent in the TAU group (6% vs 1%). Approximately 85.3% of patients had already received some kind of psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment before hospital admission.</p><p>Overall, patients&#x02019; BMI was in the normal range. Patients reported illness duration of 7.2 years on average and reported high levels of binge eating and vomiting episodes. In the 2 weeks preceding hospital discharge (baseline), the average number of objective binge eating and vomiting episodes per week had dropped considerably and 54.9% of patients were abstinent from binge eating and compensatory behaviors.

Seeking</title><p>A high proportion of patients of both groups utilized psychotherapeutic or psychiatric outpatient treatment between baseline and postintervention as well as postintervention and 9-month follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). Rates were almost identical in both groups for both time periods as were number of sessions (IN@: 44.9; TAU: 48.3). A small proportion of patients also utilized further inpatient treatment between hospital discharge and follow-up. Women of the intervention group who did not utilize any further treatment during the intervention period were more likely to terminate the IN@ intervention prematurely (7 out of 14 women [50.0%] opened less than 25% of program pages) than women who received additional CBT (7 out of 30 women [23.3%] opened less than 25% of program pages) or psychodynamic therapy (10 out of 26 women [38.5%] opened less than 25% of program pages). However, the type (CBT vs psychodynamic) or amount of TAU treatment was not significantly related to any of the reported outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>This is one of the first studies to evaluate the efficacy of a program targeting maintenance or improvement of treatment gains achieved during inpatient treatment in patients with severe BN. On the basis of ITT analysis at T2, we found that individuals receiving IN@ did not differ significantly from individuals receiving TAU in rates of abstinence from binge eating and any compensatory behaviors (21.4% vs 18.9%) and these rates remained stable at follow-up. They were higher in the CCs (and PP) sample but also not significantly different between groups. Although the intervention resulted in a 28% lower frequency of binge eating episodes at posttreatment compared with the TAU group, this difference was not significant. However, at postintervention, the IN@ group achieved a 46% lower frequency of vomiting episodes and this difference was significant. At follow up, this frequency was still 41% lower than in the TAU group but the difference was no longer significant. Moderator analyses revealed that both at post-intervention and follow-up, women of the intervention group who still reported binge eating and compensatory behaviors after the inpatient treatment had higher odds of achieving abstinence at post-intervention and follow-up compared with women of the TAU group who still reported binge eating and compensatory behaviors after the inpatient treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>The results of this study have to be discussed in the light of several important points: (1) general lack of comparison of maintenance studies for patients with BN, (2) illness severity, (3) additional treatment utilization and health care system in general, and (4) intervention characteristics.</p><p>For the primary outcome, abstinence of binge eating and any compensatory behaviors, only one other study for patients with BN has demonstrated that an aftercare intervention yields a significant reduction in abstinence while one other study did not find any differences on a number of self-report measures between the groups. In the first study, a 16-week, SMS for patients with BN after hospital discharge was investigated [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This relatively short intervention yielded significantly larger abstinence and partial remission rates at 8 months after hospital discharge than our intervention but the SMS-study differs in terms of duration of intervention and follow up, diagnoses (more EDNOS cases), and symptom frequency from ours. Additionally, treatment utilization in this study was 8-9 sessions over the 8 months of the intervention and follow-up compared with 27-29 sessions over 9 months of the intervention in our study. Because this study [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was carried out as part of the same health care system as our own study, patients were probably not as severely ill as patients included in our study. In the second study [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] published after the starting of our study, both the Web-based support group and the waiting list group improved during the 4-month intervention with no significant differences between groups. Neither abstinence rates nor follow-up data were reported.</p><p>A second important point for the interpretation of the results of this study regards illness severity of the included patient group, indicated by symptom frequency, illness duration, and previous in- and outpatient treatment utilization. Patients in our study reported an average frequency of almost 15 binge eating episodes and over 18 vomiting episodes per week during the preceding 3 months before hospital admission. Although patients treated as inpatients may have higher frequencies of binge eating and purging episodes in general, these numbers clearly exceed frequencies reported in both earlier and more recent intervention trials for BN (eg, [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). Our sample may therefore represent a more severely ill sample of BN patients which may limit the generalizability of the results.</p><p>The third crucial issue to be considered in the interpretation of the results is the amount of additional treatment utilization. Our study was originally planned to compare the efficacy of an aftercare intervention with TAU. However, at the time of planning the study, it was unclear what the &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; amount of further treatment utilized by patients after hospital discharge would be, that is, whether and to what degree patients are recommended to take up further treatment following their inpatient stay and to what degree they would follow this recommendation. In this study, treatment utilization was surprisingly high: 82% of both groups engaged in additional treatment with 2-3 sessions per month during the 9-month intervention period and even higher numbers over the 9-month follow-up period. For patients, as severely ill as in this study, a Web-based aftercare intervention may have been less acceptable as stand-alone treatment compared with face-to-face treatment.</p><p>Finally, treatment utilization in this study may also be reflective of the specific health care context in which the study was conducted, that is, access to outpatient psychotherapeutic care and coverage of up to 80 sessions of outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment by health insurances in Germany. However, waiting times can be 6-12 months depending on regional differences. Because patients originated from different parts in Germany, the amount of further treatment utilization is even more surprising.</p><p>The characteristics of the intervention itself may also need to be discussed for the interpretation of the results. Adherence is a problem for Web-based interventions in general, also labeled as &#x0201c;law of attrition&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Compared with targeted preventive interventions for eating disorders in student populations, in which adherence, defined as the number of opened pages and/or completed sessions, ranges between 50% and 80% [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], adherence to the IN@ intervention was lower. Participants opened on average 36% of the program pages; 15.1% of patients never logged on to the program after randomization and only 19.1% completed all 11 sessions of the program. However, the duration of preventive interventions is usually 8-10 weeks compared with 9 months in our study. For the included patients, the frequency of provided Web-based sessions especially during the first months may have been too low and the duration of the intervention and of individual sessions may have been too long. Future maintenance interventions may benefit from an overall shorter intervention duration and shorter, more frequent sessions which may also improve adherence to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and Service-Related Implications</title><p>Although the intervention did not have a significant effect on abstinence rates at T2, the results of secondary outcomes, specifically vomiting rates, and moderator analyses may have important clinical implications: In the IN@ group, rates of vomiting episodes were almost half the rates of patients in the TAU group. From a clinical perspective, reducing vomiting episodes is often more difficult for patients than reducing binge eating, and while patients may have given up or reduced the frequency and quality of binge eating episodes considerably, vomiting is often the more persistent symptom. Because vomiting is also specifically associated with severe medical complications, its reduction during treatment is of essential clinical importance [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, despite the marked reductions in vomiting rates during the intervention and follow-up, average rates were still above the diagnostically relevant threshold.</p><p>The intervention also proved to be specifically beneficial for patients who had not achieved abstinence at the time of hospital discharge. Thus, for a subgroup of potentially even more severely ill patients, participating in the aftercare intervention turned out to be specifically advantageous. In our study, only 54.9% of patients achieved abstinence of all BN symptoms during inpatient treatment in the past 2 weeks before baseline. Accordingly, a considerable proportion of patients were in need of further or more specific support to achieve full remission. Generally, the lack of studies examining short- and long-term effects of inpatient or residential treatments limits the comparability of these outcomes [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, studies addressing long-term course and outcome of BN often demonstrate that relapses after the end of treatment are common and that patient status at posttreatment does not necessarily predict recovery status at follow-up [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The fact that patients in this study did not maintain improvements achieved during inpatient treatment and that a large proportion of patients did not improve markedly despite further treatment utilization and participation in IN@ may also demonstrate the need for a stepped&#x02014;and more consistent and specialized&#x02014;aftercare treatment provision. TAU after inpatient treatment is obviously provided irrespective of previous treatment gains or further needs in specific symptom domains. Although for some patients the aftercare intervention may have been sufficient to maintain their treatment gains, others may have needed even more intensive outpatient face-to-face treatment. To answer the question of who might need which amount of further Web-based or face-to-face treatment would require a change in current provision of health care delivery based on evidence rather than nonevidence based exploitation of existing health care structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Our study includes one of the largest sample sizes of patients of intervention trials for patients with BN, which clearly is a strength of the study. Follow-up duration is relatively long, BN symptoms and diagnoses were ascertained by a well-validated clinical interview, and the number of adverse events was not higher in IN@ compared with TAU. In a stepped-care model, the intervention could represent an economic alternative to face-to-face treatment if provided in a shortened version as first step and full alternative to TAU.</p><p>Limitations of the study are moderately higher dropout rates compared with face-to-face intervention trials and low adherence to the Web-based intervention. Future research efforts should therefore also be directed at adapting the intervention to increase adherence to the program and reduce dropouts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, data from this study suggest moderate effects of IN@ for patients with severe and chronic BN. With regard to abstinence rates, IN@ did not show a marked superiority over TAU. However, the intervention had encouraging effects on vomiting rates and might also be particularly beneficial for women who have not achieved abstinence during previous inpatient treatment when compared with TAU.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF), as part of the German Eating Disorders Diagnostic and Treatment Network (EDNET).
