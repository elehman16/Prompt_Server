Pain has been defined as &#x0201c;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Intrathecal local anesthetics have been most commonly used for regional analgesia. To enhance bupivacaine-induced analgesia, various adjuvant drugs were used such as adrenaline, morphine, fentanyl, clonidine, and ketamine but were associated with many side effects. Acetylcholine of muscarinic cholinergic system was found to be one of the endogenous spinal neurotransmitter to have role in antinociception by direct action on spinal cholinergic muscarinic receptor M1 and M3 and nicotinic receptor subtypes as well as indirectly by stimulating release of second messenger nitric oxide in the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Neostigmine exerts its effect by inhibiting the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] According to recent literature, the inhibition of acetylcholine degradation by neostigmine enhances the descending control of afferent nociceptive stimuli and provides new approach for enhancement of desirable analgesia with few dose-related side effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The use of neostigmine intrathecally does not cause any hypotension, sedation, respiratory depression, or neurological dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, we intend to compare intrathecal neostigmine at dose of 50 &#x000b5;g and 150 &#x000b5;g as an adjuvant to bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia after surgery under spinal anesthesia. In developing countries where affordability of health care is a major concern, neostigmine is a cost effective, easily available nonopioid alternative to ameliorate, mostly undertreated postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized control study was conducted in the Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care at a comprehensive cancer care hospital of North India between 2010 and 2011 after approval by Hospital Ethics Committee. A written informed consent was obtained from all patients selected for the study.</p><p>A total of 75 patients of either sex, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class I and II in the age group of 30&#x02013;65 years scheduled to undergo lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries were chosen randomly. Patients with bleeding disorder or on anticoagulant therapy, patients allergic to bupivacaine or neostigmine, unconscious or mentally retarded patients, patients with infection at the site of lumbar puncture, patients with increased intracranial pressure, alcoholics, drug addicts, and patients with weight more than 100 kg were excluded from the study.</p><p>For the study, patients were randomly allocated into three groups, each group consisting of 25 patients. The patients were allocated using random number table into one of the three groups: Group I (control group) included 25 patients who were given 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally, Group II (50 &#x000b5;g group) included 25 patients who were given 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 50 &#x000b5;g (0.1 ml) of neostigmine methylsulfate intrathecally, and Group III (150 &#x000b5;g group) included 25 patients who were given 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 150 &#x000b5;g (0.3 ml) of neostigmine methylsulfate intrathecally. Saline was added to the syringes to make an equivalent volume of 3 ml. Neostigmine used was preservative free, was measured by insulin syringe and mixed with bupivacaine. The contents of the syringe were concealed using serially numbered opaque sealed envelope approach. The patient, anesthesiologist injecting the drug, and the observer were blind to the group that the patient belonged to.</p><p>A day before surgery, preanesthetic check-up comprising detailed history, general physical examination, and systemic examination of all patients was undertaken. Routine investigations such as hemogram, bleeding time, clotting time, random blood sugar, renal function test, liver function test, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram were obtained and checked. Patient's height and weight were recorded. The patients were explained about the procedure of spinal anesthesia, the drugs being administered along with their side effects and written informed consent was taken. All patients were also explained about the concept of visual analog scale for pain (VAS-P) and nausea (VAS-N) which consists of 100 mm line with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; equaling no pain or no nausea at all and &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; being worst pain or worst possible nausea.</p><p>All patients were kept nil orally for 6 hours (h) before surgery. Patients were given premedication with tablet midazolam 7.5 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime and 3 h preoperatively. Systemic narcotics were not administered to avoid the analgesics effects of any other drug interfering with the study. After shifting the patient to operation theatre, preoperative vital signs including pulse rate, respiratory rate, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and arterial oxygen saturation was recorded. Intravenous access was secured using 18-gauge intravenous cannula, and patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg of crystalloid solution (Ringer lactate) over 20&#x02013;30 min and then infused at 10 ml/kg body weight per hour after spinal anesthesia. Patients were subsequently placed in lateral position. Using all aseptic precautions, L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>5</sub> intervertebral space was located, and 2% lignocaine was infilterated. The 25-gauge Quincke's spinal needle was used to access subarachnoid space. Successful dural puncture was confirmed by withdrawing the stylet to verify free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Syringe loaded with injection bupivacaine alone or in combination with neostigmine, depending on the group was attached to the hub of the needle and whole of the drug was injected slowly into subarachnoid space. Patients were immediately turned supine after administration of subarachnoid block. All patients were given oxygen at 5 L/min by mask throughout the surgical procedure.</p><p>Pulse rate, noninvasive blood pressure - systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were monitored every 5 min for the first 20 min after the block and then at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, and 150 min. The time of administration of intrathecal drug and the duration of procedure from time of commencement till the end of operation was noted. The onset of sensory block, i.e., time of intrathecal administration of drug to absence of pin prick was noted. The level of sensory block was assessed by pinprick test by using a short beveled 23-gauge needle after subarachnoid block at 5 min and at 10 min. Postoperatively, patients were assessed for pain scores at hourly intervals till 4 h, then 2 h for the next 6 h and then at 24 h. The intensity of postoperative pain during first 24 h was assessed by VAS-P which was already explained to the patient in the preoperative period. When patient was asleep, no VAS assessment was made and VAS of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; was given. The duration of analgesia was measured as the time to requirement of first analgesia in recovery room and was recorded in minutes. Patients with VAS above four received rescue analgesic in form of injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscularly. The total analgesic requirement in 24 h was recorded. The occurrence of nausea was assessed by VAS-N which consisted of 10 cm horizontal line, similar to VAS-P. The end mark &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; meant no nausea and the other end marked &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; meant worst possible nausea. Patient with VAS-N above two or vomiting at any time was treated with injection metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously.</p><p>The primary outcome of our study was enhancement of duration of postoperative analgesia with use of intrathecal neostigmine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine. The secondary outcome was enhanced efficacy of 50 &#x000b5;g intrathecal neostigmine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine due to lesser side effects over 150 &#x000b5;g neostigmine, increased patient comfort and lower VAS-P scores in test groups.</p><p>A sample size of 25 patients in each group was selected to detect a difference of 60 min in the mean duration of analgesia assuming a standard deviation of 62 min and allowing for dropouts. The power of the study was kept at 90% and significance level at 5%.</p><p>On completion of study, recorded data were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance or ANOVA and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the present study, all the three groups were similar with respect to patient demographics such as age, sex ratio, weight, and ASA physical status.

The use of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g neostigmine intrathecally during vaginal hysterectomy produced significant analgesia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The study attributed analgesia with smaller doses of neostigmine to increased potency of neostigmine in response to painful stimulus as well as to use of intravenous morphine through patient controlled analgesia in all their patients.</p><p>The addition of neostigmine to bupivacaine caused significant increase in duration of analgesia up to 270 &#x000b1; 43 min as compared to bupivacaine alone (85 &#x000b1; 10 min).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The use of hyperbaric neostigmine intrathecally in dose of 100 &#x000b5;g was effective for pain relief and reduced postoperative opiate requirement after single level discectomy.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The onset of analgesia was decreased, and duration was prolonged with 50 &#x000b5;g intrathecal neostigmine.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, the mean duration of analgesia provided by intrathecal neostigmine in our study was slightly longer than that reported by Hood <italic>et al</italic>. who observed that intrathecal neostigmine at a dose of 100 &#x000b5;g produced mild analgesia (30&#x02013;40% reduction in pain scores in response to a noxious cold stimulus) lasting 3&#x02013;4 h in volunteers whereas 50 &#x000b5;g produces no detectable analgesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This may be explained on the basis of different patterns of noxious stimuli used in their study.</p><p>Our results were similar to Saini <italic>et al</italic>. who observed greatly enhanced analgesia by intrathecal neostigmine in the 150 &#x000b5;g dose as is shown by significantly less consumption of rescue analgesics. They also concluded that intrathecal neostigmine in dose of 50 &#x000b5;g was ineffective for analgesia which was in contrast to our study in which intrathecal neostigmine in a dose of 50 &#x000b5;g was associated with lower VAS score prolonged duration of analgesia and lesser consumption of rescue analgesic in 24 h as compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The use of intrathecal neostigmine in dose of 75 &#x000b5;g along with bupivacaine produced better postoperative analgesia as compared to its use in a dose of 50 &#x000b5;g, but was associated with increased frequency of side effects like nausea, vomiting, bradycardia and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher in the neostigmine groups. None of the patients (0%) in Group I, four patients (16%) in Group II, and eight patients (32%) in Group III developed nausea and vomiting which was promptly relieved by injection metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously. Intrathecal neostigmine produces nausea in a dose-dependent manner. This high incidence of nausea and vomiting could be due to cephalad migration of neostigmine to the brain stem where it causes accumulation of acetylcholine. This increased acetylcholine causes vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The injection of neostigmine in hyperbaric dextrose solution while maintaining the patient in head up position reduces the incidence of vomiting.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In a study done by Klamt <italic>et al</italic>., nausea and vomiting started within 30 min and lasted for more than 1 h despite use of metoclopramide or droperidol.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This may be attributed to the maintenance of head down position in their patients by the authors. This was in contrast to our study where most of the patients responded to injection metoclopramide given intravenously.</p><p>Hypotension occurred in all the three groups, and the difference was statistically insignificant. The reason of this hypotension is blockade of the sympathetic nervous system during subarachnoid block, and subsequent decreases in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. The addition of neostigmine to bupivacaine intrathecally did not reduce hypotension.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, in contrast, some studies had observed that intrathecal neostigmine can counteract the hypotension induced by intrathecal local anesthetics by directly stimulating preganglionic sympathetic neurons in spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of bradycardia was more in the neostigmine groups though the difference was not statistically significant. All the patients responded to intravenous atropine. Neostigmine 50 &#x000b5;g caused bradycardia at 65&#x02013;70 min after administration of spinal anesthesia and bradycardia was successfully treated with atropine.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Neostigmine caused increase in the incidence of sweating which is a sign of sympathetic system stimulation. This might account for protective effect of neostigmine against the hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] None of the patients in the present study developed respiratory depression, ejaculation, or increased salivation. This is consistent with the study by Chung <italic>et al</italic>. who did not report any respiratory depression leading to desaturation with intrathecal neostigmine.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Administration of intrathecal neostigmine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine produces effective, prolonged and hemodynamically stable postoperative analgesia as compared to administration of intrathecal bupivacaine alone. Intrathecal neostigmine in dose of 50 &#x000b5;g provided effective analgesia as shown by lower VAS-P and reduced consumption of rescue analgesic whereas the dose of 150 &#x000b5;g was associated with much more prolonged duration of analgesia but at the cost of higher incidence of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. In developing nations, it can be used as a low-cost nonopioid adjuvant in low doses, without fear of hemodynamic instability or respiratory depression for undertreated postoperative pain.</p><sec
