The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), the PAR-Q+ and the Pre-exercise Screening Tool are commonly used for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These instruments are designed to identify individuals who can safely participate in physical activity without obtaining further medical clearance and to identify higher-risk individuals who should seek medical clearance before increasing their physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In research settings, higher-risk individuals are often instructed to obtain medical clearance prior to enrolment in the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ensuring an individual&#x02019;s safety to increase their activity is a priority; however, pre-exercise screening tools can classify between 68.4% and 94.5% of individuals as higher risk, which, owing to the time and financial requirements associated with securing approval, can act as a deterrent to participation in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Further, the PAR-Q has been shown to disproportionally identify a high number of participants as high risk because of age, medication use or the presence of medical conditions that may benefit from participation in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This led to the development of the PAR-Q+, which is a valid instrument that provides additional screening to reduce the number of individuals classified as high risk who may benefit from physical activity and do not need to obtain additional medical clearance to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is not well understood, however, how requiring individuals identified as higher risk to obtain medical clearance influences overall study sample characteristics during recruitment for RCTs. For example, some individuals identified as being at higher risk may obtain the necessary medical clearance and be enrolled in the RCT, which does not alter the socio-demographic or behavioural characteristics of included individuals. Alternatively, some higher-risk individuals may not have the time or financial resources to obtain the medical clearance and consequently may not be enrolled in the RCT, which may bias the characteristics of included participants. This is important because authors of reviews of physical activity interventions frequently report that participants are characterised by high proportions of female participants and individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds (e.g., higher income, higher education levels), which limits the generalisability of results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Also, higher-risk individuals may be less physically active and may have higher chronic disease risk than lower-risk individuals, meaning that exclusion of higher-risk individuals may limit knowledge of intervention efficacy in populations that are in most need of intervention. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine differences in the socio-demographic and risk factor profiles of participants enrolled in an RCT examining a physical activity intervention who were identified as lower risk with the PAR-Q, and in those who identified as higher risk who subsequently obtained medical clearance to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The WALK 2.0 trial is a three-arm RCT that examined the effectiveness of two web-based physical activity interventions relative to a paper-based logbook physical activity intervention. The full trial protocol and baseline description of participant characteristics have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, participants were recruited from two regions in Australia (South Western Sydney, Central Queensland). The primary recruitment method was personalised invitation letters sent to an extract of individuals randomly selected from among the Australian Electoral Commission electoral roll in the study areas, supplemented with local print media advertisements, emails to university email lists, and people registered with the university as being interested in future research. Interested individuals were directed to a website to complete an online eligibility survey assessing Internet access status, age, physical activity level and the seven-item original PAR-Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were that participants be over 18&#x000a0;years of age, have Internet access, participate in &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on 5 or more days of the week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], not have an existing medical condition that contraindicated physical activity (assessed by the PAR-Q), and not have ever been a member of the existing 10,000 Steps program (i.e., the Web 1.0 group in this trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Individuals who initially reported more than 150&#x000a0;minutes of physical activity per week were asked to complete a more detailed assessment of physical activity to determine eligibility in relation to their physical activity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Individuals who completed the PAR-Q and answered &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to all PAR-Q items were identified as lower risk, and individuals who answered &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to any PAR-Q questions were identified as higher risk and were required to obtain medical exercise clearance from their usual medical practitioner prior to enrolment in the study. All participants enrolled in the study completed an online survey of socio-demographics, physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and quality of life, and had their height, weight and waist circumference measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Participants wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) affixed using an elastic belt on the waist for 8&#x000a0;days, time spent sedentary (&#x0003c;100 counts/minute) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (&#x0003e;1951 counts/minute) were determined on valid days (at least 600&#x000a0;minutes/day of wear time on at least 5&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The WALK 2.0 trial provided individuals who were identified as higher risk with an opportunity to obtain medical clearance to enrol in the trial. The additional screening resulted in a group of significantly older men, with a lower socio-economic position, who were at higher risk of chronic disease (as determined by BMI, waist circumference and sedentary behaviour) to be included in the trial. Whilst the additional screening process was resource- and time-intensive for both the participants and the research team, it was advantageous because it resulted in a more diverse group of participants who are more in need of a physical activity intervention and who may thus also benefit more from participating in the study. The greater diversity of participants subsequently included in the trial is important, given that reviews of RCTs identify that participants are typically female and from higher socio-economic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, 68 potential participants did not obtain a medical exercise clearance, and 22 potential participants who were required to obtain a medical exercise clearance did not obtain clearance, because they were no longer interested in participating in the trial. The impact of potentially including these participants in the trial is unknown. It is likely that the added barrier of having to go to a medical practitioner to seek clearance was too great for these participants. Further, 549 (83.9%) of the 654 participants eligible to attend an induction assessment actually attended the induction assessment, and 504 (91.8%) of the 549 participants attending the induction assessment actually completed baseline assessments. The omission of these individuals from the profile of participants included in the trial is unknown because no data are available for these individuals.</p><p>The WALK 2.0 trial used the original PAR-Q instrument, which is acknowledged to identify a high proportion of individuals who, after additional screening, can undertake physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The high proportions of individuals identified as high risk contributed to the development of the PAR-Q+, which can be used in combination with the ePAR-med-X+ if additional screening is necessary to identify if individuals do in fact require medical clearance prior to participation in physical activity or if they can commence physical activity without medical clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The potential benefit of using these instruments for screening in RCTs is supported by the number of participants in the present study who were required to obtain medical exercise clearance and received it, and also that these newer instruments are reported to identify only 1% of individuals for additional medical screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>On the basis of the outcomes of this study, we encourage others to apply screening protocols that are less restrictive (e.g., using PARQ+), as well as to include options for interested people to seek and provide medical exercise approval whenever possible, because this is likely to provide a more representative population that would benefit from physical activity interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This trial was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (project grant number 589903).
