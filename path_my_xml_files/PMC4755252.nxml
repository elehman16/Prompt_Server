The cause of hypertension is not known in many patients, but renal artery stenosis, severe pain, cerebrovascular disease, acute renal failure, not taking medications, and illegal drugs of antihypertensive treatment, panic attack or depression, and anxiety may lead to hypertension.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Depression, mental, and psychological problems are common for people living a modern lifestyle, and the majority of these people do not know they are suffering from depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, the use of antidepressant agents has increased substantially.

The outcomes after adjusted for confounding factors explored that the prevalence of hypertensive incidences was higher in users of SSRIs.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] As we know, depression and anxiety might contribute to the development of hypertension through physiological deregulation including altered activity of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis that observed in approximately 50% of depressed patients[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and changes in the autonomic nervous system functioning, such as decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic tone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In this regard, autonomic dysfunction may increase cardiac output, vascular resistance, and vasoconstriction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Studies considering the association between antidepressants and BP levels have not produced consistent results about their efficacy on BP levels, until now.

Inclusion criteria were history of hypertension with antihypertensive treatment or an initial SBP &#x0003e;140 or diastolic BP (DBP) &#x0003e;90 mmHg and repeated high BP after a 5 min resting period. In addition, signs of depression were diagnosed in them by psychiatrist through their psychological status such as feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in daily activities, sleep disorders, and appetite or weight changes on the basis criteria for depression in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Exclusion criteria included severe other psychiatric disorders such as general anxiety, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, current use of anti-depressants, and liver or kidney diseases. The sample size was calculated according with a comparison of means, which &#x003b1; considered 0.05 and power of the study was 80%. Afterward, all of the eligible participants signed informed consent and they randomly separated to the several groups included: (1) Users of SSRIs, (2) users of alprazolam, (3) users of SSRIs and alprazolam, and (4) users of SSRIs or alprazolam based on random digit number consecutively to four groups.

While, in nonusers of antidepressant, significant improvement was observed in DBP and mean BP. Comparing the users and nonusers did not show any significant differences in SBP, DBP, and mean BP; even, when outcomes were adjusted for risk factors and antihypertensive drugs. In fact, in our investigation, antidepressants usage did not have any association in lowering BP levels in depressed patients. According to previous studies, there were investigations which were similar to our results. For example, the article examined the long-term outcomes of depressed patients on SSRIs before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the SSRIs group had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and after adjustment for baseline differences, patients on SSRIs before CABG had increased risks of mortality, re-hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Licht <italic>et al</italic>. that compared BP levels between subjects with clinical anxiety and depressive disorders (users of antidepressant = 664, nonusers of antidepressant = 1384) with healthy control (<italic>n</italic> = 590) found that depressive disorder is associated with low SBP and less hypertension, whereas the use of certain antidepressants is associated with both high diastolic and SBPs and hypertension.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Toh <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effects of treatment with SSRIs on the risks of gestational hypertension in 5731 women with nonmalformed infants and no underlying hypertension. The risks of gestational hypertension were compared between women who did and did not receive SSRI treatment during pregnancy. Results suggested gestational hypertension was present in 9% of the 5532 women who were not treated with SSRIs and 19.1% of the 199 women who were treated with SSRIs. So, SSRIs exposure during pregnancy might identify women who are at an increased risk for gestational hypertension.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Lesp&#x000e9;rance <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of SSRIs (citalopram) on depression in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and compared users of citalopram for 12 weeks and matching placebo. Data revealed that citalopram or sertraline plus clinical management should be considered as a first step treatment for patients with CAD and major depression. In addition, they found no citalopram-placebo difference in systolic and diastolic BP.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In this regard, there were some studies on the contrary with our outcomes which suggested the safety and efficacy treatment of antidepressants on lowering BP. The investigation of Krishnan <italic>et al</italic>. with the aim of the safety and efficacy of sertraline as an antidepressant in the treatment of moderate-to-severe major depression in elderly outpatients with comorbid vascular disease revealed that sertraline was found to be a safe, well-tolerated, and effective in elderly patients suffering from hypertension and other forms of vascular comorbidity.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Another study which assessed the cardiovascular effect of citalopram in 811 elderly depressed patients concluded that the significant decrease in SBP and heart rate suggests that citalopram may reduce sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and the related increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with depression.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, our results showed improvement in SBP according to the SSRIs usage but this improvement was not significant. Yilmaz <italic>et al</italic>. studied the relationship of anxiety with BP and the effect of anxiolytic treatment on BP of emergency department patients over 18-year-old with an initial hypertension. Their finding revealed that alprazolam is as effective as captopril in lowering BP in these patients, and anxiety is relieved more effectively with alprazolam;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] whereas, this favorable changes did not observe in our study as a result of alprazolam usage. Another article carried out to compare the efficacy and safety of antianxiety treatment with sublingual captopril administration in 36 patients with excessive hypertension. Data showed antianxiety treatment is effective in lowering BP in patients with excessive hypertension without acute target organ damage.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] According to contradictory between our results and the investigations mentioned above, it should be noted, the kind of SSRIs that used, the period of follow-up (short-term or long-term), the level of baseline BP (hypertension or excessive hypertension), low number of samples or even the age of the participants may be the causes of these variations.</p><p>The mechanisms linking the influence of SSRIs on the BP have been proposed to be the effects of several pathways. Serotonin may play the main role in the regulation of vascular tone, as serotonergic neurons, and receptors modulate vascular resistance.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] It has been revealed that SSRIs not only affect neuronal serotonin uptake but also modulate peripheral serotonin. Sertraline, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine reduce platelet and whole blood serotonin concentrations after continual doses.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Additionally, SSRIs have been shown to affect circulating serotonin levels.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The inhibitory effect of SSRIs on the synthesis of nitric oxide as a vasodilator that seems to play a role in vascular tone has been mentioned as another potential pathway.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Some studies suggested that short-term SSRIs usage may reduce sympathetic nervous system activation[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the short-term responses may be different from those due to the long-term usage of SSRIs.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Finally, we concluded that 3 months treatment with antidepressant did not have any effect on lowering BP level in patients with psychiatric disorder, and may be continuation of treatment with these drugs, more than 3 months, was necessary for getting significant findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flack</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Neaton</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>R</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Shih</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutler</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ensrud</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Blood pressure and mortality among men with prior myocardial infarction.
