Two separate studies were conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of a newly formulated oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablet to a marketed oxycodone product in Japan under fasting and fed conditions. Each study was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, single-center, two-period, two-way crossover study. Healthy male Japanese subjects received the oxycodone 10-mg products under fasting and fed conditions. Blood samples were collected at specified time intervals, and plasma concentrations of oxycodone were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay method. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined via non-compartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic metrics used for bioequivalence assessment were the maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Oxycodone is a strong opioid that is commonly used as an alternative to morphine. After oral administration, oxycodone has a higher bioavailability (range 42&#x02013;87%) than morphine (range 22&#x02013;48%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, and less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. First-pass metabolism most likely occurs in the liver and not in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-3A4 and CYP2D6 are the main enzymes involved in its metabolism. Oxymorphone, a 3-<italic>O</italic>-demethylation metabolite of oxycodone catalyzed by CYP2D6, is a potent opioid with a &#x003bc;-opioid receptor affinity that is three to five times higher than that of morphine. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 displayed the highest activity for oxycodone <italic>N</italic>-demethylation to catalyze noroxycodone in human liver microsomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Both oxymorphone and noroxycodone are transformed to another possibly active metabolite, noroxymorphone, by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, respectively. CYP2D6 genotypes caused expected differences in pharmacokinetics (PK), but they did not influence pain control in patients treated with oxycodone for cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Opioid therapy frequently requires switching from one opioid to another to improve the response to analgesic therapy or to reduce adverse effects. There may be a benefit in switching to a different route of administration, drug, or formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Various oxycodone dosage forms and routes of administration, including immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) oral formulations and intravenous and subcutaneous injections, allow a high degree of flexibility in switching from one route of administration to another and switching to oxycodone from other opioids. In Japan, oxycodone hydrochloride ER tablets and IR powder were approved in 2003 and 2007, respectively. The recommended daily dose of ER oxycodone in Japan is 10&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg divided into two oral doses. Four strengths (5, 10, 20, and 40&#x000a0;mg) of ER oxycodone have been used for the treatment of patients with cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Oxycodone hydrochloride injection formulation was developed as an alternative route for these patients with cancer pain and was approved in 2012. Population PK analysis indicated no PK differences for total body clearance between intravenous and subcutaneous infusion in Japanese patients with cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">ER opioid formulations can provide less fluctuation in plasma drug concentration than IR formulations and good patient compliance due to reduced dose frequency, which offers several clinical advantages to managing chronic pain as a longer-lasting analgesia. Hydrophilic matrix technology is a method for ER of drugs and has been widely used for oral controlled delivery of various drugs, including hydromorphone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given their hydrophilic nature, these polymers begin to swell upon contact with water, forming a gel layer. Drug release is controlled via diffusion through the layer and/or erosion mechanisms. The advantages of this technology are ease of formulation, the cost-effective manufacturing process, wide regulatory acceptance of the polymer systems, and flexibility in the control of the drug-release profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A new oxycodone ER tablet with in vitro dissolution properties that were not affected by the pH of the test medium was manufactured with this technology. In addition, in vitro dissolution profiles, when evaluated with a bio-relevant method, were similar between the newly formulated ER tablet and a marketed oxycodone tablet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The objective of this study was to investigate whether the newly formulated ER oxycodone tablet is bioequivalent to a marketed oxycodone tablet under fasting and fed conditions to provide an option for a generic oxycodone product in Japan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, and locally applicable laws and regulations.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">This study was undertaken to establish the bioequivalence of the oxycodone ER tablet and the marketed formulation to support development of new ER formulations of oxycodone in Japan. The results from this study show that the two oxycodone tablets at the dose strengths of 10&#x000a0;mg can be considered bioequivalent. Mean plasma concentrations and <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> were similar under both fasting and fed conditions, and adjusted geometric mean ratios for the PK parameters were close to 1.00, with 90% CIs contained within pre-specified bioequivalence limits. Bioequivalence guidance in Japan recommends studies be conducted using a stronger dose than intended for regular consumption; however, to protect the safety of healthy subjects, these bioequivalence studies were conducted using a 10-mg tablet dose based on available published information concerning oxycodone administered without naltrexone, which has not been approved in Japan. The bioequivalence of the four strengths of the ER tablets has been demonstrated using in vitro dissolution tests.</p><p id="Par27">The concomitant intake of alcoholic beverages together with ER opioid formulations poses a serious safety concern, since ethanol ingestion may modify the release characteristics and cause dose dumping, which can be a patient safety issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The in vitro dissolution profile in 40% ethanol of oxycodone from the ER tablets used in this study did not differ from that in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hydrophilic polymers, which are insoluble in ethanol and expected to be unaffected when consumed together with alcohol, were used as excipients for the preparation of the ER oxycodone tablets. The dissolution profiles of the ER tablet with or without ethanol (5&#x02013;40%) in test medium were evaluated using the USP apparatus 2 (paddle method). The in vitro dissolution rates of the ER tablet decreased slightly depending on the concentration of ethanol in the test medium (Fukui et al., unpublished data). In the medium with the highest ethanol concentration (40%), the dissolution rate decreased by approximately 20% compared with that in the ethanol-free medium. Therefore, the ER tablet would have a low potential for dose dumping when consumed with alcohol.</p><p id="Par28">A delay of median <italic>t</italic>

<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> than the reference formulation was observed for the ER tablets in fasted and fed conditions, while bioequivalence was demonstrated in both conditions. As ER oxycodone is administered twice daily and the plasma concentration at 12&#x000a0;h after administration was similar for both formulations, the difference in <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> between the two formulations would not provide a clinically meaningful difference in the treatment of pain.</p><p id="Par29">Although ER opioid formulations offer several clinical advantages, including consistent analgesia over the administration period, they are at particular risk for abuse via unintended routes because they contain higher amounts of the active drug than do IR formulations. The US FDA considers the development of abuse-deterrent opioid products a high public health priority and released guidance on the evaluation and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Oxycodone products specifically intended to reduce the potential for abuse and misuse of the original oxycodone tablet formulation were developed and reformulated as OxyContin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; these became available in the USA in 2010. A tamper-resistant system was not actively provided for either the test or the reference tablets used in this study. No abuse-deterrent formulation of oxycodone is currently approved for use in Japan. In Japan, oxycodone is prescribed only to patients with cancer pain who require continuous around-the-clock opioid analgesics for an extended period of time. However, abuse-deterrent formulations will definitely ensure the safe and effective use of opioids for the relief of chronic pain, and the technology has been under consideration.</p><p id="Par30">The most common oxycodone-related AEs are similar to those experienced with other opioids, e.g., constipation, sedation, and nausea. Although oxycodone-related AEs are similar to those of morphine, the lack of opioid-induced hallucinations with oxycodone means it could be superior to morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which includes constipation, hard dry stools, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal cramping, and increased gastric reflux, is the most distressing symptom, and the frequency of symptoms ranges from 26 to 49% in patients receiving oxycodone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An ER tablet comprising oxycodone and naloxone was developed, and analgesic efficacy was reported as comparable with a significant and clinically relevant improvement in opioid-induced constipation in various types of pain even after long-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Both test and reference products in the present study were well tolerated, with no severe AEs experienced. The AEs reported and observed in this study were similar and consistent with the known safety profiles of oxycodone. In a phase I study, naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, was used to reduce the likelihood of these AEs. However, naltrexone potentially altered the PK profile because it reverses the slowing of gastric transit associated with opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, naltrexone is capable of producing nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although blockade with naltrexone was not used in this study, all AEs were of mild and moderate severity and there were no clinically meaningful changes in the safety laboratory values, ECGs, or vital signs in any subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">This study demonstrated that a newly formulated oxycodone tablet using hydrophilic matrix technology is bioequivalent to a marketed reference product in Japan when administered to healthy male Japanese subjects under fasting and fed conditions.
