training around the ankle joints on the gait of elderly people who have experienced a
fall. [Subjects] Twenty-six elderly people with a risk of falling and a Berg Balance Scale
score of 37 to 50 points who had experienced a fall in the last year were randomly and
equally assigned to either a balance training group or an ankle training group. The
balance training group received training on a hard floor, training while maintaining
balance on a cushion ball in a standing position, and training while maintaining balance
on an unstable platform in a standing position; the ankle training group received training
to strengthen the muscles around the ankle joints and conducted stretch exercise for the
muscles around the ankle joints. [Results] There were significant changes in gait
velocity, step length, and stride length in the balance training group after the
intervention; there were significant changes in gait velocity, cadence, step time, cycle
time, step length, and stride length in the ankle training group after the intervention.
In a between-group comparison, the gait velocity of the balance training group showed a
significant improvement compared with the ankle training group. [Conclusion] Both balance
training and ankle joint training are effective in enhancing the gait ability of elderly
people with a risk of falling; in particular, balance training is effective in improving
the gait velocity of elderly people who have experienced a fall compared with ankle joint
training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly people</kwd><kwd>Balance training</kwd><kwd>Ankle training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>When a person falls, they drop down to a position on the floor, a lower position than their
original body position, because of an abrupt unintentional postural change, except for in
the case of falling due to acute paralysis or external force<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Factors that may trigger a
fall include age, gender, changes in physical strength such as balance hypoesthesia,
weakened lower limb muscles, reduced flexibility, reduced activities of daily living, visual
deficits, peripheral nerve disorders, cognitive impairment, emotional problems like
depression, residential environment, drug intake, drinking, urinary incontinence, past
history of a fall, arthritis, and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Falls are frequent among elderly people<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Elderly people who have experienced a fall may suffer from a series of severe complications
including hip joint fractures, which increase their morbidity and mortality rates and waste
medical resources<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the diverse
methods of preventing falls, regular and appropriate exercise slows down decreases in
physical strength such as balance ability, muscle strength, and flexibility<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and exercises that prevent falls are known
to reduce their frequency<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is a dynamic phenomenon that requires stability and mobility to be in good harmony,
and in order to properly maintain body balance, the ability to integrate the neurological
and musculoskeletal systems is important<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. All the stimuli coming from various sensory receptors such as
visual sensory, somatic sensory, proprioceptive, skin, joint, and vestibular sensory
receptors are integrated in different levels of the central nervous system, affecting an
individual&#x02019;s ability to maintain balance through efficient muscle tone, muscle strength and
endurance, and flexibility of the joints<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recovery of balance according to postural sway is achieved by an ankle strategy, a hip
strategy, or both strategies in combination<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. An ankle joint strategy is ordinarily used when there is a small
amount of body sway on a solid base of support. It is the first postural adjustment strategy
to be used and refers to primarily recovering upright standing balance through muscular
contraction of the ankle joints<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Training programs to ameliorate balance include aerobic, muscle
strengthening, and balance exercises. Balance exercise programs include aerobic exercise for
the purpose of improving stability, exercise to enhance muscle strength, and a method to
ameliorate balance using different sensory inputs<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on gait stability is deeply related to research on falls. In study of falls
associated with age, the postural sway that appeared when maintaining postural balance
became serious, and the stability limit significantly decreased<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. As individuals age, the step width and gait speed in the
gait process decrease, and the double-support stance phase during the gait cycle lengthens.
Such growth in the double-support stance phase increases the step width, which is related to
gait instability and is a factor for falls<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, a reduction in gait speed in
elderly people means that their ability to perform movement in ordinary life decreases<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to enhance gait stability, lower
limb muscle strength training and balance training are frequently used. Previous research in
which elastic resistance exercises were applied to the lower extremities for 14 weeks showed
that an elderly group that conducted such exercises saw greater improvements in gait speed
and ankle flexor muscle strength than an elderly group that did not conduct such
exercises<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, resistance
and balance exercises changed the gait patterns of elderly people who had experienced a
fall<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most prior studies have concerned fall prevention or balance
ability improvements. In this study, balance training and muscle training were applied
around the ankle joints by changing the base of support to improve the balance ability of
elderly people who have already experienced a fall, and the authors examined how such
training affected their gait ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The Subjects for this research were selected from the patients of a retirement community

times per week, 50 minutes per time, for eight weeks. A balance training program aimed at
improving balance was applied by referring to the methods presented by Lee<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and Park<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. It consisted of warm-up exercise for five minutes, balance
training for 30 minutes, and cool-down exercise for five minutes. The main portion of the
training was composed of exercises performed while standing on a hard floor (slowly raising
and lowering both heels, raising and lowering the front parts of both feet, and alternately
standing on one leg); an exercise consisting of maintaining your balance while standing on a
cushion ball; and an exercise consisting of maintaining your balance while standing on an
aero step. The exercise done on a hard floor was done in two sets, each for three minutes.
The subjects were instructed to keep their eyes open for one set and closed for the other
set. They did two sets of the exercises on the cushion ball and the aero step, each set
taking two minutes. After each set, they sat on a chair and rested for two minutes. The
ankle training program was comprised of warm-up exercise for five minutes, an ankle training
exercise for 30 minutes, and cool-down exercise for five minutes. For the main exercise, the
subjects conducted muscle stretch exercises around the ankle joints for fifteen minutes each
time and then muscle resistance exercises around the ankle joints for fifteen minutes each
time. For the stretch exercise, the subjects conducted static stretching of the ankle
dorsiflexor and ankle plantarflexor. They performed resistance exercises using yellow
(resistance power of 1.0&#x02005;kg when extended by 40&#x02005;cm) and red (resistance power of 1.6&#x02005;kg when
extended by 40&#x02005;cm) elastic bands 30 minutes per day. Considering that they were elderly
people, the exercise intensity was set with the rating scale of perceived exertion at 13 to
14.</p><p>A GAITRite system(CIR Systems Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) was used to measure gait performance.
All of the subjects in both groups rested for 30 minutes before and after the training, and
their gait ability was measured after practicing their gait twice at their own speed.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 was used for data analysis. In order to compare gait performance prior to and
after the exercises in each group, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted; in order to
compare the gait performances of the two groups, a Mann-Whitney U test was carried out. The
statistical significance level was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A comparison of gait ability according to training indicated that the balance training

once are afraid of falling again, which results in decreased activity<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the movement of
elderly people who have experienced a fall through exercise. To improve their balance
ability and basic gait, aerobic exercise and other diverse exercise methods aimed at
increasing balance and muscle strength need to be applied<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study examined the effects of balance and muscle
exercises targeting the ankle joints on the gait of elderly people who have experienced a
fall.</p><p>A comparison of gait ability according to training demonstrated that there were
statistically significant differences in the gait velocity, step length, and stride length
of the balance training group (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the ankle training group, there were
statistically significant differences in gait velocity, cadence, step time, cycle time, step
length, and stride length between before and after the training (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In general, gait speed may be affected by neurological control of such things as balance
ability and physical and physiological characteristics like reciprocal coordination of the
lower limb muscles and vital capacity<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, improving muscle functioning through regular exercise increases the number of
steps and gait speed<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Persch et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a 12-week lower limb muscle strength training program
enhanced muscle strength, which resulted in gait speed being improved by 11.1% and gait
ability being improved by 44%. In the present study, similar to previous research results,
the gait velocity of the balance and ankle joint training groups increased after eight weeks
of exercise. Steadman et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that
reduced balance ability in elderly people was related to reductions in gait velocity and
balance ability. In the present study, the gait speeds of both the balance training group
and the ankle joint training group increased, and the eight-week exercise programs had a
positive effect on balance in the elderly subjects.</p><p>In the gait, increases in cadence, step length, and stride length affect the increase in
gait speed<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Coa et al.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the reason elderly people&#x02019;s
gait speed decreases is because their step width decreases. Ferrandez et al.<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that reductions in step width
negatively influenced other aspects of gait&#x02014;decreases in arm swing and rotation of the hip,
knees, and ankles&#x02014;and lengthened double-limb support time, triggering reduced gait speed.
According to the present findings, the balance training group had increases in step length
and stride length, and the ankle joint training group experienced improvements in cadence,
step length, and stride length. In both groups, gait velocity increased, consistent with
previous research results.</p><p>According to the between-group comparison, there were statistically significant changes in
the gait velocity of the balance exercise group relative to the ankle joint exercise group
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Balance ability and gait ability are known to have a high correlation<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Continuous postural adjustment is
necessary between one lower limb and the other and between the lower extremities and the
upper extremities on a base of support that is unstable and changes during gait<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the activities of daily living,
gait is one that is performed at different speeds and in diverse directions, not just in one
direction. A change in gait direction slows forward motion and triggers movement in a new
direction, and balance should be well controlled to prevent falling and to maintain a stable
gait in the new direction and speed<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance during gait is an important element, and therefore the balance exercise group&#x02019;s gait
speed increased significantly more than that of the ankle joint exercise group.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The number of subjects was small, and various physical
traits of the subjects were not sufficiently taken into account; therefore, it will be
difficult to generalize the results to all elderly people. Besides, the variety of chronic
diseases was not considered, and the effects of chronic degenerative physical traits cannot
be excluded. The subjects of this study were elderly people who were able to independently
walk without aid. However, physical capabilities such as visual perception ability or space
perception ability that may have affected the results were not taken into consideration.
Accordingly, future research that reflects individual traits should be carried out on the
association between physical characteristics and functional levels and should utilize a
larger number of subjects over a longer time period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this paper was provided by Namseoul University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ungar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rafanelli</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Iacomelli</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Fall prevention in the elderly</article-title>.
