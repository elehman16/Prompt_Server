The painful event is the hallmark acute clinical manifestation of SCD, characterised by sudden onset and is usually bony in origin. This study aims to establish if 1.5mcg/kg of intranasal fentanyl (INF; administered via a Mucosal Atomiser Device, MAD&#x02122;) is non-inferior to intravenous morphine 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg in severe SCD-associated pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a randomised,double-blind, double-dummy active control trial of children (weighing more than 10&#x02009;kg) between 1&#x02009;year and 21&#x02009;years of age with severe painful sickle cell crisis. Severe pain is defined as rated seven or greater on a 0 to 10 age-appropriate numeric pain scale or equivalent. The trial will be conducted in a single tertiary urban paediatric ED in Dublin, Ireland. Each patient will receive a single active agent and a single placebo via the intravenous and intranasal routes. All clinical and research staff, patients and parents will be blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary endpoint is severity of pain scored at 10&#x02009;min from administration of the study medications. Secondary endpoints include pain severity measured at 0, 5, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 120&#x02009;min after the administration of analgesia, proportion of patients requiring rescue analgesia and incidence of adverse events. The trial ends at 120&#x02009;min after the administration of the study drugs. A clinically meaningful difference in validated pain scores has been defined as 13&#x02009;mm. Setting the permitted threshold to 50% of this limit (6&#x02009;mm) and assuming both treatments are on average equal, a sample size of 30 patients (15 per group) will provide at least 80% power to demonstrate that INF is non-inferior to IV morphine with a level of significance of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial will inform of the role of INF 1.5mcg/kg via MAD in the acute treatment of severe painful sickle cell crisis in children in the ED setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN67469672 and EudraCT no. 2011-005161-20</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sickle cell disease</kwd><kwd>Paediatric</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Analgesia</kwd><kwd>Intranasal</kwd><kwd>Fentanyl</kwd><kwd>Randomised Controlled Trial</kwd><kwd>Double blind</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) frequently and unpredictably present to the emergency department (ED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In these children, pain is a common experience, beginning as early as 4 to 6&#x02009;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These painful episodes (often referred to as a pain &#x0201c;crisis&#x0201d;) are the hallmark acute clinical manifestation of SCD, characterised by the sudden onset of pain. Although pain is a dominant feature in the medical lives of children with SCD, with approximately 70% of their hospitalisations after ED presentation being for uncontrolled pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], it is often under-recognised and undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Unrelieved pain does not only have negative consequences, such as missed days of school, restriction of other activities, and fear or mistrust of health care providers, but also can lead to amplified responses to subsequent pain experiences and sensitivity to pain later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, frequent painful episodes are associated with early mortality in patients with SCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Suboptimal acute pain management in SCD patients is associated with caregivers' preoccupation with the pathophysiological causes of vaso-occlusion and concern of creating opioid dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and a negative attitude toward patients with SCD in urban hospitals and EDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The truth regarding opiate addiction in patients with SCD is markedly less dramatic than conventional opinion would suggest. Prevalence estimates for opiate addiction among patients with SCD range from 0.5% to 8% compared to patients with other chronic pain syndromes with opiate addition rates of 3% to 16% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Two putative biological mechanisms may explain the relatively low prevalence of opiate addiction among SCD patients. First, the allelic variants in the genes involving the opioid (UGT2B7, OPRM1, and ABCB1 genes) and non-opioid system (COMT gene) can alter the efficacy of morphine in SCD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Second, the pharmacokinetics of morphine is altered in SCD patients, with clearance of morphine being 3&#x02013;10 fold higher in SCD patients compared with healthy non-SCD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although treating acute painful sickle cell crisis (PSCC) with appropriate potent analgesia [intravenous (IV) and/or oral controlled-release morphine] is humane and reduces the length of hospitalisation in SCD patients with mild to moderate pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the evidence base for acute ED pain management in children with PSCC is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Alternative, quicker and pain-free methods of providing safe and effective analgesia include the intranasal (IN) route for the administration of opiates such as fentanyl, sufentanil and diamorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The IN route is increasingly being used for the safe administration of analgesia in paediatric patients with painful conditions (e.g. burns, long bone fractures and post-operatively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the emergency care setting, IN fentanyl is also currently used for managing pain in children in the pre-hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Compared with other routes of drug administration, the IN route has unique advantages that may allow for more efficient use of resources, more rapid pain relief, and higher patient and provider satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The highly vascularised nasal mucosa and the olfactory tissue in direct contact with the central nervous system permit rapid drug absorption, high bioavailability and onset of action comparable with IV drug administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, IN drug administration is also relatively painless, inexpensive, convenient and easy to deliver with minimal training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Fentanyl is a potent opioid (approximately 100 times more potent than morphine) with high bioavailability and a short duration of action (IN fentanyl plasma half-life of 1&#x02009;h). When used in analgesic doses, fentanyl results in minimal sedation and little haemodynamic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine if 1.5mcg/kg of intranasal fentanyl via a Mucosal Atomiser Device (MAD&#x02122;) is non-inferior to intravenous morphine in children presenting with severe pain associated with SCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>To determine whether 1.5mcg/kg IN fentanyl is non-inferior to 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg IV morphine in the management of severe pain in children with PSCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active control clinical trial.

The study is a repeated measures study, measuring pain scores before and after the treatment. A detailed statistical analysis plan has been developed in association with CSTAR. From a previous study it is estimated that the reduction in pain will be 26&#x02009;mm on a visual analogue score (VAS) with a standard deviation of 6&#x02009;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As a non-inferiority study, a threshold of how different the two treatments are has to be established, generally from clinical data. A clinically meaningful difference in VAS scores has been defined as 13&#x02009;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Setting the allowable threshold to 50% of this limit (6&#x02009;mm) and assuming the two treatments are on average equal, a sample size of 30 patients (15 per group) will provide at least 80% power to demonstrate that INF is non-inferior to IV morphine with a level of significance of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Non-inferiority of the intranasal fentanyl treatment will be established based on a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time of measurement (before or after treatment) as the within-subjects factor and treatment as the between-subjects factor.

Risk analysis was carried out as part of protocol development. The study protocol was approved by the institutional Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC), OLCHC, Dublin.

IMB approval for this trial was granted on 20 January 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Breaking of the study blind</title><sec><title>During the study</title><p>If an adverse event is regarded as a potential serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR) by the sponsor, the treatment group to which the trial subject affected belongs is unblinded for that subject alone. The procedure will ensure that the identity of the IMP is only revealed as far as necessary (GCP Directive). All staff will have received training on all aspects of the trial protocol prior to commencement of the trial.</p><p>The principal investigator (PI) or authorised member of the team will have a written procedure for requesting randomisation codes for rapidly identifying a blinded IMP in an emergency. Breaking the blind of a trial subject will be at the discretion of the PI, when clinically indicated for the safety of the patient or in the event of a SUSAR. If the patient needs to be unblinded we will refer to the unblinding SOP for complete details of the procedures to be followed. The master randomisation codes will be kept by the clinical trial pharmacist and the PI. Unblinding will be performed by the senior clinician/pharmacist when the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE)/SUSAR have been met, and there is a necessity for the PI or treating healthcare professional to know which treatment the patient is receiving to ensure that the patient receives appropriate urgent safety measures.</p><p>A 24-h contact number will be available in the circumstances when unblinding is required. The scenario will be communicated and when the unblinding criteria are met the unblinding will ensue.

Adverse events will be classified on the form in terms of their severity, association with the study drug, expectedness and seriousness. They will be recorded on an adverse event log. The adverse events will be reported to the sponsor and the institutional HREC on a yearly basis as part of an annual safety report and at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious adverse event (SAE)</title><p>Each SAE will be recorded by a member of the research team on an SAE form. SAEs will be classified on the form in terms of their severity, relatedness to the study drug and expectedness. They will be recorded on aserious adverse event log. All SAEs will be reported on the SAE form within 24&#x02009;h to the sponsor and the institutional HREC. The research team will ensure that follow-up information and a detailed written report are provided when available. An ongoing prospective study of children experiencing severe painful sickle cell crisis in our ED reveals that over 90% of these children are admitted as an inpatient for further management of their crisis. This, therefore, would not be truly indicative of an SAE in this cohort of patients and will not be classified as such.</p></sec><sec><title>Suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (SUSAR)</title><p>Each SUSAR will also require expedited reporting to the sponsor. This will occur as soon as possible, but no later than 24&#x02009;h after a member of the research team has first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting. In each case, relevant follow-up information will be sought and a detailed, written report completed as soon as possible. The sponsor has responsibility to ensure all relevant and available information is forwarded to the competent authority (Irish Medicines Board) and the appropriate health ethics committee (HREC, OLCHC). For fatal or life-threatening events this will be done as soon as possible and not later than 7&#x02009;days after the sponsor becomes aware of the event. Additional relevant information will be sent within 8&#x02009;days of the first report. This will be sent no later than an additional 15 calendar days. For AEs that are not fatal or life-threatening, the sponsor will ensure that a SUSAR is reported as soon as possible and in any event not later than 15&#x02009;days after the sponsor is first aware of the event.</p><p>The parents of participants will be provided with 24-h contact details of a study representative if they have concerns about any component of the study or their child&#x02019;s condition. We will also report to the hospital (OLCHC) Risk Management Team and the Drugs Advisory Committee of the study site.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment commenced in April 2012 for the 30 patients needed for the study. It is anticipated patient recruitment will be completed by early 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PSCC, Painful sickle cell crisis; ED, Emergency department; SCD, Sickle cell disease; IN, Intranasal; OLCHC, Our Lady&#x02019;s Children&#x02019;s Hospital Crumlin; MAD, Mucosal atomiser device; CSTAR, Centre for Support and Training in Analysis and Research (HRB); SOP, Standard operating procedure; IV, Intravenous; VAS, Visual analogue score; AE, Adverse event; SAE, Serious adverse event; SUSAR, Suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reaction; IMB, Irish Medicines Board; PI, Principal investigator; GCP, Good clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ROS conceived the study.
