The rationale for our intervention was to avoid the potential adverse effects of immediate stenting when the likelihood of no-reflow might be greatest. Deferred stent implantation might allow time for reduction in coronary thrombus burden and recovery of microvascular function such that the likelihood of no-reflow is reduced. We hypothesized that after initial coronary reperfusion and normalization of coronary blood flow, brief deferral of stenting might reduce the occurrence of no-reflow compared with usual care with immediate stenting and increase myocardial salvage. We investigated this hypothesis in a real-life clinical setting involving STEMI patients treated with primary PCI.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Trial design</title><p>We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial in STEMI patients enrolled at a single center between March 11, 2012, and November 21, 2012.

This time interval was based on a balance between competing benefits and risks. A short minimum period (4 h) was adopted, given our concern about the theoretical time-related risk of coronary reocclusion. In practice, a guideline of at least 8 h was recommended for the deferred PCI to permit the beneficial effects of reperfusion and antithrombotic therapies and so that all patients could be treated between 7:00 <sc>am</sc> and 11 <sc>pm</sc> during the first 24 h of admission to ensure that the second procedure occurred at a time that facilitated a rest period for the patient and the staff. Finally, an upper limit of 16 h was set to minimize any prolongation of the hospital admission.</p><p>The treatment protocol for deferred patients included transfer to the Coronary Care Unit, continuous intravenous infusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy (tirofiban 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) and administration of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 h) for up to 16 h. The radial artery sheath used for PCI was retained or removed according to operator and patient preference. Arterial blood pressure and the radial sheath site were monitored in the Coronary Care Unit. All patients also had continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the Coronary Care Unit.</p><p>Usual care included immediate stenting in the catheter laboratory and intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy for 12 h (tirofiban 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg/min).

Repeat coronary angiography was performed within 30 min and confirmed reocclusion of the culprit artery. The patient received a stent, and his subsequent clinical course was uncomplicated. A second patient who inadvertently had not received low molecular weight heparin therapy in the Coronary Care Unit experienced a reinfarction before stenting.

A&#x000a0;simple approach was adopted for treatment stratification and randomization by the cardiologist. We identified patients with initial evidence of successful reperfusion and with clinical risk factors for no-reflow, and from these patients, the study participants were randomized to immediate stenting or to an intention-to-stent strategy within 4 to 16 h, including prolonged antithrombotic therapy. The strategy of deferred stenting in primary PCI represents a radical change from standard care.</p><p>Our trial provided new knowledge on primary PCI. We observed that deferred completion of PCI in selected STEMI patients reduced no-reflow, distal embolization, and intraprocedural thrombotic complications compared with conventional treatment with immediate stenting. Final coronary flow grade and myocardial blush grade were also better in the deferred stenting group. Two patients in the deferred stenting group experienced early recurrent myocardial infarction before the second procedure. During longer term follow-up, myocardial salvage measured with cardiac MRI was significantly greater in the deferred stenting group. In other words, when indexed to the initial extent of jeopardized myocardium (i.e., the ischemic area at risk), final infarct size was smaller in the patients randomized to deferred PCI. The MRI results obtained after 6 months of follow-up indicate a beneficial treatment effect that was sustained over time. Because myocardial salvage is a prognostically validated therapeutic target in primary PCI <xref rid="bib2 bib9" ref-type="bibr">(2,9)</xref>, the favorable long-term effect of deferred stenting on myocardial salvage is clinically relevant.</p><p>We also found that in the deferred PCI group, the approach to PCI differed at the second procedure compared with the first for the same operator. The maximal stent diameter in the second procedure was 0.5 mm greater and the range of stent length was greater. Three-fourths of patients had an increase in stent diameter. These observations indicate that vessel dimensions are greater at the second procedure compared with the first, in keeping with attenuation of coronary artery tone with time from reperfusion.</p><p>Our trial results reflect a balance of potential benefits and potential risks. The trial was conducted during usual care, and our intervention was based on simple clinical eligibility criteria. The antithrombotic strategy involved a mechanical component (i.e., deferral of stent implantation to avoid/minimize thrombus embolization) and a therapeutic component based on prolonged treatment with low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy during the interval between the first and second PCI procedures. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy is an evidence-based antithrombotic treatment <xref rid="bib2 bib9" ref-type="bibr">(2,9)</xref> and was included in therapeutic strategy to reduce thrombus burden before stent implantation in the deferred stenting group <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">(9)</xref>. Although these treatments also increase the risk of bleeding, no bleeding problems occurred in the deferred stenting group, probably because radial artery access was used in all patients. Accordingly, our strategy has the potential to be widely applicable.</p><p>Our strategy was based on selection of patients with at least 1 clinical and/or angiographic risk factor for no-reflow <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">(4&#x02013;6)</xref>. We believed that the intervention would not be appropriate in &#x0201c;all-comers&#x0201d; for 3 reasons. First, the efficacy of deferred stenting was likely to be greatest in the patients at highest risk of no-/slow-reflow. Second, the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction could not be mitigated in patients who were at low risk of no-reflow on clinical grounds. Third, a strategy that involved all-comers would be difficult to implement due to the large number of additional second procedures. To assess whether clinicians could stratify patients at risk of no-reflow, information on all-comers was collected, and those who were not randomized were included in a registry.</p><p>The clinical risk profiles of the randomized and registry patients differed. Compared with the registry patients, TIMI&#x000a0;thrombus grade 4 and an occluded culprit artery (TIMI flow grade 0/1) were much more common in the trial patients. Greater thrombus burden and an occluded culprit artery are both associated with large infarct size <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">(22)</xref> and an adverse prognosis <xref rid="bib2 bib9" ref-type="bibr">(2,9)</xref>. These baseline differences between randomized and registry patients can be explained by appropriate risk stratification and patient selection by the cardiologists at the time of primary PCI.</p><p>Compared with the randomized trial participants, the no-/slow-reflow rate of 14.5% in the registry was nearly half of the incidence of this event observed in the immediately stented patients and more than double the incidence of no- or slow-reflow in the deferred stenting group. This finding indicates that the patient selection approach correctly identified a subgroup of STEMI patients in whom the incidence of no-/slow-reflow was lower (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Furthermore, the incidence of no-/slow-reflow in the subgroup of registry patients who were eligible for inclusion but not randomized due to patient or physician preference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) was 23.4%, which was very similar to the rate observed in the immediate stenting group. Although the observed rate of no-reflow in the immediate stenting group was lower than predicted, we still observed a significant reduction in the deferred stenting group.</p><p>Our study was performed during normal emergency care. However, as might be expected with a new intervention that represents a radical change from standard care, patient enrollment was influenced by physician preference, and in the absence of clinical evidence to support this strategy, 5 of 13 cardiologists in our primary PCI service did not randomize any patients.</p><p>Thrombus is mechanistically involved in no-reflow, and stent implantation may cause distal embolization of clot and microvascular thrombosis <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">(23)</xref>. Based on the rationale for our intervention, we examined whether coronary thrombus burden might be lower at the start of the second PCI compared with the start of the first procedure (when stenting is normally performed), and this indeed was the case. Furthermore, thrombus in the culprit artery had dissipated during the intervening period. Thus, coronary stent implantation in the deferred stenting group of patients occurred when thrombus burden was less, and so the substrate for distal embolization and microvascular thrombosis had diminished. This may explain the lower incidence of no-reflow in the deferred stenting group.</p><p>Two patients in the deferred stenting group had early recurrent myocardial infarction. One of these patients had a complex culprit lesion with an intramural dissection <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">(24)</xref> and persistently reduced side-branch flow (TIMI grade 1). The other patient was a protocol violation as he had not received low molecular weight heparin after the initial procedure. Both patients were treated with PCI expeditiously and without complication. These events contain learning that should be used to optimize the design of a future clinical trial. For example, persistent flow reduction (TIMI grade 0/1) in the side branch of a culprit bifurcation lesion would be an exclusion criterion. Overall, the balance of the benefit of reduced no-reflow versus the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction needs to be tested in a large multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.</p><p>Therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of&#x000a0;no-reflow have not improved clinical outcomes in large multicenter randomized trials <xref rid="bib2 bib8 bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">(2,8,25&#x02013;27)</xref>.

The strategy involves a balance between competing risks and benefits that merits prospective evaluation in a large clinical trial. On the one hand, we have shown that deferred stenting reduces no-reflow and increases myocardial salvage. On the other hand, there may be an increased risk of early recurrent STEMI. Based on our experience, the design of the intervention should be adapted to further mitigate the risk of early coronary reocclusion (e.g., a patient with side-branch occlusion would not be suitable). A deferred stent strategy involves a second procedure, and so procedure-related costs may be higher. Our study design timed the second procedure 4 to 16 h after the first to keep the second procedure within working hours and thus optimize feasibility. On the other hand, the strategy has the potential to reduce healthcare costs overall by reducing the clinical consequences of no-reflow (e.g., heart failure and its related cost burden). Only a large clinical trial designed to assess patient experience, health outcomes, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness can address these uncertainties.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Investigators and patients were unblinded in our study. For this reason, the primary and secondary outcomes underwent independent analysis blind to treatment group assignment to prevent ascertainment bias. Our initial estimates for the expected incidences of no-/slow-reflow were slightly higher than the observed rates. The reasons for this may be multifactorial and may reflect the effect of core laboratory adjudication over investigator-reported events. Our study design did not include an angiographic control in the immediate stenting group, but we do not think that this is relevant because the occurrence of no-reflow and other angiographic sequelae, such as intraprocedural thrombotic events, is due to the effect of PCI, so additional invasive angiography in the control group seems unnecessary. The minimal delay of 4 h to the second procedure in the deferred stenting group was relatively short and may not have been sufficient time to permit significant reduction in thrombus size. Although 2 patients experienced recurrent STEMI, their outcome was favorable. The rate of recurrent ischemia in the deferred stenting group was low, and, considering the limited sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility that this was due to chance. TIMI frame count was not assessable in several of the angiograms. Because deferred stenting involves a second invasive procedure with radiographic contrast medium, on safety grounds, radial artery access is recommended and advanced peripheral vascular disease and severe renal dysfunction (e.g., glomerular filtration rate&#x000a0;&#x0003c;30 ml/min) should be exclusion criteria. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy and unfractionated heparin were used rather than bivalirudin <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>, and because the former antithrombotic combination therapy almost certainly remains the most common combination used worldwide, we think that our results are generalizable. Our standard-care antiplatelet strategy involved oral clopidogrel given at the time of the first medical contact <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>. Because more effective antiplatelet drug therapies are available, such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>, we postulate that the efficacy and safety of the deferred strategy could be further enhanced with one of these drugs instead of clopidogrel. Some of the clinical characteristics (e.g., time from symptom onset to reperfusion &#x0003e;12 h) and outcomes (e.g., some MRI and electrocardiographic parameters) were numerically, but not statistically, different between treatment groups, which may reflect the limited sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the first time, we conducted a proof-of-concept trial and found that deferred stenting in primary PCI reduced no-reflow and increased myocardial salvage compared with conventional primary PCI with immediate stenting. Two patients had recurrent myocardial infarction, which represents important balancing information on potential risks. The strategy is simple, pragmatic, and potentially widely applicable. Our results support the rationale for a substantive multicenter clinical trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of early deferred completion of PCI after reperfusion versus conventional treatment in STEMI patients at risk of no-reflow.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group

Each patient had similar ischemic times (147 min and 163 min), and both were treated with similar antithrombotic therapies including 300 mg aspirin, 600 mg clopidogrel, 5,000 IU heparin, and intravenous tirofiban. <bold>(A)</bold> Usual care with immediate stenting. The angiogram <bold>(left)</bold> revealed proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (<bold>green arrow</bold>, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 flow). Primary PCI was complicated by no-reflow (TIMI grade 1 flow). Two days later, cardiac MRI was performed. Cine MRI <bold>(middle left)</bold> revealed an extensive anteroapical left ventricular wall motion abnormality. Matched diastolic phase images obtained using late gadolinium enhancement imaging <bold>(middle right)</bold> revealed a transmural infarction with microvascular obstruction <bold>(orange arrows)</bold>. The area at risk revealed by T2-weighted imaging <bold>(right)</bold> was 42.2% of left ventricular mass, and the acute infarct size revealed by late gadolinium enhancement <bold>(middle right)</bold> was 39.6%. Microvascular obstruction depicted as the central dark zone within the infarct territory was 8.2% of the left ventricular mass. The left ventricular ejection fraction and end-systolic volume were 43.7% and 52.3 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Six-month follow-up MRI revealed that the final infarct size was 32.1% of the left ventricular mass, and therefore myocardial salvage was 10.1%. <bold>(B)</bold> Deferred PCI. The angiogram <bold>(left)</bold> revealed a proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (<bold>green arrow</bold>, TIMI grade 0 flow). Primary PCI in the left anterior descending coronary artery with deferred stent implantation was uncomplicated. Two days later, cardiac MRI was performed. Cine MRI <bold>(middle left)</bold> revealed an extensive anteroapical left ventricular wall motion abnormality. Despite similar ischemic times in both patients, this patient had minimal evidence of infarction on late gadolinium enhancement imaging <bold>(middle right)</bold> and no microvascular obstruction. The acute infarct size was 8.4% of the left ventricular mass. The area at risk <bold>(right)</bold> was similar between cases, at 43.1%, as was the left ventricular ejection fraction and normalized end-systolic volume, measured at 43.5% and 57.1 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, consistent with stunned but viable myocardium. Six-month follow-up MRI revealed that the final infarct size was 1.7% of the left ventricular mass, and therefore myocardial salvage was 41.4%.</p></caption><graphic
