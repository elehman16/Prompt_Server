Treatments were administered according to their respective summaries of product characteristics. Of 139 dogs screened, 124 were suitable for study participation: 62 of which were dosed with mavacoxib and 62 with carprofen. Both treatments resulted in a very similar pattern of considerable improvement as indicated in all parameters assessed by both owner and veterinarian. The primary efficacy endpoint &#x02018;overall improvement&#x02019; was a composite score of owner assessments after approximately six weeks of treatment. Both drugs were remarkably effective, with 57/61 (93.4 per cent) of mavacoxib-treated dogs and 49/55 (89.1 per cent) of carprofen-treated dogs demonstrating overall improvement and with mavacoxib's efficacy being non-inferior to carprofen. The treatments had a similar safety profile as evidenced by documented adverse events and summaries of clinical pathology parameters. The positive clinical response to treatment along with the safety and dosing regimen of mavacoxib makes it an attractive therapy for canine osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dogs</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by a degenerative, progressive and irreversible deterioration of joints resulting in a decreased range of motion, pain, joint swelling and crepitus. This disease is estimated to affect 20 per cent of dogs over one year of age (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Johnston 1997</xref>). Chronic locomotor system diseases such as OA result in a 20 per cent reduction of longevity in dogs (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Moreau and others 2003</xref>). The majority of OA cases result from developmental (e.g. hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, shoulder osteochondrosis) and acquired conditions (e.g. articular fractures, cranial cruciate rupture). Until treatment modalities that reverse the disease process are readily available, the goals of therapy are to ameliorate joint pain, delay progression of the disease and restore joints to normal function with an overall increase in the quality of life (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Singh 2003</xref>). While controlled exercise and physical therapy may have their benefits, a major weapon in the armoury of pharmacological agents is the NSAID (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson and others 2009</xref>). Such products exert their anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes of which there are two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. These convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>, from which a series of prostanoids is derived; this can result in sensitisation of nociceptive neurone terminals and with repeated stimulation can lead to hyperalgesia and allodynia.</p><p>Central sensitisation amplifies signals coming from inflamed joints (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Neugebauer and Schaible 1990</xref>) resulting in greater perceived pain; COX-2 contributes to this pain hypersensitivity (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Samad and others 2001</xref>) whereas COX inhibitors can inhibit this process (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Veiga and others 2004</xref>). A recent review from <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Innes and others (2010)</xref> indicates that long-term NSAID treatment in dogs with OA is more efficacious than short-term treatment with no evidence of any increase in side effects. Compliance with long term daily administration of medicines in routine veterinary clinical practice is known to be relatively poor, with daily doses being missed even during a relatively short 10-day treatment course (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Grave and Tanem 1999</xref>). Therefore, long-acting NSAID preparations achieving an increased overall compliance might be more dependable in reducing or preventing central sensitisation. Mavacoxib is an orally administered preferential COX-2 inhibitor which has a long mean half-life of 44&#x02005;days in a typical patient population (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Cox and others 2011</xref>). This long half-life enables monthly dosing after a second loading dose which is administered 14&#x02005;days after the first dose. All other oral NSAIDs approved for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with canine OA are administered on a daily basis.</p><p>This report details the results of a randomised positive-controlled study to gain European regulatory approval with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for mavacoxib. The study evaluated mavacoxib administered orally at 2&#x02005;mg/kg, in comparison with carprofen, for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with OA in dogs under field conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A controlled multi-site study was conducted in compliance with VICH (International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">VICH 2000</xref>) at 12 veterinary practices located throughout France. Approval was obtained from the appropriate regulatory authority in France and satisfied national regulatory and animal welfare standards and requirements. The protocol was subjected to review and satisfied the sponsor's animal welfare and ethical committee. Informed consent was obtained from each one of the dog's owners, or their agents, prior to enrolment.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Animal selection</title><p>Dogs greater than one year of age presenting as veterinary patients with clinical and radiographic signs of OA were evaluated for possible inclusion in the study. At initial presentation, dogs underwent screening procedures to determine study eligibility. Dogs received a complete general physical examination, and blood and urine were collected for routine clinical pathology, including complete blood cell count, serum biochemical profile and urinalysis. The severity of clinical signs of OA was evaluated by both the &#x02018;examining veterinarian&#x02019; and the dog's &#x02018;owner&#x02019;. The dog owner's evaluation focused on three categories; lameness, musculoskeletal pain and quality of life taking into account the condition of the pet over the previous two days. The examining veterinarian also focused on the three categories: general musculoskeletal condition, lameness/weight bearing and pain on palpation/manipulation of joints on the day of the examination. Each dog was evaluated whilst walking and trotting and its gait was assessed whilst turning in a tight circle or whilst going up and down stairs. After completion of the evaluations at exercise, each dog was observed while standing for signs of weakness, asymmetric limb trembling, spasms, and asymmetry of limb carriage or weight bearing, including elevation of limbs contra-lateral to those affected to assess the degree of resistance. Each category was scored with a severity grade from 0 (clinically normal) to 4 (nearly incapacitated) as detailed in Appendix 1.</p><p>Dogs selected for inclusion in the study were considered to be in good general health based on physical examination and clinical pathology results, and had clinical signs of OA as evidenced by positive scores in one or more of the above categories when assessed by both the owner and examining veterinarian at screening and again on day 0 prior to treatment. The presence of OA in at least one of the affected joints was confirmed by radiography.</p><p>Prior to enrolment, dogs had not received any treatment with systemic NSAIDs for at least 30&#x02005;days, short-acting topical or systemic corticosteroids for at least 14&#x02005;days, intermediate or long-acting corticosteroids for 30&#x02005;days, repository anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 120&#x02005;days, intra-articular injections of any type for approximately one year, and disease modifying agents (e.g. glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate or sodium hyaluronate) for at least three weeks. Dogs known or suspected to have gastric or duodenal ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, kidney disease, uncontrolled endocrine disease, congestive heart failure, internal soft tissue injury (e.g. contusions of the abdominal organs as a result of trauma) or bleeding disorders, most of which are also label contraindications or cautions for the use of daily NSAIDs, were excluded from participation. Dogs for which surgical intervention was anticipated, or for which the presenting lameness was known to be related to neoplasia, primary neurological disorder, immunological disorder (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), infection or non-healed fracture, were also excluded from enrolment. Dogs undergoing physical therapy were only eligible for enrolment if, in the opinion of the examining veterinarian, the presenting orthopaedic condition was stable. Dogs on aggressive weight loss programmes, females that were pregnant or lactating, or animals intended for breeding were also excluded from enrolment. Concurrent treatment with topical or systemic anti-inflammatory drugs, or tetracycline class antimicrobials was not permitted during the study. Administration of other concurrent medications was permitted but had to be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Treatments</title><p>Dogs that met the inclusion criteria were allocated to treatment at the time of enrolment by use of a randomised block schedule that was produced in advance of the study. The block size was four, with two mavacoxib-treated and two carprofen-treated dogs in each block. Day 0 was defined as the day of first treatment administration. Each dog received treatment with either mavacoxib (Trocoxil, Zoetis) at 2&#x02005;mg/kg monthly to day 104 with a loading dose administered 14&#x02005;days after the first dose, or carprofen (Rimadyl, Zoetis) at 4&#x02005;mg/kg once daily to day 134. In order to maintain masking of all individuals involved in the study, dogs allocated to treatment with mavacoxib were also administered placebo for carprofen daily for the same duration as mavacoxib treatment, and dogs allocated to treatment with carprofen were also administered placebo for mavacoxib on the same schedule as active mavacoxib. Placebos for mavacoxib and carprofen were the commercial formulations and presentations without the active ingredients.</p><p>Dose calculations for study treatments were performed using the body weight determined during the most recent physical examination. Mavacoxib/mavacoxib placebo tablets were administered either with food or immediately prior to feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assessments</title><p>Following treatment administration on day 0, dogs were re-examined at regular intervals during the study. Owner assessments were performed on day 0 prior to treatment, and thereafter on approximately days 2, 7, 14, 44, 74, 104 and 134. Examining veterinarian assessments were performed on day 0 prior to treatment and thereafter on approximately days 14, 44, 74, 104 and day 134. General physical examinations were also performed on the same days as the examining veterinarian assessments together with collection of blood or blood and urine for analysis. Any abnormal health observations irrespective of their nature and severity made by either owner or veterinarian were recorded according to <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">VICH (2000</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Efficacy outcome measures</title><p>Scores for each of the categories (owner assessment of lameness, musculoskeletal pain and quality of life, and examining veterinarian assessment of lameness/weight bearing, pain on palpation/manipulation of joints and general musculoskeletal condition) were summarised by treatment for each assessment day. For each assessment conducted after day 0, the improvement in each score was determined for each dog.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was based on the owner assessment scores for the categories lameness, musculoskeletal pain and quality of life on day 44 compared with day 0. A successful &#x02018;overall improvement&#x02019; was defined as an improvement in at least one of the three categories of owner assessment with no worsening in either of the other two categories, or improvement in at least two of the three categories with no change or a worsening of the third category. It was predetermined that any dog that was withdrawn from the study due to apparent lack of efficacy or inadequate improvement would be considered a treatment failure. The overall objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority for &#x02018;overall improvement&#x02019; of mavacoxib compared with carprofen using a 15 per cent non-inferiority margin. To assess non-inferiority, a 90% CI was calculated on the difference in the per cent of dogs showing &#x02018;overall improvement&#x02019; between mavacoxib and carprofen treatment groups (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Newcombe 1998</xref>). If the lower bound of the CI was greater than the non-inferiority margin (i.e. &#x02212;15 per cent), then mavacoxib was considered to be non-inferior to carprofen.</p><p>The study results were analysed in two ways. The primary analysis was &#x02018;per-protocol&#x02019;, with data being excluded from the analysis if significant deviations from the study protocol had occurred. The secondary analysis was &#x02018;intent to treat/all randomised animals&#x02019;, in which data from all cases which had been randomised and dosed with either mavacoxib or carprofen on day 0 were included.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Safety outcome measures</title><p>All enrolled dogs that were administered at least one dose of test article were included in the safety summary.

Overall, 62 dogs were treated with mavacoxib (mean age 10.1&#x02005;years) and 62 were treated with carprofen (mean age 9.3&#x02005;years). Dogs were predominantly purebred and the majority were comprised of large/giant breeds. Male, female, neutered male and neutered female dogs were enrolled in each treatment group.</p><p>More than 40 concomitant medications were administered concurrently with either mavacoxib or carprofen during the study.

had a similar good efficacy and safety profile. The increase in patient response up to 44&#x02005;days and the sustained benefit seen throughout the study up to day 134 support the premise that continuous use of NSAIDs over the long-term provides additional benefit in the management of OA as compared with short-term treatment (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Innes and others 2010</xref>). Mansa and others reported that the number of patients improving with carprofen treatment increased between day 14 and day 84 of treatment and that some patients that had improved by day 14 demonstrated further improvement by day 84 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Mansa and others 2007</xref>). Although the patients were unaware that they were receiving an active anti-inflammatory agent, both the owners and the examining veterinarians, who were making assessments, were aware that every dog on study was being positively treated. Consequently, there was the potential for an &#x02018;indirect&#x02019; placebo effect. This potential artefact could have been avoided by having a third treatment group receiving placebo alone. However, as there were recognised active comparators available, providing placebo long-term treatment for a painful condition would be unethical and be contrary to good animal welfare. An alternative approach might have been to have a treatment group that received placebo for a short period initially but one of the aims of this study was to investigate long-term effects. The study reported here was conducted to gain European regulatory approval for mavacoxib; following the guidance of EMA, it was designed as a positive-controlled study to demonstrate that monthly administration of mavacoxib is at least as good as (i.e. non-inferior) daily administration of carprofen. Carprofen was selected as a comparator as it is generally recognised to be effective in practice and its efficacy has been demonstrated in placebo studies, for example, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur and others (1995</xref>) and <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food and Drug administration (1996</xref>). The demonstration of non-inferiority does not automatically imply efficacy (e.g. if the comparator molecule has no proven efficacy and/or the methodology used to assess efficacy is insensitive). Great care has to taken in designing and interpreting the results of &#x02018;non-inferior studies&#x02019; (e.g. magnitude of the non-inferiority margin, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Freise and others 2013</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that there is good evidence from other studies for both mavacoxib's and carprofen's efficacy in negative-controlled studies and/or studies employing objective assessment tools (e.g. <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur and others 1995</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Lees and others 2009</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Walton and others 2014</xref>). Ideally, objective rather than subjective assessment tools should be used for efficacy assessments, that is, force plate analysis. This study was designed as a multi-centre field study and for practical reasons force plate analysis was not possible as the technical equipment is typically only available in clinical research facilities. It has to be acknowledged that the tool used in the study described here was subjective and had not been validated and published but expert opinion was sought and used in its design. There are now a number of validated subjective tools to assess chronic pain in dogs related to OA (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Wiseman-Orr and others 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Brown and others 2008</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Hercock and others 2009</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hielm-Bj&#x000f6;rkmann and others 2009</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Walton and others 2013</xref>), but at the time the study was performed, these subjective tools (LOAD, HCPI, CBPI) were either not yet available or validated. Further, it should be noted that the EMA had previous experience with similar assessment tools to that reported here. Consequently, the authors decided to use the categorical assessment tool described here. It has to be said that the owner assessments in particular may have given a better judgement of the &#x02018;quality of life&#x02019; improvement than a purely objective assessment such as force plate analysis and the categorical assessments are applicable to a more comprehensive set of affected joints.</p><p>The potential &#x02018;indirect placebo effect&#x02019;, non-inferiority comparison and use of a subjective assessment tool might be considered weaknesses in the study design but they represent reasonable compromises that satisfy animal welfare and ethical considerations. The efforts made to ensure blinding of study participants as to which patients received which drug provide a degree of robustness to the study results.</p><p>In this study, all abnormal health observations were recorded in alignment with VICH Good Clinical Practice (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">VICH 2000</xref>). During the course of the study, AEs were reported in 51 dogs (26 mavacoxib-treated and 25 carprofen-treated). This number must be considered in the context of the study, that is, the average age of the dogs at enrolment was more than nine years, owners and investigators were asked to record all abnormal health observations whatever their causality and severity and that the treatment period was four-and-a-half months during which it would not be unusual for dogs of this age to present with some abnormal health observations. Adverse reactions affecting the digestive tract, the renal and the hepatic systems have been described for NSAIDs in general approved in veterinary medicine. However, in this study, a &#x02018;probable&#x02019; causality assessment was only attributed to one case, a carprofen-treated patient.</p><p>Review of all AEs recorded in the study indicates that the profile of AEs in mavacoxib-treated dogs is generally similar with regard to type, severity and duration to that seen in dogs dosed daily with carprofen. As the study was designed to provide adequate power for the &#x02018;overall improvement&#x02019; calculation but not sufficiently powered to detect statistical differences in AEs, a statistical analysis was not conducted. It is worth noting that the aforementioned AEs were similar whether the treatments could be discontinued, thereby rapidly reducing drug exposure (daily, carprofen) or not (monthly, mavacoxib). Indeed, all &#x02018;digestive tract disorders&#x02019; reported in mavacoxib-treated patients were very transient despite continued mavacoxib exposure (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="VETREC2014102397TB3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref> for more details).</p><p>In this study, the monthly administration of mavacoxib achieved at least the same anti-inflammatory effects as did the daily administration of carprofen without an increase in the incidence and severity of suspect adverse reactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the investigators and their assistants along with the statisticians who worked on this project.
