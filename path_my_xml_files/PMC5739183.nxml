Research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer (PC) patients&#x02019; side effects has been lacking. Our primary goal was to determine the feasibility of recruiting PC patients on a clinical trial of yoga while they underwent external beam radiation therapy (RT). <italic>Methods.</italic> Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the RT course (6-9 weeks). Baseline demographic information was collected. Feasibility was declared if 15 of the first 75 eligible PC patients approached (20%) were successfully accrued and completed the intervention. Additional end points included standardized assessments of fatigue, erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence (UI), and quality of life (QOL) at time points before, during, and after RT. <italic>Results.</italic> Between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible PC patients were identified. 23 patients (34%) declined, and 45 (56%) consented to the study. 18 (40%) were voluntarily withdrawn due to treatment conflicts. Of the remaining 27, 12 (30%) participated in &#x02265;50% of classes, and 15 (59%) were evaluable. Severity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability, with fatigue increasing by week 4, but then improving over the course of treatment (<italic>P</italic> = .008). ED, UI, and general QOL scores demonstrated reassuringly stable, albeit not significant trends. <italic>Conclusions.</italic> A structured yoga intervention of twice-weekly classes is feasible for PC patients during a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient radiotherapy. Preliminary results are promising, showing stable measurements in fatigue, sexual health, UI, and general QOL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>yoga</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>radiation therapy</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735415617022"><title>Introduction</title><p>For most cancer patients, the most common side effects of both the underlying disease and its oncological treatment are pain, depression, and fatigue.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is defined as &#x0201c;a common, persistent, and subjective sense of tiredness related to cancer or to treatment of cancer that interferes with usual functioning.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> CRF differs from so-called &#x0201c;everyday life&#x0201d; fatigue, which is generally temporary and can be relieved by rest or sleep.

The interference items include general activity, mode, walking ability, normal work (includes both work outside the home and housework), relations with others, and enjoyment of life.

Patients rate all items using a 5-point rating scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>very much</italic>. The measure yields information about total QOL as well as information about the dimensions of physical well-being and disease-specific concerns. FACT-G takes about 5 minutes to complete and has been written at the sixth grade level.</p><p>The International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire (IIEF-5), also referred to as the Sexual Health inventory for Men, was used to assess ED. Scores range from 0 to 25, with scores &#x0003e;21 indicating normal erectile function and scores &#x0003c;12 indicating moderate to severe ED. The International Prostate Symptom Score Sheet (IPSS) was used to determine the severity of urinary symptoms. Scores on this scale range from 0 to 35, where a score of 8 to 19 indicates moderately symptomatic and 20 to 35, severely symptomatic.

We hoped to detect 80% participation in the study intervention, defined as twice-weekly yoga class attendance throughout the entire radiation course.

Two-thirds of the men approached were initially very enthusiastic and willing to take part in the yoga program. However, almost entirely because of conflicts between the radiation treatment times and the available yoga class schedule, one-third of the patients who started the program were unable to attend the requisite minimum number of yoga classes. Resource limitations in terms of staffing and room availability restricted the number and timing of yoga classes offered. Radiation treatment machine malfunction leading to unpredictable delays, severe inclement weather, and long travel time to and from the hospital were among the main issues that prevented enrolled patients from attending the twice-weekly classes offered at the hospital. But even despite these issues, the study met our stringent definition of feasibility in this pilot study, in which we mandated a 20% rate of evaluable patients. Typical clinical trial enrollment rates among cancer patients have historically been reported to be as low as 3%<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>; our rate of enrollment was a surprising 66%, despite the prevailing perception that &#x0201c;old men don&#x02019;t do yoga.&#x0201d; According to a published national survey of yoga practitioners, we estimate that a little less than 7% of the adult yoga practitioner population comprises men older than 44 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="bibr38-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr39-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Even after removing the study patients who had to be withdrawn early for noncompliance, our rate of enrollment of eligible patients was nearly 40%. Furthermore, we found that all the selected Eischens yoga poses were well tolerated by this patient population and were approached with good will and, at times, a good sense of humor. Most yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class; on finishing the yoga program and concluding their involvement in the study, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs.</p><p>Thus far, we have also observed the potential for improvement of CRF with this yoga intervention for PC patients undergoing active radiation treatment. The levels of fatigue that are normally expected to increase midtreatment (weeks 4 to 5) stayed unchanged, and the severity of the fatigue&#x02014;the ability to lead normal work and social lives&#x02014;went to pretreatment levels. These results are consistent with early studies that demonstrated the ability of yoga interventions to reduce fatigue symptoms in breast cancer survivors.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735415617022" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Albeit from nonrandomized data, our findings demonstrate a potential positive signal for improvement in urinary symptoms in patients undergoing radiation treatment for PC. Although the severity of the urinary symptoms expectedly increased during the course of RT, the QOL associated with urinary symptoms stayed unchanged, with lower scores at the range of &#x0201c;pleased to mostly satisfied.&#x0201d; Regarding male sexual health, with the exception of 1 patient who reported no ED, most patients had mild-moderate (IIEF-5 12-16) or moderate (IIEF-5 8-11) ED. At present, we can only report stability in sexual function among those participating in the yoga intervention during radiation treatment. Further follow-up and comparison with non-yoga-participating controls are necessary. Overall, QOL parameters were maintained throughout the treatment, with the exception of a statistically significant decline in emotional well-being. This initial decline (weeks 1 to 4) stabilized with the continuation of the yoga sessions. Because most patients reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, one hypothesis is that the emotional burden of daily radiation treatments was harder to overcome during the first half of radiation treatment, but its negative effect decreased, and emotional well-being stabilized as patients became increasingly proficient with their yoga practice.</p><p>There are several limitations to the present study. The small sample size of this pilot study and lack of a control arm negates the ability to exclude an argument that the findings were caused by a placebo effect. Furthermore, this study was not designed to follow the participants&#x02019; sustainability with any structured yoga practice and subsequently measure the long-term effects (over a period of 1 to 3 years) of RT on ED and UI and, thus, QOL. Finally, attention and social support from other group members and/or instructors may have biased the treatment effect and may have added to the overall mental and emotional well-being of the participants.</p><p>Fortunately, because our pilot feasibility criteria have been met, this study has continued seamlessly to a randomized phase II design. Future analysis of data from the full complement of yoga and non&#x02013;yoga participants in the randomized phase of the study will permit more detailed evaluation of the impact of a yoga intervention on fatigue, UI, ED, and overall QOL. Until then, our study does strongly suggest that PC patients, a population perhaps not traditionally believed to have great interest in integrative and complementary therapies because of stereotypes of age and gender, may in fact prove to be a viable and attractive audience for such targeted interventions. At a minimum, the preliminary work presented here underscores the fact that PC patients have a clinically and emotionally significant need for symptomatic management of fatigue and pelvic floor compromise during cancer therapy and that nonmedical approaches should be considered in this setting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by an American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1534735415617022"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
