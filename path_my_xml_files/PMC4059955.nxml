cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic disorders. There is a close relationship between elevated
androgen plasma levels and the ultrasound findings of stromal hypertrophy. In randomized trials,
the administration of metformin has been shown to be followed by an improvement in insulin
sensitivity and decrease in androgen levels in most women. In the present study, we investigate the
association between reduced ovarian volume in PCOS patients after administration of metformin
with improvement in CV risk factors.
</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p> This was a randomized clinical trial study. A total of 28 women
diagnosed with PCOS who referred to the infertility clinic were selected. Anthropometric
characteristics of the patients, mean ovarian volume and plasma levels of fasting blood sugar
(FBS), lipid profile, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol,
testosterone, 17-&#x003b1;-OH progesterone (17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS),
C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine (Hcy) were evaluated before and after treatment
with 500 mg metformin, three times daily for three months. Statistics were calculated with
the aid of SPSS 16.0 with student&#x02019;s paired t- and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient tests.
Significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> There were significant reductions in mean ovarian volume and body mass index
(BMI), in addition to CRP, Hcy, testosterone, FBS, HDL and LDL levels. There was a positive
correlation between mean ovarian volume and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).After treatment, there
correlation noted with reduction in mean ovarian volume and decreased BMI, in addition to
reductions in CRP, LDL, Hcy and testosterone levels.

endocrine disorder associated with characteristic
features including hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance
and obesity, which profoundly impact a
woman&#x02019;s reproductive life (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PCOS is a syndrome
of ovarian dysfunction. Its cardinal features
are hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Its clinical manifestations may include
menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess
and obesity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Women with PCOS are known
to be at higher risk for hypertension and diabetes,
and several studies have pointed to their having
a greater degree of atherosclerosis compared to
women of comparable age. This finding is reflected
in increased coronary calcium, increased carotid
intima-media thickness and endothelial dysfunction
(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Abnormalities exist in PCOS patients, including
dyslipidemia (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), insulin resistance and
elevations in homocysteine (Hcy) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), C-reactive
protein (CRP) and other markers of inflammation
(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although some of these abnormalities may be
expected in the obese population, and obesity is
more prevalent in women with PCOS, these risks have also been found in non-obese PCOS women
and at a younger age (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Insulin-lowering agents
such as metformin have been shown to improve
insulin sensitivity, hyperandrogenism, menstrual
pattern and ovulatory function in obese and nonobese
women with PCOS (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). There is a close relationship
between elevated plasma androgen levels,
ultrasound findings of stromal hypertrophy and increased
ovarian volume. In randomized trials, the
administration of metformin was followed by decreased
androgen levels in most women (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We
conducted this study to investigate the association
between reductions in ovarian volume in PCOS
patients after the administration of metformin with
improved cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee

defined as the presence of polycystic ovaries on
transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS); more than 12
cysts (2-9 mm in diameter in one plane in at least
one ovary) and increased stroma, usually combined
with increased ovarian volume &#x0003e;10 ml; clinical or
biochemical hyperandrogenism with at least one
of the following symptoms: oligomenorrhea or
amenorrhea; and clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism
such as hirsutism and acne, Anovulation
was defined as the presence of amenorrhea or
oligomenorrhea (cycle length greater than 35 days)
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Pretreatment inclusion criteria also included
normal prolactin concentration, thyroid, renal and
hematological indices. No participant was treated
with metformin within three months prior to study
entry.</p><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>
Exclusion criteria included concurrent hormone
therapy within the previous six weeks, any chronic
disease that interfered with the absorption, distribution,
metabolism or excretion of metformin
and the presence of renal or liver disease. Patients
with significant systemic disease were excluded.
Smokers, those taking sex hormones or drugs effecting
insulin secretion, clomiphene citrate, intense
physical activity, as well as the loss of 3 kg
of body weight two months prior to study entry
were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>
Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences
were measured. Because of the impact of body fat
distribution on androgen levels and glucose metabolism,
waist-to-hip ratios (WHR) were measured.
Waist circumference was determined as the
minimum value between the iliac crest and the lateral
costal margin, whereas hip circumference was
determined as the maximum value over the buttocks.
The cut-off point for high WHR for women
was set at 0.80. Body weight was measured using
analogue scales in light clothing; height was
measured barefoot using a stadiometre. BMI (kg/
m2) was calculated to assess obesity and WHR assessed
body fat distribution. Obesity was defined
as BMI &#x02265;30 and overweight as BMI from 25 to
29.9 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Ovarian morphology was assessed in all
subjects by same technician who used an Emperor
2800 6.5 MHz endovaginal probe. The ultrasound
examination was performed on the same day as the
blood samples were obtained.</p><p>Ovarian volume was calculated for each ovary using
the formula for a prolate ellipsoid: &#x003c0;/6 &#x000d7; (D1 &#x000d7;
D2 &#x000d7; D3), where D1-D3 represent the maximum
diameter in the transverse, antero-posterior and
longitudinal axes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The mean ovarian volume
was calculated by adding the sizes of each ovary
and then dividing by two. No patient showed a
dominant follicle (over 12 mm mean diameter) or
cysts (over 30 mm mean diameter) in the ovaries.
All women were studied during the early follicular
phase of their menstrual cycle and in amenorrheic
women after progesterone withdrawal. Physical
examination was performed in each person by a
physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical assays</title><p>
Venous blood samples were collected from all
patients after 12 hours of overnight fasting. Samples were centrifuged immediately and serum was
stored at -20&#x000b0;C until assayed for total testosterone,
estradiol, 17-&#x003b1;-OH progesterone (17OHP), luteinizing
hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH), estradiol, testosterone, 17-&#x003b1;-OH progesterone
(17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
(DHEAS), C-reactive protein (CRP), Hcy, lipid
profiles and fasting blood sugar (FBS).</p><p>All patients received 1500 mg metformin per day
(500 mg, three times daily) for three months. All
women were urged to maintain the same diet as
before treatment and were checked monthly. No
severe side effects were reported during the study.
After three months of treatment, patients were
reevaluated clinically, biochemically and hormonally.
All measurements were performed using the
ChemWell&#x000ae; Analyzer, unless otherwise stated.
FBS (mg/dl) was determined by the glucose oxidase
color method (Glucose GOD-PAP). Total cholesterol
(mg/dl) was determined by enzymatic photometric
(CHOD-PAP) precipitation of low density
lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein
(VLDL) and chylomicrons. High density lipoprotein
(HDL) (mg/dl) was measured by magnesiumphosphotungstate
precipitation, and precipitation
of LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons. LDL-C (mg/dl)
levels were calculated by the Friedewald formula.
Total testosterone (ng/dl), 17OHP (ng/ml), estradiol
(pg/ml), LH (mlu/ml), FSH (mlu/ml), DHEAS
(&#x003bc;g/ml), CRP (mg/l) and Hcy (&#x003bc;mol/l) were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>
Statistics were calculated by the SPSS version 16.0
with student&#x02019;s paired t-test. Significance was set at
p&#x0003c;0.05. The correlations between mean ovarian
volume with androgen levels, BMI, triglyceride
(TG), LDL, CRP, Hcy and WHR were tested by
applying Pearson's correlation coefficient using bivariate
analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were 28 PCOS patients with a mean age
25.67 &#x000b1; 8.54 years who participated in this study.
In patients, the following PCOS signs and symptoms
were noted: hirsutism (75%), acne (50%) and
acantosis nigricans (39.3%). Regular menstruation
was seen in 7 (25%) patients, 18 (64.3%) had oligomenorrhea
and 3 (10.7%) had amenorrhea. After
treatment, 17 women (65.38%) had regular menstrual
cycles.</p><p>No patients had BP &#x02265;130/85. Laboratory analysis
showed that 22 (78.57%) had a TG _&#x02265;150mg/dl
and 12 women (42.85%) had HDL levels &#x02264;50mg/
dl, however no patients had impaired FBS. A WHR
ratio &#x02265;0.85 was seen in 4 cases (14.28%) and there
was a positive correlation between mean ovarian
volume and WHR (r=0.547, p=0.003).</p><p>Twenty-one patients (75%) had sonographic characteristics
of polycystic ovary and 17 women
(60.71%) had a mean ovarian volume greater than
10 ml.</p><p>According to BMI, there were 7 (25%) obese patients,
15 (53.57%) overweight and 6 (21.42%)
who were in the normal BMI range. Positive correlations
were noted between mean ovarian volume
and BMI (r=0.589, p=0.001), and testosterone
levels and BMI (r=0.663, p=0.000).</p><p>Anthropometric characteristics of PCOS patients
before and after treatment are listed in table 1.
Weight, BMI and mean ovarian volume were significantly
different before and after treatment in
PCOS patients, but there was no significant difference
in WHR and BP. After treatment, baseline
FSH was higher, however decreases were seen in
LH, DHEAS, 17OHP, estradiol and testosterone
levels.</p><p>The lipid profile, Hcy, FBS and CRP in PCOS
patients significantly reduced after three months
treatment with metformin. Hcy was more than the
desired level (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) in 15 cases (53.57%),
but not more than the upper limit of normal (5-16
&#x003bc;mol/l) in any of the patients. All patients had
positive CRP (&#x02265;3mg/l). Twenty-one PCOS women
(75%) had testosterone levels more than the
95th percentile. Table II lists the main hormonal
and metabolic profile before and after metformin
treatment in PCOS patients.</p><p>There was a positive correlation between reduction
in ovarian volume and decreases in CRP
(r=0.603, p=0.001), LDL (r=0.436, p=0.026) and
Hcy levels (r=0.479, p=0.013) after three months
of treatment with metformin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ovarian volume correlated to BMI and thus
suggested a possible relationship between ultrasound
findings and anthropometric characteristics.
In our findings, the prevalence of obesity,
high androgen, CRP, Hcy levels and existence of
metabolic syndrome within patients with larger
ovarian volumes was higher than in PCOS patients
with normal ovarian volumes. This finding
possibly confirmed an interaction between ovarian
morphology and volume, and anthropometric
characteristics. We hypothesized that patients with
larger ovarian volumes were more insulin resistant;
this would explain the higher BMI, androgen
and CV risk factors. Metformin administration was associated with reduced ovarian volume and
this reduction had a positive correlation with the
decrease in CV risk factors.</p><p>Hyperinsulinemia stimulates the development of
antral follicles, increasing the sensitivity of granulosa
cells to FSH, thus increasing the numbers of
follicles and ovarian volume (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Morin-Papunen
et al. have reported no significant changes in mean
volumes of the right and left ovaries, two and four
to six months after metformin therapy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In our
study, the mean ovarian volume significantly decreased
after three months of metformin administration,
which was similar to a study by Bayrak
et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) who noted significant improvement in
polycystic ovarian morphology after acute metformin
therapy. In their study, patients took oral
metformin at a dose of 850 mg per day for one
week.</p><p>The results of our study, which are also in agreement
with Genazzani et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), Zeyneloglu et al.
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and Banaszewska et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), may provide evidence
for the efficacy of metformin in modulating
ovarian activity. Therefore, we conclude that metformin
in PCOS patients may cause decreases in
ovarian volume by decreasing intra-ovarian stromal
androgens, even in a relatively short time such
as three months. Women with PCOS have many
abnormalities in lipid profiles. Hyperandrogenism
probably plays a role in these abnormalities, but
hyperinsulinemia seems to be the more dominant
influence (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this study, PCOS patients had
impaired lipid profiles as seen by increased levels
of TG, cholesterol and LDL, and low levels of
HDL. After three months of metformin administration,
there was a beneficial effect on the lipid
profile, as also confirmed by Santana et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and
Lord et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is seen in 40% to 50% of women with
PCOS. This obesity is usually of the android type,
with an increased WHR (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this research,
most cases were obese or overweight. A significant
reduction in BMI was seen after three months of
metformin administration, which was also similar
to studies by Kolodziejczyk et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and Santana
et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>A moderately increased total plasma Hcy concentration
is associated with an increased risk of
atherosclerosis. Elevations of Hcy can be due to
demographic, genetic, nutritional or metabolic factors.
Hyperhomocysteinemia induces sustained
injury to the arterial endothelial cell, which accelerates
the development of thrombosis and atherosclerosis
(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Wijeyaratne et al. declared that Yarali first reported
a significant elevation of plasma Hcy among PCOS
subjects when compared with older BMI-matched
controls. This correlated with echocardiographic
evidence of diastolic dysfunction (considered as
an early marker of CAD), plasma insulin and uric
acid; thus linking hyper homocysteinemia with
the insulin resistance of PCOS. Also they declared
that Loverro et al. reported significantly greater
plasma Hcy in a group of 35 women with PCOS
when compared with age-matched controls and
conversely, Morgante et alreported no difference in
plasma Hcy inwomen with PCOS, although their
study had fewer patients. Also they reported the results
of Schachter et al. study on 150 women with
PCOS, of whom 53.5% were insulin resistant, and
reported a significant elevation of fasting plasma
Hcy that correlated with insulin resistance (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction in PCOS was documented
both by decreased response to vasodilation and
by the finding of increased levels of endothelin-1
in insulin-resistant PCOS patients and increased
oxidative stress markers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Possibly, these findings
were due to increased Hcy levels. In study by
Wulffel&#x000e9; et al. in patients with type 2 diabetes who
underwent 16 weeks of treatment with metformin,
reductions in the levels of folate and vitamin
B12 resulted in a modest increase in Hcy (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In
research by Palomba et al., metformin exerted a
slight, but significant deleterious effect on serum
Hcy levels in patients with PCOS. Supplementation
with folate increased the beneficial effect of
metformin on vascular endothelium (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In a study
by Schachter et al. in 2007, 102 women with insulin-
resistant PCOS were randomized to treatment
with a vitamin B preparation, metformin, or both,
in conjunction with standard infertility treatment.
Plasma Hcy levels were significantly reduced by
both B vitamins and metformin, but to a greater
degree by B vitamins. Higher pregnancy rates were
associated with vitamin B treatment (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Badawy et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) declared that Sills et al. reported
different results, with no correlation between
PCOS and Hcy. However, they recruited
women only according to ultrasound criteria for
the diagnosis of PCOS,thus they possibly evaluated
a different group ofpatients from those of
other studies. Also they reported the results of
Kilic-Okman et al. study with no correlation between
insulin resistance and elevated Hcy. They
suggested thatHcy elevation in PCOS patients was
independent of insulin resistance and due to another
factor. This study included a small number
of patients with PCOS (29 patients). Badawy et
al also reported Rosolova et al. findings:an unexpected
inverse relationship between insulin resistance
and serum Hcy levels in healthy participants.</p><p>This increase in Hcy levels may be explained by
the fact that metformin affects folate and vitamin
B levels by decreasing their absorption from the
gut, which significantly increases Hcy levels (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
In a research by Sahin et al. in patients with type
2 diabetes, metformin was shown to reduce folate
and vitamin B12 levels, but increased Hcy. Conversely,
rosiglitazone decreased Hcy levels during
this time period (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In a prospective case-control
study performed by Salehpour et al. on 85 PCOS
women and 83 controls matched by BMI, Hcy levels
were elevated in the PCOS population (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We
have suggested that these controversial results may
be related to differences in definitions of PCOS,
insulin resistance, Hcy cut-off levels as well as differences
in the study populations. Decreasing Hcy
levels in our study may be due to administration of
folic acid (5 mg, orally) during the study. In this
study, more than half of PCOS patients had plasma
Hcy levels over the desired level, which decreased
after administration of metformin.</p><p>Many PCOS patients may also have an increase in
subclinical atherosclerotic disease, as suggested by
greater carotid intima media thickness and higher
levels of coronary calcifications (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Birdsall et
al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) studied the association between PCOS
and coronary artery disease in 143 women, aged
60 years or younger, who were undergoing cardiac
catheterization. PCOS was detected in 42%
of the patients. Those patients with PCOS more
frequently exhibited coronary artery segments
with greater than 50% stenosis and more severe
ischemic heart disease compared to women with
normal ovaries. Previous reports have referred to
CRP levels greater than 5 mg/liter whereas more
recent studies have shown CRP levels greater than
3 mg/l that correlate to CVD. A recent prospective
study has linked menstrual irregularity, about 80%
of which is attributed to PCOS, to an increased risk
of mortality due to fatal CAD. In study based on
findings in 210 subjects (116 PCOS patients and
94 controls),the finding of the preliminary study
by Kelly et al. was confirmed (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) despite different
inclusion criteria. This suggests that CRP may
be a marker for possible prospective identification
of young PCOS women prone to develop CVD in
the future, despite the fact that none of the PCOS
patients had any signs of inflammation.</p><p>Metformin improves insulin sensitivity. Metformin
may improve ovulation and menstrual cycles, and
reduce ovarian volume. It may decrease circulating
androgen levels, thus addressing the traditional
goals of long-term treatment. Available clinical
evidence supports the use of metformin as a protective
measure against the adverse CV effects of
insulin resistance and insulin excess (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Existing data support the importance of increased
CV and metabolic risks in hyperandrogenic women
with classic features of PCOS (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Metformin
can reduce androgen production by lowering insulin
and maybe by a direct inhibitory effect on
ovarian androgen production by decreasing ovarian
volume. Decreasing ovarian volume may have
a positive correlation with improvements of CV
risk factors. Larger-scale studies are needed to
confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Financial supports from the University of Medical
