exercise on the trunk functions of chronic low back pain patients. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-four patients with chronic low back pain were randomly divided into groups of
respiratory effort and trunk stabilization exercises. The exercises were performed for 45
minutes, 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Spinal stabilization was measured as the
compensation of thesagittal angle joint in relation to the lumbar external load. [Results]
After the intervention, the forced breathing and stabilization exercise groups showed a
significant difference in lumbar spine stabilization between the first and second stress
tests and the control group also showed a significant difference after the intervention.
The M1 and M2 tests of lumbar spine stabilization revealed no significant differences
between the groups. [Conclusion] The results of this research demonstrate that forced
breathing exercise therapy is effective at improving the trunk stability and daily living
activities of chronic low back pain patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Forced breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The lability of lumbar segments following degenerative disc disease and decreased muscle
control ability are important factors in lumbago. Accordingly, active trunk muscle
stabilization exercises for the lability of lumbar segments are widely used in clinical
practice<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spinal stability is derived
from simultaneous activities of the trunk muscles, and active simultaneous contractions are
required to improve the spinal stability of lumbago patients with unstable lumbar
segments<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced mobility of vertebral joints generates excessive stress or
increased mobility of the joints; moreover, if the surrounding muscles cannot properly
regulate this increased mobility, lability can occur<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This epidemiological mechanism can manifest in various forms in all
vertebral joints and can strongly influence functional changes of the spinal column. Lumbago
patients who remain seated for long periods or have poor posture have a higher probability
of kyphosis of the back joints and decreased flexibility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; these lead to inefficient muscle tone of the spinal trunk and
induce abnormal muscle compensation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the trunk muscles, the respiratory muscles, internal oblique, abdominal muscles, back
fibers, and spinal multifidus stabilize the spine. The pelvic floor muscles also influence
spinal stability by cooperating with the trunk muscles to generate abdominal pressure<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The transversus abdominis moves up and down while breathing and is
the most important muscle required for blocking inspiration among the various muscles that
contribute to spinal stabilization. Moreover, as the transversus abdominis is an expiratory
muscle, it also increases abdominal pressure. Both muscles work by cooperating with the
pelvic floor muscles. Thus, regarding the function of the trunk muscles, the simultaneous
contraction and coordinated movement of the diaphragm, transversus abdominis, and pelvic
floor muscle are the most important and basic elements of spinal stabilization and can be
directly affected by forced breathing exercises. Furthermore, the movement of the spine
joints, including the ribs, which are involved in the movement of the trunk joints, can also
be affected through forced breathing exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In healthy adults, stable inspiration depends on the active contraction of the diaphragm
and intercostal muscles. Stable expiration occurs as a passive process because of the
elastic recoil caused by the relaxation of the inspiratory muscles. Forced respiration can
be actively enhanced and accompanied by additional muscular contraction in the inspiratory
and expiratory reserve volumes excluding one respiratory volume among vital capacity. Forced
inspiration requires the mobilization of additional muscles such as the serratus posterior
superior, serratus posterior inferior, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum,
pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, sternocleidomastoid, and primary inspiratory muscles to
increase the speed and volume of the inhaled air. Forced expiration requires the active
contraction of the four abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, external oblique muscle,
internal oblique muscle, transverse abdominis) to rapidly decrease the volume inside the
thorax<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sapsford reported that after simultaneous contraction of the
pelvic floor and transversus abdominis, the lumbar lesion stabilizes during deep
breathing<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study used a
kinesitherapeutic approach to determine the effects of forced breathing exercises, which
regulate respiratory frequency and breathing capacity, on the spinal stabilization of
lumbago patients during activities such as lifting heavy objects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 24 adults living in Gwangju aged 20&#x02013;40&#x02005;years with
intermittent chronic lumbago (&#x0003c;VAS 4) who did not have lumbar surgery experience,
inflammatory spinal disease, spinal deformities, or neurologic radiating pain. The subjects
were unable to perform muscular movements of the spinal trunk or cardiopulmonary exercise
within one month of the study and did not receive any pathological diagnosis regarding the
respiratory system. All subjects provided their informed consent to participation in this
study. The subjects were randomly assigned the following two groups: the forced breathing
exercise plus trunk stabilization exercise group and the trunk stabilization exercise group.
The experimental period was 6 weeks, and a total of 18 exercise sessions were performed.</p><p>A SPIRO TIGER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Idiag, Switzerland) was used for the forced breathing exercises.
For respiratory muscle endurance training, the mouthpiece and respirator bag are connected
by a pipe. There is a ventilation outlet between the pipe so that inflows and outflows of
air pass through the vent during breathing. The tube handle is connected to the machine body
by a cable. The main body has a mark and signal tone that gives visual and acoustic feedback
for inhalation and exhalation, and can regulate and show the number of breaths per minute
(65&#x02013;10 times at maximum) and time (maximum, 99 minutes); it also prevents dizziness
following forced respiration by regulating appropriate inflows and outflows of gas.</p><p>The trunk stabilization exercise started with deep contraction without external resistance
and changed to isometric exercise through external resistance (i.e., at the end of the body
or band). The change in dynamic movement as well as the position and direction of the lever
were based on changes from the proximal to distal and vertical to horizontal directions as
well as the motor developmental condition. The exercise followed basic principles, that
changing the supporting surface from bodyweight ratio load to a weight-bearing position<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first- and second-stage training
contents were based on a 3-stage special exercise intervention for new motor skills
acquisition involving decrease of the deep muscle control capacity of lumbago patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The first training stage was carried out by bending the knees while in the supine, lying
sideways, prone, and crawling positions as well as sitting in a chair and standing on both
feet. The neutral position of the spine was found through control of the pelvis without use
of large muscles. The subjects were trained to perform the simultaneous contraction of the
pelvic floor and transversus abdominis with diaphragmatic respiration. The contraction
maintenance time was 10&#x02013;60 seconds, and 5&#x02013;10 sets were performed. The exercise times were 15
and 30 minutes for the experimental and control groups, respectively, and the intervention
was conducted 6 times over 2 weeks. The weight support position of the subjects was trained
by applying posture correction. The second-stage training involved bending the knees and
pulling down elastic bands in a supine position, lifting the legs up while lying sideways,
lifting dumbbells with both hands in a prone position, standing up from sitting on a chair,
and squatting while lifting both arms in a standing position. The posture maintenance
exercise was 10&#x02013;30 seconds, each exercise was repeated 10&#x02013;30 times per set, and 5&#x02013;10 sets
were performed. The exercise times for the experimental and control groups were 30 and 45
minutes per session respectively, and the exercises were performed 12 times over 4 weeks.
During a total of 6 weeks of training, the break time between each set was one-half of the
set exercise time, and the break time between exercises was 1 minute. The load test and a
spinal mouse were used to measure vertebral joint stabilization. In the load test, the
patients held a weight that was 3% of their body weight in both hands while standing
comfortably with the shoulders flexed at 90&#x000b0; with their elbows spread. The first measurement
was made by tracing the spine with a spinal analyzer. The same posture was maintained, and
the second measurement was made by using the same method 15 seconds later. The measurement
was performed by dragging the spinal analyzer across the spinous processes from the 7th
cervical spine to the 3rd sacral vertebra. The stability of the vertebral joints was
determined through two measurements of the thoracolumbar spine compensatory sagittal plane
angle before and after exercise. Data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version
22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between the groups were tested using one-way
ANOVA, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test when difference were
detected. The statistical significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05. This study was conducted
after receiving approval regarding its safety, procedures, and ethics from the Research
Ethics Committee of Dongshin University (BM-004-01).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristic of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FBS group (n=12)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ST group (n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.8 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.5 &#x000b1; 1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.0 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.1 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.6 &#x000b1; 3.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.0 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.8 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.7 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SE.

posture and the balance of the spinal trunk under an external load. These compensatory
contractions affect not only the lumbar region, but also the cervical-shoulder and
sternocostal areas. Clinically, early on, excessive muscle contraction usually persists in a
location where there is joint lability. Subsequently thereafter, patients are unable to
maintain a position for a long time and frequently adjust their support posture because of
pain. Chronic lumbar pain patients with spinal lability eventually develop joint lability in
many areas, which reduces movement through overall physical dysfunction. In turn, this
decreases physical muscular endurance including activities of daily living and causes
cardiopulmonary problems<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A state of local lability in the thoracolumbar spine is
common in chronic lumbago patients. It can be explained by a state of decline and impairment
in the neurological and epidemiological capacity of such patients. The stabilization of the
trunk requires increased activity of the deep muscles that control various segments as well
as motor control for harmonious muscle mobilization of the large muscles and joints that
function in the sacral region<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Enhancement of simultaneous contractile ability and muscular power can relieve pain and
allow stable functioning in everyday life through abdominal pressure and trunk muscle
strength improvements<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
stabilization tests revealed there was a significant difference between the experimental and
control groups as well as decreased lumbar extension angle at the initial examination after
stress even in examinations performed after a considerable amount of time. Regarding the
lability of the lumbar segments, the clinical signs of the extension pattern cause excessive
contraction of the erector muscle increasing lordosis, impairing the mutual contractility of
the spinal multifidus and transversus abdominis, and decreasing the respiratory function of
the diaphragm. Regarding lumbar stabilization, the forced breathing exercises decreased the
extension angle, eventually improved the breathing pattern, and stimulated the abdominal
muscles. Therefore, the lumbar spine became more stable overall in the neutral zone due to
hypertonic suppression of the spinal extensor muscles and decreased lordosis. The findings
of the lumbar spinal stabilization tests exhibit the same pattern as those of the lumbar
spine. For functional and anatomic reasons, the forced breathing exercises stimulate the
abdominal wall and stabilized the intrathoracic pressure. Also, the transverse abdominis
muscle and external oblique, and erector spinae muscles played an important role in
controlling vertebral shearing forces. Therefore, these exercises helped stabilize the
dorsal spine in response to an external load<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study showed that forced breathing exercises performed by chronic lumbago patients
decreased the thoracolumbar spine sagittal angle and contributed to functional improvement.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of forced breathing exercises as well as the
necessity of spinal stabilization and functional enhancement for lumbago patients. These
exercise are expected to help alleviate pain in lumbago patients through spinal
stabilization. Therefore, the present exercises including forced breathing exercises are a
possible kinesitherapeutic approach for the functional improvement of the truncal spine of
chronic lumbago patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Akuthota</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Nadler</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Core strengthening</article-title>. <source>Arch Phys Med
