task, an unskilled model showing clumsy finger movements is more effective than a skilled
model&#x0200f;. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-six young adults were randomly assigned to one of
three groups. The unskilled model observation group observed a video of a ball rotation
task practiced by a person for a short time. The skilled model observation group observed
another video of the same task practiced by the person for a relatively long time. The
non-observation group did not observe any video. Regarding rotation speed, the unskilled
model was faster than the participants&#x02019; but slower than the skilled model. The unskilled
model had the highest number of ball drops. [Results] After the observation, the unskilled
model observation group showed significantly faster rotation speed than the other groups.
There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of ball drops.
[Conclusion] An unskilled model whose performance is better than the participants&#x02019; is
beneficial for improving motor performance but a model showing less skill than the
participants is not.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor learning</kwd><kwd>Action observation</kwd><kwd>Model&#x02019;s skill</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>When clinicians teach patients a new motor activity in a clinical setting, they often
provide an ideal demonstration of the task as a model. In most situations, the clinician
expects to activate the mirror neuron system in the patient, leading the patient to imagine
the body movement from a first-person perspective<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, i.e., to execute the movement mentally without any movement of
their body<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Use of such imagery has been shown to lead to the activation of the
same areas of the brain as those activated by the actual movement<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, observing actions can promote the learning of new motor
skills.</p><p>Motor learning through action observation is referred to as observational learning.
Observational learning has previously been reported to have beneficial effects on motor
performance in younger participants. Heyes et al. reported a beneficial effect of the action
observation of a sequenced tapping performance on participants&#x02019; tapping<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Badets et al. showed that observational
learning was effective for a motor performance in which participants needed to perform a
coordination task of the upper extremities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Breslin et al. reported that observation of a bowling
demonstration resulted in greater upper extremity concordance as compared with no
observation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that these
previous studies showed the benefits of observational learning in improving motor
performance, action observation is expected to be useful for patients in clinical settings
as a non-physically demanding tool. In particular, such an intervention may be more
effective for frail elderly people because it does not present any physical demands.</p><p>However, in young participants, low brain activity in the mirror neuron system has been
shown when (a) there is a difference between the model&#x02019;s skill and the participants&#x02019; skill,
and (b) the activity has not previously been experienced by the participants. Calvo-Merino
et al. showed lower brain activity in novice ballet dancers than in expert ballet dancers
during the observation of ballet dances<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Agilit et al. reported that the cortical excitability of novice
basketball players was lower than that of expert basketball players following the
observation of free throws<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering
the importance of brain activity in the mirror neuron system and sensory-motor area for the
improvement of motor skills<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, decreased activation in these areas following observation
of a skilled model denotes ineffective motor learning.</p><p>In contrast, greater brain activity and high motor performance have been shown when
characteristics of the model are similar to those of an observer. For example, infants can
more easily imitate peers model than older children or adult models<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the mirror neuron system of dancers was
activated more strongly when they observed a video showing dancers of their own gender
rather than the opposite gender<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
findings indicate that models similar to the observers promote motor learning. Therefore,
when participants learn a new motor action, an unskilled model (a model who remains clumsy
when performing the action) may be more effective for learning than a skilled model.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the type of model that best promotes novel
motor learning. In particular, we examined whether better motor learning followed
observation of a skilled model (i.e., a model able to demonstrate a complete performance) or
an unskilled model (i.e., a clumsy performance, although better than the participants&#x02019; na&#x000ef;ve
performance). Defining the optimal model for improving novel motor learning may be useful in
clinical settings for specific types of patients, e.g., patients with serious brain damage
who have to learn new motor movements such as hand actions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-six young male adults participated in this study (mean age = 21.2&#x02005;years, SD =
0.8&#x02005;years). All participants were strongly right- or left-handed (two participants), based
on the Edinburgh handedness inventory<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inclusion criteria were (a) no visual disability, (b) no previous
experience of ball rotation using the hands, and (c) no previous neurological disease. All
participants gave informed consent prior to participating in the study. The experimental
protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Ryotokuji University
(approval number 2622). The tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups (unskilled model
observation group [n = 11], skilled model observation group [n = 14], non-observation
group [n = 11, including the two left-handed participants], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of experiment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3829-g001"/></fig>). We ensured that there were no significant group differences in length of hand
(wrist to top of the middle finger: 18.8 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;cm; 18.1 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;cm; and 18.2 &#x000b1; 0.8&#x02005;cm,
respectively, for the aforementioned groups). The participants sat comfortably and were
asked to perform a task involving rotating two balls in non-dominant hand to measure their
baseline performance (the time required to perform 10 rotations and the number of times a
ball was dropped). The balls were made from iron and were 50&#x02005;mm in diameter, weighed 37&#x02005;g
each, and had a smooth surface. In performing the rotation task, the participants were
instructed to rotate the two balls clockwise around the palm of their non-dominant hand as
quickly and as smoothly as possible. They started to do the task voluntarily. We videoed
their performance with a working stopwatch next to their hand; we were then able to
measure the time for the 10 rotations accurately by dividing the video into frames using
video conversion software (free video to JPEG converter, DVDVideoSoft Ltd., USA).</p><p>After gathering the baseline performance data, the participants in the two observation
groups observed the assigned model&#x02019;s video for one minute, whereas the participants in the
non-observation group rested, and then the participants performed the rotation task again.
This was repeated for a total of three cycles, with the post-intervention performance
measurements made in the same manner as for the baseline performance. We therefore
collected four sets of performance data for each participant, consisting of a
pre-intervention performance (labeled &#x0201c;pre&#x0201d;) and three post-intervention performances
(labeled &#x0201c;post 1,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;post 2,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;post 3&#x0201d;).</p><p>In the videos, the same person demonstrated the novel and expert performances. The
unskilled model video showed the model performing the ball rotation task in his
non-dominant (left) hand after practicing it for only 20&#x02005;min. The performance was 30
seconds for 10 rotations, with balls dropped twice. The expert performance showed the ball
rotation task after the model had practiced it for 10 minutes per day for 10 consecutive
days. The performance was 7.5 seconds for 10 rotations with no drops of the ball from the
hand. For the two left-handed participants, the video was inverted from left to right
using Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.</p><p>Following this procedure, we asked the participants to rate what they focused on while
watching the video, specifically the model&#x02019;s fingers, his palm, or the balls. With a total
of 10 points to assign, the participants assigned the greatest number of points to the
region they primarily focused on, and then divided the remaining points between the other
two regions.</p><p>The dependent measures were rotation speed, the number of times a ball was dropped from
the hand, and the participant&#x02019;s rating for focus on the fingers. The rotation speed was
calculated by dividing each second of the video into 30 frames using the video converter
software. The stopwatch was included in every frame of the video, and the calculation
involved subtracting the precise time the finger movement started from the time shown on
the stopwatch after exactly 10 rotations. The rotation speed and number of ball drops were
analyzed using separate group (unskilled model observation group, skilled model
observation group, and non-observation group) &#x000d7; session (pre, post 1, post 2, and post 3)
analyses of variance (ANOVAs). The ratings for focus on the fingers were analyzed using a
separate group (unskilled model observation group, skilled model observation group) &#x000d7;
session (post 1, post 2, and post 3) analysis of variance (ANOVA). The level of
significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean rotation speeds are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

observation group and non-observation group (t (23) = &#x02212;1.01, ns). Post-hoc analysis of the
groups at post 3 also showed a significant difference between the unskilled and skilled
model observation groups (t (20) = &#x02212;2.19, p = 0.03), and between the unskilled model
observation group and non-observation group (t (12) = &#x02212;3.31, p = 0.006), but not between the
skilled model observation group and non-observation group (t (15) = &#x02212;1.91, ns). In both the
unskilled and skilled model observation groups, the rotation speeds in all post sessions
increased significantly, although it did not do so in the non-observation group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the number of ball drops, there was a
significant main effect of session (F (3, 69) = 3.34, p = 0.02, <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but there was no significant effect of, or any
interaction with group (F (1, 23) = 0.05, ns, and F (3, 69) = 0.31, ns, respectively).</p><p>For the mean of the ratings for focus on the fingers, an ANOVA showed a significant main
effect of observation group (F (1, 37) = 5.70, p = 0.02). No significant main effect of
session and interaction (F (2, 45) = 0.45, ns; F (2, 45= 0.45, ns, respectively). The
unskilled model observation group gave higher ratings than the skilled model observation
group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results showed that the improvement in the rotation speed (i.e., the time required for
10 rotations) was greater in the unskilled model group than in the skilled model observation
group or the non-observation group. However, no differences between the groups were obtained
for the number of times a ball was dropped during the task. The ratings for focus on the
fingers were higher for the unskilled model observation than those for the skilled model
observation.</p><p>Relative to the time required for 10 rotations in the pre-intervention baseline
measurement, the time in all the post-intervention sessions in both the unskilled and
skilled model observation groups became faster; this was not the case for the
non-observation group. These findings indicate that model observation results in beneficial
effects on motor learning. Heyes et al. and Badets et al. reported effects of model
observation on motor learning in younger participants<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consistent with these
previous reports, we showed similar effects in young participants, showing that model
observation has beneficial effects on the motor learning of finger coordination.</p><p>Of particular note was the difference in the time required for 10 rotations between the
unskilled model and skilled model observation groups. This suggests that post-intervention
skill improvements were related to the similarity in the level of performance between the
unskilled model and the participants. The importance of understanding action and movement in
early phase motor learning has long been understood<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In fact, the rating of focus on the fingers was higher in the
unskilled model observation group than in the skilled model observation group. This suggests
that, by watching the finger movements of the unskilled model, the participants in the
unskilled model observation group understood the task more readily than the participants in
the skilled model observation group watching the finger movements of the skilled model.
Taken together, these findings suggest that motor learning was promoted best in the
unskilled model observation group.</p><p>Another reason for the different effects of the skilled and unskilled models on rotation
speed lies in brain activity. According to previous study, during action observations,
significantly greater brain activity occurs in the mirror neuron system when participants
imagine their own body movement than that when participants simply observe the action<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that viewing a model that
allows the participants to imagine their own movements is effective for observational
learning. Another previous study showed significantly stronger brain activity in the mirror
neuron system when the skill level between the participant and model was congruent than that
when it was incongruent<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering
these previous studies, the unskilled model may have activated participants&#x02019; mirror neuron
system, which would represent motor imagery of the finger movements involved in the ball
rotation task. Consequently, motor learning would be promoted, because the skill level of
participants was similar to that of the unskilled model.</p><p>There was no difference in the number of ball drops between the two model observation
groups. This finding would have been affected by the two drops made by the unskilled model,
which was greater than the number of ball drops made by most participants. Ikegami et al.
reported that observation of a novice action model by experts in the action (i.e., experts
observing poor performance) led to low performance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the unskilled model dropped more balls than the
participants, suggesting that the unskilled model did not lead to beneficial effects on
motor performance when a model showing a lower performance was used, even though the
unskilled model&#x02019;s skill was similar to that of the participants. Thus, certain effects of
repeated ball rotation performance on motor learning were demonstrated because of natural
motor learning through repetition of the ball rotation performance; these effects were not
due to model observation.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that observing an unskilled model had benefits in
fostering ball skill performance. This advantage was shown using a model who demonstrated a
higher performance level than the participants&#x02019;. In clinical settings, such an unskilled
model would be effective for observational learning. In particular, the unskilled model
could potentially be used in clinical settings for individuals without cognitive impairment,
such as fragile elderly people or patients with lower-extremity orthopedic problems. One of
the limitations of the present study was that the relationship between the degree of
performance improvement, the rating for focus on the fingers was fully unclear because both
the rating for focus on the fingers and impressions of the model were obtained subjectively
(not based on any scientific data). Another limitation was that we did not exclude the
possibility that the significant improvement in the unskilled model observation group was
due simply to a difference in movement speed in the video. Future studies are needed to
resolve these issues and to show that using unskilled models would be an effective tool to
assist with motor learning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by a Japanese Physical Therapy Association Research Grant
