Few theory- and evidence-based interventions to improve regular handwashing are available. Therefore, two intervention modules, a motivational and a self-regulatory one, were designed and evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a longitudinal study, 205 young adults, aged 18 to 26&#x000a0;years, were randomized into two intervention groups. The Mot-SelfR group received first a motivational intervention (<italic>Mot</italic>; risk perception and outcome expectancies) followed by a self-regulatory intervention (<italic>SelfR</italic>; perceived self-efficacy and planning) 17&#x000a0;days later. The SelfR-Mot group received the same two intervention modules in the opposite order. Follow-up data were assessed 17 and 34&#x000a0;days after the baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both intervention sequences led to an increase in handwashing frequency, intention, self-efficacy, and planning. Also, overall gains were found for the self-regulatory module (increased planning and self-efficacy levels) and the motivational module (intention). Within groups, the self-regulatory module appeared to be more effective than the motivational module, independent of sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Self-regulatory interventions can help individuals to exhibit more handwashing. Sequencing may be important as a motivation module (Mot) first helps to set the goal and a self-regulatory module (SelfR) then helps to translate this goal into actual behavior, but further research is needed to evaluate mechanisms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Self-regulation</kwd><kwd>Handwashing</kwd><kwd>Intention</kwd><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>Planning</kwd><kwd>Young adults</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>More than 100&#x000a0;years of evidence conclusively demonstrates that handwashing reduces the risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and that it is one of the most effective ways of preventing the transmission of infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, only 31% of men and 65% of women wash their hands after using a public restroom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and handwashing is even less common among young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite this, non-compliance to hand hygiene is rarely studied in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Particularly in one of the world&#x02019;s largest youth population, India, with around 66% of the total population under the age of 35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], handwashing was hardly systematically studied before. Thus, this was one goal of the current study.</p><p>In the hand hygiene literature, previous studies were mainly done among healthcare workers (HCW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and very few of them were generalizable to the population of adults, much less to youth. Moreover, these studies were lacking quantitative research methods, and very few could be found testing strategies to enhance handwashing empirically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In one of the few studies addressing a handwashing campaign, education was addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but it has been shown to be ineffective in handwashing promotion. Authors suggested testing more effective interventions and their differential impact in changing behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] especially in a student residence hall environment and university campus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, the current study aimed at focusing on university students and promoting handwashing in this sample with theory-based interventions, because interventions are imperative for successful health behavior promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivational and self-regulatory strategies for health behavior change</title><p>The World Health Organization prioritized hand hygiene as an intervention of universal relevance across developed and developing countries in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interventions should include the general principles guiding the development of health promotion programs and employed strategies based on relevant evidence coupled with an understanding of the underlying mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Such evidence-based strategies to enable health behavior change include addressing self-efficacy and self-regulatory skills such as planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as suggested by the health action process approach (HAPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>According to the HAPA, individuals first need to become motivated to adopt health behaviors, i.e. form an intention. This can be supported by strategies enhancing psychological variables such as <italic>risk perception</italic>, <italic>outcome expectancies,</italic> and <italic>self-efficacy</italic>. The HAPA assumes that after forming a behavioral intention, i.e., as soon as individuals are motivated, they need self-regulatory skills such as planning and further self-efficacy to translate their intentions into actual health behavior and to maintain the behavior over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study on fruit and vegetable intake among young adults highlighted the advantage of a self-regulatory intervention over a motivational intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This also needs to be investigated in the domain of hand hygiene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Motivational factors: risk perception and outcome expectancies</title><p>According to <italic>HAPA, risk perception</italic> can be a starting point for contemplating health behavior change although it is not regarded as a powerful predictor of most behaviors. <italic>Outcome expectancies</italic> are the perceived consequences of adopting the health behavior, which are supposed to lose their predictive power after a personal decision has been made. To form a behavioral intention, one also needs perceived self-efficacy which is the belief in one&#x02019;s capability of performing a desired action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Self-regulatory factors: perceived self-efficacy and planning</title><p>Perceived self-efficacy is the confidence in one&#x02019;s ability to execute a difficult or resource-demanding behavior and the capability of performing the actions that are required to attain a desired end state. Moreover, self-efficacious individuals invest more effort into achieving their goals especially in the face of barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The barrier here is not the technical difficulty of hand hygiene, but rather the regular performance of this activity as an integral part of daily life. Self-efficacy predicts a range of health behaviors including hand hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Self-efficacy is not only imperative for setting the goal to change behavior (motivational effect) but also for translating the goal into behavior and maintaining the behavior after the first enactment (volitional effect).</p><p>Intention to change a behavior is central to most health behavior promotion programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but intentions can be unstable, and as a consequence people might not actually take up an action, for example, when they lack control over their behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The &#x0201c;black-box&#x0201d; nature of the underlying psychological processes that lead from intention to action has been labelled intention-behavior-gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To bridge this intention-behavior-gap, it has been shown that forming specific <italic>action plans</italic> of when, where, and how to act can increase the likelihood of successful implementation of one&#x02019;s intention. Two types of planning have been introduced: <italic>action planning</italic> (when, where and how to act) and <italic>coping planning</italic> (to identify barriers and strategies to cope with them) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Much research has documented the pivotal role of planning interventions for the uptake and maintenance of a variety of health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, its effects on a self-regulatory handwashing intervention in comparison to a motivational intervention, has not been tested before.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The current study explored whether it would make a difference in which order a set of two brief theory-based psychological intervention arms (motivational and self-regulatory interventions) are presented to improve hand hygiene in young adults. It evaluated a unique research design by comparing these two intervention modules. A crossover design was employed: one group of participants received the motivational intervention (Mot) first, followed by the self-regulatory module (SelfR). The other group received the two modules in the opposite sequence (SelfR-Mot). At the point in time when the order was switched (after 17&#x000a0;days), a second assessment took place allowing to gauge the changes during the first phase. In addition, after another 17&#x000a0;days the third assessment was scheduled to allow for evaluating the final outcomes.</p><p>The purpose of this cross-over design was to examine whether it made a difference in which order treatments were presented. According to the theoretical assumptions derived from the HAPA, participants should first become motivated before they acquire self-regulatory skills. Thus, the aim is to determine the optimal sequence for motivational and self-regulatory modules, and it is expected that the motivation-self-regulation (MotSelfR) sequence would be superior in adopting the handwashing goal as well as planning this behavior, compared to the opposite sequence (Hypothesis 1: Mot-SelfR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;SelfR-Mot).</p><p>However, it may be that some participants do not benefit from such a sequence because they feel patronized by the motivational messages or they perceive them as redundant, as they are already beyond that stage. In such cases, a mere self-regulatory intervention without a motivational precursor would be the better and more parsimonious option.</p><p>Moreover, the intervention benefits should not only be documented by changes in handwashing but also by changes in mindsets as reflected by higher levels of self-efficacy and planning. This leads to the following hypothesis: participants who received the self-regulation intervention module would gain more in terms of the volitional outcomes (behavior and planning), whereas those receiving the motivational intervention module would show increases in the motivational outcome (intention), no matter at which point in time (Hypothesis 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>University students (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;206, including 107 women, mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.71&#x000a0;years, <italic>SD&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;1.59 with a range from 18 to 26&#x000a0;years) were observed from March 2013 to April 2013 with three assessment points in time over a time span of 34&#x000a0;days.

The two intervention modules (a motivational intervention and a self-regulatory intervention) were theory-guided, based on the HAPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the intervention modules included psychological constructs such as risk-perception and outcome expectancies (Mot intervention) as well as perceived self-efficacy and planning (SelfR module). Two experimental groups were treated with both interventions, but in two different sequences (Mot-SelfR versus SelfR-Mot), testing their differential effects.</p><p>The Mot-SelfR proved to be slightly more effective than the SelfR-Mot to promote handwashing, however, not being significant. This result supports descriptively the first hypothesis and replicates the findings of a previous study on fruit and vegetable intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, results yielded that the main differences were observed at T2, when both groups were exposed only to a single intervention, either the motivational or the self-regulatory one. This substantial group difference vanished at T3, after all participants had been exposed to both kinds of interventions. Thus, this research demonstrates that a motivational intervention in itself leads to a mere increase in intention but does not lead to behavior change replicating the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The more successful approach lies in the acquisition of self-regulatory skills and the development of confidence in one&#x02019;s agency confirming the second hypothesis: It was assumed that all study participants receiving the motivational intervention module would show increases in intention, no matter at which point in time. This assumption was corroborated by the data as intention was higher in both groups right after they had received the motivational intervention.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 also assumed that planning and actual change in the behavior would be higher after individuals of both groups had received the self-regulatory intervention module. This especially was supported for planning. Regarding the actual behavior change, the assumption can also be supported as not only the mean level of behavior at the measurement points should be evaluated, but also the change in behavior and other test variables. Overall, the motivational intervention, which was mainly educational, did not lead to strong effects in behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is important that people first set a goal which then needs to be translated into behavior. If individuals have to plan a non-intended behavior, this might have adverse effects. Although it has been frequently shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that conditional planning (if-then) structures such as coping planning are more effective than simply specifying the when, where, and how (action planning), the current study yielded similar effects of action and coping planning on handwashing behavior. This may be due to the habitual nature of the behavior that is produced by particular cues, often as a part of routine and, thus, these two planning components were incorporated here into one single planning construct.</p><p>While the results of the current study support the hypotheses, in contrast to previous studies among university students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], no gender differences in the handwashing compliance rate were found (<italic>p&#x02009;&#x0003e;</italic>&#x02009;.05). Thus, the interventions were equally effective in men and women.</p><p>There are some limitations. Assessments were self-reported and handwashing frequency was measured retrospectively. For more objective assessments, one could use video cameras and Smart Soap (containing devices that record usage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To examine more potential mechanisms of the two interventions and, thus, account for the complexity of a behavior-change process, effects on other constructs such as action control (i.e., monitoring one&#x02019;s progress, comparing performance with goals, and investing more effort if needed) should also be tested. To address the stage of change, future work might also consider a segmentation of the audience in terms of the participants&#x02019; levels of previous behavior and concurrent motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Further, it could be tested whether matched interventions work better than the mismatched treatments. However, as in this study the baseline handwashing compliance rate was only 4%, it was assumed that almost all participants were initially unmotivated to adopt handwashing 10 times daily. Therefore, no distinction was made between participants in terms of intenders, non-intenders, and actors. Rather, the effectiveness of two intervention modules (Motivation and Self-regulation) was evaluated and a large proportion of participants seemed to have benefitted from both interventions, independent of their stages of change.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the low initial compliance rate was due to lack of awareness, lack of motivation, or lack of self-regulatory skills. We assume that in educated college students, a moderate level of hygiene awareness and motivation is given, which then would mean that the translation of intention is at stake. Under such circumstances, a brief self-regulatory treatment, as provided in this study, might be a useful shortcut towards the target behavior, without the need to provide lengthy educational messages.</p><p>In the analyses, we did not address possible mechanisms of behavior change that involve intentions, planning, and self-efficacy because this is beyond the present scope and constitutes a different research question. For example, various studies have examined the moderating role of self-efficacy in the volition phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. An interaction between planning and self-efficacy on physical activity has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] as well as an interaction between intention and self-efficacy on planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings lead to implications for developing health behavior change interventions in public health settings. In promoting hand hygiene among young adults, the implementation of brief self-regulatory skill training appears to be promising, whereas an educational program that provides information to build motivation seems to be less effective. It does make a difference in which order the two intervention modules are presented. The sequence in which individuals were motivated first and then guided to develop their self-regulatory skills appears to be more intuitive and in line with major theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] than the opposite sequence, but, on the other hand, behavior change was achieved with the self-regulatory module alone, questioning the usefulness of a motivational prelude to this module.</p><p>Overall, this research has explored in a unique way the sequencing of different health behavior intervention modules and elucidated the proximal predictors of changing hand hygiene behaviors, in this case handwashing, and, thus, contributes to the emerging literature on the developments of health behavior change techniques.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PL, RS and SL have contributed to the conception and design of the study.
