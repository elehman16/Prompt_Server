However, in recent years, Some scholars believe that pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) might have advantages in decreasing Peak airway pressures and ensuring oxygenation,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] however the choice of ventilation mode is still controversial, and PCV or VCV which is more suitable for postoperative recovery is still uncertain, especially in elderly patients with poor pulmonary function.</p><p>The aim of our study is to investigate, which ventilatory mode is more advantaged between VCV and PCV during OLV undergoing radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma in elderly patients with poor pulmonary function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the authors' hospital, and informed consent was obtained from each patient or from their nearest relatives. No commercial entity providing device or equipment had a role in any aspect of this study. Prior to surgery all patients underwent arterial blood gas and lung spirometry. The patients were enrolled into the study having poor pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &#x0003c;1.5 L) and undergoing radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma requiring at least 2 h of OLV. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I-III and aged above 65 years. Preoperative exclusion criteria were patient refusal, anticipated inability to perform early postoperative extubation, no signed informed consent form, poor understanding by the patient of the purpose of the study, patient with uncompensated cardiac disease, hepatic or renal disease, previous thoracic surgery, and asthma.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Before anesthetic induction, patients were respectively allocated to VCV group and PCV group with a block randomization scheme produced by computer-generated codes. The ventilation strategy of all the patients used a tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) of 10 ml/kg during two-lung ventilation (TLV) before the operation and reduced to 6 ml/kg during OLV associated with 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) throughout the operative time, after the operation the V<sub>T</sub> was used back to 10 ml/kg until extubating the endotracheal tube. The difference is that patients in VCV group were ventilated with VCV and in PCV group the ventilation strategy used PCV during all the mechanical ventilation phase. Inspiration:expiration ratio (I:E) was 1:2 and FIO<sub>2</sub> was 100%. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained between 35 and 40 mmHg through adjusting the respiratory rate during OLV. The cut-off strategy were unable to control the upper pressure in PCV group &#x0003c;35 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, unable to perform tracheal intubation in conditions of usual practice, inability to maintain stable mechanical ventilation settings for 30 min, inability to maintain an appropriate EtCO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub>, abnormal surgical complications, such as large blood vessels burst and unstable state of circulation, such as continuous hypertension or hypotension. The anesthesiologists were not blinded to the groups, but they were not participated in the collection of the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patient treatment</title><p>Anesthetic and surgical management were standardized for each patient. After standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive blood pressure), an arterial cannula was inserted into the radial artery for invasive arterial pressure monitoring and collecting arterial blood, and a central venous catheter was inserted from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava near the right atrium, used for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring and collecting mixed venous blood. General anesthesia was induced in all patients with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), propofol (1.5 mg/kg), fentanyl (4 ug/kg), and rocuronium (1 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.1-0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min), propofol (50-100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min), and supplemental rocuronium discontinuously. No volatile anesthetics were used. The trachea was intubated with a left or right double lumen tube (Mallinckrodt-Endobronchial Tube, Covidien, Made in Ireland) no. 37 for male and no. 35 for female patients. The position of the tube was confirmed by auscultation and fiberoptic bronchoscopy before and after turning the patient to the lateral position. The patients' lungs were ventilated with a Datex-Ohmeda Ventilator (Aestiva/5 7900, Madison, USA). The lumen of the nonventilated side was left open to the air during OLV. During surgery, SpO<sub>2</sub> should be kept above 90% at all times. If SpO<sub>2</sub> fell below 90%, the following treatments were taken: sucking sputum, adjusting the catheter position, reconfirming by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. After treatment SpO<sub>2</sub> can't back to above 90%, TLV was initiated and the patient would be excluded from the study.</p><p>Preoperatively standardized fluid replacement had consisted of 10 ml/kg Compound Sodium Chioride Injection (Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China), followed by the solution (10 ml/kg/h) perioperatively. If mean arterial pressure was lower than 70 mmHg continuous &#x0003e;5 min, an additional fluid replacement was administered with 10 ml/kg 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Fresenius Kabi, Germany). If this was not enough, repeated doses of 5 mg ephedrine were administered intravenous.</p><p>After surgery, all patients were transferred to Intensive Care Unit?ICU).

Our results showed that compared with VCV, the PCV during OLV undergoing radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma in elderly patients with poor pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;1.5 L) had a statistically significant decrease in Ppeak, it could improve intraoperative and postoperative arterial oxygenation in patients, and have obviously advantages in postoperative recovery.</p><p>Our results were consistent with some studies comparing VCV with PCV, which reported that PCV could provide advantage over VCV for as much as improving oxygenation. Tu&#x0011f;rul <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that, PCV improved arterial oxygenation during OLV, especially in patients with a lower forced vital capacity (VC). This improvement might be explained by the flow profile with PCV, decreasing in pulmonary shunt fraction and lower airway pressures than with VCV. Sent&#x000fc;rk <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that PCV with a PEEP of 4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was associated with an improvement in oxygenation compared with VCV and zero PEEP. In contrast, some studies had found that PCV offered no advantage over VCV for improving oxygenation. Unzueta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported that the use of PCV during OLV did not lead to improve oxygenation during OLV compared with VCV for patients with good preoperative pulmonary function. Pardos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that compared with VCV, the use of PCV did not affect arterial oxygenation during OLV or early postoperative oxygenation.</p><p>According to our study results, we think the PCV during OLV have some advantages in elderly patients with poor pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;1.5 L) and the reasons are as follows:</p><p>The first of all, we had chosen the elderly patients with poor pulmonary function in our study. The lung tissues undergo changes with age that lead to an increase in alveolar size. The changes can lower the alveolar surface tension, which cause a reduction in maximum achievable flow in the airways. Muscle performance diminishes with age and the chest wall becomes stiffer, which lead to an increased residual volume.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These changes impact on lung function; static and dynamic measurements fall. VC is generally decreased almost 25% or 40%, FEV<sub>1</sub> clearly drops at a rate depending on age and the FEV<sub>1</sub> /FVC ratio drops progressively with age.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] PCV has the lower peak airway pressure that might reduce the degree of barotraumas during mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] PCV ventilator mode generates appropriate flow to maintain the set aspiratory pressure, and it usually can make peak airway pressures lower, improve the static and dynamic lung compliance, and decelerate flow waveform.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Due to these characteristics of the elderly patients, PCV shows its advantages.</p><p>Second, our ventilation strategy was small V<sub>T</sub> (6 ml/kg) during OLV associated with 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O PEEP throughout the operative time; therefore, the airway pressure is relatively lower during OLV in both two groups. VCV uses a constant inspired flow, which has been gained as the V<sub>T</sub> delivered through producing a progressive increase of airway pressure to the peak inspiratory pressure. However, in contrast, the PCV ventilation model has advantage that it can improve the homogeneous distribution of inspired gas, gain better oxygenation and decrease the risk of lung injury.</p><p>Third, in our study, PCV ventilation strategy was used throughout the whole process of ventilation in PCV group, including the mechanical ventilation in postoperative phase. We found that the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FIO<sub>2</sub> ratio in PCV group had a significant advantage in arterial oxygenation than VCV group in early postoperative recovery phase. The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FIO<sub>2</sub> ratio is an universal accepted parameter that can be used to compare the oxygenation among patients in the recovery period after thoracic surgery, and it is often measured in early postoperative phase because lung injury often appears very early after lung resection surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although, there is no obvious difference of postoperative complications in two groups, but we found that compared with VCV group, the patients in PCV group had a significant decrease in the length of postoperative ventilation duration, the days stay in ICU and in hospital.</p><p>In addition, all the patients in our study had been undergone radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma. This kind of surgery need a longer operating time. Furthermore, during OLV in lateral decubitus, the compression atelectasis of dependent lung regions, the loss of elastic recoil after thoracotomy, and mediastinal surgical manipulations can markedly reduce the aerated lung capacity, impair ventilation distribution, and worsen ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Therefore, PCV might exert its advantages in a longer time in the process of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, it was a single-center study with a small group of patients, and limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. Second, the results cannot extrapolate how severe degree of the preoperative pulmonary function is safe during OLV. Third, the different difficulty in operation and scope of surgical resection may produce some effects on the results of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"

(FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;1.5 L) have significant advantages of intraoperative and postoperative oxygenation and it might be a factor, which can beneficial to postoperative
