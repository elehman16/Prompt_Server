Only left sided pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction were enrolled for study. Patients were assigned into two groups for surgery by simple randomization technique. A total of 38 transmesocolic laparoscopic pyeloplasty (TMP) and 41 left sided RLP were performed. The data were recorded in a prospective manner that included age, pelvic volume, presence of stone [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>], aberrant vessel, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>] operative time, analgesics requirement (paracetamol 15 mg/kg body weight for children more than 10 kg of weight and 7.5 mg/kg body weight for children less than 10 kg of weight), time to accept oral feeds, drain removal. A dismembered AH pyeloplasty was performed in all patients. Double J Stent (DJS) was placed in 73.68% of patients in TMP group while 82.92% patients in RLP group. Based on pelvic volume, patients were divided into three groups:</p><p>

</p><p>Pelvic volume measurement was done by ultrasonography. All patients with significant obstruction (obstructed pattern and t1/2 more than 20 min) as per the &#x0201c;well-tempered diuretic renogram&#x0201d; were taken for surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. All cases were done by a single surgeon who has experience of more than two hundred laparoscopic pyeloplasty including fifty cases of transmesocolic pyeloplasty. Written consent of all patients was taken. Institutional ethics and review board approval were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position. Using Hasson's canula by open technique, pneumoperitoneum up to 8-10 mm Hg was created at umbilicus and a 30&#x000b0; laparoscope was placed through this. Two 3 mm or 5 mm ports were placed subcostally in the midclavicular line and mid-way between spinoumbilical lines respectively.</p><p>The first step was the identification of renal pelvis under the mesocolic fat. A mesocolic &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; was opened by dissecting the mesocolon with the Harmonic scalpel. This space was limited medially by the inferior mesenteric vein and laterally by the medial margin of the descending colon. The landmarks were then represented by the inferior mesenteric vein and gonadal vein. A 5 cm incision was then made longitudinally, lateral to the inferior mesenteric and gonadal veins, in between the medial and left colonic artery. This area was free of vessels and the incision frequently enabled direct visualization of the lumbar ureter. Sometimes small branches of the left colonic artery were present and were clipped and sectioned, with no impairment of the colonic vascularization. In this way, we created a peritoneal &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; that allowed a direct access to the renal pelvis. Whenever a wider operative field was necessary, the superior margin of the incision was suspended to the lateral abdominal wall with a suture. Needle aspiration of renal pelvis was done if pelvic capacity was more than 50 ml as to minimize the size of mesocolic window. [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>]. Further, in larger pelvises, a stay suture passed percutaneously helps in better stabilization of the former. The ureter and renal pelvis were carefully dissected to avoid unnecessary damage to their vasculature, whereas for the same reason, the kidney and ureter were not mobilized. The UPJ was divided proximal to the renal pelvis and the obstructed part was left attached to the ureter. If necessary, the ureter was transposed over any aberrant vessels [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. The ureteral stent was placed by introducing the guide wire through a 16-gauge intravenous catheter sheath placed percutaneously under direct laparoscopic control. Then the ureter was spatulated, and a running suture on a small and half- circle [SH] needle was placed. We used DJS according to age (Length of JJ = age of the child in years + 10 cm). The anterior plane of the anastomosis was completed using the same suturing technique as for the posterior layer. In some cases, we used a 2 mm percutaneous retractor on the anterior flap of the sectioned renal pelvis in order to stabilize the loose pelvis and facilitate the anastomosis. The mesocolic window was usually closed with two or three Hem-O-Lok<sup>&#x02122;</sup> clips or by using a 3-0 polyglactin interrupted suture after placement of the suction tube. The port sites were closed. Perinephric drain was placed in all patients of both groups. Drain was removed when drain output was less than 30 ml/day. Perurethral catheter was put for bladder drainage. Patients were orally allowed after bowel sounds were appreciated. DJS was removed after 6 week.</p><p>In RLP group, the procedure began by incising at Toldt's line, dissecting the left colon from Gerota's fascia and reflecting it medially to visualize the renal hilum and UPJ. Rest of the steps was same as TMP group. Median follow-up period for transmesocolic group was 12.5 months (9.5-62 months) and 14 months (8-66 months) for retro colic group. Follow-up included renal dynamic scan, first at 6 weeks after stent removal, then at 3 months and further 2 scans at 6 monthly intervals, resolution of symptom and or resolution of hydronephrosis on ultrasound.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In TMP group, 32 patients were boys and 6 were girls while 36 patients were boys and 5 were girls in RLP group.

The American Society of Anesthesia score was 1 in all patients. DJS was put in 73.68% patients in TMP group while 82.92% patients in RLP group.

On average, TMP was 30 min shorter than classic RLP (104.8 min vs. 135.4 min; <italic>P</italic> 0.05). There were no intra-operative complications or open conversions.

Thus, the pyeloplasty can be performed through a small incision in the posterior peritoneum.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Conversely, on the left side, mobilization of the descending colon is mandatory to identify the underlying renal fascia and to access the UPJ.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, the descending colon can reduce the width of the operative field, especially in obese patients or when the colon is distended. In these cases, the introduction of a fourth trocar is often required to improve the exposure. To avoid the mobilization of the descending colon and all the inherent problems associated with bowel manipulation, a direct transperitoneal access to the left UPJ is proposed[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and recently applied in adult urology by Romero <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Castillo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who reported series of 18 and 11 patients, respectively.</p><p>Crossing vessels were present in 15.78% patients of TMP group while 18.42% patients in RLP group.

Higher values are due the fact that poor sanitary condition at home and poor wound care would increase infection and morbidity, owing to which discharging of the patient is delayed.</p><p>Mean analgesic dose requirement was significantly less in TMP group than RLP group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Manipulation of the colon and adjacent abdominal wall can cause visceral pain. But generally TMP causes less pain when compared to RLP.
