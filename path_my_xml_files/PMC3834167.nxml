This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of repeated incobotulinumtoxinA injections in subjects with CD. Following a &#x02264;20-week placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, single-dose main period, subjects could enter a&#x000a0;&#x02264;68-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, repeated-dose, flexible-interval (minimum 6&#x000a0;weeks) extension period with 240&#x000a0;U or 120&#x000a0;U of incobotulinumtoxinA (&#x02264;5 injections). Outcome measures included the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) and adverse events (AEs). Of 219 subjects completing the main period, 214 were randomized in the extension period to receive incobotulinumtoxinA 240&#x000a0;U (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;111) or 120&#x000a0;U (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;103); 169 subjects completed the extension period, with 90 receiving five injection sessions. Both doses of incobotulinumtoxinA provided statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in mean TWSTRS-Total, -Severity, -Disability, and -Pain scores, from each injection session to respective 4-week follow-up visits. The most frequently reported AE was dysphagia (240&#x000a0;U: 23.4&#x000a0;%; 120&#x000a0;U: 12.6&#x000a0;%), which did not result in any study withdrawals. There was no impact of injection interval on the incidence of AEs (post hoc analysis). A major limitation of this study was the fixed dose design requested by regulatory authorities, which does not reflect clinical practice. However, repeated incobotulinumtoxinA injections (240 or 120&#x000a0;U; flexible intervals) provided sustained efficacy and were well tolerated, with no unexpected safety risks following repeated injections. The incidence of AEs was similar in subjects requiring repeated injections at shorter intervals (&#x02264;12&#x000a0;weeks) compared with those treated using longer intervals (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;weeks).</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Dystonia</kwd><kwd>Xeomin</kwd><kwd>IncobotulinumtoxinA</kwd><kwd>NT 201</kwd><kwd>Botulinum toxin</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Wien 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cervical dystonia (CD) is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary activation of the muscles of the neck and shoulders, resulting in abnormal repetitive and/or sustained posturing. Pain is a recognized clinical feature of CD: over two-thirds of subjects have associated neck pain (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1991</xref>). The efficacy and tolerability of botulinum toxin for the treatment of CD are supported by Class I evidence (Simpson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>).</p><p>When isolated from <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> cultures, botulinum toxin is composed of a 150-kDa core neurotoxin and accessory (complexing) proteins, including hemagglutinin and non-toxin non-hemagglutinin (NTNH) proteins (Inoue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>). IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; also known as NT 201; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) is a purified form of botulinum toxin type A that contains no accessory proteins and has a high specific biological activity (Frevert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Frevert and Dressler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>, Dressler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). IncobotulinumtoxinA has shown comparable efficacy and safety to onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of CD when used in a 1:1 dosing ratio (Benecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>) and was equipotent to onabotulinumtoxinA in a mouse toxicity (LD<sub>50</sub>) assay (Dressler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>).</p><p>In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled main period (MP) of a phase 3 study, incobotulinumtoxinA (240 or 120&#x000a0;U) significantly improved Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total scores and subscores compared with placebo in subjects with primary CD of a predominantly rotational form (Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). While this demonstrates the efficacy of a single set of incobotulinumtoxinA injections, the majority of subjects with focal dystonia require long-term treatment. Herein, we report data from the double-blind extension period (EP) of this study, which investigated the safety and efficacy of repeated injection sessions of incobotulinumtoxinA (240 or 120&#x000a0;U) in subjects with CD over a 68-week period (including a 20-week safety period). This is the first randomized trial in CD where the design of the EP included flexible injection intervals (minimum 6&#x000a0;weeks) to allow tailoring of treatment to meet individual subject needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The design and results of the placebo-controlled MP of this double-blind, randomized, parallel-group phase three trial (clinicaltrials.gov identification number: NCT00407030; MRZ 60201&#x02013;0408) have been reported (Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). The EP had a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design and was conducted at 37 centers across the USA. The total duration of this incobotulinumtoxinA long-term study (MP plus EP) was up to 88&#x000a0;weeks. The respective Institutional Review Boards approved the study protocol and the informed consent process. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the declaration of Helsinki and was consistent with good clinical practice and the applicable regulatory requirements. Both the MP and EP were monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>In the MP, pre-treated and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve subjects were eligible for enrollment (Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>).</p><p>Subjects could enter the EP if they had completed the last visit of the MP and had a need for re-injection, which the investigator agreed was necessary, as defined by a TWSTRS-Total score &#x02265;20 points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization</title><p>Before enrollment into the MP, subjects were randomized to receive incobotulinumtoxinA (240 or 120&#x000a0;U) or placebo in the MP. At this time point, independently from randomization to MP treatment, subjects were also randomized to receive incobotulinumtoxinA injections at total doses of either 240 or 120&#x000a0;U in the EP. Randomization was performed using RANCODE version 3.6 (IDV, Gauting, Germany). Block-wise randomization (block size of six) ensured a balanced treatment assignment for each center. Subjects, investigators, medical staff, and all staff at the sponsoring company and clinical research organization were blinded to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment and follow-up visits</title><p>In the EP, subjects received incobotulinumtoxinA at total doses of 240 or 120&#x000a0;U in an equal total volume of 4.8&#x000a0;mL. Muscles treated, number of injection sites per muscle, use of electromyographic guidance, and doses injected at each site were at the discretion of the investigator. All subjects could receive one to five injection sessions of incobotulinumtoxinA as clinically required over the 48&#x000a0;weeks. The interval between injection sessions was flexible, with a minimum interval of 6&#x000a0;weeks up to the time when subjects expressed a need for a re-injection. To be re-injected, subjects had to spontaneously request re-treatment and have a TWSTRS-Total score of &#x02265;20.</p><p>A mandatory telephone call was made on Day 7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1 and a follow-up visit took place on Day 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3 after each injection session. The Trial Termination Visit (TTV) was performed 20&#x000a0;weeks (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;days) after the last injection session or when the subject expressed a need for a new injection of botulinum toxin other than study medication, whichever came first (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design.

In the EP, the following efficacy variables were assessed: TWSTRS-Total and subscale scores (Disability, Severity, and Pain) (Consky and Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994</xref>), Investigator Global Assessment of Efficacy (IGAE), and Patient Evaluation of Global Response (PEGR) (adapted from Wissel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>). TWSTRS-Total and subscale scores were assessed at each injection session, each follow-up visit, and the TTV; analyses included changes from each injection session to the follow-up visits, and changes from the first injection session in the EP to the TTV. Assessments were only performed by investigators who had been appropriately trained, and the same investigator performed all assessments for a given subject. The IGAE consists of a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very good) to 4 (poor), and the PEGR scale ranges from &#x02013;4 (very marked worsening) to +4 (complete abolishment of all signs and symptoms). IGAE and PEGR were recorded at all injection visits of the EP (except the first) and the TTV, for the assessment of the respective previous injection cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Subjects were requested to report all adverse events (AEs) to the investigator. At each visit and telephone contact, AEs were evaluated and subjects were specifically asked to report any swallowing difficulties using a 5-point dysphagia rating scale as 0 (absent, no swallowing difficulties), 1 (mild swallowing difficulties), 2 [moderate, when swallowing solid meals (e.g. meat)], 3 (severe, with swallowing difficulties and requiring a change in diet), or 4 (swallowing not possible, resulting in weight loss) (Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1992</xref>). Any increase in the dysphagia scale score after an injection session was classified as an AE.</p><p>Vital signs, including systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate, were assessed at each visit. Physical and neurological examinations were performed at the third injection visit of the EP and the TTV. Blood samples for clinical chemistry and hematology, and for the determination of antibodies against botulinum toxin type A, were taken at all visits for evaluation at a central laboratory. Antibodies against botulinum neurotoxin type A were assessed by a validated fluorescence immunoassay for antibodies (FIA-AB). To identify neutralizing antibodies, samples that were positive in the FIA-AB were tested with a mouse ex vivo hemidiaphragm assay (HDA) (G&#x000f6;schel et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>; Sesardic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>). FIA-ABs were performed by BioProof AG, Munich, Germany, and HDAs were performed by Toxogen GmbH, Hannover, Germany. For the assessment of the respective previous injection cycle, the Investigator Global Assessment of Tolerability (IGAT) scale, a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very good) to 4 (poor) was performed at all injection visits of the EP (except the first) and the TTV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>Efficacy results represent the intent-to-treat population, and safety data represent the evaluable-for-safety population (both defined as all subjects who received any amount of study medication during the MP or EP).

The highest incidence of ADRs occurred after the first injection session of the EP, both in pre-treated (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23, 17.4&#x000a0;%) and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30, 36.6&#x000a0;%). There was no cumulative effect of repeated injection sessions on the incidence of ADRs over the treatment period.

Improvements in mean TWSTRS scores were considered clinically relevant and comparable with results of published studies (Benecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Brin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>; Truong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>).</p><p>IncobotulinumtoxinA was well tolerated with no unexpected safety risks following repeated injections. Dysphagia was the most common ADR, with incidences per injection interval comparable to rates described for other botulinum toxin preparations used to treat CD (Allergan, Inc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Ipsen Biopharm Ltd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>). Of note, in this study, unlike in previous studies of other botulinum toxins for CD, direct questioning using a 5-point dysphagia scale may have prompted a greater level of reporting by subjects. Incidences of ADRs did not increase with repeated injections, suggesting that there were no cumulative effects.</p><p>This is the first randomized trial in which flexible injection intervals were used in registration trials in the evaluation of repeated treatment of CD with botulinum toxin. Current US prescribing information for formulations of botulinum toxin type A suggests a minimum interval of 12&#x000a0;weeks between injection sessions, primarily due to concerns regarding safety and formation of neutralizing antibodies (Greene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1994</xref>; Allergan Inc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>; Ipsen Biopharm Ltd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>). However, in this study of incobotulinumtoxinA, flexible injection intervals (minimum 6&#x000a0;weeks) were utilized at the discretion of the investigator depending on individual subject needs. This approach enabled individualized treatment for subjects who may derive greater benefit from more flexible dosing. In this study, 47.1&#x000a0;% of subjects with &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;incobotulinumtoxinA injections had a median injection interval &#x02264;12&#x000a0;weeks and 22.5&#x000a0;% had a median injection interval &#x02264;10&#x000a0;weeks. This is in line with the results of a multi-national survey of botulinum toxin injectors and subjects who were receiving onabotulinumtoxinA or abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of CD, which showed that &#x0003e;46&#x000a0;% of subjects would prefer shorter injection intervals (&#x02264;10&#x000a0;weeks) compared with those intervals actually received (Sethi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). However, it has to be emphasized that the mean (SD) injection interval in this EP was 14.0 (7.4) weeks (median injection interval: 13.0&#x000a0;weeks). Importantly, the current study did not show significant differences in the incidence of AEs between subjects who received injection sessions at a median interval of 6 to &#x02264;10&#x000a0;weeks and those treated less frequently, indicating that there are no additional safety concerns associated with shorter injection intervals when incobotulinumtoxinA is injected repeatedly according to subject needs with a flexible dosing period of up to 68 and a total duration of up to 88&#x000a0;weeks (up to six injections). For the 88-week duration of this study, there was no difference in the number of subjects testing positive for neutralizing antibodies in the HDA assay at the beginning of the main phase of the study versus the end of the EP. However, as the development of antibodies can occur with a longer treatment duration (Dressler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>; Naumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>) further studies with a larger number of subjects over a longer period are required to further evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated botulinum toxin treatments administered with flexible dosing intervals.</p><p>Neither the MP nor the EP was designed or powered to identify differences between the two dose groups and, accordingly, statistical analyses of treatment differences between the dose groups did not reach significance. To meet the requirements specified by regulatory authorities, subjects in this trial received randomized, fixed doses of incobotulinumtoxinA. Thus, total doses were not based on individual subjects&#x02019; medical needs and condition and did not take into consideration any previous botulinum toxin treatment outcomes subjects may have experienced, as would be standard practice in the treatment of CD outside a clinical trial setting. Re-randomization at the beginning of the EP also led to approximately two-thirds of subjects switching dose groups between the MP and the EP. As a result, subjects may have been over- or under-dosed, which may potentially have impacted on the frequency of AEs and/or withdrawals. Thus, it is inappropriate to draw definitive conclusions regarding differences between dose groups and purposely designed dose titration studies will be required to evaluate dosing for botulinum toxin treatment of CD. Nonetheless, similar to the results from the MP of this study, both doses of incobotulinumtoxinA demonstrated efficacy.</p><p>In summary, this randomized, double-blind extension study shows that repeated injections of incobotulinumtoxinA provide sustained efficacy for up to five treatment cycles when administered at total doses of 240 or 120 U using flexible dosing intervals according to subject need. Furthermore, incobotulinumtoxinA was well tolerated, and no unexpected safety risks emerged following repeated injections. No additional safety concerns were observed in subjects who received injection sessions at short intervals (6 to &#x02264;10 or &#x0003e;10 to &#x02264;12&#x000a0;weeks) compared with those who received injection sessions at longer intervals (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;weeks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Study investigators</title><p>Richard Barbano (Rochester, NY, USA); Allison Brashear (Winston-Salem, NC, USA); Matthew Brodsky (Portland, OR, USA); Mahan Chehrenama (Alexandria, VA, USA); Cynthia Comella (Chicago, IL, USA); Paul Cullis (Detroit, MI, USA); Fabio Danisi (Kingston, NY, USA); Richard Dubinsky (Kansas City, KS, USA); Aaron Ellenbogen (Bingham Farms, MI, USA); Marian Evatt (Atlanta, GA, USA); Virgilio Gerald Evidente (Scottsdale, AZ, USA); Hubert Fernandez (Gainesville, FL, USA); Stephen Gollomp (Wynnewood, PA, USA); David Greeley (Spokane, WA, USA); Stephen Grill (Elkridge, MD, USA); Philip Hanna (Edison, NJ, USA); Robert Hauser (Tampa, FL, USA); Neal Hermanowicz (Irvine, CA, USA); Zhigao Huang (Jacksonville, FL, USA); Bahman Jabbari (New Haven, CT, USA); Joseph Jankovic (Houston, TX, USA); Un Jung Kang (Chicago, IL, USA); Mark LeDoux (Memphis, TN, USA); Kenneth Levin (Ridgewood, NJ, USA); Peter LeWitt (Southfield, MI, USA); Anthony Nicholas (Birmingham, AL, USA); Robert Rodnitzky (Iowa City, IA, USA); Alok Sahay (Cincinnati, OH, USA); Harvey Schwartz (Hollywood, FL, USA); Burton Scott (Durham, NC, USA); Kapil Sethi (Augusta, GA, USA); Dee Silver (La Jolla, CA, USA); Carlos Singer (Miami, FL, USA); Lynn Struck (Des Moines, IA, USA); William Sunter (Melbourne, FL, USA); Daniel Truong (Fountain Valley, CA, USA); Alberto Vasquez (St Petersburg, FL, USA); Maureen Wooten Watts (Dallas, TX, USA).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>For the Xeomin US Cervical Dystonia Study Group.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This study was supported by Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
