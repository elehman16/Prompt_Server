Eight practices in each of the four states provided consent.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were the use of computerised medical records that could be audited with the PCS Clinical Audit Tool (PENCAT) and employment of a practice nurse (PN).

The facilitation was based on quality improvement (QI) whereby each practice reviewed their performance and set and reviewed goals specific to their individual circumstances and resources. Facilitators also provided telephone support as needed to practices over 12&#x02005;months. Facilitators were sourced from a local primary care organisation and all had expertise providing QI to practices. Facilitators also underwent specific training to provide the PEP intervention and were in turn supported by the research team.

This modelled dichotomous dependent variables for improvements in recording of CVD risk, BMI, WC, alcohol, BP and smoking at follow-up. These models examined the effect of the intervention on improved recording of risk factors adjusted for clustering of patients (level 1) within practices (level 2) and confounding effects of patient factors (age and gender) and practice characteristics (number of GPs and nurses and proportion of GPs/PNs working &#x02265;10&#x02005;years in primary care).</p><p>Initially we fitted a baseline variance component or empty multilevel model (no independent variables) for each of the dependent variables, followed by the multilevel model with independent variables. The significance of the fixed and random parameter variance estimates (practice variance) was assessed using the Wald joint &#x003c7;2 test statistic. The proportion of the practice level variance explained for each model was estimated as the difference in practice variance between baseline model (empty model) and each model with independent variables divided by the practice variance for the baseline model.

This is consistent with earlier research demonstrating inconsistency between the frequency of self-reported assessment and more objective measures.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Over half of the GPs and PNs reported not being confident in various preventive assessments at baseline, and remained so after a year, despite some improvement in the intervention group. This suggests the importance of developing provider skill and confidence as pre-requisites for further improvement.</p><p>The level of &#x02018;risk&#x02019; in the patient population was high and comparable with that reported generally for Australians in this age group. Despite this, where recorded, no change was found during the trial in the proportion of patients who were at risk. This is an important negative finding and is potentially explained by a couple of intervention characteristics. The PEP intervention targeted the preventive care provided by practices and practitioners for their patients, rather than providing new services directly to patients. The intervention period was also relatively short being of 6&#x02005;months duration only. We know that effective lifestyle interventions can require significant time.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> There are system barriers that may reduce the capacity of practices to improve the frequency of referral. Barriers to referral include patient (health literacy),<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> practice (team roles and time)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and system level (cost and funding, information and communication systems) factors.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The implication of this may be that more direct services to patients need to be provided in addition to practice improvement strategies to achieve change in health outcomes.</p><p>There are a number of limitations of our trial. Practices were urban and thus we cannot generalise these findings to rural or remote general practice. The trial design did not allow blinding of practitioners to their allocation. Practices were smaller than those participating in a national audit of general practices)<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> with respect to size of practice (43% had four or more GPs compared with 62.8% in the national data). All practices in our study were urban or semiurban compared with 73.9% of those national data.</p><p>Although largely comparable, there were some differences at baseline in practitioner years in general practice and in their current practice between intervention and control groups. Furthermore there were differences at baseline in the recorded frequency of smoking which made it more difficult to show improvement in this risk factor the control group. In addition, the provider questionnaire relied on self-report and as such was subject to recall and social desirability bias. While all practitioners agreed to the assessment goals, the implementation of the intervention with patients was constrained by their lack of confidence and other practical constraints. The number of practitioners was too small for multilevel analysis of their self-reported data.</p><p>The sample size was lower in the control practices due to the smaller number of practices and practitioners and thus it was insufficiently powered to show a 10% or less difference in BP and cholesterol recording between intervention and control practices. Patient medical record audits did not allow examination of other patient characteristics such as health literacy and did not allow for the measurement of assessments that had been recorded in other ways by the GP. Only a minority of the interpractice variance in CVD risk, BMI and BP recording was explained by variables included in the regression model suggesting that other factors need to be explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PEP intervention involved clinical audit, provider training, practice facilitation visits and linkage to other services. It had a positive impact on provider behaviour, as evidenced by the improved assessment and recording of smoking, WC, alcohol and absolute CVD risk. Effective implementation of preventive care in PHC is however a complex iterative process that requires ongoing support and monitoring at the patient, provider, practice and system levels. This result is extremely relevant to the role of primary care organisations in Australia which are charged with improving the quality of care. Our trial did however show no impact on patient risk. Achieving the latter may require more intensive facilitation over a longer time frame, changes to the electronic medical record to prompt preventive care, additional support of practices to make changes to their work flow and providing interventions that directly involve patients (such as telephone or online coaching).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MFH led the development of the design of the study and its protocol and the implementation of the trial.
