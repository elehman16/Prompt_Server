To prevent stroke in this high-risk population, antithrombotic treatment is necessary. Given the challenges and inherent risks of antithrombotic therapy, decision-making is particularly complex for clinicians, necessitating comprehensive risk:benefit assessments. Targeted interventions are urgently needed to support clinicians in this context; the Computerized Antithrombotic Risk Assessment Tool (CARAT) offers a unique approach to this clinical problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study (a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial) will be conducted across selected regions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Fifty GPs will be randomized to either the &#x02018;intervention&#x02019; or &#x02018;control&#x02019; arm, with each GP recruiting 10 patients (aged &#x02265;65 with AF); target sample size is 500 patients. GPs in the intervention arm will use CARAT during routine patient consultations to: assess risk factors for stroke, bleeding and medication misadventure; quantify the risk/benefit ratio of antithrombotic treatment, identify the recommended therapy, and decide on the treatment course, for an individual patient. CARAT will be applied by the GP at baseline and repeated at 12 months to identify any changes to treatment requirements. At baseline, the participant (patients and GPs) characteristics will be recorded, as well as relevant practice and clinical parameters. Patient follow up will occur at 1, 6, and 12 months via telephone interview to identify changes to therapy, medication side effects, or clinical events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This project tests the utility of a novel decision support tool (CARAT) in improving the use of preventative therapy to reduce the significant burden of stroke. Importantly, it targets the interface of patient care (general practice), addresses the at-risk population, evaluates clinical outcomes, and offers a tool that may be sustainable via integration into prescribing software and primary care services. GP support and guidance in identifying at risk patients for the appropriate selection of therapy is widely acknowledged. This trial will evaluate the impact of CARAT on the prescription of antithrombotic therapy, its longer-term impact on clinical outcomes including stroke and bleeding, and clinicians perceived utility of CARAT in practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12613000060741">ACTRN12613000060741</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>Warfarin</kwd><kwd>Bleeding</kwd><kwd>Antithrombotic therapy</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>GP</kwd><kwd>Decision support</kwd><kwd>Risk assessment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Age, atrial fibrillation, and stroke</title><p>Stroke accounts for significant morbidity and mortality globally every year, including in Australia (where this study is being conducted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Advancing age is a key non-modifiable risk factor for stroke, and this is important to recognize given that 80% of stroke sufferers are over 60 years old and that 80% of stroke-related deaths occur in those over 75 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As the population ages the incidence of stroke rises, doubling the disability burden by the year 2031 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Atrial Fibrillation (AF), commonly dubbed the &#x02018;a<italic>rrhythmia of the millennium</italic>&#x02019;, is the commonest irregular heart rhythm encountered in clinical practice, and is reportedly most prevalent in the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is infamous for its propensity to form stroke-causing thrombi in the heart chambers (atria) that can embolize to other parts of the body; these thrombo-emboli can subsequently occlude the blood vessels and disrupt the circulatory supply through to the brain, causing ischemia, i.e., stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Patients with AF have at least a 5 to 6-fold increased risk of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and in the elderly the proportion of stroke attributable to AF is at least one-third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Independently, &#x02018;old&#x02019; age and chronic AF are major risk factors for stroke but, unfortunately, both are irreversible. This complex of factors significantly compounds the risk of stroke in older people with AF, and for this reason, stroke prevention in this population is now recognized as a global health priority.</p></sec><sec><title>Stroke prevention therapy</title><p>To date, numerous large clinical trials and meta-analyses have provided convincing evidence that antithrombotics (anti-clotting agents) can prevent stroke in patients with AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Historically, antithrombotic therapy has been reliant on two key agents: warfarin (anticoagulant) and aspirin (antiplatelet). Warfarin has been reported to reduce the risk of stroke by approximately two-thirds, whilst aspirin is less effective, reducing the risk by about 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Underutilization of preventative therapies</title><p>Although highly effective antithrombotic medicines, specifically warfarin, are significantly underutilized in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; data from local Australian practice shows that this is especially true in the target at-risk older population, even in the absence of apparent contraindications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A fear of side effects underpins this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] because antithrombotics inherently increase the potential for bleeding. Therapy, therefore, requires careful patient selection, close patient monitoring (via blood tests), and regular dosage adjustment. This is particularly true for warfarin, as pharmacological characteristics render its use more challenging in patients with multiple medical comorbidities and/or polypharmacy (e.g., elderly) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, the inconvenience of therapy has led some clinicians to cite &#x0201c;old age&#x0201d; <italic>per se</italic> as a contraindication to treatment without further risk/benefit assessment, leading to the underutilization of warfarin. In older people the risk of stroke is high but so too may be the risk of medication misadventure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], giving clinicians a platform to question whether initiating life-saving anti-coagulant therapy is done at the expense of causing potentially life-threatening side-effects.</p><p>In more recent times, clinicians have been awaiting the availability of alternative agents (so-called &#x02018;novel&#x02019; oral anticoagulants - NOACs) to overcome some of these known challenges of warfarin therapy. Whilst the newer agents present viable, effective treatment alternatives (e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban), they are not without their own inherent risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of these agents must be carefully considered, before widespread use in the at-risk population can be supported. For this reason, decision-making regarding stroke prevention in AF is still largely focused on the selection of warfarin (anticoagulant) versus aspirin (antiplatelet) therapy, and has been highlighted again in the recent Australian Government Review into Anticoagulation Therapies for Atrial Fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In any case, the expanding armamentarium of treatment options for stroke prevention in AF has added to the complexity of decision-making in this clinical context.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimizing stroke prevention in general practice</title><p>Primary care is the key to optimal stroke prevention, and past guidelines have stated that &#x0201c;<italic>General Practitioners &#x02026; are the key to better stroke prevention. What is needed is proactive opportunistic screening and risk management, and prompt action for two groups of patients: those with stroke/TIA symptoms and those with atrial fibrillation</italic>&#x0201d; (National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC; (23)).</p><p>Although it is widely recognized that general practitioners (GPs) are well placed to facilitate stroke prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the EXAMINE-AF study conceded that management by a GP, compared to a cardiologist, continues to be a significant predictor for the underutilization of warfarin, even in high-risk patients with a prior history of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A national survey of Australian GPs reinforces that there is a need to support GPs in quantifying stroke risk versus bleeding risk, to eliminate misperceptions about risk and to reduce anxiety about &#x0201c;<italic>acts of commission</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Careful patient selection via risk/benefit assessment is integral to decision-making here, but guidelines <italic>per se</italic> are ineffective as they fail to demonstrate how evidence can be actioned in individual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, it has been shown that an applied comprehensive risk assessment process can significantly improve the utilization of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Using evidence-based algorithms to facilitate the systematic review of individual stroke risk and bleeding risk (taking into account medical, functional, cognitive, medication-related, and social factors), the use of antithrombotics increased (59.6% versus 81.2%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Overall, 36% of patients required changes to their existing therapy, with 76.9% of these being &#x02018;upgrades&#x02019; to more effective treatment. Following the success of this intervention, the founding risk assessment algorithm has been integrated into a key Clinical Indicator (Indicator 1.6) in the NSW Therapeutic Advisory Group&#x02019;s (TAG) &#x0201c;<italic>Indicators for Quality Use of Medicines in Australian Hospitals&#x0201d;</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Although highly effective, a limitation of the above approach is the reliance on a paper-based process that cannot be linked into an increasingly electronic and online health system. In response to clinician feedback, the CARAT, an electronic (web-based) Computerized Antithrombotic Risk Assessment Tool, has been developed to aid clinicians in selecting appropriate antithrombotic therapy in older persons with AF. Unlike paper-based guidelines, it facilitates a systematic review of risk factors and calculates the estimated risk versus benefit of therapy in an individual patient. The CARAT inputs are modeled on those used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and current evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>An exploratory study has yielded feedback from clinicians highlighting the potential utility of CARAT in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Overall the majority of clinicians: are satisfied with CARAT&#x02019;s format (94%); agree with its recommendations when applied to patient cases (72%); and agree with its estimate of stroke and bleeding risk (&#x0003e;66%). Most (63%) clinicians (geriatricians, cardiologists, neurologists, hematologists) positively indicated that CARAT was at least &#x0201c;<italic>somewhat useful</italic>&#x0201d; for their clinical practice with 22% indicating it was &#x02018;very useful&#x02019; because:</p><p>&#x0201c;Highlights functional elements that need to be considered.

Indeed, there is scope for improving the use of therapy through such a tool; preliminary data evaluating the CARAT as a screening tool shows that, in a cohort of older patients (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) with AF, less than half (44%) of those indicated for warfarin (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;126) were prescribed it; in those in whom warfarin was NOT indicated (i.e., unfavorable risk: benefit profile), 46% of patients <italic>were</italic> actually prescribed it. Furthermore, 12% of patients did not receive any preventative therapy at all, despite it being indicated and the absence of contraindications (30). The National Institute of Clinical Studies acknowledges our earlier findings and those of others, supporting the crucial need for improving stroke risk assessment and provision of information to GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study aim and objectives</title><p>Optimizing stroke prevention in general practice requires targeted interventions to address the critical need for improving stroke risk assessment and provision of information to GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

This will involve performing an individualized risk assessment and generating a treatment recommendation for their patient by carefully assessing relevant risk factors for stroke, bleeding, medication misadventure and entering this data, as guided by CARAT, into the web-based platform. CARAT will then quantify the patient&#x02019;s estimated risk of stroke versus bleeding, flag pertinent medication management issues, and generate a recommendation for therapy (warfarin, aspirin, none, other). <italic>Note: CARAT does NOT require identifiable personal information to be entered NOR is any information saved to the website.</italic></p><p>The GP will consider the CARAT output and make a final treatment decision to initiate, cease, or maintain current antithrombotic therapy.

During the baseline visit, the GP will apply CARAT to consecutive admissions over a period of 3 months and obtain the patient&#x02019;s consent to participate. GPs will print-out the completed risk-assessment template (generated by the CARAT) for subsequent review by the project officer. Each GP will then &#x02018;flag&#x02019; the patient for review and baseline data collection by the project officer by returning a purpose-designed fax-back form with basic patient details. Baseline data will be extracted from medical notes, patient interview, and a brief patient survey.</p><p>Clinical outcome data will be collected at 1, 6 and up to 12 months after the index consultation. This data will be collected from patients via follow-up telephone interview (15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;minutes) by the project officer. To verify outcomes, the GP will be contacted via phone and/or the patient&#x02019;s notes reviewed. Hospital medical records may also be reviewed where patients have been admitted for an acute event including a stroke or bleed.</p><p>A 1-month pilot study will be conducted prior to the main trial to confirm project procedures/logistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Computerized data analysis will employ SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) Version 15. ANOVA will test for differences in continuous variables. The Chi-square test will examine differences in independent proportions. Kappa analysis will detect the level of agreement between prescribers&#x02019; clinical judgment and the CARAT output. Logistic regression analysis will identify predictors of clinical events (clotting versus bleeding), and selection of antithrombotic therapy, accounting for the use of the CARAT. Survival analysis will assess mortality rates in both arms. All analyses will necessarily be based on the ITT principle; standard imputation methods (e.g., last observation carried forward) will be used to estimate missing data (withdrawal, failure to start) and data analysed according to initial group (random) allocation. All analyses will be adjusted for the effects of clustering, and set at a significance (p) level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes measured</title><p>The primary outcome measures for the intervention will include:</p><p>&#x02022;changes to therapy (initiations, changes, cessations) made following application of CARAT;</p><p>&#x02022;difference in the proportion of patients receiving no therapy;</p><p>&#x02022;overall difference in the proportion of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy;</p><p>&#x02022;difference in the proportion of patients receiving warfarin therapy;</p><p>&#x02022;difference in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse clinical outcomes (ALL events).</p><p>The secondary outcome measures will include:</p><p>&#x02022;the sustainability of prescribed therapy over time, i.e., changes to antithrombotic therapy made during patient follow-up up to 12 months;</p><p>&#x02022;incidence of any clotting (thromboembolism, stroke) events up to 12 months;</p><p>&#x02022;incidence of any bleeding (minor or major hemorrhage) events up to 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative data collection and analysis</title><p>Qualitative data is integral to this study; it will triangulate the findings regarding the utility and refinement of CARAT for future sustainable implementation in general practice (previous data focused on CARAT&#x02019;s utility in the acute care/hospital setting).</p><p>In-depth feedback will be obtained via individual face-to-face or telephone interviews. A semi-structured process will be adopted using a purpose-designed interview guide. Initially, 5 to 10 GPs in each arm will be interviewed until theme saturation is achieved. Each face-to-face interview will be digitally-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then thematically analysed using inductive coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The need for tailored sustainable interventions to optimize the use of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in at-risk patients is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which will ultimately reduce the considerable burden of stroke suffered by individuals and the global community, on the background of an ageing population. In this study, a novel decision-support tool will be tested, to assist clinicians (specifically, GPs) in their decision-making.</p><p>Given the expansion of the treatment armamentarium following the development of the NOACs, the decision-making will necessarily become more complex, and will additionally be driven by the economic implications of the potentially widespread use of newer, more expensive therapies. This study specifically considers those therapies that have been historically available in the local practice arena, for which there is vast and robust evidence-base (i.e., warfarin, aspirin). However, the findings of this study will inform the need to integrate newer therapies, and their specific benefits and limitation, within decision-support tools. Separate to evaluating the impact of this tool as a targeted intervention, this study will additionally provide data on the absolute and relative risks of clinical outcomes (e.g., changes to therapy; stroke; bleeds; mortality) in an Australian cohort of older persons with AF, and identify predictors of these (e.g., risk factors, antithrombotics prescribed).</p><p>Our unique approach in this study addresses National Research Priorities in Preventative Health and targets major health issues in effective health care including an ageing population, burden of chronic illness, and translation of evidence into practice. A key feature of this study is that it targets the interface of patient care (general practice), addresses the at-risk population, and provides evidence for the impact of the intervention by evaluating related clinical outcomes. Its innovation lies in the application of a novel computerized antithrombotic risk assessment tool, developed by the researchers, to provide GPs not only with a screening instrument, but importantly a mechanism for comprehensive risk assessment that, for the first time, quantifies the risk versus benefit of antithrombotic therapy in individual patients. Eventually, the CARAT may be integrated into prescribing software, and/or other primary care services including Medication Review and Disease State Management rendering its application in practice highly sustainable.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AF: Atrial fibrillation; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; CARAT: Computerized antithrombotic risk assessment tool; GP: General practitioner; SF36: 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey; SPSS: Statistical package for the social sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BB conceived the project, coordinated the design of the study, and prepared the manuscript.
