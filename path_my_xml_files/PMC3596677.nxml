A randomized, dose-escalating study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple oral doses of zaltoprofen in 12 healthy Chinese volunteers. Pharmacokinetics was determined from serial blood samples obtained up to 24 h after administration of a single dose of zaltoprofen at 80, 160 or 240 mg and after multiple doses of zaltqorofen at 80 mg 3 times daily. The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-24</sub> of zaltoprofen were found to be proportional to drug dose. Zaltoprofen was rapidly absorbed (t<sub>max</sub> =1.46&#x000b1;0.83 h) and cleared (t<sub>1/2</sub> =4.96&#x000b1;2.97 h). Pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple doses were similar to those after single doses. Zaltoprofen was well tolerated. These results support a tid regimen of zaltoprofen for the management of acute and chronic inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>zaltoprofen</kwd><kwd>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Zaltoprofen, a propionic acid derivative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has strong inhibitory effects on acute and chronic inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">[1]</xref>. Zaltoprofen may produce its analgesic effects through a peripheral mechanism and especially for the treatment of inflammatory conditions accompanied by pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">[2]</xref>. However, the adverse effects of zaltoprofen on gastric and small intestinal mucosa were very weak<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">[3]</xref>. In addition, zaltoprofen has more powerful inhibitory effects on bradykinin (BK)-nociception than other NSAIDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The therapeutic dose of zaltoprofen is about 80-240 mg/d given orally. High performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV) is a sensitive determination method for zaltoprofen in human plasma of the elimination phase. Although the pharmacokinetic profile of one single-dose of zaltoprofen at 160 mg in Korean healthy volunteers was studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">[5]</xref>, the pharmacokinetic profiles of zaltoprofen following single and multiple oral doses have not yet been fully characterized in Chinese volunteers. In addition, dose proportionality of the plasma levels over the therapeutic range has not been determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of zaltoprofen after single escalating oral doses (80-240 mg) and multiple doses (80 mg, 3 times daily) in healthy Chinese volunteers. The effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of zaltoprofen were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Zaltoprofen in human plasma was determined by HPLC. The Shimadzu HPLC system consisted of LC-10ATvp pumps and a SPD-10Avp UV-Vis absorbance detector (Shimadzu), operated at 332 nm, and an N2000 chromatographic workstation (Intelligent Information Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China). Liquid chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters Symmetry C18 column (250 mm, 4.6 mm, 5 &#x000b5;m).

All subjects were in good health after the assessment of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and standard laboratory test results (blood cell count, biochemical profile and urinalysis) and a negative pregnancy test result. Subjects were excluded for the following reasons: a history of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematological or vascular disease; a history of nervous system or a psychiatric disorder; women during breastfeeding or menstruating; a history of alcohol or drug abuse; allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drugs; a positive test result for hepatitis B virus; blood donation within the previous 3 months; participation in another investigational drug study within the previous 3 months; treatment with any drug during the previous 2 w or the entry into the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study designs</title><p>All subjects received in sequential order zaltoprofen orally 80, 160 and 240 mg. All doses were taken in the morning after an overnight fast (10 h). Subjects fasted 4 h after drug administration.

So the study was performed to investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics and dose proportionality of zaltoprofen in healthy Chinese volunteers following single oral doses of 80, 160, 240 mg and multiple oral doses of zaltoprofen 80 mg 3 times daily for 6 consecutive days.</p><p>Sample preparation is usually required for the determination of pharmaceuticals in biological samples owing to complex matrices in order to remove possibly interfering matrix components and increase the selectivity and sensitivity. Liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction (LLE) is a widely adopted method and often achieves satisfactory extraction recoveries of analytes from biological samples. Dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether were all tested. Diethyl ether finally chosen as the extraction solvent can not only eliminate the interference of endogenous substances, but also meet the requirement of sensitivity for the assay. For zaltoprofen is a weak acid, the extraction recovery of zaltoprofen can be improved by decreasing the pH of the plasma samples with hydrochloric acid solutions. Therefore, a 50 &#x000b5;L aliquot of 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution was added to 1 mL plasma sample before extraction. IS was applied to get high accuracy when zaltoprofen was determined in human plasma. Enalapril maleate, ibuprofen, fenbufen and ketoprofen were all investigated to find the suitable one. Ketoprofen was finally chosen as the IS because of its similarity of structure, retention time, and extraction efficiency as well as less endogenous interference in plasma. This suitable IS was useful to correct volumetric errors and to improve linearity and selectivity of the detection system. In the mobile phase, 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate buffer was added to improve the chromatographic peak shapes of zaltoprofen and IS, and obtain a good separation of target compounds.</p><p>The results of the study showed that zaltoprofen was rapidly absorbed following single oral doses, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring 1.46 to 2.33 h after administration. Mean t<sub>1/2</sub> ranged from 4.83 to 5.04 h in the subjects. The C<sub>max</sub> of zaltoprofen increased in a linear and proportional manner with increasing oral doses. The AUC and dose are also positively correlated. The t<sub>1/2</sub> and the T<sub>max</sub> did not change largely with the doses. In comparing the single-dose with the multiple-dose profile, the pharmacokinetic analysis of zaltoprofen showed similar properties. The t<sub>1/2</sub> and the T<sub>max</sub> of consecutive administrations of 80 mg zaltoprofen were similar to those of single-dose 80 mg zaltoprofen,which means that there is no significant accumulation of zaltoprofen with repeated doses. The linear pharmacokinetics and the low pharmacokinetic variability should facilitate the definition of dose regimens and the prediction of plasma levels after multiple oral administrations. As another main objective of the study, we used these data to examine the effects of sex on the pharmacokinetics of zaltoprofen. In both study parts, there were no significant differences in AUC and C<sub>max</sub> between the female and male subjects. Hence, no adjustment of dosage on the basis of sex appears needed. Though the body weight of male and female volunteers have significant difference, we need not adjust dose according to body weight.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that zaltoprofen has predictable pharmacokinetics. Zaltoprofen displays linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 80 to 240 mg after single oral doses. The compound is rapidly absorbed and cleared from plasma, which supports the use of zaltoprofen for a 3 times daily dose regimen. Zaltoprofen was not accumulated in the human body. No marked effect of sex on the disposition of zaltoprofen was observed. All these conclusions can provide reference for clinical medication.</p><p>Lee <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">[5]</xref>. described the pharmacokinetic profiles of Korean healthy volunteers after oral administration of 160 mg zaltoprofen in single-dose study.
