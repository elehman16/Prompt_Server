Randomised clinical trials [RCTs] have demonstrated that treatment with ADA results in higher rates of clinical remission and mucosal healing, and improvement in HRQL, than observed in patients who received placebo.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> ADA is also associated with a reduced risk of hospitalisation in patients with UC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>However, these data were obtained from RCTs designed primarily to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADA,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and patients with inflammatory bowel disease entering into clinical trials are not necessarily representative of those in usual practice.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Limited data are available regarding the effects of ADA on clinical outcomes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref></sup> HRQL, treatment satisfaction, health care utilisation, and health care costs in usual clinical practice. The objectives of the present multinational study were to provide such data.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>2.1. Study design and participants</title><p>This was a Phase 3b, prospective, multicentre, multinational, open-label, 26-week study [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01550965] to evaluate clinical outcomes, HRQL, treatment satisfaction, health care utilisation, and health care costs among UC patients treated with ADA following usual clinical practice. The ranked primary effectiveness endpoints of the InspirADA study were: [1] change from baseline in Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [SIBDQ] at Week 26; and [2] change [6 months after initiating ADA vs 6 months before initiating ADA] in costs of UC-related medical care excluding ADA costs. Secondary outcomes included assessment of Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] response and remission, change in HRQL measures, change in health care use, and change in health care costs. Patients with UC were enrolled at 92 sites located in Austria [2], Belgium [7], Canada [9], Czech Republic [2], Denmark [2], France [5], Germany [5], Greece [3], Ireland [4], Israel [5], Italy [5], Poland [5], Portugal [4], Russia [8], Slovakia [4], Spain [9], Sweden [1], Switzerland [1], Turkey [3], and the UK [8]. The study was conducted between May 2012 and April 2015.</p><p>Patients [18 to 75 years old] with moderate to severely active UC (defined as a Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment [PGA] &#x02265;2) and SIBDQ &#x02264; 45 at baseline, who had experienced rectal bleeding within 7 days of baseline, were enrolled in the study. Patients had to be receiving concurrent treatment defined by at least one of the following: stable oral corticosteroid [prednisolone &#x02265; 20 mg/day or equivalent] for at least 14 days prior to baseline, or stable oral corticosteroid dose [prednisolone &#x0003c; 20 mg/day or equivalent] for at least 21 days prior to baseline, and/or at least a consecutive 12-week course of azathioprine or mercaptopurine prior to baseline. Concurrent therapy was not required for patients previously treated with corticosteroid or immunosuppressant drugs who had failed to respond to or could not tolerate their treatment. Consistent with clinical practice, concomitant medications could be introduced, stopped or changed at any time at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion. Patients or their physicians had to be able to provide complete medical care resource utilisation information for the previous 6 months. Patients who had previously used any tumour necrosis factor [TNF] antagonist were eligible unless they had been treated within the past 56 days or had been a primary non-responder. Patients who had previously experienced a treatment-limiting adverse reaction to a TNF antagonist before being able to demonstrate response were not considered primary non-responders and could participate in the study.</p><p>Participants received 160/80 mg ADA at Week 0/2 followed by 40 mg ADA every other week [eow] from Week 4 through Week 24. Patients who did not respond to ADA by Week 8 [defined as PGA &#x02265; 2 and not achieving a decrease in SCCAI &#x02265; 2 points compared with baseline] were to discontinue ADA. Patients who lost response or had a flare at or after Week 8 could escalate to 40 mg ADA weekly dosing.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>2.2. Clinical outcomes</title><p>Clinical outcomes were assessed using the SCCAI, a validated measure of disease activity in UC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref></sup> The SCCAI questionnaire was completed by the physician, based on an interview and examination of the patient. Variables assessed included bowel frequency [day and night], defaecation urgency, blood in stool, general well-being, and extraintestinal manifestations [EIMs]. Higher SCCAI scores [range of 0&#x02013;19] indicate greater disease activity. Clinical response was defined as a SCCAI decrease of &#x02265; 2 points from baseline. Remission was defined as SCCAI &#x02264; 2. Absence of rectal bleeding, which has been shown to be associated with mucosal healing,<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> was also assessed by evaluating the proportion of patients reporting &#x02018;no blood in stool&#x02019; on the SCCAI. The presence of EIMs [arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, or uveitis] were collected in the SCCAI from baseline through Week 26. EIM resolution was assessed at Weeks 2, 8, and 26 and was defined as &#x02018;no reported EIM&#x02019; at the respective visit. Durable resolution from Week 2 to 26 and from Week 8 to 26 was defined as no EIM at the respective and subsequent visits. Physicians made an overall assessment of the severity of a patient&#x02019;s UC (Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment [PGA]) using the following ordinal scale: 0 = normal, 1 = mild disease, 2 = moderate disease, and 3 = severe disease.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>2.3. Health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction</title><p>HRQL, work productivity, and treatment satisfaction were assessed using validated questionnaires that were completed by patients. The SIBDQ is a disease-specific HRQL instrument that consists of 10 questions to measure the effect of inflammatory bowel disease on social, emotional, and physical well-being.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Total scores range from 10 [worst health] to 70 [best health]. A 9-point change in the SIBDQ is considered a minimal clinically important difference [MCID].<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>The European Quality of Life&#x02014;5 Dimensions&#x02014;5 Level [EQ-5D-5L] is a generic HRQL instrument that provides a standardised measure of health status, composed of the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The total index score ranges from &#x02013;0.594 to 1.000, where higher scores indicate better HRQL. The EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale [VAS] ranges from 0&#x02013;100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 the best imaginable health state. Lower index and VAS scores indicate worse HRQL.</p><p>For those employed, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment [WPAI] questionnaire was used to assess time missed from work, impairment while working, overall work impairment and, for all patients, impairment of daily activities.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> WPAI outcomes were expressed as percentage of impairment/productivity loss [range 0&#x02013;100% impairment] with higher values indicating greater impairment and less productivity. A decrease of 7% in WPAI outcome score for an individual patient is considered a MCID.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Satisfaction with medication was assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication [TSQM].<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> TSQM has 14 items across four domains: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. The TSQM items are answered on 2-, 5-, or 7-point Likert-type scales. The score for each domain is the sum of the items corresponding to each domain, which is then transformed into a 100-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with medication, greater perceived effectiveness, greater convenience, and lower burden associated with side effects.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>2.4. Resource utilisation</title><p>Health care resource utilisation was assessed by the study investigators and recorded on case report forms. Study investigators asked patients about their medications and previous/recent visits to other physicians. Any therapies that patients received and/or discontinued within the 6 months before baseline were recorded, along with whether or not the therapies were UC-related. All-cause and UC-related health care resource utilisation data during the 6-month period before baseline were collected retrospectively at baseline. During the 6-month period after baseline, data were collected prospectively at each follow-up visit. Health care resource utilisation assessment included the number of hospitalisations, days in hospital, and outpatient visits/procedures, such as unscheduled physician consultations and emergency department visits, as well as surgical and diagnostic procedures including radiology and endoscopy appointments. Investigators recorded whether hospitalisations or outpatient visits/procedures were UC-related on case report forms. Any missing resource use data were assumed to be zero. Any therapies that patients received and/or discontinued within the 6 months preceding baseline were recorded, along with whether the therapies were UC-related or not.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>2.5. Safety</title><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were documented to assess safety during the study. A structured questionnaire was designed and used to assess adverse events in this study. The items in the questionnaire included diagnosis or symptoms of the adverse event, onset date and duration of adverse event, severity of the adverse event [hospitalization, medical intervention, disability, death, congenital anomaly, miscarriage, spontaneous/elective abortion], investigator opinion of the relationship of the adverse event to adalimumab, action taken for adverse event, and other cause of adverse event. If it was a serious adverse event, a set of questionnaires was used to collect more detailed clinical information about the adverse event, laboratory data, and medication use.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>2.6. Data analyses</title><p>The safety analysis set [<italic>N</italic> = 463] consisted of all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of ADA during the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The intent-to-treat analysis set [<italic>N</italic> = 461] consisted of all patients in the safety analysis set who had data for at least one post-baseline assessment of any effectiveness measurement. Analyses of clinical outcomes, HRQL, treatment satisfaction, health care utilisation, and health care costs were performed using the intent-to-treat analysis set.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Patient disposition. <sup>a</sup>A total of 80/463 patients discontinued adalimumab [ADA] owing to a lack of efficacy; of these, 66 patients discontinued ADA by Week 8.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jjx09301"/></fig><sec id="s9"><title>2.6.1. Clinical outcomes</title><p>The proportion of patients achieving SCCAI response/remission was determined at Weeks 2, 8, and 26. Non-responder imputation [NRI] was used for response/remission when SCCAI data were missing, regardless of dose-escalation status, in the primary analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, patients who dose-escalated were assumed to be non-responders/non-remitters at Week 26. The proportion of patients reporting &#x02018;no blood in stool&#x02019; on the SCCAI was determined at Weeks 2, 8, and 26; missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward [LOCF]. The point estimates for these outcomes were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals [CIs].</p><p>The proportions of patients with EIMs at baseline and Weeks 2, 8, and 26 were calculated. Missing data were imputed using LOCF, regardless of dose-escalation status. McNemar&#x02019;s test was used to compare the presence of any EIM at Weeks 2, 8, and 26 with baseline. Resolution at Weeks 2, 8, and 26 [no reported EIM at the respective visit] and durable resolution [no EIM at the respective and subsequent visits] of any EIM from Week 2 to 26 and from Week 8 to 26 was assessed in the subset of patients with EIMs at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>2.6.2. HRQL and treatment satisfaction</title><p>Mean change from baseline to Weeks 2, 8, and 26 in SIBDQ and mean change from baseline to Week 26 in EQ-5D-5L scores, WPAI domain scores, and TSQM domain scores were assessed for statistical significance using paired <italic>t</italic> tests, and their associated 95% CIs were calculated. Missing data were imputed using LOCF, regardless of dose-escalation status. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>2.6.3. Resource use and costs</title><p>All-cause and UC-related resource use was determined by calculating the number of hospitalisations, days in hospital, and number of outpatient visits/procedures from data collected on case report forms. Direct costs were defined as medical costs associated with hospitalisations and outpatient visits/procedures and costs of all medications including ADA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Direct costs were standardised using UK National Health Service [NHS] reference costs<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> for all participating countries. All costs were obtained from the UK NHS with the exception of outpatient primary care costs, which were obtained from the Personal Social Services Research Unit.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The average cost of ADA included eow and weekly treatment and was based on the average doses taken during the study at the 2014 hospital price<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> in the UK; it should be noted that these costs may vary depending on country, contracts, and tenders. Costs associated with resource utilisation were determined by multiplying the unit costs obtained from the UK NHS or the Personal Social Services Research Unit by the number of times each resource was used. Indirect costs were defined as costs associated with work loss resulting from absenteeism and disability because of UC and were based on the WPAI questionnaire using average weekly earnings from the 2014 UK Annual Salary Survey of Hours and Earnings<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> for all participating countries. All-cause [for any reason] direct costs, all-cause medical costs, all-cause pharmacy costs, UC-related direct costs, UC-related medical costs, UC-related pharmacy costs and UC-related total costs were calculated for the 353 patients who completed the study. Total costs were the sum of direct and indirect costs. Change [defined as 6 months after initiating ADA vs 6 months previously] in resource utilisation and costs associated with health care use was determined. Comparisons of costs and resource utilisation before and after the onset of ADA were made using paired <italic>t</italic> tests. All costs were adjusted to 2014 British pounds sterling.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>2.6.4. Treatment-emergent adverse events</title><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were summarised by frequency and percentage. The treatment-emergent adverse event rate per 100 patient years of exposure to ADA was also calculated. The numerator of the rate was the total number of adverse events reported. The denominator of the rate was the total number of days exposed to ADA summed across all treated patients divided by 365.25. The adverse event rate per 100 patient-years [PY] of exposure was calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator multiplied by 100.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s13"><title>2.7.

Discussion</title><p>The present study evaluated clinical outcomes, HRQL, treatment satisfaction, health care resource utilisation, and associated costs among patients with moderate to severe UC who were treated with ADA according to usual clinical practice. Following initiation of ADA, patients with moderate to severely active UC had significant improvements in clinical symptoms as early as Week 2, and by Week 26 most patients had responded, with nearly half achieving SCCAI remission. Consistent with previously reported results,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> remission rates were lower in patients with previous exposure to TNF antagonists [42%] compared with TNF antagonist-na&#x000ef;ve patients [49%]. Significant and clinically meaningful changes in HRQL were also observed as early as Week 2 and were maintained through Week 26. Perhaps as a result of disease control and corresponding improvements in quality of life and work productivity, patients receiving ADA reported high treatment satisfaction. Significant and clinically relevant reductions in time missed from work and impairment while working, as well as improvement in ability to perform daily activities, were also observed as a result of treatment with ADA. Not only was rapid and sustained effectiveness of ADA seen for all parameters, but all-cause medical costs were halved and UC-related medical costs were reduced by three-quarters. Although the UC-related direct and indirect costs reported in this study do not offset the estimated costs of ADA therapy, the benefit to the patient is substantial, with nearly half of the patients in remission and almost 70% achieving a response by Month 6, fewer hospitalisations and surgeries, and sustained improvements in work productivity and overall quality of life, for an incremental UC-related cost of &#x000a3;719 over 6 months.</p><p>Consistent with data obtained in RCTs, data from InspirADA demonstrated that ADA is an effective treatment for UC patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Higher rates of clinical response and remission reported in the InspirADA study compared with the ULTRA trials might well be explained by methodological differences.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Similar to clinical practice, ADA dosage and concomitant medications could be adjusted any time in the study; thus, patients in the InspirADA study could continue treatment in the face of a temporary flare, as opposed to RCTs where failure rules are strictly enforced, concomitant mediation changes are generally prohibited, and patients who dose-escalate are considered non-responders. Moreover, the use of different disease activity indices may have played a role in observed differences. In most registration clinical trials, Mayo scores were calculated using mean values obtained from the patient&#x02019;s diary over several days; however, in ULTRA 1 and ULTRA 2,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the Mayo score was calculated using the worst-rank [ie highest] of three daily scores, which is likely to have resulted in a lower estimate of therapeutic effect. However, as the Mayo score is not often used in clinical practice, the SCCAI was employed in the InspirADA study. The higher response and remission rates seen in the present study are aligned with results recently reported in a real-world assessment of the effectiveness of TNF antagonists.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It is also possible that the higher responses were influenced by the fact that InspirADA was an open-label study for a drug that patients know is effective for the treatment of UC.</p><p>The strength of this study is that data were obtained in the context of the clinical practice setting, which may provide results that are more generalisable to a broader patient population than data obtained in a more restrictive, controlled clinical trial setting. Limitations of this study include the open-label, single treatment arm design; the short-term [26 weeks] nature of the study; absence of endoscopy and pharmacokinetic data; and the retrospective collection of data about previous treatment. The retrospective collection of health care utilisation data before baseline may be subject to recall bias; thus the true cost-saving effect of ADA treatment may have been underestimated in this study. In the current analysis, data were not available to comprehensively evaluate the long-term economic benefits of ADA treatment for UC patients. In the short term [within 6 months], the costs of ADA were found to be a major component of the direct costs of UC care; however, substantial benefits were also observed from reduced health care utilizations and work productivity gained. Previous studies have shown that long-term use of ADA is not only associated with substantial clinical benefits, but is also cost-effective compared with standard of care using both clinical trial data<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and real-life data.<sup><xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Data were collected from 20 countries and, since the unit price for health care utilization varies by country, the cost results may not be generalisable to individual countries. Assumptions were made for the cost analysis by extracting cost information associated with resource utilization and drugs for the UK, because the UK contributed the largest number of patients in this study [<italic>n</italic> = 90] and due to the availability of the data necessary [from the UK NHS] to perform meaningful analysis. The MCID values of 9 points for SIBDQ and 7 points for WPAI are assumed from the literature on Crohn&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and have not been validated in patients with UC.</p><p>Overall, in clinical practice, achievement of response and remission and improvements in HRQL among patients treated with ADA for UC were rapid, sustained, and clinically meaningful. Improvements in work productivity and performance of daily activities probably resulted in patient satisfaction with ADA therapy. ADA therapy significantly reduced use of health care resources and their associated costs, as well as costs of work loss resulting from absenteeism and disability among patients with moderate to severely active UC. ADA was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by AbbVie.
