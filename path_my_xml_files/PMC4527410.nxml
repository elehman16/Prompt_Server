In a pooled study of 501 individuals with cryptococcal meningitis in South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, and Thailand, mortality was 17% at 2 weeks and 34% at 10 weeks [<xref rid="JIV067C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In routine care, outcomes are substantially worse [<xref rid="JIV067C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Efforts to improve survival with early ART initiation, a beneficial strategy with other opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis [<xref rid="JIV067C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], have been unsuccessful in cryptococcosis. Two clinical trials conducted in sub&#x02013;Saharan Africa have now been halted prematurely due to increased mortality with earlier ART initiation. The first, conducted in Zimbabwe using fluconazole 800 mg/day as induction antifungal therapy, found ART initiation within 72 hours of diagnosis led to a 3-fold increase in mortality compared with ART initiation at 10 weeks [<xref rid="JIV067C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, the COAT (Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing) trial, conducted in Uganda and South Africa using amphotericin 0.7&#x02013;1 mg/kg/day and fluconazole 800 mg/day as induction therapy, found a 15% increase in all-cause mortality when ART was initiated 1&#x02013;2 weeks after diagnosis compared with deferred initiation at 5 weeks (26-week mortality, 45% vs 30%, respectively) [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The reasons for this increased mortality following early ART initiation remain unclear. In both trials, the majority of the deaths occurred within the first 4 weeks following ART initiation and was largely attributed to cryptococcosis. In the Zimbabwean trial, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was not ascertained as an endpoint; in the COAT trial, earlier ART was associated with a nonstatistical increased incidence of IRIS. Mortality in the COAT trial particularly differed among individuals with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell counts (WCCs) &#x0003c;5 cells/&#x000b5;L at time of randomization, with earlier ART being detrimental [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Paucity of CSF immune responses during CM has been identified as a major risk factor for cryptococcal-IRIS [<xref rid="JIV067C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This raises the possibility that an inflammatory mechanism related to early ART caused the excess mortality observed in these 2 trials, resulting in sudden death rather than evolving to what was clinically recognized as paradoxical IRIS.</p><p>We hypothesized that earlier ART initiation resulted in excess inflammation in persons treated for CM. To test this, we compared the immune response of COAT trial participants, in CSF and serum, between the 2 trial arms (early vs deferred ART) at equivalent time points, analyzing CSF cellular counts as well as a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and macrophage activation markers.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample Acquisition</title><p>Participants were enrolled in the COAT trial between November 2010 and April 2012 at 3 sites: Kampala, Uganda; Mbarara, Uganda; and Cape Town, South Africa (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01075152); the details of which are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, 177 ART-naive persons with cryptococcal meningitis were randomized to receive early or deferred ART initiation (7&#x02013;13 days or 5 &#x000b1; 1 weeks postcryptococcal meningitis diagnosis, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV067F1">1</xref>). All participants provided written informed consent, and site-specific institutional review board approvals were obtained. As per trial protocol, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed at diagnosis (amphotericin day 1), trial randomization (median amphotericin day 8, interquartile range [IQR], 7&#x02013;8), completion of amphotericin therapy (amphotericin day 14, median 6 days ART [IQR, 6&#x02013;7] in the early ART arm), and additionally at clinicians' discretion, to control elevated intracranial pressure. Serum samples were taken at the same time points, and additionally 21 days after diagnosis. Excess serum and CSF specimens were centrifuged, and supernatant frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Cryopreserved CSF and serum samples were shipped on dry ice (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C), thawed, and analyzed in batches at the University of Minnesota. Luminex magnetic bead technology (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) was used to analyze 19 cytokines and chemokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interferon-&#x003b3;, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]&#x02013;&#x003b1;, interleukin [IL]&#x02013;1&#x003b2;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1 [CCL2], macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]&#x02013;1&#x003b1; [CCL3], MIP-1&#x003b2; [CCL4], VEGF) according to manufacturers' protocols. Three soluble markers of macrophage activation (sCD163, sCD14, CCL22) were also measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). C-reactive protein (CRP) was run at the University of Minnesota Medical Center clinical laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis</title><p>Demographics and other baseline characteristics are summarized with proportions and median values presented with IQRs. Biomarkers analyzed as continuous variables were log<sub>2</sub> transformed for normalization, analyzed, and then back-transformed to geometric mean values. All &#x0201c;mean&#x0201d; biomarkers values are geometric means. Low (&#x0201c;out of range&#x0201d;) measurements were set to half of the manufacturer's listed assay limit of detection (LOD). CSF biomarkers with substantial proportions (&#x02265;40%) of undetectable values at diagnosis (IL-2, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-5, CCL22) were analyzed as categorical variables: &#x0201c;detectable&#x0201d; (values greater than the LOD) versus &#x0201c;nondetectable (values lower than the LOD). CSF WCC was analyzed in terms of absolute values, and also classified as &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;elevated&#x0201d; (&#x0003c;5 vs &#x02265;5 cells/&#x000b5;L, respectively). Means and proportions were compared between trial arms (early vs deferred ART) at equivalent time points. Biomarkers were also compared between participants with CSF WCC &#x0003c;5 cells/&#x000b5;L and those with CSF WCC &#x02265;5 cells/&#x000b5;L at amphotericin day 8 (COAT randomization), as differential outcomes occurred among this group in the COAT trial [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Randomization for the COAT trial was stratified by site. However, due to significant differences between sites in terms of baseline characteristics (specifically higher CD4 and CSF white cells in Cape Town), additional subgroup analyses were performed for participants enrolled in Kampala&#x02014;the largest site where the majority of mortality occurred. Overall tests of heterogeneity (interaction tests) evaluating biomarker treatment differences across participants in Kampala versus the other 2 sites are provided. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, Fisher's exact, and linear regression models as appropriate; plots were generated with R statistical software 2.10.1 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.R-project.org">www.R-project.org</uri>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Number of Participants and Samples Available</title><p>Of the 177 participants enrolled in the COAT trial, 155 were alive and remained enrolled at amphotericin day 14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV067F1">1</xref>). CSF WCCs were measured for 166, 146, and 120 participants at amphotericin days 1, 8, and 14, respectively. Participants missing CSF WCC measurements typically had blood-stained CSF. Stored CSF specimens were available for 167, 115, and 121 participants, and stored serum samples were available for 168, 161, and 151 at the same time points; a further 136 participants had serum available 21 days after diagnosis. Due to the low volume of stored CSF at the Mbarara site, it was not possible to measure concentrations of the 3 macrophage-specific biomarkers (sCD163, sCD14, CCL22) in this group of participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>Details of the clinical cohort have been previously reported [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Median CD4 count for COAT participants with samples available was 28 (IQR, 11&#x02013;75) cells/&#x000b5;L and median HIV viral load 5.5 (IQR, 5.2&#x02013;5.8) log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL. There were no significant differences between study arms in baseline demographics and markers of CM severity (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale score or fungal burden) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIV067TB1">1</xref>). However, there were clear differences in participants between study sites. Participants in Kampala had significantly lower CD4 cell counts at enrollment and were more likely to have CSF WCC &#x0003c;5 cells/&#x000b5;L throughout the 14-day induction antifungal therapy period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIV067TB2">2</xref>). Through 14 days, mortality rates were 17%, 6% and 0%, for Kampala, Mbarara, and Cape Town, respectively, among patients surviving to trial enrollment and randomization (median day 8).

The excess deaths associated with early ART in the trial occurred primarily within the first 2&#x02013;5 weeks after meningitis diagnosis and were particularly increased among participants with a paucicellular CSF response at randomization (ie, WCC &#x0003c;5/&#x000b5;L, 32% higher mortality with early ART) [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This study examines the effect of early ART initiation on the host immune response in an attempt to explain the pathophysiology behind the excess mortality observed in the COAT trial.</p><p>Early ART initiation was associated with an increased proportion of participants with CSF white cell infiltrate by day 14 of amphotericin. This was particularly marked among participants who had an initial paucity of CSF white cells (&#x0003c;5/&#x000b5;L). By day 14, 28% of such participants in the early ART arm (with CSF white cells&#x0003c;5/&#x000b5;L) had developed a CSF cellular infiltrate and an additional 19% had died, compared with 0% with cellular infiltrate in the deferred ART arm and only 4% mortality. We hypothesize that this influx of cells into the CSF represents a detrimental, ART-driven, immune response that may explain the excess mortality observed with early ART initiation in CM. Furthermore, in Kampala, persons receiving early ART had increased CSF concentrations of sCD163, sCD14, and MIP-1&#x003b1; at day 14. This is consistent with increased macrophage activation in the central nervous system (CNS), and the increased CSF IL-13 suggests a Th2 skew to the immune response in those receiving early ART [<xref rid="JIV067C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Th2 immune responses have been shown to be detrimental during infection with intracellular organisms such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, whereas Th1 responses are protective [<xref rid="JIV067C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the overall cohort, mean CSF IL-13 concentrations increased from diagnosis to day 14 by approximately 20% with early ART, and by approximately 100% with early ART in Kampala participants. Among persons deferring ART, CSF IL-13 levels declined by approximately 40% over 14 days. Conversely, CSF concentrations of interferon-&#x003b3; gradually declined by approximately 50% in both arms over 14 days as the infection was treated. Given that the majority of mortality occurred in Kampala, the finding that early ART was associated with increased CNS macrophage activation and Th2 response (just 6&#x02013;7 days after ART initiation) in Kampala participants further supports the hypothesis that ART-associated immunopathology was likely responsible for the increased mortality observed in this trial.</p><p>In the COAT trial, there was no statistically significant increase in paradoxical CM&#x02013;IRIS with early ART initiation (20%) versus deferred ART (13%) (<italic>P</italic> = .32) [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is in contrast to the increased incidence of tuberculosis-IRIS reported with early ART in HIV-associated tuberculosis [<xref rid="JIV067C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the case definition of paradoxical CM-IRIS specifies that persons must undergo a pattern of clinical improvement prior to their ART-associated clinical deterioration [<xref rid="JIV067C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the COAT trial, early ART was often initiated prior to the resolution of meningitis symptoms, making it difficult to identify such a biphasic clinical course with distinct second events. Yet, the hypothesis that early ART resulted in adverse inflammatory responses is supported by the ART-associated CSF cellular infiltrate occurring exclusively among participants who failed to mount a CSF leukocyte pleocytosis initially (WCC &#x0003c;5/&#x000b5;L). This was the same subgroup of participants found to be at high risk of mortality with early ART in the COAT trial, and the same group previously shown to be at &#x0003e;3-fold increased risk of CM-IRIS [<xref rid="JIV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further examination of participants in this study with a paucicellular CSF response prior to ART initiation showed they also had significantly reduced CSF macrophage activation markers (sCD14, sCD163) and significantly increased serum IL-4 and IL-17 concentrations prior to ART. Pre-ART elevations of IL-4 and IL-17 have previously been reported in persons who subsequently developed CM-IRIS after starting ART [<xref rid="JIV067C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is possible this group in the COAT trial may have responded similarly.</p><p>In the Kampala subgroup, we detected increased CSF markers of macrophage activation (sCD14 and sCD163) among participants receiving early ART. CD163 is a haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenging receptor found on the surface of monocytes, macrophages, and activated microglia [<xref rid="JIV067C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; it is cleaved from the cell surface in response to cellular activation, and concentrations of soluble CD163 (sCD163) are considered an accurate reflection of macrophage and monocyte activation [<xref rid="JIV067C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In HIV infection, serum concentrations are positively correlated with HIV-1 viral load, inversely correlated with CD4 count, and fall following ART initiation [<xref rid="JIV067C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, sCD163 levels were also significantly reduced in serum among individuals receiving early ART but were significantly increased in CSF. This suggests an early differential ART effect on the host immune response at the site of disease. Monocyte or macrophages have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of paradoxical tuberculosis-IRIS [<xref rid="JIV067C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The increased CSF sCD163 levels noted herein imply that CNS macrophage and/or microglia activation may play a role in the early ART-associated mortality observed.</p><p>CD14 is also found on monocytes, macrophages, and activated microglia, and functions as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide as well as glucuronoxylomannan cryptococcal antigen [<xref rid="JIV067C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV067C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar to sCD163, CD14 can also be released from the cell surface in response to a range of stimuli, and thereafter is detectable as soluble CD14 (sCD14) [<xref rid="JIV067C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Serum concentrations of sCD14 are elevated in HIV-1 infection, possibly due to translocation of microbial components through the intestinal wall, and sCD14 levels are associated with increased mortality [<xref rid="JIV067C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Raised CSF sCD14 has also been reported in bacterial meningitis, both in hospitalized patients and mouse models [<xref rid="JIV067C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In these studies, CSF sCD14 elevations appeared to result from increased intrathecal production by infiltrating blood white cells rather than diffusion across the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="JIV067C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to being a marker of monocyte-macrophage activation, sCD14 augments the CSF immune response, leading to increased proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="JIV067C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Elevated CSF MIP-1&#x003b1;/CCL3 also occurs in bacterial and tuberculosis meningitis [<xref rid="JIV067C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and an increased CSF CCL3/CXCL10 ratio prior to ART initiation is associated with future cryptococcal-IRIS [<xref rid="JIV067C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to its chemotactic activities, MIP-1&#x003b1; also modulates the immune response by stimulating proinflammatory cytokine production from a variety of cells [<xref rid="JIV067C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is possible that sCD14 and MIP-1&#x003b1;/CCL3 may play a similar role here, not only reflecting increased macrophage activation within the CNS, but providing insight into the mechanism by which ART initiation may lead to a detrimental proinflammatory immune response.</p><p>Previous cryptococcal-IRIS studies have demonstrated CSF elevations in many proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-&#x003b1;, interferon-&#x003b3;, G-CSF, IL-6) [<xref rid="JIV067C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this trial, IL-13 was the only T-cell&#x02013;related cytokine increased with early ART. However, CSF was only systematically sampled 6 days after ART initiation. Had later samples been collected, it is possible that an evolution in CNS immune response may have been demonstrated: from cellular infiltrate, increased macrophage activation and chemokine secretion, to widespread elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. In a separate COAT trial analysis using flow cytometry, highly activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells predominated in CSF at diagnosis (median CD4:CD8 ratio = 0.06), yet at paradoxical-IRIS, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had increased in CSF (median CD4:CD8 ratio = 0.33) [<xref rid="JIV067C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the CSF effects observed with early ART, there was no evidence to suggest early ART led to increased systemic inflammatory response. Serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations were not elevated, and CRP initially decreased. This may reflect compartmentalization of immune response, which has been reported in tuberculosis meningitis paradoxical-IRIS, where individuals had marked elevation in CSF proinflammatory cytokines but little change in serum [<xref rid="JIV067C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in our study at 21 days, serum CRP was higher among persons receiving early ART (median 14 days of ART), possibly reflecting the evolution of inflammatory response on the path to paradoxical cryptococcal-IRIS in certain patients [<xref rid="JIV067C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="JIV067C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>There are limitations of this study.

In addition, some of the significant findings reported here are from subgroup analyses; this was considered appropriate given the heterogeneity in demographics, clinical parameters, and immune response between the 3 trial sites. Finally, CSF was not available for all study subjects at day 14 (due to early mortality, approximately 10% LP refusal, and approximately 8% normalized intracranial pressure with a small volume of CSF collected); however, CSF was available for over 80% of trial participants.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study provides a unique insight into the immunologic changes that occurred when patients with CM received early ART initiation. Given the findings of the COAT trial, it is unlikely a similar trial should or will be repeated. The data presented herein provide evidence suggesting early ART led to a CSF cellular infiltrate, CNS macrophage/microglial activation, and skew toward a Th2 immune response. These findings support the hypothesis that the increased mortality associated with early ART in the COAT trial was immunologically mediated with compartmentalized neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiv067/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
