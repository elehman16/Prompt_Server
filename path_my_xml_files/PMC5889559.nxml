Furthermore, there is growing emphasis on involving patients in their own treatment as a key to health behavior change. Research on the benefit of having patients choose their treatment from among options, in contrast to being assigned to a treatment by experts, has been limited. Consequently, we designed a rigorous test of patient self-matching to determine whether it does improve retention, adherence, and outcome in alcoholism treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The present study is being conducted as a randomized controlled trial. Four hundred consecutive patients aged 18 years or older will be enrolled and randomized to either self-matching or expert-matching to one of five different treatment approaches. All patients entering the alcohol outpatient clinic in Odense are offered the opportunity to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are cognitive dysfunction as measured with the Mini Mental State Examination, and non-Danish- or non-English-speaking individuals. The following instruments will be administered at intake to provide standardized measures of alcohol problems: the Addiction Severity Index, Timeline Followback, the World Health Organization quality of life questionnaire, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory 3, and the Personal Happiness Form. For each outcome measure, two analyses will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) will be carried out with all patients, regardless of whether they complete the interventions or are reinterviewed. Regarding incomplete data, multiple imputations will be used together with ITT analysis. Completer analyses will also be carried out with patients who complete their respective interventions. The primary outcome is decrease in number of monthly excessive drinking days 6 months after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes are compliance and 2 quality of life. The influence of personality traits on outcome will also be examined in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The debate on matching patients to treatment has been going on for decades.

The central concepts are that patients should take an active role in choosing and implementing their own care and that health care systems should actively support and honor patients&#x02019; self-determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">A related line of research in alcoholism treatment pertains to patient-treatment matching. On the basis of the idea that different kinds of patients may respond differently to different treatment approaches, the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism funded the largest randomized trial of alcoholism treatment methods ever conducted: Project MATCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The primary purpose of this project was to test matching hypotheses regarding which patients would respond optimally to three very different treatments: cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step facilitation therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy. The principal investigators of this trial, who were prominent alcoholism treatment researchers in the United States, generated two dozen <italic>a priori</italic> matching hypotheses. The project included replication of nearly every matching effect that had been reported in prior clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and represented top experts&#x02019; predictions regarding which patients should be assigned to which treatments. The stunning finding of Project MATCH was that even with a very large sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 1726), very few of the hypotheses were confirmed as statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nearly all previously reported matching effects failed to be confirmed, and several emerged in a direction opposite to prediction. In a partial replication of the MATCH study, the UK Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT) research team conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with two different treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. They similarly found improvement in alcohol consumption with all treatment methods, with no difference between the groups or confirmation of matching predictions. In other words, the best &#x0201c;guesses&#x0201d; of some of the field&#x02019;s most experienced alcoholism treatment researchers in two nations were little better than chance when it came to choosing the best treatment approaches for patients.</p><p id="Par15">Another major attempt at expert matching was a set of patient placement criteria promulgated by the American Society of Addiction Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As it became clear that the outcomes of inpatient programs were no different, on average, from those of less costly outpatient options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], insurance companies dramatically reduced reimbursement for inpatient treatment. In response, a group of treatment program directors in northern Ohio developed a consensus set of decision rules, known as the <italic>Cleveland criteria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], to defend the allocation of patients to particular levels of care. These rules were subsequently published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and were then revised into even more complex decision systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Six types of data from an extensive evaluation are used to recommend which of six levels of care a patient should receive.</p><p id="Par16">If an expert matching system such as this one is valid, then patients who are matched to treatment on the basis of these criteria should have better outcomes than those who are mismatched. The few studies of these criteria to date have provided little evidence for their efficacy. One early study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated no significant improvement in 6-month outcomes for matched versus mismatched cases given outpatient treatment (level II, Cleveland criteria). Similarly, only one of several potential matches was statistically significant in another study of inpatient treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These studies were limited to evaluation of one level of care. Four trials with patients receiving different levels of care also found little support for this expert matching system. Two of these reported only one &#x0201c;significant&#x0201d; match of the many tested, with no Bonferroni correction for the number of hypotheses tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The third, a random assignment trial, found no significant matches at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The fourth, a multicenter observational follow-up study, found that only 24.4% of patients were matched properly to the treatment planned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One naturalistic study in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] comparing only two levels of care found that cases given less intensive treatment than recommended showed higher attrition, less improvement in severity, and no significant reduction in substance use when compared with matched cases who were offered the recommended level of care. In summary, the findings are quite mixed, and once again, a complex expert system for placing patients into the best treatment for them appears to be little better than chance.</p><p id="Par17">The difficulties experts have in matching patients to treatment and developing useful algorithms have led many researchers to question whether matching based on patient characteristics is optimal for improving treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Are there other aspects of treatment and treatment allocation that are more important? If experts are not particularly good at deciding which alcoholism treatment is best for patients, how else might matching be done?</p><p id="Par18">One option is, for instance, to allow patients to match themselves, to make an informed choice from among a menu of evidence-based treatment options. This may not be feasible in smaller programs that may have few staff members; however, in larger systems where more than one treatment option can be provided, it would be feasible to allow patients to choose for themselves. Patient preference is increasingly being considered as good practice in health care, such as when there are several cancer treatment options available with similar overall evidence of efficacy. Patients can be given a fair description of the options open to them and permitted to make an informed choice of which treatment they prefer.</p><p id="Par19">It is still not clear if taking patient preferences into account when choosing between treatment options improves treatment outcome. Authors of a systematic review of the literature on shared decision making in treatment of substance use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that only 3 of 25 trials revealed a significant effect when treatments were matched to patients&#x02019; preferences. The authors stated, however, that the results should be interpreted with caution owing to heterogeneity of the included studies. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] showed that informed choice improved adherence and reduced the amount of smoked cigarettes in a smoking cessation intervention program for patients in treatment for chemical dependency. On the contrary, a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] of women with alcohol use disorder, who were given the opportunity of choosing between individual therapy or conjoint treatment with their male partner, showed that the number of patients enrolled in treatment increased, but there was no additional improvement in adherence or reduced drinking days. The two groups also differed significantly in sociodemographic variables that could influence outcome.</p><p id="Par20">There are at least two good reasons for offering patients a choice when the treatment goal is behavior change. The first is that patients are likely to have some wisdom about which behavior change approach is most likely to work for them. Who knows them better? They certainly would know which approaches sound more acceptable or attractive to them. Second, there can be an inherent motivational advantage of choosing one&#x02019;s own course of action. As Miller et al. stated,<disp-quote><p id="Par21">When people perceive that they have freely selected, from among options, a product or course of action, they are likely to be more satisfied with it and committed to it. There is evidence that taking active steps toward change increases the likelihood of successful change, no matter what the action happens to be. If what matters is that the client do <italic>something</italic> and stick with it, then it makes sense to allow clients to select that to which they will be most committed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par22">To our knowledge, however, research is limited on the benefit of having patients freely choose their treatment approach from among options, in contrast to the usual practice of their being assigned to a treatment based on expert clinical judgment. Because there is little evidence that clinical judgment is more effective than chance in choosing optimal treatments, it is reasonable to conduct a rigorous test of patient self-matching to determine whether it does indeed improve retention, adherence, and outcome in alcoholism treatment. As part of the RESCueH studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], in the present randomized clinical trial, we will compare the efficacy of patient self-matching versus treatment-as-usual expert matching.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Purpose and hypotheses</title><p id="Par23">The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if patient self-matching to psychotherapy treatment methods improves drinking outcome, compliance, and quality of life for patients being treated for alcohol problems compared with assignment to treatment as usual, which is by means of expert matching.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>A priori hypotheses</title><p id="Par24">Our a priori hypotheses are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par25">Patients who choose their own treatment will show significantly greater reductions in alcohol consumption (measured by number of days with excessive drinking) at follow-up, when compared with patients assigned to treatment by expert matching.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Patients who choose their own treatment method will show significantly better compliance in treatment (measured by retention) when compared with patients assigned to a specific treatment method by expert matching.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par27">The present study is being conducted as a randomized controlled trial.

These data are used in the algorithm for expert matching. This interview is also mandatory regardless of whether patients participate in the Self-Match Study because the data are used to plan specific treatment sessions in all the treatment offers. Furthermore, this design ensures that expert matching is treatment as usual. All treatment methods in the study are part of the normal treatment modalities offered at the center, which means that patients who choose not to participate in the study will receive the same treatment as participants. They are assigned to treatment by algorithm as usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experimental referral routines</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Self-matching</title><p id="Par43">At the first baseline interview, the five treatment options that are offered by the treatment center are presented to patients in a short video presentation conducted by the first author.

The first author or a research assistant will answer any further questions about the format of all treatment options, logistics, and other aspects, but no specific choice of either of the treatment options will be or recommended or favored. The first author or a research assistant will stress that all five treatment methods are evidence-based and effective, at least for some patients.

This is already standard procedure in the clinic for everyone receiving treatment, regardless of participation in the study.

We assume the SD will be the same for the reduced number of days. Most likely it will be smaller, because less than zero days of excessive drinking is impossible; that is, the method is conservative. As stated by Miller and Manuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], this power calculation is based on practitioners&#x02019; judgment of a meaningful difference in outcome rather than on statistical significance based on other studies. By this approach, a total sample of 200 patients in each group is needed to have 90% power to detect a difference of this magnitude using a 0.05% level of statistical significance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We expect that the proportion of patients assigned to each of the five treatments will differ between the two groups; hence, type of treatment, sociodemographic data, and problem severity will be integrated into the analysis as explanatory variables.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Power calculation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2592_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par59">For each outcome measure, two analyses will be carried out:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par60">Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) will be carried out on all patients, regardless of whether they complete the interventions or are reinterviewed.

Several studies, including Project MATCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and UKATT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], have shown that matching patients to treatment is little better than chance, and they have not been able to clarify which aspects of matching improve outcome. In the present study, we will investigate the importance of patient <italic>personal choice</italic> rather than clinician matching patient to treatment based on patient characteristics. Hence, the present study will cast light on whether patients&#x02019; perceived autonomy yields better treatment outcome. In addition, personality traits will be measured to investigate whether they influence the impact of patients&#x02019; free choice on treatment outcome.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Challenges</title><p id="Par69">On the basis of a pilot study of 16 patients that showed a higher preference for supportive therapy in the self-matching group than in the expert matching group, we expect that the proportion of patients assigned to the five treatments may differ between the two groups. This will be controlled for in the analysis to clarify whether it is the therapy method or self-matching that causes any observed difference in outcome.</p><p id="Par70">Some would argue that 50% reduction in excessive drinking days is optimistic and therefore would criticize the power calculation. The power calculation is based on clinicians&#x02019; estimation of what would constitute a clinically meaningful outcome, however, rather than on statistical significance derived from former studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Innovative aspects</title><p id="Par71">All patients who seek treatment at the center will undergo exactly the same intake procedure, including baseline interviews, for this study. This procedure will provide an opportunity to generate a hypothesis of motives to participate or not participate in studies, because the difference between participating or not is reduced to a single 6-month follow-up interview that will take about 45 minutes to complete. Another innovative aspect is that personality traits will be compared with outcomes in both groups and thereby will provide information on any differences in personality traits of those who profit from self-matching and those who profit from expert matching.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par72">The second version of the protocol was accepted on 17 November 2016.
