dogs with epilepsy continue experiencing seizures, emphasising the importance for new
treatment strategies to improve the quality of life of people or dogs with epilepsy. A
6-month prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over dietary
trial was designed to compare a ketogenic medium-chain TAG diet (MCTD) with a standardised
placebo diet in chronically antiepileptic drug-treated dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. Dogs
were fed either MCTD or placebo diet for 3 months followed by a subsequent respective
switch of diet for a further 3 months. Seizure frequency, clinical and laboratory data
were collected and evaluated for twenty-one dogs completing the study. Seizure frequency
was significantly lower when dogs were fed the MCTD (2&#x000b7;31/month, 0&#x02013;9&#x000b7;89/month) in
comparison with the placebo diet (2&#x000b7;67/month, 0&#x000b7;33&#x02013;22&#x000b7;92/month, <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;020);
three dogs achieved seizure freedom, seven additional dogs had &#x02265;50 % reduction in seizure
frequency, five had an overall &#x0003c;50 % reduction in seizures (38&#x000b7;87 %, 35&#x000b7;68&#x02013;43&#x000b7;27 %)
and six showed no response. Seizure day frequency were also significantly lower when dogs
were fed the MCTD (1&#x000b7;63/month, 0&#x02013;7&#x000b7;58/month) in comparison with the placebo diet
(1&#x000b7;69/month, 0&#x000b7;33&#x02013;13&#x000b7;82/month, <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;022). Consumption of the MCTD also
resulted in significant elevation of blood <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hydroxybutyrate
concentrations in comparison with placebo diet (0&#x000b7;041 (<sc>sd</sc> 0&#x000b7;004)

were no significant changes in serum concentrations of glucose (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;903),
phenobarbital (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;422), potassium bromide (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;404) and
weight (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;300) between diet groups. In conclusion, the data show
antiepileptic properties associated with ketogenic diets and provide evidence for the
efficacy of the MCTD used in this study as a therapeutic option for epilepsy

excessive, synchronous neuronal firing patterns<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Despite ongoing research in understanding the pathophysiological manifestation
of seizures and epilepsy, the cellular mechanisms remain elusive. As a result, approaches
towards antiepileptic therapy are usually directed towards the control of seizures, most
commonly chronic administration of antiepileptic drugs (AED), rather than prevention of
epileptogenesis or comorbidities. Despite appropriate AED treatment, approximately one-third
of dogs and humans with idiopathic epilepsy continue to experience seizures that are difficult
to control<sup>(</sup>

polydipsia and incontinence in dogs as well as behavioural, sedative, cognitive or psychiatric
adverse reactions in humans also contribute to reduction in QoL<sup>(</sup>

welfare of people with epilepsy.</p><p>A myriad of anecdotal reports and some published literature have suggested the importance of
dietary manipulation in seizure management<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">

treatment strategy for canine epilepsy<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The &#x02018;classic&#x02019; KD consisting of high fat, low protein and low carbohydrate,
typically with ratios of up to 4:1 fats to proteins and carbohydrates, was first introduced in
the 1920s for use in patients with childhood epilepsy<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Wilder initially suggested the use of the KD in order to mimic the metabolic
state and biochemical changes associated with fasting, as fasting was shown to possess
anticonvulsant properties<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. A randomised controlled trial on childhood epilepsy showed promising results
with 38 and 7 % of children on KD diets having &#x0003e;50 and 90 % seizure reduction,
respectively. In comparison, only 6 % of the children on control diets achieved &#x0003e;50 %
seizure reduction, with no children achieving &#x0003e;90 % seizure reduction<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, other KD, some with improved palatability and diet toleration, have been
proposed. These include the modified Atkins diet<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>

<sup>)</sup> and diets that involve intermittent energitic restriction<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The conventional MCTKD is based on high proportions, 60 % or greater daily
calories, of dietary fats in which at least 30 % and up to 60 % consists of medium-chain TAG
(MCT)<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Such MCTKD diets, containing high proportions of dietary fats, have still been
perceived as problematic due to palatability and diet restrictiveness.</p><p>The MCTKD utilise medium-chain (C6&#x02013;C12) fatty acids, with the main constituents being
octanoic and decanoic TAG, as an alternative fat source rather than long-chain TAG (LCT)
implemented in the &#x02018;classic&#x02019; KD<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In comparison, MCT in humans and dogs are more efficiently digested and absorbed
via the gastrointestinal tract, and the resulting medium-chain fatty acids are transported by
the portal vein to the liver where they are subsequently metabolised and converted primarily
into ketone bodies<sup>(</sup>

</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">

yields per kilocalorie of dietary energy in comparison with LCT<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. However, a randomised trial comparing a MCTKD and the &#x02018;classic&#x02019; KD, over a
period of 3, 6 and 12 months in 145 children with intractable epilepsy, showed no significant
differences in responder rates, seizure frequency reduction and tolerability between the
diets<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Other studies evaluating the effectiveness of MCTKD have also shown
anticonvulsant properties to varying degrees<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite the unknown mechanisms of action of the KD, the antiepileptic properties of the KD in
children have led to its proposal as a new treatment option for canine epilepsy. Recently, a
novel diet with relatively low MCT levels (medium-chain TAG diet (MCTD)) developed for canine
consumption was shown to be ketogenic and useful as a dietary strategy for cognitive
enhancement in aged dogs<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. This MCTD inherently is a potential candidate to investigate its effects on
epilepsy. It is thought that canine epilepsy is not only naturally occurring but also similar
in aetiology, heterogeneity, clinical manifestations and pathology to its human counterpart,
and thus acts as a good translational model<sup>(</sup>

ketogenic MCTD in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy compared with a standardised placebo control
diet.</p><sec sec-type="general" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the International
Cooperation of Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary
Products (VICH) GL9 Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and the European Agency for the evaluation
of Medical Products (EMEA). The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics and Welfare
Group (EWG) (URN 2011 1132). The diet allocations were randomised and only available to the
study nurse who was also the diet dispenser; therefore, dog owners, investigators and
statisticians involved were blinded throughout the study. Furthermore, owners were also
blinded from the content of both the MCTD and the placebo diet and were unaware that the
study involved KD.</p><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="general"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study comprised of a 6-month prospective, randomised, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled, cross-over dietary trial comparing the MCTD to a standardised placebo
diet for canine epilepsy. Dogs were fed either the MCTD or the placebo diet for 3 months
(day 1 to day 90&#x000b1;2 d) followed directly by a subsequent respective switch of diet for a
further 3 months (day 90 to day 180&#x000b1;2 d). Relevant data were collected on the following
variables at visit 1 (day 2), visit 2 (day 90 (<sc>sd</sc> 2) d) and visit 3 (day 180
(<sc>sd</sc> 2) d): seizure frequency (generalised seizures); body weight; measurements
of serum phenobarbital (PB) and/or potassium bromide (KBr) concentrations as appropriate;
dynamic bile acids; complete blood cell count; standard clinical serum chemistry; adverse
events; and visual analogue score (VAS) for ataxia, sedation and QoL.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="general"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through different media in the UK based on the following
inclusion criteria that were verified by telephone interviews with owners, followed by
physical and laboratory examinations: canine species of mixed or purebred breeds;
suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy (unremarkable former MRI scan); aged between 6
months and &#x02264;12 years; weighing between 4 and &#x02264;65 kg; no clinically significant findings on
haematology and biochemistry or dynamic bile acid results; have unremarkable interictal
neurological examinations for a dog on antiepileptic treatment; only one dog per household
enroled to the study; have had at least three seizure episodes in the previous 3 months
before the start of this study; on at least one antiepileptic treatment; and no use of
drugs that could influence the metabolism of PB and KBr. Dogs intended for breeding in
&#x0003c;2 weeks from the start of study; with known cause of epilepsy such as brain
neoplasm, brain trauma, encephalitis and meningitis; with chronic or acute renal, hepatic
or cardiac failure; with an acute or surgical condition at the time of enrolment; and
bitches known or suspected to be pregnant or lactating were all excluded from the study.</p><p>Owners of dogs meeting all the above-mentioned criteria received further information,
both verbally and in writing, on all aspects of the study, including information about the
protocol and explanations about the seizure frequency diary that was to be completed at
home. Dogs were enroled as an individual experimental unit and independent of other dogs.
A unique study case number, consisting of a two-digit number, ascending in a chronological
order of enrolment, was allocated and used to identify each dog on all documents and
samples throughout the study. Twenty-one dogs were included in the analysis and all of
them completed the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="general"><title>Visual analogue score</title><p>VAS was recorded for ataxia, sedation and QoL using a line ranging from 0 to 100 mm. The
observer was asked to draw a secondary intersecting line perpendicular to the line of
measurement that best represented the subjective severity. A perpendicular line at 0 mm
represented &#x02018;asymptomatic/normal&#x02019; and at 100 mm represented either &#x02018;ataxia so severe dog
is unable to walk&#x02019; or &#x02018;sedation to the extent dog only sleeps&#x02019; or &#x02018;QoL is so poor
euthanasia is requested&#x02019;, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="general"><title>Experimental food</title><p>The experimental placebo and test formulae were dry extruded kibble (Nestle Purina
PetCare) formulated to meet or exceed the nutritional guidelines established by the
Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Both formulae were of the same
ingredient composition, and formulated to contain &#x0003c;10 % moisture, at least 28 %
crude protein, at least 15 % crude fat and 50 % carbohydrates with &#x0003c;2 % as crude
fibre. The only compositional exception was that zero MCT were added to the placebo
formula, and lard was used as fat substitute to ensure that the formulae were isoenergetic
(1560&#x000b7;6 kJ/100g (373 kcal/100 g)), whereas the test formula contained 5&#x000b7;5 % MCT. MCT
content was about 10 % of the total formula calories (based on fat as 35&#x000b7;6 kJ/g (8&#x000b7;5
kcal/g) and MCT as 28&#x000b7;5 kJ/g (6&#x000b7;8 kcal/g)). Proximate analysis of both formulae indicated
that they were of similar composition, with the exception of MCT, as the placebo diet was
void of C12, C10 and C8 fatty acids (each &#x0003c;0&#x000b7;100 % of placebo formula). Both
formulae exceeded the AAFCO minimum requirements for essential fatty acids. The dogs were
housed and fed mainly once or twice daily at home with no restrictions on water
consumption. The owners were educated to keep the diet consistent throughout the study
period. The amount of food given per day was calculated according to the weight of each
dog in order to provide sufficient food to fulfil their nutritional requirements. A
deviation of &#x000b1;10 % food consumption (kg) was allowed to account for the individual needs
of each dog, taking into consideration differences in activity level and physical
condition. Dogs were restricted to consumption of the study diet, and thus treats or
snacks were replaced by the respective placebo or MCTD food.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5" sec-type="general"><title>Ketone body measurements</title><p>Three sets of blood samples were collected from the dogs over the duration of the study

of period 2 &#x02013; day 180 (<sc>sd</sc> 2) d). Blood samples were collected 2 h after
consumption of the respective diets and routine concomitant AEDs. Blood samples were
collected and stored using clotting activator dipotassium EDTA-containing (with
serum-separation gel) polypropylene blood-collection tubes and plain polypropylene
blood-collection tubes (International Scientific Supplies Ltd). Blood samples were allowed
to clot and serum was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Serum samples were analysed for

(colorimetric) reaction assay as directed by following the kit manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol
(C444-0A; Catachem Inc.) and using an Olympus AU 640e (Beckman Coulter) chemistry analyser
for measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6" sec-type="general"><title>Adverse events and concomitant treatments</title><p>Any abnormal health observation that was unfavourable, unintended and occurred after
enrolment, regardless of whether it was considered as an MCTD- or a placebo diet-related
event, was reported to the investigator and documented (online Supplementary Table S1).
Details of the adverse event include the following: a description of the adverse event;
length of the adverse event recorded in days; severity of the adverse event recorded using
1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe and 4=serious; frequency of the adverse event measured using
1=once, 2=occasionally, 3=regularly and 4=ongoing; concomitant treatment noted as 1=none

with further effects, 3=unchanged, 4=euthanasia and 5=death. In light of the objectives of
this study, seizure occurrences during the study period were not regarded as an adverse
event. Any concomitant treatments including routine AED administered during the study
period were recorded, detailing indication of treatments, products used and length of
treatments (online Supplementary Table S2). To avoid confounding influences, concomitant
AED medication and dosages were unchanged throughout the study. Eighteen of the twenty-one
dogs were drug-resistant. All twenty-one dogs received PB. Most dogs were treated
additionally with KBr (<italic>n</italic> 18). Some dogs were chronically treated with a

of a low MCT-containing diet to dogs with idiopathic epilepsy chronically treated with
standard AEDs. To achieve this objective, twenty-one dogs with epilepsy were enroled into a
6-month prospective study, in which they were separately fed the MCTD containing low
concentrations of MCT (5&#x000b7;5 % as fed) for 3 months and an isoenergetic placebo diet
containing the same levels of fat, protein and carbohydrate for 3 months. The results show
that, for the first time, the MCTD &#x02013; a diet with low MCT inclusion rate &#x02013; had positive
effects on reduction of both seizure frequency and seizure day frequency per month. This KD
was well tolerated and had no significant effect on weight or serum concentrations of
glucose, PB or KBr in the dogs, and resulted in significantly higher serum concentrations of
BHB, which was in accordance with the results reported by Patterson <italic>et al.</italic>

canine epilepsy.</p><p>The KD diet is a therapeutic option commonly utilised in people with drug-resistant
epilepsy, especially in children<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The anticonvulsant effectiveness of a KD, where most pharmacological
treatments have failed, suggests a fundamental mechanistic difference between these
treatment modalities. Although the exact mechanisms resulting in the antiepileptic effects
of the KD remain elusive, proposed mechanisms include involvement and/or alterations in
brain energy metabolism, neurotransmitters, ketone bodies, AED, fatty acids and neuroactive
peptides<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In human clinical practice, during a KD treatment, it has been shown that
serum AED concentrations may increase despite no changes in the dosage administered. In such
cases, serum concentrations of PB have been shown to increase by up to 100 %<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>41</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It is, thus, reasonable to hypothesise an association between the
antiepileptic effects of KD and the ability of the diet to influence serum concentrations of
AEDs. This was investigated in an open clinical study of fifty-one children on a KD, which
showed no significant changes in PB serum concentrations, along with other commonly
administered AED<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>42</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The results presented in this study also show no significant changes in both
the PB and the KBr plasma concentrations during the MCTD phase, suggesting alternative
mechanisms of anticonvulsant properties.</p><p>The MCTD utilised in this study has previously been shown to improve the brain function of
aged dogs, and was hypothesised to exert these cognitive enhancements by providing the brain
with an alternative energy source<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Ageing is commonly associated with declined efficiency of glucose metabolism
in the brain, and has been demonstrated in both animals and humans. The MCTD is able to
increase ketone concentrations in the blood, and thus provides an alternative metabolic
pathway<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Secondary to providing an alternative energy source, MCT may contribute to the
maintenance of the neuronal structure via increasing concentrations of PUFA in the brain,
which have also been shown to decrease as a consequence of ageing<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The MCTD described in this study shows positive effects in both cognitive
enhancement and seizure control, where pathological mechanisms or pathways involved may be
similar or may act in a synergistic manner.</p><p>KD have often been associated with increases in BHB and other ketone bodies such as acetone
and acetoacetate, which is in accordance with this study where administration of the MCTD
resulted in significant increases in serum concentrations of BHB<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. It has, thus, been hypothesised that the ketone bodies play a crucial role in
the antiepileptic properties seen in KD. Studies involving administration of acetone and
acetoacetate in animal models including rabbits, mice and rats have shown protection against
induced seizures to varying degrees<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>45</sup>
</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In our study, we showed MCTD-related antiepileptic effects that were poorly
correlated with relative changes in serum BHB concentrations. As serum concentrations of
ketone bodies have not been consistently correlated with antiepileptic efficacy, others have
suggested the importance of relative glucose reductions along with elevation of ketone
bodies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>49</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. However, we showed reductions in seizure frequency with no significant changes
in serum glucose concentrations between the MCTD and placebo diets. The MCTD in this study
resulted in seizure control, manifesting as seizure frequency and seizure day frequency
reductions, which were not correlated with age or weight. The mechanisms resulting in
antiepileptic effects upon consumption of the MCTD seem to be irrespective of the
age-related reduced efficiency of glucose metabolism or increases in relative serum BHB
concentrations.</p><p>The results of this study suggest a rapid onset of antiepileptic properties associated with
consumption of the MCTD. It is, therefore, likely that the mechanisms of action leading to
the antiepileptic effects possessed by the MCTD also involve rapid biological processes.
Studies have highlighted the potential involvement of individual constituents of the MCTKD
in the antiepileptic properties associated with the effectiveness of a KD. The main
constituents of the MCTKD consist of the 8-carbon caprylic acid along with other MCT
including the 10-carbon capric acid and 12-carbon lauric acid<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>50</sup>
</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Caprylic acid has been shown to significantly and dose-dependently increase
the dosage of pentylenetetrazol required to induce myoclonic twitch and clonic
convulsions<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>50</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Capric acid has also been shown to significantly and dose-dependently increase
the seizure thresholds in the 6Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold tests<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>51</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It was, thus, suggested that other TAG may possess similar antiepileptic
properties as those seen in caprylic and capric acids. Interestingly valporic acid (VPA,
2-propulpentanoic acid), the most common and widely used broad-spectrum epilepsy drug in
humans worldwide, is also a TAG<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Unfortunately, VPA is commonly associated with unfavourable side-effects such
as teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. This highlights the need to search for novel agents
such as fatty acid compounds with improved potency against seizures and a better
side-effects profile compared with the drugs currently available. Recently, it has been
shown that seizure activity correlates with phosphoinositide depletion and that VPA acts by
restoring phosphoinositide levels<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>53</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>54</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Other MCT such as 4-methyloctanoic acid (hircinoic acid) and nonanoic acid
(pelargonic acid) were shown to exhibit similar effects with evidence of enhanced seizure
control and an improved side-effects profile in comparison with VPA<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>55</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It has been shown that a MCTKD causes not only increases in ketone body
production but also accumulation of MCT in the blood plasma; therefore, it is possible that
specific MCT or downstream metabolites are acting directly to exert antiepileptic
effects<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the MCTD implemented in this study contains much higher
proportions of carbohydrates in comparison with traditional KD used in humans, which contain
ratios of about 4:1 or 3:1 fats to proteins and carbohydrates. Despite this difference, the
MCTD diet still shows antiepileptic effects, highlighting a disassociation between
antiepileptic effectiveness and specific diet ratios, but instead potentially suggesting
involvement of specific metabolite agents or constituents, such as fatty acid compounds with
antiepileptic properties. However, canine and human metabolism of fats and carbohydrates
differ, as dogs rely more significantly on fat metabolism compared with humans. More
research is necessary to elucidate the mechanistic differences in fat metabolism and the
relationship of energitic proportions contributed by MCT in KD.</p><p>The placebo effect is a well-known phenomenon and has been demonstrated, manifesting as a
decrease in seizure frequency, in dogs with epilepsy. It was shown that the placebo effect
accounted for 26&#x02013;46 % of seizure reductions during placebo administration in comparison with
baseline values<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>56</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The placebo response is thought to originate from bias in the owners&#x02019;
observations and data collection, which is influenced by the positive attitudes of owners
towards respective intervention treatment. This study comprised of a triple-blinded,
randomised cross-over diet trial design, where the placebo effect was not relevant as dogs
were fed both the test diet and the placebo diet. Another factor besides the placebo effect
is the regression to the mean effect, highlighting the fact that most diseases wax and wane
and that recruitment peaks at the time when the clinical signs are more severe<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>56</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. We, therefore, have disregarded the analysis of the baseline data, which was
only used as an inclusion criterion for the prospective trial.</p><p>In conclusion, the data shown are in accordance with evidence in the literature showing
antiepileptic properties of the MCTKD and KD, manifesting as reductions in seizure
activities. By maintaining clinically effective levels of ketosis and anticonvulsant
efficacy, this research indicates that more carbohydrates, although still a KD, can be
utilised with the MCTKD to increase palatability, nutrient balance, compliance and
acceptability of the diet. This study provides evidence for the therapeutic management of
canine epilepsy using the MCTD with further potential implications in dietary management for
both human and canine drug-resistant epilepsy. Further investigations into the effectiveness
and efficacy of the MCTD on epilepsy should involve a pragmatic approach with larger
randomised controlled trials and inclusion of an intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Royal Veterinary College clinical investigation centre for help
