At Durham University, first and second year medical students practice clinical skills on each other under direct supervision from tutors, and receive immediate feedback on their performance during the clinical skills training sessions. They are introduced to a range of generic clinical skills, such as communication, clinical examination, and practical procedures, all of which are assessed during the summative Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Students are trained so that they can subsequently perform these skills competently and confidently on patients. However, the challenges faced by preclinical students (Phase 1 medical students) are that they must learn and develop these clinical skills with limited exposure to patients, and also be able to apply these skills appropriately when they move on to clinical rotations. Several studies have documented that this transition from preclinical to clinical phases is stressful for medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One of the areas in which both students and instructors feel there are difficulties is in the competent performance of clinical skills at an early stage in their clinical rotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Simulation-based education is seen to supplement the clinical education of medical students in a safe and supportive manner. It is a rapidly developing area which provides the learner with opportunities to repetitively practice, develop and transfer clinical skills without any fear of harm to patients, in a controlled setting. It is being used to augment learners&#x02019; knowledge and help them shape the acquisition of clinical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although simulation does not exactly duplicate clinical challenges or experiences with real patients in a genuine clinical setting, it complements students&#x02019; learning, and literature suggests that it can be used to prepare students for contact with real patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Laerdal SimMan&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a moderate fidelity manikin, is currently used widely in the later years of medical education. Students have evaluated its use positively in a number of studies, such as teaching undergraduate medical students in the context of management of medical emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the development of preclinical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It provides learners with the opportunity to experience a learning environment as close as possible to clinical practice by providing physical representations of patients. It gives them the benefit of exposure to pathological states with the holistic experience of examining and treating a patient, without exposing them to real patients. Thus it can be used to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical settings.</p><p>The aim of the study was to explore the role of SimMan&#x000ae; as an adjunct to peer examination in the teaching of clinical skills to preclinical medical students.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University (ESC2/2013/PP003).</p><p>One hundred and four first year medical students at Durham University were invited to participate, of which seventy nine students volunteered and were included in the study. All students were taught the clinical skills of respiratory and cardiovascular system examination, and had previously performed these examinations on their peers.</p><p>Preclinical medical students at Durham University practice clinical skills on each other in a safe and supportive environment, the clinical skills laboratory. Students performed chest examination on each other and examined the manikin in a similar clinical setting in order to create a more realistic environment. The manikin can be programmed with a range of clinical examination findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, SimMan&#x000ae; 3G was programmed to display abnormal signs in each of the selected respiratory and cardiovascular clinical conditions based on the under-graduate medicine case-led curriculum (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two SimMan&#x000ae; 3G manikins were set up in the clinical skills laboratory and were connected to equipment such as monitors and a simulated oxygen supply.</p><p>The students were randomly divided into two groups (A and B). Within each group they were further divided into subgroups consisting of two students who were facilitated by a tutor. The subgroups were created based on students&#x02019; preference choice of their peers with whom they were comfortable in performing examination. A pre-test was conducted at the beginning of the session with a questionnaire consisting of seven knowledge-based questions (with the maximum score of twelve), and three confidence level questions rated using a 4-point Likert scale (1-not at all confident to 4- very confident). In pairs, students performed chest examination and received immediate feedback from a tutor, the session lasting for approximately 20&#x000a0;minutes. Group A students used peer examination initially whilst Group B students initially examined the manikin. The students then answered the same questionnaire used in the pre-test as a mid-test, followed immediately by Group A examining the manikin and Group B examining each other. Finally a post-test (once again, with the same questionnaire) was conducted. The tutors scored students&#x02019; performance formatively using an objective scoring scheme (with the maximum score of twenty) similar to that used to assess them during formal summative clinical examinations. The students completed a feedback questionnaire at the end of the session. The cross over study model was used (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in order to provide equivalent learning opportunities for all students. Thus all students performed examination both on their peers as well as on the manikin.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Quantitative data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and an Independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Qualitative data from confidence questions were analyzed using a 2-proportion Z test and Fischer&#x02019;s exact test. A P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant in all tests. Qualitative data from the free text comments on feedback questionnaires was analyzed using thematic analysis. From the free text comments, the relevant data was coded into themes for each of the questions. Two authors (MSw and MS) independently coded the data and any differences were then discussed to reach an agreement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Knowledge</title><p>When the two groups were compared, it was found that the knowledge test scores (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) did not differ significantly between Group A (using peer examination initially) and Group B (using SimMan&#x000ae; initially) for the pre-test (Independent <italic>t</italic>-test, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.602, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.549). Thus the baseline level of knowledge of both groups was considered to be equal. In the mid-test, Group B scored significantly higher after performing the examination on the manikin when compared to Group A who had performed peer-examination (Independent <italic>t</italic>-test, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.411, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The knowledge test scores did not differ significantly between the two groups for the post-test. This suggests that their knowledge had improved equally after both groups had performed examination on the manikin (independent <italic>t</italic>-test, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.109, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.913).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

Further analysis (Independent <italic>t</italic>-test) confirmed that there was a significant increase in the mid-test scores (after performing examination on the manikin) when compared with the pre-test scores in the Group B (Independent <italic>t</italic>-test, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.354, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Thus students scored higher in the knowledge test after examining the manikin when compared to students who performed the examination on each other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Performance</title><p>Students scored higher when they performed examination on their peers rather than the manikin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When student&#x02019;s performance scores on each other were compared before and after simulation, it was found that the students scored higher after examining the manikin. The finding that Group B scored better on peer examination could be explained by the fact that they had more training (SimMan&#x000ae; and Peer examination) than Group A which had been exposed only to peer examination. After having previously performed examination (in previous teaching sessions, see methods) on their peers, students scored significantly higher by examining the manikin initially and then their peers (Independent <italic>t</italic>-test, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.895, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) as opposed to examining their peers initially, and then the manikin. Thus the manikin, when used as an adjunct to peer examination, can help students&#x02019; improve their ability to perform chest examination.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>

It was found that students&#x02019; knowledge required to perform respiratory and cardiovascular examination improved significantly after they performed examination on the manikin. However, it is interesting to note that repeated exposure to peer examination did not improve students&#x02019; knowledge. In addition, the manikin was as effective as peer examination in increasing students&#x02019; confidence. These findings are similar to other studies that have reported an improvement in preclinical medical students&#x02019; knowledge and confidence after simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We found a significant increase in students&#x02019; knowledge after examining the manikin in both groups whereas in the study conducted by Swamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], there was a similar, non-significant trend in the group initially using peer examination. One of the advantages of simulation is that it allows application of theoretical knowledge to practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When students perform examination on each other, they become familiar with normal examination findings but they are aware that they are examining a healthy person. SimMan&#x000ae;, on the other hand provides students with the variability of examining both normal and abnormal clinical signs, which reflects more closely what they are likely to encounter in clinical practice. During examination this encourages students to actually look for signs rather than just comment that they were either present or absent. The manikin provides them with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and thus reinforces normal findings; focusing them towards looking for abnormalities or deviations from normal. One student aptly summarised this, saying <italic>&#x0201c;I was able to explore the abnormal and know the abnormality. In peer examination normal is always &#x02018;assumed&#x02019; rather than checked. SimMan&#x000ae; you don&#x02019;t know for sure that you are examining a normal patient&#x0201d;</italic>. Hence most students found the manikin useful for practicing examination and felt that it added clinical contextualisation.</p><p>Students felt that the manikin improved their knowledge because they not only learnt about abnormal findings but also were provided with an opportunity to apply knowledge and interpret clinical signs, thus reiterating the knowledge required to examine a patient. Students also considered the feedback they received to be useful. Students felt they were more aware of the issues around examining a patient after examining the manikin. We found that the number of students who reported they were confident increased significantly for differentiating between normal and abnormal clinical signs after simulation whereas this decreased for examining a patient in a clinical setting. It may be that examining in a new setting without previous exposure to the modality, and having to recall steps, apply their knowledge and to be able to explore abnormalities, can be challenging to students.</p><p>SimMan&#x000ae; has drawbacks during examination. Students are not able to communicate as effectively as they would with a live subject. Also when using the manikin some aspects of the examination cannot be performed, for example, the head of the manikin cannot be turned when looking for JVP, neither can the wrist be bent to examine for flapping tremors, hence some students gave negative responses for using the manikin to practice examination. Some students specifically commented that it impacted negatively because they were examining the manikin for the first time. This may explain why students scored higher during peer examination when compared to examining the manikin. In the study by Swamy et al. in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it was found that graduate-entry students scored higher or equal to peer examination whilst performing chest examination on the manikin. This could be because they were mature students and thus the drawbacks felt by the students of examining the manikin were not as much of a hindrance. However, some students were less stressed because there was no shame or shyness or inhibition that may be associated with examining peers or patients. Students suggested that the session could be improved by increasing the time allocated, providing more teaching, and increasing the number of stations. They recommended frequent use of the manikin. Although SimMan&#x000ae; and other simulators like Harvey&#x000ae; and Ventriculoscope have their own advantages and disadvantages, SimMan&#x000ae; provides a more realistic and holistic experience of examining a patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Learners&#x02019; engagement with the repetitive practice of skills and assessment with specific informative feedback in a controlled setting has been shown to help in the acquisition of expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Students evaluated the session incorporating both peer and SimMan&#x000ae; very positively. Together they can establish a strong foundation of clinical skills through experiential learning which can eventually be developed in clinical practice. Also it prepares students for future encounters with the manikin which is likely to increase in medical training, and helps them to acquire advanced clinical skills without having any negative impact on their learning experience at that stage.</p><p>Some limitations of this study include the fact that this is a carried out with a single cohort of medical students from a single school. SimMan&#x000ae;, a simulated patient cannot replace the learning experience that is derived from real patients in clinical practice. But, providing real patients may not be practical in preclinical years with respect to feasibility, accessibility and availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it encourages learning in an environment that does not compromise patient safety and can be useful to prepare students for clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The manikin provides students with an opportunity to experience examining patients during their early years of training. It reinforces the importance of eliciting normal findings and helps application of knowledge and skills in a safe environment. The findings of this study show that the manikin can be used as an adjunct in facilitating the acquisition of clinical skills during the early years of training as it improves students&#x02019; knowledge and confidence. The majority of the students found it useful to practice examination. It can be used to formatively assess student performance. Thus, an integrated learning approach using SimMan&#x000ae; as an adjunct to peer examination can benefit preclinical medical students&#x02019; ability to acquire clinical skills.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MSw was involved in conception of the study, its design and conduction; performed data analyses and interpretation; drafted and critically reviewed the manuscript.
