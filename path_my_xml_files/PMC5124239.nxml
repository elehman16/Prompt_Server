Hospitalization for cUTIs caused by Gram-negative bacteria (typically Enterobacteriaceae such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) in the United States increased by approximately 50% from 2000 to 2009, whereas the incidence of infections caused by extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase (ESBL)&#x02013;positive organisms increased by approximately 300% in the same time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin have historically been an attractive therapy for cUTI (including pyelonephritis) because of their high drug concentrations in the urine and their demonstrated clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, their future usefulness is threatened by alarmingly high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance, often occurring in combination with other resistance mechanisms including ESBL production. A surveillance study of 24 US hospitals found that less than 70% of non-ESBL&#x02013;producing isolates of <italic>E. coli</italic> were susceptible to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, and this number fell to less than 10% for ESBL-producing strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The challenge of fluoroquinolone resistance is even greater in other regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Resistance to fluoroquinolones can occur through a combination of point mutations in the target gyrase and topoisomerase genes, plasmid-mediated mechanisms (eg, qnr), and upregulated efflux of the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The spread of these resistance mechanisms has been facilitated by their strong association with the worldwide pandemic clone of <italic>E. coli</italic>, ST-131 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the clinical management of cUTI, it remains common practice to treat patients empirically, at least during the 2- to 3-day time period required to obtain standard culture results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As resistance increases, recommendations either to avoid empiric use of fluoroquinolones or to use these antibacterials judiciously based on local surveillance data are becoming more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Guidance directed toward uncomplicated urinary tract infections, published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, supports a 3-day course of fluoroquinolone therapy, but only in regions where the resistance rate is lower than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous clinical studies have concluded that high urinary tract concentrations of fluoroquinolones are sufficient to allow successful outcomes for nonsusceptible isolates. One large <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis examined a population in whom the level of fluoroquinolone resistance was relatively low (&#x0003c;10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Patients received levofloxacin (750&#x000a0;mg intravenously) or ciprofloxacin (either 400&#x000a0;mg intravenously or 500&#x000a0;mg orally) for 10&#x000a0;days. Forty-two fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (levofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] &#x02265;8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and ciprofloxacin MIC &#x02265;4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) were reported. Six isolates had levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin MICs ranging from 8 to 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and were eradicated with treatment, and 13 isolates with fluoroquinolone MICs &#x0003e;32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL persisted. The outcomes of the remaining 23 isolates were not presented. A smaller study of a 500-mg dose of levofloxacin conducted in a setting of higher levofloxacin resistance calculated a 90% probability of microbiological eradication of Gram-negative bacilli at an MIC of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. Eradication was evaluated only 2&#x000a0;days after therapy, however, a time when levofloxacin may still be present in the urine and suppressing the growth of organisms that could result in a different microbiological outcome after the drug has cleared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In vitro urinary bactericidal titer experiments demonstrated that the concentration of levofloxacin in urine following a 750-mg dose was bactericidal to <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates with MICs &#x02264;32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In this exploratory analysis, we examined the clinical and microbiological outcomes of treatment with high-dose, extended-duration levofloxacin (750&#x000a0;mg for 7&#x000a0;days) by levofloxacin MIC in a large sample of patients with cUTI caused by Enterobacteriaceae in the ASPECT-cUTI phase 3 clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>ASPECT-cUTI (ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01345929">NCT01345929</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01345955">NCT01345955</ext-link>) was a large, global, phase 3 program that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus levofloxacin for the treatment of adult hospital patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The trials were approved by appropriate regulatory agencies and local institutional review boards (IRB) and were conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The microbiologically evaluable (ME) population was the subset of the mMITT population who adhered to study procedures and had interpretable urine culture results at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (5&#x02013;9 days after the last dose of study drug).</p><p>The ASPECT-cUTI study provided data on 370 patients in the mMITT population and 327 patients in the ME population who had &#x02264;1 isolate of Enterobacteriaceae at baseline and were treated with levofloxacin. A total of 333 Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 327 patients in the ME population.

The ME population was selected for analysis to exclude patients with indeterminate outcomes. Clinical cure at the TOC visit was defined as complete resolution, substantial improvement (ie, reduction in severity of all baseline signs and symptoms), or return to premorbid signs and symptoms without the need for additional antibiotic therapy. Microbiological eradication was defined as a TOC urine culture with &#x0003c;10<sup>4</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/mL of the baseline uropathogen. The per-pathogen microbiological and clinical outcomes at the TOC visit were stratified by levofloxacin MIC of each baseline infecting organism. Clinical outcomes for patients who were classified as clinical cures at the TOC visit and who returned for the LFU visit were classified as sustained, indeterminate, or relapsed based on the sustained resolution or relapse in clinical signs and symptoms of cUTI that were absent at the TOC visit. Relative proportions of each of these categories were examined for patients whose infections were microbiologically eradicated versus those who had persisting positive cultures at the TOC visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Susceptibility testing</title><p>Susceptibility and quality control testing of study isolates was performed by ICON Laboratories (Farmingdale, NY) in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.

A recent meta-analysis examined multiple cUTI trials before ASPECT-cUTI and identified microbiological eradication rates at the TOC visit in the microbiological intent-to-treat population of 81% for doripenem, 79% for levofloxacin, and 80.5% for imipenem-cilastatin, confirming that levofloxacin has a place in the armamentarium for cUTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In an era of increasing and evolving antibiotic resistance, however, decisions about clinical usefulness must be made at the local hospital and individual patient level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>High-dose levofloxacin treatment (750&#x000a0;mg once daily for 7&#x000a0;days) in ASPECT-cUTI resulted in clinical cure for the more than 90% of patients with Enterobacteriaceae infections who had MICs &#x02264;4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. Nevertheless, persistence of the baseline pathogen became more frequent as the MIC increased, with an eradication rate of &#x0003c;90% observed at an MIC of only 0.125&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. A similar decrease in the microbiological eradication rate with levofloxacin treatment above a levofloxacin MIC of 0.06&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL was observed during the phase 3 doripenem studies, though the total numbers of patients treated was smaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The clinical significance of failure to eradicate the causative pathogen while resolving clinical symptoms is unknown, but multiple studies have shown that fluoroquinolone resistance is strongly correlated with persistence of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and recurrence of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The results presented in this study show that, as expected, an increase in levofloxacin MIC was correlated with a decrease in microbiological eradication rate with levofloxacin treatment. Clinical cure without microbiological eradication of the causative pathogen was more likely (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 8.7&#x02013;29.6%) to result in a relapse of cUTI at the LFU visit. The levofloxacin-resistant isolates from this study had high levofloxacin MICs that were associated with common and highly conserved fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms, most typically point mutations in gyrA and parC (data not shown).</p><p>Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets for fluoroquinolone treatment in cUTI have been studied in depth. Typically, AUC/MIC ratios of 100 or C<sub>max</sub>/MIC ratios of 10 are associated with good clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], though 90% microbiological eradication of Gram-negative cUTI pathogens has been reported at targets as low as 31.46 and 2.74, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Data on the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in either serum or urine were not obtained during ASPECT-cUTI; therefore, direct analysis of these outcomes as they relate to the levofloxacin concentration is not possible. Administration of single 750-mg doses of levofloxacin to 10 healthy adults was reported to produce AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values of 93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;h/mL and 7.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in serum and 7328&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3237&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;h/mL and 620&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;324&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in urine, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Conservatively applying the lower bound of the PK ranges and the higher PK/PD targets predicts that levofloxacin MICs of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL should be treatable in serum. In urine, the value is between 16 and 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, depending on whether the C<sub>max</sub> or the AUC parameter is used. However, elevated MIC treatment targets based on urinary concentrations are not supported by the outcomes in this study, which is the first to examine a population with high levels of levofloxacin resistance using a stringent criterion for microbiological eradication.</p><p>In summary, these clinical data demonstrate that high-dose, extended-duration levofloxacin treatment (750&#x000a0;mg for 7&#x000a0;days) of patients with cUTIs was less likely to be successful when the MIC of the infecting organism was &#x02265;4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and less likely to be sustainable when the MIC was &#x0003e;0.06&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec9"><title>Additional file</title><p>
