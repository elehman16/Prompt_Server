Control group subjects received crossover VTP treatment at 3 months (crossover group). Effectiveness measures of meibomian gland secretion (MGS) and dry eye symptoms were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Subjects with inadequate symptom relief could receive additional meibomian gland dysfunction therapy after 3 (treatment group) and 6 months (crossover group).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 3 months, the treatment group had greater mean improvement in MGS (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and dry eye symptoms (<italic>P</italic>=0.0068), compared to controls. At 12 months, 86% of the treatment group had received only one VTP treatment, and sustained a mean improvement in MGS from 6.4&#x000b1;3.7 (baseline) to 17.3&#x000b1;9.1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and dry eye symptoms from 44.1&#x000b1;20.4 to 21.6&#x000b1;21.3 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001); 89% of the crossover group had received only one VTP treatment with sustained mean improvement in MGS from 6.3&#x000b1;3.6 to 18.4&#x000b1;11.1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and dry eye symptoms from 49.1&#x000b1;21.0 to 24.0&#x000b1;23.2 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Greater mean improvement in MGS was associated with less severe baseline MGS (<italic>P</italic>=0.0017) and shorter duration of time between diagnosis and treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.0378).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single VTP treatment can deliver a sustained mean improvement in meibomian gland function and mean reduction in dry eye symptoms, over 12 months. A single VTP treatment provides significantly greater mean improvement in meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms as compared to a conventional, twice-daily, 3-month regimen. Early VTP intervention for meibomian gland dysfunction is associated with improved treatment outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>meibomian gland dysfunction</kwd><kwd>dry eye</kwd><kwd>vectored thermal pulsation</kwd><kwd>LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dry eye is currently understood to be a multifactorial disease state that afflicts many millions of people worldwide.<xref rid="b1-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While our awareness of the disease has expanded exponentially since it was first documented in 1950,<xref rid="b2-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> as a collective, we continue to struggle with formulating a comprehensive definition for this disease.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Currently, the definition is constrained to that of measureable dry eye sequelae with no mention of an etiology.

These included active ocular infection or inflammation (including allergic, vernal, or giant papillary conjunctivitis and severe eyelid inflammation); ocular surface abnormality that may compromise corneal integrity; eyelid abnormalities that affect lid function; recent (within the past 3 months) ocular surgery, trauma, herpes, or recurrent inflammation; systemic disease condition that causes dry eye; punctal plugs or punctal occlusion within the past 3 months; unwilling to abstain from the use of systemic medications known to cause dryness for the study duration; unwilling to abstain from the use of systemic or topical treatments for MGD or dry eye for the study duration (except for over-the-counter [OTC] artificial tears, ocular lubricants, or dietary supplements); pregnant, nursing, or females of childbearing potential and not utilizing adequate birth control measures; and participation in another ophthalmic clinical trial involving a therapeutic drug or device within the past 30 days. Prior to the baseline visit, subjects were required to discontinue use of systemic antihistamines or isotretinoin for at least 1 month, cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for at least 2 months, all other prescription medications used for dry eye or MGD (eg, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for at least 2 weeks, and all other MGD treatments (eg, at-home warm compress therapy, eyelid hygiene, eyelid massage, and manual lid expression) for at least 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and subject disposition</title><p>A total of 101 subjects (202 eyes) were randomized to the treatment group (VTP treatment) and 99 subjects (198 eyes) were randomized to the control group (warm compress and eyelid hygiene). Subjects in the treatment group received a single 12-minute VTP treatment and those in the control group were instructed to perform twice-daily, 10-minute warm compress, and eyelid hygiene treatment of both eyes for 3 months, which was standardized using the OTC EyeGiene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Insta-Warmth&#x02122; System (Eyedetec Medical, Inc. Danville, CA, USA) and OCuSOFT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Lid Scrub&#x02122; Original (OCuSoft, Rosenberg, TX, USA). Control subjects documented daily therapy use on a diary. In stage 1, treatment and control group subjects were followed at 1 and 3 months after the treatment visit. After the 3-month exam, control subjects were instructed to stop the control therapy and received crossover VTP treatment. In stage 2, treatment group subjects were followed at 6, 9, and 12 months. Control subjects who became crossover group subjects were followed at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months.

In addition, subjects were permitted the use of OTC supplements during the study. No prescription MGD or dry eye treatment was permitted for treatment group subjects for the first 3 months and for control/crossover group subjects through the first 6 months. In stage 2, subjects were assessed at each visit for adequacy of symptom relief to determine which subgroup the subjects entered for the subsequent visit. Subjects who reported adequate symptom relief remained in the one VTP subgroup, and no additional treatment was prescribed until the next visit, when the adequacy of symptom relief was assessed again. Subjects who reported inadequate symptom relief were provided either a second VTP treatment (two VTP subgroups) or other MGD and dry eye treatment (combination subgroup). If the subject self-initiated other MGD or dry eye treatment during the study (except for OTC supplements), the subject was entered into the combination subgroup and was no longer eligible for a second VTP treatment. For the combination subgroup, the type of other MGD or dry eye treatments prescribed by the physician included warm compress, lid hygiene, lid massage, systemic antibiotic, topical antibiotic, and topical steroid.</p></sec><sec><title>The LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System</title><p>The LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Vectored Thermal Pulsation System is a prescription device intended for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including MGD, also known as evaporative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry eye.

Meibomian gland assessment was performed using a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator, to apply standardized pressure to the eyelid margin, which simulates a blink in yielding gland secretions. A total of 15 glands were evaluated along the lower eyelid margin, consisting of five glands located in each of the temporal, central, and nasal regions. For each of the 15 glands, expressed secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid secretion), 2 (cloudy liquid secretion), 1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency), and 0 (no secretion). For data analysis, the MGS score for each eye was calculated based on the sum of the secretion grades for all 15 glands evaluated with a range of 0 to 45.</p><p>The OSDI questionnaire assessed the subjects&#x02019; frequency of dry eye symptoms and problems with their eyes in situations and conditions of daily living. The dry eye questionnaire was explained to the subjects prior to completion to ensure understanding of the instructions without coaching or influencing the subjects&#x02019; responses. The subjects completed the questionnaire directly and signed and dated the form. The OSDI score was calculated as the sum of frequency scores for all symptoms multiplied by 25 and divided by the number of questions answered with a range from 0 to 100.<xref rid="b33-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>Stage 1 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints were to compare the mean change from baseline to 3 months in MGS and OSDI scores, respectively, between the treatment and control groups.

There was no safety endpoint in this study because the LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System is a nonsignificant risk device and safety has been demonstrated through a previous study.<xref rid="b20-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, adverse event data were collected at all study visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study populations</title><p>Three populations were used for analysis. 1) The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all subjects who were randomized in the study and was used for analysis of the stage 1 primary and secondary endpoints and adverse events. 2) The per protocol (PP) population, which included all subjects who completed stage 1 with no significant protocol deviations that could affect the effectiveness endpoints, was also used for stage 1 endpoint analyses. Control subjects who did not meet the minimum acceptable compliance for use of the control therapy as defined in the protocol were excluded from the PP population.

A comparability analysis by treatment group was performed for demographics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (MGS score, OSDI score, duration of dry eye symptoms and duration of dry eye, or MGD diagnosis). Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison of continuous variables. For categorical variables, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or Fisher&#x02013;Freeman&#x02013;Halton test was used. A <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1 was used to determine imbalance between groups. Any significant variables were included in supportive multivariate models of study endpoints to control for the imbalance.</p><p>To assess poolability of the multicenter data, a multivariate mixed models analysis of variance of the stage 1 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints was employed to test whether a site by treatment group interaction existed. A two-sided test with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.10 was used to determine a significant site by treatment interaction. If the effect size was homogeneous by site, the stage 1 endpoint was analyzed by a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. If the effect size was heterogeneous by site, the overall effect size across sites for the stage 1 endpoint was obtained by taking the weighted average of the difference in scores between groups at each site, using the inverse of the variance of the difference in scores as the weight, and dividing the sum of these weighted differences by the sum of the weights. The test of significance was a z-statistic. To avoid multiplicity issues, the stage 1 primary and secondary endpoints were tested in order under a closed form testing method. The secondary hypothesis was tested only if the primary hypothesis was statistically significant. If both hypotheses were statistically significant, the overall study alpha is 0.025.</p><p>Supportive multivariate generalized linear mixed models for the stage 1 endpoints were analyzed with covariates, including treatment group, demographics, baseline characteristics, and any variables found to be out of balance from the comparability analyses. The data were modeled based on subject as the independent unit of measure to account for any clustering and correlation between right and left eyes of each subject.</p><p>Stage 2 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints were analyzed with a multivariable mixed model with stage 2 subgroup as a fixed effect. Covariates for the model included treatment group, demographics, and baseline characteristics. Stage 2 endpoints were analyzed at 12 months with comparison of the one VTP subgroup to the combination subgroup only because there were too few subjects in the two VTP subgroup (n=3 subjects) at 12 months for meaningful analysis. Stage 2 endpoints were not analyzed at 6 months because there were too few subjects in the two VTP (n=1 subject) and combination (n=6 subjects) subgroups at 6 months for a meaningful comparative analysis.</p><p>Exploratory analyses included analysis of the sustained effect by assessing the mean change in MGS and OSDI scores from baseline to 12 months using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test and the CC population of the one VTP subgroup in the treatment and crossover groups. In addition, to determine patient characteristics significantly associated with greater MGS improvement after VTP treatment, the change in MGS score from baseline to 3 months was analyzed for the treatment group using a multivariate mixed model and the ITT population.

This significant difference between treatment and control groups in these outcomes was maintained after controlling for patient demographic and baseline characteristics in the multivariate analysis.

These patients did not receive any additional prescribed therapy for MGD or dry eye to further ameliorate their symptoms after the initial single VTP<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment.

These results support the view that early intervention improves treatment outcomes for MGD, as measured by improvement in gland function. In addition, the baseline mean duration of dry eye symptoms was 1.6 years longer than the mean duration of diagnosis in the treatment group and 3.2 years longer in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-10-1385">Table 1</xref>), reflecting that many patients are not diagnosed with MGD until after they are symptomatic for some time. Early intervention requires early detection, and patients should be routinely assessed for MGD even in the absence of dry eye symptoms.</p><p>In this study, a small percentage of patients received additional prescribed therapy (combination or two VTP treatments) for further symptom relief through 12 months. In the comparison of outcomes for subjects who received only one VTP treatment versus those who received combination treatment, there was no significant difference in the mean MGS score but the one VTP subjects had a statistically significantly lower mean OSDI score (less symptoms) at 12 months. Not surprisingly, the combination subjects, who were selected into this subgroup based on inadequate symptom relief, had more severe baseline dry eye symptoms on average than the one VTP subjects. In addition, the combination subjects were often not compliant with their prescribed therapy, thus limiting the conclusions that we can draw regarding these subjects. However, as other MGD or dry therapy did not further improve the mean MGS score in the combination subgroup, it is likely that factors other than MGD specifically were contributing to the greater dry eye symptoms at 12 months. This is not atypical of patients with chronic dry eye where multiple therapies may be indicated.<xref rid="b22-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The safety of the LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System has been previously evaluated and reported.<xref rid="b20-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The type and rate of nonserious and transient adverse events related to the LipiFlow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System in this trial were consistent with prior studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single VTP treatment can deliver a sustained effect over 1 year, as shown by mean improvement in meibomian gland function and mean reduction in dry eye symptoms from baseline. These results also show that most patients, 86.2%, did not receive additional prescribed therapy for symptom relief after a single VTP treatment during the 12-month study period. Furthermore, a single VTP treatment provides significantly greater mean improvement in meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms as compared to a robust, conventional regimen used twice-daily for 3 months. These results also suggest that early intervention for MGD improves treatment outcomes. This study strongly supports a previously published perspective that no other single dose therapy offers a comparable efficacy profile for reducing dry eye symptoms and improving meibomian gland function as well as VTP for MGD.<xref rid="b17-opth-10-1385" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by TearScience, Morrisville, NC, USA.
