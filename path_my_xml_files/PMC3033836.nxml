Traditional therapy with thrombectomy and eventually additional (bypass) surgery has been associated with moderate long-term patency rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was introduced in the early 1980s as a treatment option for occluded bypass grafts. This technique has advantages that make it ideal for acute occlusions, including avoidance of mechanical injury to the endothelium, no need for surgical interventions and more complete lysis of the clot in the bypass graft or outflow arteries. Moreover, it can dissolve platelet-fibrin aggregates in the microcirculation and thrombi in collateral vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review that included a meta-analysis of 5 large randomized controlled trials with a total of 1283 patients comparing surgery with thrombolysis in the management of acute lower limb ischemia showed no significant difference between them in limb salvage or death at 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year. However, hemorrhagic complications and distal embolization were more likely at 30 days in thrombolysis patients (8.8% and 12.4%, respectively) than in surgery patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of these complications might be reduced by a reduction in thrombolytic therapy time. In recent years, ultrasound (US) has been used to accelerate thrombolysis. Low-intensity US-accelerated thrombolysis has been shown to accelerate enzymatic clot lysis in vitro by loosening fibrin strands and thereby increasing thrombus permeability and exposing more plasminogen receptors for binding, without mechanically disrupting the clot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The safety of this technique has been shown in the treatment of embolic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and deep venous thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Only two prospective series have been published on the use of US-accelerated thrombolysis in the treatment of thromboembolic obstructions of native arteries and bypass grafts of the lower extremities. In a recent study by Wissgott et al, 25 patients with acute obstructions of the native lower limb arteries were treated with US-accelerated thrombolysis. The technical success rate of 100%, and total clot removal was achieved in 88% of the patients within 24 hours. There were no complications related to the catheter system. At the 1-month follow-up, 2 reocclusions had occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Motarjeme et al used US-accelerated thrombolysis in the treatment 24 arterial occlusions and 12 venous occlusions, and complete lysis was achieved in 23 (96%) arterial occlusions. Average time to achieve complete lysis was 16.4 hours (range, 3-25 hours). During the 12-month follow-up, only 1 femoropopliteal graft rethrombosed. No bleeding or other complications occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>So far, no randomized trials have focused on US-accelerated and standard catheter-derived thrombolysis for arterial thromboembolic disorders of the lower limbs.

Given a power of 90% and a 2-tailed significance of 5%, a 2-armed randomized trial including 26 patients in each arm will be needed to prove a significant reduction in therapy time (12 hours or more) with US-accelerated thrombolysis compared with standard thrombolysis. Taking into account 5% to 10% dropouts in each arm, 30 patients need to be included in each study arm. We will analyze the primary outcome by means of Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test. The sample size calculation is also based on this premise. We will assess imbalance in prognostic factors as a secondary analysis by means of Cox-proportional Hazards multivariate analysis.</p><p>An interim analysis on the primary end point (ie, efficacy) will be performed after 50% of patients have completed their follow-up. The Peto approach will be followed, meaning that the study will only be stopped for beneficial effects in case of a <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; .001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The study will not be stopped in case of futility. End points in blinded groups will be assessed by the DSMB.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Group A (standard thrombolysis)</title><p>Standard thrombolysis will be performed with use of a 5F UniFuse Infusion catheter (AngioDynamics, Queensbury, NY, USA) with a working length of 90 cm, with infusion holes around the circumference of the distal 10 cm to 50 cm of the catheter. Access sites may be the contralateral common femoral artery, the ipsilateral common femoral artery, or a brachial approach.</p><p>During the initial angiography, the catheter will be navigated over a guidewire and positioned in such way that the entire distal segment with the infusion holes is in the thrombosed segment. At standardized intervals, a control angiography will be performed. During each control angiography, the distal part of the thrombolysis catheter will be repositioned in the remaining thrombosed segment.</p></sec><sec><title>Group B (US-accelerated thrombolysis)</title><p>US-accelerated thrombolysis involves simultaneous delivery of low-intensity US and a thrombolytic agent into a thrombosed vessel. US-accelerated thrombolysis will be performed with use of the EKOS EndoWave system (EKOS Corporation, Bothell, WA, USA). This system consists of a 5.2F multilumen thrombolysis delivery catheter with a 106 cm or 135 cm working length and a matching US coaxial core wire with a working zone of 6 cm to 50 cm. The central lumen of the multilumen thrombolysis delivery catheter accommodates the US core. Thrombolytics will be infused through 3 drug lumens containing multiple side holes. Low-intensity (2.2 MHz), high-frequency US will be delivered over the entire length of the infusion catheter. US power and local temperature are automatically controlled by a portable control unit.</p><p>During the initial angiography, a multilumen thrombolysis delivery catheter will be navigated over a guidewire into the thrombosed segment in such a way that the US treatment zone traverses the entire thrombosed segment and the tip of the infusion catheter is located distal to the thrombosed segment. After final positioning, the guidewire will be exchanged for a matching US core wire, and thrombolytic therapy will be started. Likewise, a control angiography will be performed at standardized intervals.</p><p>If placement of the EKOS system is technically not feasible, the procedure will be defined as a technical treatment failure. The vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist, or both, may decide what alternative treatment they will start, for instance, standard thrombolysis or conversion to open surgery. The outcome of these patients will be analyzed in group B according to the intention-to-treat principles.</p></sec><sec><title>General</title><p>The primary angiography in groups A and B will be started at day 1 at 8.00 a.m. &#x000b1; 1 hour for logistic reasons. After successful positioning of the thrombolysis catheter, a bolus of 250,000 IU urokinase is given and followed by a continuous infusion with a dose of 100,000 IU urokinase/h. A control angiography will be performed every 6 &#x000b1; 1 hours. During the night, standard angiography will only be performed in emergencies. Angiographies will be performed the next day at 8.00 a.m. &#x000b1; 1 hour; 2.00 p.m. &#x000b1; 1 hour, and 8.00 p.m. &#x000b1; 1 hour. A checklist is completed during each angiography.</p><p>The pressure curve from the EKOS monitor will be recorded constantly from the start of the procedure. From the start of thrombolysis until completion angiography, the ankle-brachial indices of the treated leg and a standardized pain score will be recorded every 3 hours by a nurse practitioner or surgical resident. Every day during thrombolysis, the fibrinogen concentration must be checked: if &#x0003c;1.0 g/L the urokinase rate must be lowered to 50,000 IU/h; if the fibrinogen concentration is &#x0003c;0.5 g/L, thrombolysis must be stopped. If the obstructive clot has been successfully thrombolized, any necessary additional procedure, for instance percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the inflow or outflow artery, is performed before the completion angiography, and again, a checklist of the last angiography is completed.</p><p>After successful thrombolysis, systemic heparin is given (25,000 IU/24 hours) and coumarin derivatives are started. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will be measured daily during heparinization. The target international normalized ratio (INR) will be 2.5 to 3.5; if this value is reached, heparinization can be stopped.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data will be collected by means of a CRF during treatment in the participating centers. The CRF will be completed prospectively during hospital admission and during follow-up. After that, the CRFs will be forwarded to the data coordinating center. There will be regular contact between the study coordinators and the participating centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Patients are followed-up during their hospital stay. At 30 &#x000b1; 7 days after thrombolysis has been completed, there is one follow-up visit in the outpatient department, including a physical examination, ankle-brachial index, treadmill test, and contrast-enhanced MRA of the treated leg, according to current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. During follow-up, any additional procedures, conversion to open surgery, duration and costs of hospital admission, death, distal thromboembolic complications, and other complications will be recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Several treatment strategies have focused on accelerating thrombolytic therapy to improve its effectiveness and to reduce treatment time and, therefore, adverse effects. US-accelerated thrombolysis, which involves the simultaneous delivery of low-intensity US and a thrombolytic agent into a thrombosed vessel, has been shown to reduce therapy time. The DUET study is designed to compare US-accelerated thrombolysis with standard thrombolysis in patients with recently thrombosed infrainguinal native arteries or bypass grafts.</p><p>Only patients with acute lower limb ischemia in class I and IIa, according to the Rutherford classification, will be included in our study, because catheter-directed thrombolysis is the initial treatment chosen in patients with viable or minimally threatened lower limbs. Immediate surgical revascularization is indicated in most patients with acute lower limb ischemia class IIb and III; therefore, these patients will be excluded from the study.</p><p>Prolonged thrombolysis therapy might be expected in clots older than 1 week. Most clots that are less than 1 week old can be rather easily and quickly treated with standard catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombosuction. The additional value of the more expensive US-accelerated thrombolysis in these thrombi may be argued and these are therefore excluded from this study.</p><p>Randomization is stratified according to whether a native artery or a bypass graft is occluded, because it has been shown that thrombolysis of a bypass graft will lead to better outcome than thrombolysis of a native artery.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, a control angiography should be performed every 12 hours. Therefore, our sample size calculation is based on a reduction in therapy time of 12 hours or more. Control angiographies at 8:00 a.m. and at 8.00 p.m. would have been sufficient. However, in our study protocol we have incorporated an extra control angiography at 2.00 p.m. to measure our primary outcome more precisely and to reduce any unnecessary exposure to thrombolytics in our study participants.</p><p>Two vascular surgeons and 2 interventional radiologists from 2 nonparticipating centers will review all angiographies independently. The vascular surgeons and the interventional radiologists will be blinded for patient characteristics and for the results of the initial reports. They will be asked to classify the degree of lysis, ranging from no lysis, partial lysis, to complete lysis (&#x0003e;95% lysis).</p><p>If thrombolysis of the occluded segment is successful, any hemodynamically significant underlying atherosclerotic lesion will be identified and treated. Preferably, the underlying lesion will be treated endovascularly, with PTA with or without stent placement, or both. It will be the vascular surgeon's or interventional radiologists' decision to convert to open surgery if endovascular treatment of the underlying lesion is not feasible or if thrombolysis of the occluded segment is not successful.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DUET study is a randomized controlled trial that will provide evidence whether US-accelerated thrombolysis will significantly reduce therapy time compared with standard thrombolysis in patients with recently thrombosed infrainguinal native arteries or bypass grafts, without an increase in the number of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AMS and JPPMdV drafted the manuscript.</p><p>AMS, MMPJR, RPJTN, AWJH, MvL and JPPMdV participated in the design of the study.</p><p>All authors edited the manuscript and read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Appendix</title><sec><title>DUET committee members</title><sec><title>Steering committee</title><p>JPPM de Vries (chairman), AM Schrijver (principal investigator), M van Leersum, St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein; MMPJ Reijnen, Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem.</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring Committee</title><p>GJ de Borst (chairman), EJ Vonken, UMC Utrecht; BP Keller, H Alkefaji, Martini Hopsital, Groningen.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the support of Johannes C.
