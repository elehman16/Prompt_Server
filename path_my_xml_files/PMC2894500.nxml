Epinephrine was the earliest adjuvant drug used, during second half of 1980's. Opioids were also used but their use carried risk of respiratory depressions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>.

The analgesic action of epidurally administered Clonidine is due to stimulation of descending noradrenergic medullospinal pathways inhibiting the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters in the dorsal horn of spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>. The analgesic effect of Clonidine is more pronounced after neuraxial injection which suggests a spinal site of action and makes this route of administration preferable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>.</p><p>We designed a prospective randomized double blind study to examine the haemodynamic and respiratory effects of clonidine as an adjunct to bupivacaine caudal epidural analgesia and compare its analgesic efficacy with control group in which only bupivacaine was used, in paediatric day care procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>After informed parental consent, 40 ASAI children between 1-10 years of age weighing 5-20 kg, who were scheduled to undergo inguinal herniotomy as daycare cases were admitted in the study. Children with any contraindication to caudal block or having congenital heart disease were excluded from the study. No premedication was given and all surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia. Inhalational induction was done with oxygen, nitrous oxide and 8% sevoflurane delivered through Jacks on Rees modification of Ayre's T-piece and face mask, with standard monitoring. After intravenous cannula insertion a PUMA (Proseal Laryngeal Mask Airway LMA company Ltd.) of appropriate size (between size 1- 1.5), depending on the weight of the patient, was introduced. Anaesthesia was maintained with 33% oxygen, 67% nitrous oxide and sevoflurane (3-4%) with manual assistance and fresh gas flow of 2-3 litres /minute. After induction of anaesthesia, the children were assigned randomly to receive a caudal ep idural injection of either 0.75 ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 0.25% bupivacaine (Group B) or 0.75 ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2&#x003bc;g.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of clonidine (Group C). Clonidine was loaded in 1 ml syringe so as to keep the volume same in both the groups. Caudal block was performed with 23 gauge hypodermic needle under aseptic conditions in left lateral position and the child was turned supine after the injection of the drug. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before induction of anaesthesia and every 5 minutes subsequently. An intraoperative increase in heart rate and blood pressure by more than 10% after 15 minutes of caudal injection was defined as insufficient analgesia and treated with intravenous fentanyl lmcg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>At the beginning of skin closure, sevoflurane and nitrous oxide were discontinued. When the children were sufficiently awake, PLMA was removed and they were shifted to the recovery room, breathing room air.</p><p>After arrival mean blood pressure, heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> was documented hourly for 6 hours. Intraoperative or postoperative decrease in mean blood pressure or heart rate more than 30% of the baseline values was defined as severe hypotension or bradycardia respectively. Respiratory depression was defined as a decrease of SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 93% and required supplemental oxygen viamask. Pain assessment in the post-operative period was done by an observer blinded to the therapeutic intervention using OPS score (at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours) and duration of analgesia. Each variable (crying, facial expression, verbal response, position of torso and motor restlessness) was scored between 0-2 (0: none, 1: moderate, 2: severe), to give a cumulative score of 0-10. Ifthe OPS score was more than 4 in 2 subsequent measurements or ifthe patient showed obvious signs of pain they were given oral paracetamol 10 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1.</sup> The duration of postoperative analgesia was defined as time between caudal drug injection and the first complaint of pain. Assessment of sedation was done by sedation score at 30 minutes, l hour and 4 hours after the operation. Patient sedation score was defined as 1: asleep, not arousable by verbal contact; 2: asleep, arous able by verbal contact; 3: drowsy not sleeping; 4: alert/aware. This helped in identification of respiratory depression. Duration of motor blockwas assessed by noting the time children began moving their legs. Time of first micturition was also noted. Children were discharged from the daycare ward after 6 hours of arrival. Parents noted the total requirement of additional analgesia in first 24 hours after operation on a form and were contacted telephonically.</p><p>Parametric data was analysed using Student's t test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Mean age, weight, surgical and recovery time were comparable between two groups (mean age of Group B: 3.3 years, mean age of Group C: 3.5 years, mean weight of Group B: 13.5 kg, mean weight of Group C: 14.6kg, mean surgical time of Group B: 39.7 min, mean surgical time of Group C:43.8 min, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).
