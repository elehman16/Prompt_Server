Both disorders have overlapping symptoms, and current research shows that the presence of a BPD has an adverse effect on the course of BD. The limited research available shows an unfavorable illness course, a worse prognosis and response to medication, longer treatment duration, more frequent psychiatric admissions, higher drop-out, increased risk of substance abuse, increased risk of suicide, and more impairment of social and occupational functioning. However, there is no research available on the effect of specific psychotherapeutic treatment for this patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This paper presents the protocol of a RCT to investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD (study part 1) and the effectiveness of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) added to treatment as usual (TAU) for BD compared to TAU in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features (study part 2). STEPPS is a validated and effective intervention for BPD. The study population consists of patients treated for BD at specialized outpatient clinics for BD in the Netherlands. At first the prevalence of comorbid borderline personality features in outpatients with BD is investigated. Inclusion criteria for study part 2 is defined as having three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of BPD, including impulsivity and anger bursts. Primary outcomes will be the frequency and severity of manic and depressive recurrences as well as severity, course and burden of borderline personality features. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life, utilizing mental healthcare and psychopathologic symptoms not primarily related to BD or BPD. Assessment will be at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at 12 and 18 months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features. There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity. We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bipolar disorder</kwd><kwd>Borderline personality disorder</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>STEPPS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex and heterogeneous mood disorder defined by the occurrence of depressive, manic, hypomanic, and mixed episodes, divided by intervals of longer or shorter duration. DSM-IV-TR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] classification distinguishes bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II), bipolar disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BD-NOS), and cyclothymia. A study of the World Health Organization
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that BD is associated with significant functional impairment. There are considerable differences in the acute and prophylactic treatment response among patients with BD. Longitudinal studies show that despite treatment there are often recurrent episodes, residual symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial impairments and functional limitations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many questions regarding the course and outcome of BD and factors that lead to an unfavorable outcome are still open to research. There is evidence that the presence of comorbid personality disorder (PD) has an unfavorable impact on the course of BD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Patients with BD and comorbid PD are more likely to be hospitalized, need more time to achieve symptomatic remission, have more chronic impairments in occupational and social functioning, are less compliant to medication, have greater levels of suicidality, and utilize more psychiatric services than patients with BD without PD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A review reported that BD patients have a significantly higher prevalence of PD than the general population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The prevalence of PD in patients with bipolar disorder is estimated between 30% and 40%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This concerns particularly personality disorders from the B and C clusters and in particular borderline personality disorder (BPD). There are considerable areas of clinical overlap between BD and BPD, especially mood instability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a sample of 375 patients with a bipolar I or II disorder prevalence of BPD was estimated at 37.3% as screened by PDQ-4+, specified as 34,3% in 169 patients who were euthymic at the time of completing the PDQ-4+, 36,8% in 163 depressed patients, and 51.2% in 43 patients with current (hypo-) mania (personal communication R. Kupka: unpublished data from the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network). Patients who meet diagnostic criteria for both disorders (BD and BPD) have more frequently a history of substance abuse
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore there is evidence that the presence of comorbid PD has a negative impact on the course of BD, leading to more mixed episodes and depressive symptoms, a higher suicide risk, a worse therapeutic response, and less treatment adherence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Given the overlap in clinical presentation of BD and BPD, it has been suggested that there are shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>],
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Only three publications report the effectiveness of treatment of BD with comorbid BPD. In a matched case&#x02013;control study Swartz et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] compared patients who met diagnostic criteria for both BD and BPD with patients with BD without BPD. Both groups received pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The results suggest that treatment course may be longer in patients suffering from both BD and BPD. Preston et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] observed that dimensions of BPD improved significantly with lamotrigine treatment. There was a trend for comorbid bipolar patients to require a second psychoactive medication in addition to lamotrigine during extended treatment. Frankenburg and Zanarini
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study the efficacy of divalproex sodium in the treatment of women with BPD and comorbid BD-II. They found that treatment with divalproex sodium significantly decreased irritability and anger, tempestuousness in relationships, and impulsive aggressiveness.</p><p>Currently little research exists on the effects of psychological treatments in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features or BPD. There are no specific recommendations included in the guidelines for the treatment of BD in this population (e.g., the Dutch guideline
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). There clearly is a need to develop new psychotherapies or evaluate existing psychological interventions to improve the course of BD and quality of life as well as reducing mental health care utilization in these patients. This study evaluates the addition of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) to treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features as described in the inclusion criteria. STEPPS is a cognitive behavioral skills group treatment for BPD developed to improve their emotion regulation. The training consists of 20 weekly sessions of approximately 2,5&#x000a0;hours and has 4 parts: psycho-education, emotion regulation skills, behavioral skills, and emotion handling plan. Two trainers deliver the training. The group size is 8&#x02013;12 patients. An uncontrolled pilot study presented an indication of the effectiveness of the STEPPS in BPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A randomized trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] showed that BPD patients treated with STEPPS compared with TAU showed larger reduction of BPD symptoms, more quality of life and less general psychological symptoms. All improvements were still significant after 6&#x000a0;months. In another randomized trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] STEPPS plus TAU also led to greater improvements in impulsivity, negative affectivity, mood, and global functioning. STEPPS is included in the Dutch guidelines for treatment in BPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The underlying assumption is that BPD is characterized by a defect in the individual&#x02019;s internal ability to regulate emotional intensity. The aim of the training is to gain skills to manage emotions and behavior related problems. Friends and family members provide the &#x0201c;reinforcement team&#x0201d; and learn to reinforce and support newly learned skills of the patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.steppsforbpd.com">http://www.steppsforbpd.com</ext-link>).</p><p>BPD can be conceptualized as a dimensional or spectrum disorder. Patients may suffer from significant symptoms of BPD without meeting the full diagnostic criteria defined by DSM-IV-TR. To increase the clinical relevance of the present study, both patients with BPD as well as those with borderline personality features are included. For this study patients with borderline personality features are included if they have three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, with the additional requirement that these include both impulsivity and anger bursts, since STEPPS training is specifically aimed at improving skills to regulate these symptoms.</p><p>The study described in this article will investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD (study part 1). Furthermore it will be investigated in a randomised controlled trial if a specific treatment (STEPPS combined with TAU) compared to TAU only will lead to better clinical outcomes as well as an increased quality of life and less care consumptions (study part 2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><sec><title>Study part 1</title><p>Screening for personality disorder with a questionnaire (PDQ4+) in patients with BD treated in a specialized outpatient facility, followed by a semi-structured diagnostic interview (SCID-II) in those patients who screened positive on BPD or borderline personality features relevant for this study.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], Dutch translation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) to screen for the prevalence of BPD. After screening all patients who score positively on the presence of BPD will be asked to participate in a <italic>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders</italic> (SCID-II)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; Dutch translation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The SCID-II will start with modules concerning BPD. In case of the presence of three BPD symptoms, including both impulsivity and anger bursts, the interview will be continued with modules of other personality disorders to explore further axis-II comorbidity. In case of presence of less than three BPD symptoms (including both impulsivity and anger burst) the interview will be terminated.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Modules K &#x00026; L will be completed to determine substance abuse, and module M part I &#x00026; II will be completed to exclude schizoaffective disorder. In patients who were previously assessed with the MINI-Plus, a re-test will be completed only if the information is older than 2&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Study part 2: After inclusion into the trial patients are randomly assigned either to the STEPPS added to treatment as usual (TAU) for bipolar disorder or the control group receiving TAU for BD only. Patients in the intervention group will be assessed on all outcome measures at baseline (T0), at the end of the intervention (T1) and 12 (T2) and 18 (T3) months after start of treatment.

The relationship between BD and BPD is still subject of controversy. In a review Paris et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] conclude that BPD and BD may co-occur, but their relationship is not consistent or specific. More knowledge about co-occurrence and comorbidity of these disorders may have an important clinical relevance in order to plan appropriate treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is expected that a psychological treatment aimed at improving emotion regulation will have a positive effect on symptoms of personality disorder as well as BD, and will contribute to an increased quality of life and less care consumption in patients with complex emotional instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no competing interest in relationship to this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>GR is coordinating investigator and grant holder.
