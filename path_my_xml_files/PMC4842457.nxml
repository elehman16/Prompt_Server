dual-task training program to improve postural stability in infantile hemiparesis.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients participated in this study; patients were
classified randomly into two equal groups: study and control groups. Both groups received
conventional physical therapy treatment including mobility exercises, balance exercises,
gait training exercises, and exercises to improve physical conditioning. In addition, the
study group received a selected dual-task training program including balance and cognitive
activities. The treatment program was conducted thrice per week for six successive weeks.
The patients were assessed with the Biodex Balance System. These measures were recorded
two times: before the application of the treatment program (pre) and after the end of the
treatment program (post). [Results] There was a significant improvement for both groups;
the improvement was significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group.
[Conclusion] The selected dual-task training program is effective in improving postural
stability in patients with infantile hemiparesis when added to the conventional physical
therapy program.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Infantile hemiparesis</kwd><kwd>Postural stability</kwd><kwd>Dual-task training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postural control is considered an automatic system. However, recent studies suggest the
involvement of attentional processes in the regulation of posture during simple or more
complex tasks, especially when the latter involves attentional processes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is well known that visual information plays an important role in postural control in
children; visual inputs are known to require attention, and the execution of eye movements
involves attention<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several structures in the central nervous system, the cerebral cortex (frontal, parietal,
and occipital), and the brainstem (paramedian pontine reticular formation and superior
colliculus) play an important role in postural control as well as in the programming and
execution of eye movements. Consequently, one could expect interferences between oculomotor
and postural control. Studies on the effects of eye movements on posture in normal children
are nonexistent. The few studies available have focused only on adult subjects, and their
results are discordant<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The body position in space maintained by the postural control for the dual purposes of
stability and orientation. Postural dysfunction in cerebral palsy is due to the decreased
capacity to modulate postural activity in certain situations. Recently, researchers have
suggested that postural control requires significant attention<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Researchers have demonstrated the attentional demands of
maintaining an upright posture by using the dual-task paradigm with postural control chosen
as the primary task. A dual-task condition is a situation in which a person performs two
attention-demanding tasks simultaneously. Most of our environments consist of background
noise, obstacles, and distracting visual and auditory stimuli<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In our daily life with or without our attention, we perform dual tasks. Typically,
developing children are capable of dividing their attention between tasks within a limit,
such that neither of the tasks is affected. Dual-task interference occurs due to the
conflict arising in resolving the allocation of attention between two tasks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Blanchard along with Pellecchia were the
first researchers to demonstrate the interaction between the cognitive process and motor
control in the pediatric population<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies demonstrate the combined
effects of physical and cognitive tasks on postural sway in both adults and children with
spastic cerebral palsy. Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies showing
the attentional requirements in young and older children during postural tasks and in
various neurological conditions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, there is a lack of literature examining the postural sway during the attentional
demands of a concurrent cognitive task in children with cerebral palsy. These children often
encounter numerous dual-task situations in their daily living activities. Therefore, there
is a need to identify whether dual-task conditions affect the postural control of children
with cerebral palsy to pinpoint the importance of the rehabilitation needs and to decrease
the risk of falls<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this
work is to study the effect of dual-task training on postural stability in children with
infantile hemiparetic cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty children with spastic hemiparesis (infantile type) between the ages of nine to
fifteen years participated in this experimental study. Participants were recruited from our
clinic, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University. The degree of spasticity of all
participants ranged from grade 1 to grade 2, measured according to the modified Ashworth
Scale. Participants could stand and walk independently and they could understand and follow
verbal commands and instructions during both testing and training sessions. We excluded
children with fixed deformities of upper and lower limbs or had significant perceptual,
cognitive, visual and auditory disorders.</p><p>The children were assigned into two groups of equal number, a control group, and a study
group. Each group consisted of fifteen participants. Ethical approval was obtained in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declarations of Helsinki.</p><p>The Biodex Balance System (AESCULAP-MEDITEC GMBH, Holland) was used to measure postural
stability parameters of all participants. The study procedure was explained to each patient.
Informed consent was filled and signed by the father or the mother. Care was taken not to
interrupt the recording procedure to maintain the child in a relaxed position. Each child
was instructed to take off their shoes before standing.</p><p>To ensure the safety of every patient, the session started with the balance platform in the
&#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; or static position. Before beginning the evaluation on the Biodex system, the
supporting structures above and below the examined joints were adequately fixed to stabilize
the balance device. We positioned the display at the patient&#x02019;s eye level to ensure comfort
and safety. To protect the patient against sudden or unexpected movement on the platform,
the patient was asked to stand in the center of the platform and grasp the support handle,
then progress to standing without grasping the support handle. Three trials were performed
before testing. For static balance testing, the &#x0201c;default settings&#x0201d; were preselected with
three trials per side. The pre-trial testing assists with the learning curve and provides a
better average of the data. The system&#x02019;s microprocessor-based actuator controls the degree
of surface instability.</p><p>The assessment of postural stability was performed pre and post treatment program for each
participant in both groups. The Postural Stability test emphasizes a patient&#x02019;s ability to
maintain their center of mass. The patient&#x02019;s score on this test assesses deviations from the
center; thus, a lower score is more desirable than a higher score. In this study platform,
stability was selected to be at one level (i.e.) level eight. The testing menu screen was
selected from the main menu. The patient setup information screen was displayed on Postural
Stability. The patient&#x02019;s name, age, and range of height were selected. The foot position and
angle for each patient was recorded on the control display by using the alpha numeric grid
on the platform. The foot position and angle for each patient were constant during pre- and
post-test. The stance type was adjusted at a two-leg stance. The start button was pressed to
activate the cursor, and the patient was asked to move the cursor to the center point on the
grid. The record button was pressed to bring up the patient position entry screen. Using the
keypads, the patient&#x02019;s left foot, left heel, right foot, and right heel positions were
entered with the midline of the foot and the platform grid as reference points. The stance
button was touched at the postural stability testing screen to scroll through the three
stance positions provided: left, right or both. The test trial time was set at 20 seconds.
The initial and ending platform stability settings were entered at level eight, with three
trials for each patient. The (OK) button was touched to confirm selections and to return to
the postural stability testing screen. With the patient ready to begin the test, the collect
data button was touched. The screen provided a three-second countdown before beginning the
first of three test trials. The display screen showed total trial time, platform setting,
and stance to the left of the grid. This displayed the trial number and score to the right
of the grid. After the first trial, the screen displayed &#x0201c;Trial 1 Complete,&#x0201d; the platform
returned to the locked position, and a ten-second rest countdown began for the second trial.
The data were collected and the second test trial started and continued. After completing
the test, a &#x0201c;Test Complete&#x0201d; message was displayed. The Results button was touched to advance
to the postural stability test results screen. The Print button was touched to automatically
generate a printed report at the postural stability test results screen. The (Save Results)
button was touched to save the test data and then (OK) was touched in response to the &#x0201c;Save
Results for later reporting or export&#x0201d;. The data generated from this test were in the form
of a balance index. This included the overall balance index, which represents the patient&#x02019;s
ability to control his balance in all directions. High values mean balance disturbance
(increase rate of body swaying during the test). In addition, the results included the
anterior/posterior (A/P) index, which represents the patient&#x02019;s ability to control his
balance in a front to back direction. High values indicate balance disturbance. Moreover,
the medial/lateral (M/L) index represents the patient&#x02019;s ability to maintain his balance from
side to side. High values indicate balance disturbance. The (Home) button was touched to
return to the opening menu from the postural stability test results screen.</p><p>Children in the control group received a specially designed exercise program based on
balance activities while those in the study group received the same program in conjunction
with selected cognitive activities (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

postural stability compared with those focusing only on conventional balance training in
children with infantile hemiparesis. Postural stability depends on the on appropriate
integration of visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular signals, which accordingly leads to
the generation of an optimal motor response to counteract a postural perturbation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Swan et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, proposed that performing a secondary cognitive task
directs attention away from balance-related cues, thereby preventing over-corrections.</p><p>Cognitive therapy is important to reduce fall risk. Although hemiplegics have complex
impairments involving cognitive, sensory, and motor functions, they receive therapies
focused on a single aspect at a time. For example, a physical therapist provides treatment
for motor impairments or poor balance control, whereas an occupational therapist provides
cognitively oriented therapy. However, many tasks in a community setting require an
interplay of motor, sensory, and cognitive functions. The interventions that were provided
to the dual-task group in this study help patients with stroke adapt to the real-world
environment. Therefore, our findings that dual-task training focusing on balance control and
cognitive function improved postural stability have important clinical implications and
suggest that this type of dual-task training might be helpful for reducing fall risk and
helping patients with stroke adapt to new strategies<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These results suggest that patients in the dual-task group reduce their risk of falling or
becoming unstable during activities that require weight shifts. In addition, significant
decreases in sway area and sway length were observed only in the dual-task group during
steady standing, which represents steadiness and postural control<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee et
al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported that visual feedback
training improves sitting balance and visual perception in patients with chronic stroke. The
dual-task training we provided was task oriented and of high intensity. Dual-task programs
trigger the conscious control mechanisms and attention strategies and reduce automatic
control during activities. The automatic control of movement involves the supplementary
motor area (SMA) which receives its major input from the basal ganglia (BG)<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The potent effect of dual-task programs
may be attributed to the efficacy of attention in generating cortical plasticity in the
primary somatosensory and motor cortex and improvement in the motor memory<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Holschneider et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, also stated that long-term dual-task programs elicit
plastic changes in the brain. These changes result in a combination of increase in the
efficiency of neural processing (sensorimotor cortex, striatum, vermis) and enforcement of
the cerebellar-cortical circuit.</p><p>In the current study, improvement in the postural stability parameters can be explained by
the potent effect of the dual-task program on activating an alternate pathway containing the
cerebellum, sensorimotor cortex, and lateral premotor cortex. In this pathway, the
cerebellum is responsible for movement timing. The premotor cortex may be responsible for
scaling the motor activity when facilitated by somatosensory cues related to any task (i.e.
walking). This means that recruitment of these structures can compensate for inefficient
BG<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chen et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>
compared the between effects of simple versus dual-task training on dynamic balance but in
children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as they found it effective in favour
to dual-task training. Future studies should investigate the effect of various cognitive
skills on balance through postural sway<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, future research should investigate the different
effects of dual motor task training in patients with neurological deficits from various
viewpoints depending upon activities of daily living and gait<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Belen&#x02019;ki&#x0012d;</surname><given-names>VE</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurfinkel&#x02019;</surname><given-names>VS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pal&#x02019;tsev</surname><given-names>EI</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>[Control elements of voluntary movements]</article-title>.
