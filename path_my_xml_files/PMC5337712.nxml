To reduce walking EC, a spring-like ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) can be prescribed. However, the reduction in EC that can be obtained from these AFOs is stiffness dependent, and it is unknown which AFO stiffness would optimally support calf muscle weakness. The PROOF-AFO study aims to determine the effectiveness of stiffness-optimised AFOs on reducing walking EC, and improving gait biomechanics and walking speed in patients with calf muscle weakness, compared to standard, non-optimised AFOs. A second aim is to build a model to predict optimal AFO stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A prospective intervention study will be conducted. In total, 37 patients with calf muscle weakness who already use an AFO will be recruited. At study entry, participants will receive a new custom-made spring-like AFO of which the stiffness can be varied. For each patient, walking EC (primary outcome), gait biomechanics and walking speed (secondary outcomes) will be assessed for five stiffness configurations and the patient's own (standard) AFO. On the basis of walking EC and gait biomechanics outcomes, the optimal AFO stiffness will be determined. After wearing this optimal AFO for 3&#x02005;months, walking EC, gait biomechanics and walking speed will be assessed again and compared to the standard AFO.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam has approved the study protocol. The study is registered at the Dutch trial register (NTR 5170). The PROOF-AFO study is the first to compare stiffness-optimised AFOs with usual care AFOs in patients with calf muscle weakness. The results will also provide insight into factors that influence optimal AFO stiffness in these patients. The results are necessary for improving orthotic treatment and will be disseminated through international peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ankle-foot-orthosis</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Walking energy cost</kwd><kwd>Neuromuscular disorders</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Prinses Beatrix Spierfonds</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004243</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W.0R 14-21</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A wide variety of outcome measures is assessed to provide a broader view on the efficacy of stiffness optimised AFOs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The selection of the optimal AFO stiffness is based on objective walking energy cost and gait biomechanical measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A limitation may be that only a limited range of stiffness is tested which may not include the optimal stiffness.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with neuromuscular disorders, such as poliomyelitis and Charcot&#x02013;Marie&#x02013;Tooth disease, frequently suffer from weakness or paresis of the calf muscles. Gait in calf muscle weakness is often characterised by excessive ankle dorsiflexion and persistent knee flexion during stance and by a reduced ankle push-off.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These gait deviations nearly always lead to walking limitations such as instability,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> pain,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> reduced speed<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and an increased walking energy cost (EC),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> which may restrict walking activity in daily life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>In normal gait, the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) prevent excessive ankle dorsiflexion, as the ground reaction force progresses over the foot in late stance. They create an eccentric force to restrain inclination of the shank,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> preventing the ankle from collapsing in uncontrolled dorsiflexion. This is followed by a concentric contraction of the calf muscles during push-off, which assists in propelling the limb forward into swing and inducing knee flexion.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When the calf muscles are weak or paralysed, the forward progression of the shank will not be slowed down, which results in a rapid and uncontrolled ankle dorsiflexion,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> moving the knee anteriorly and prolonging the time during which the ground reaction force passes behind the knee. This yields an increased external knee flexion moment and, hence, quadriceps overloading.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, as a consequence of calf muscle weakness, ankle push-off power is reduced, which may cause a shorter step length and single support time.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This reduces walking speed and, when compensated for, increases walking EC,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which may lead to early fatigue during gait.</p><p>To improve gait and reduce walking EC, patients with calf muscle weakness can be provided with an orthosis that restrains ankle dorsiflexion, such as a carbon fibre dorsal leaf spring ankle-foot orthosis (DLS-AFO).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref> When the ankle moves into dorsiflexion during late stance, this AFO acts like a spring and provides a plantar flexion moment at the ankle, thereby reducing the maximal dorsiflexion angle and shank inclination angle.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> As a result of the reduced shank inclination, the knee is not constrained into flexion and the ground reaction force will progress more anterior in late stance. Consequently, the ground reaction force will not pass as far behind the knee as without the AFO, thereby reducing the external knee flexion moment during stance.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The spring-like properties of the DLS-AFO can also support ankle push-off by unleashing energy from the leaf in pre-swing that was loaded in the stance phase.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This energy takes over part of the ankle work during the gait cycle<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and lowers soleus activity,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> thereby reducing the need for inefficient compensation strategies by patients with weak calf muscles.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In healthy individuals, an exoskeleton based on this mechanism of storing and unleashing energy reduced the walking EC by 7%.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The effectiveness of spring-like DLS-AFOs to reduce walking EC, however, is indicated to be stiffness dependent.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Simulations in which AFO ankle stiffness was systematically varied demonstrated that with increasing stiffness walking EC first decreased, then increased;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> a trend also observed in healthy individuals wearing a spring-like exoskeleton.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Moreover, in both studies, an optimal stiffness was found at which walking EC was minimal, supporting the idea that also in patients with calf muscle weakness there would be an optimal DLS-AFO stiffness that reduces walking EC the most.</p><p>In current clinical practice, a variety of off the shelf and custom-made AFOs and orthopaedic shoes for calf muscle weakness are provided, of which the effectiveness to reduce walking EC has not been secured.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Since the mechanical properties of these AFOs are generally fixed, it is not possible to individually adjust the orthotic stiffness. Hence, it may be assumed that common practice in providing AFOs for calf muscle weakness is biomechanically suboptimal in reducing walking EC and that stiffness-optimised DLS-AFOs will be more energy efficient in this respect, although this has not been studied yet. To reach consensus about the optimal AFO for people with calf muscle weakness, the effectiveness of stiffness-optimised AFOs compared to standard AFOs needs to be evaluated.</p><p>In addition, the factors that determine optimal DLS-AFO stiffness in calf muscle weakness need to be evaluated, assuming such stiffness exists. Patient characteristics such as degree of (calf) muscle weakness, ankle joint range of motion and body weight will most likely determine optimal AFO stiffness,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> although this has not yet been investigated. If the factors that influence optimal stiffness are known, individual optimal stiffness may be computed based on pre-specified patient characteristics, which may contribute to improving AFO care in patients with neuromuscular disorders.</p><p>The study described in this design article will test the hypothesis that walking with a stiffness-optimised DLS-AFO is more energy effective compared to a standard, non-optimised AFO for patients with neuromuscular disorders that demonstrate calf muscle weakness. Furthermore, our study aims to evaluate the effects of varying DLS-AFO stiffness on walking EC, gait biomechanics and speed and to create a simulation model to individually compute patient-dependent optimal DLS-AFO stiffness in calf muscle weakness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective uncontrolled intervention study with three repeated measurements will be conducted to evaluate the effects of stiffness-optimised AFOs compared to standard, non-optimised AFOs.

After a baseline assessment of demographics, anthropometrics and muscle strength, patients will be casted for their experimental AFO. Between the first and second visits, daily step activity will be measured with the StepWatch, the adherence monitor and the activity diary.</p><p>During the second visit, T1<sub>fit</sub>, walking EC and speed will be assessed for walking with shoes only and the patients' standard AFO. Furthermore, patients will be asked to fill in the SF36 and FSS questionnaires, and a DTI scan of the lower legs will be conducted. The scan will be made before or at least 30&#x02005;min after the walking test to avoid interference of additional blood flow and muscle damage with the DTI scan.</p><p>At the third visit, the experimental AFO will be delivered. Fitting and alignment of the AFO will be checked and, if necessary, corrected by the orthotist. Patients can walk up and down a hallway to adjust to the new AFO. After patients feel comfortable with the new AFO, they will be tested for gait biomechanics while walking barefoot, with shoes only, their current AFO and the experimental AFO in five stiffness configurations (T2<sub>k-3DGA</sub>). The order of stiffness configurations will be randomly assigned, using a balanced block randomisation for all possible sequences, to ensure that the same number of patients is allocated to each sequence. The randomisation is performed per Matlab script (V.2015, MathWorks). Between the different conditions, patients will be allowed enough rest and have a 5&#x02005;min acclimation period in which they can walk with and adapt to the new stiffness.</p><p>One week after the assessment of gait biomechanics, walking EC and speed will be measured for the five stiffness configurations of the experimental AFO (T2<sub>K-6MWT</sub>). An evaluation of all AFO stiffness configurations will allow the selection of the stiffness with the maximal benefit for a particular subject (explained below), referred to as the subject's optimal AFO, which will be provided to the patient at the fifth visit (T2<sub>deliver</sub>). During this fifth visit, the ankle and forefoot stiffness of the experimental AFO (all five configurations) and the patients' standard AFO will be measured with the BRUCE device.</p><p>One week after providing the optimal AFO, patients will be contacted to check for adverse events. If the patient has no symptoms, the follow-up period will start, which will last until the next study visit, 12&#x02005;weeks later. If patients report any adverse event during the follow-up period, the adverse event will be recorded and checked on regularly. At the start of the follow-up visit (T3<sub>Kopt</sub>), patients are asked about adverse events within the follow-up period that were not previously reported. During this visit, walking EC, walking speed, gait biomechanics, perceived physical functioning, perceived fatigue and satisfaction with the optimal AFO will be assessed. Furthermore, compliance and daily step activity will be assessed for the optimal AFO in the week prior to the follow-up measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Selection of optimal AFO</title><p>After the T2<sub>K-6MWT</sub> visit, the optimal AFO stiffness will be selected based primarily on walking EC in view of walking speed and secondarily on the gait pattern (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013342F3">figure 3</xref>). The procedure starts by sorting the measured stiffness configurations by walking EC outcome. All conditions that have a &#x02265;5% higher EC compared to the condition with the lowest recorded EC will be excluded from the selection procedure, unless the walking speed is &#x02265;5% higher compared to the speed of the condition with the lowest EC. The 5% range for the EC is chosen because of the mediocre precision of this measure.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The reason that walking speed is taken into account is because this is an important parameter for daily activities.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Subsequently, three assessors will independently evaluate the gait pattern of the remaining configurations and pick the configuration that normalises the gait pattern the most according to three predefined parameters: (1) peak dorsiflexion angle in late stance, (2) peak knee extension angle during single support and (3) peak ankle power. Disagreements in assignment of the optimal AFO will be resolved with a consensus procedure.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013342F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Selection procedure of the optimal AFO stiffness.

If the difference in MRC score for the calf muscles is &#x0003c;1 grade, EC and gait biomechanics will be assessed with the same AFO stiffness on both legs because no differences in optimal stiffness between the legs are expected. Optimisation will be performed for both legs simultaneously using the aforementioned procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013342F3">figure 3</xref>), and patients are always provided with the same AFO stiffness for both legs. In case the MRC score of the calf muscles differs more than one grade between legs, both AFOs will be optimised separately. First, the AFO for strongest leg will be optimised solely based on a gait analysis where the experimental AFO is worn on the strongest leg and the patient's own AFO on the weakest leg. After the AFO for the strongest leg has been optimised, EC and gait biomechanics will be assessed using the optimal AFO on the strongest leg and altering AFO stiffness on the weaker leg. On the basis of these data, the AFO for the weakest leg will be optimised using the procedure described above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013342F3">figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data for all patients will be coded and entered into a secured database, OpenClinica.

Furthermore, it aims to create a computational model to determine the optimal AFO stiffness for each patient, assuming such stiffness exists. This study captures several important strengths.</p><p>First, our study uses a stiffness-adjustable AFO design by a replaceable carbon fibre leaf spring, which enables the stiffness of the AFO to be varied within the same custom-made orthosis. This is an important advantage, as it allows a comparison of the efficacy between different AFO stiffness configurations, while minimising confounding factors, such as differences in alignment and footplate length or stiffness. Furthermore, the AFO is fabricated with standardised sizes of components that can be easily implemented in daily practice. This ensures direct improvement of AFO care if stiffness-optimised AFOs are more effective compared to standard AFOs currently used in clinical practice. Although we measure five different stiffnesses over a broad range, the optimal stiffness may not be included, which is a limitation of our study. We use multiple outcome measures to compare the usual care AFO with the optimised experimental AFO on different levels of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, providing a unique data set. With this data set, a broader view on the efficacy of stiffness-optimised AFOs on gait biomechanics and the impact of these AFOs on patients' daily life can be assessed.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In addition, the large data set will provide input for creating and adjusting a musculoskeletal model in such a way that optimal AFO stiffness may be computed. This would enable clinicians to provide each patient with an optimal AFO stiffness, based on their individual characteristics.</p><p>In conclusion, the PROOF-AFO study will be the first to compare the effectiveness of stiffness-optimised AFOs with standard AFOs in patients with neuromuscular disorders exhibiting calf muscle weakness. The ECs of walking will be the primary outcome of this study, but the evaluation includes multiple outcome measures, which allows us to give an extensive comparison between AFOs with different stiffnesses and to create a simulation model to compute optimal stiffness. These results may provide new insights about how AFO stiffness influences gait in patients with calf muscle weakness, but they may also directly improve AFO care by providing a computational model for individually determining optimal stiffness that can be applied in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) has approved the study protocol, and the study will be performed at the Department of Rehabilitation of the AMC in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR 5170) and will be carried out according to good clinical practice guidelines. Patients receive a study number, which will be used on all forms instead of names. Forms will be stored in a locked cabinet to assure anonymity. Only persons involved in the study have access to these forms before and after the study. A steering committee oversees the progress of the study, while monitoring will be performed by an independent monitor of the AMC. Aspects that will be monitored will include: inclusion rate; trial master file; informed consent process; inclusion and exclusion criteria; source data verification; safety reporting; investigational product; trial procedures and closing and reporting. Important protocol changes will be recorded (a new protocol version number will be assigned) and reported to the Medical Ethics Committee. The study is insured in case patients are harmed by participation in the study. After completion of the study, a manuscript with positive as well as negative or inconclusive results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at scientific conferences. Furthermore, the study data sets and statistical codes will be available on request.
