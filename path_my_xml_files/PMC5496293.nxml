This study was approved by the Clinical Research, Ethical Committee, College of Medicine, Al-Mustansiriyia University. A total number of 111 patients (79 males, 32 females) previously and currently treated with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin presented with acute MI in a Coronary Care Unit (CCU), were divided into three groups, Group A: Thirty-nine patients (29 males + 10 females) treated with atorvastatin 20 mg/day, Group B: Thirty patients (20 males + 10 females) treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, compared to 42 patients presented with MI not previously treated with statins (30 males + 12 females) were enrolled in this study. Each patient was clinically examined by a cardiologist, and the diagnosis was achieved through electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI). The inclusion criteria were patients with a recent acute MI admitted into the CCU. The exclusion criteria were patients with valvular heart diseases, malignant diseases, acute infection, inflammatory disorders and blood disorders, advanced renal disease, liver disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM).

57.65% of our patients were of type 2 DM.</p><p>Moreover, most of the recruited patients with MI in the present study were associated with hypertension, DM, high BMI, and dyslipidemia which may explain the elevated ASP levels in the current study that supported by Saleh <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;

all of enrolled patients were Caucasian that associated with high ASP levels.</p><p>Regarding statins pharmacotherapy, in statins-treated patients with acute MI showed a significant low ASP levels compared to the non-statins treated patient, both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin decreases ASP levels indirectly through modulation of complement which is regarded as precursor of ASP, since C3 play a role in initiations of CAD and cardiovascular complications.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, CAD is associated with higher fasting and postprandial C3 due to elevated TG levels which upregulate C3 that encourage premature microvascular and macrovascular complications through C3 itself or ASP which is the end product of C3 activations.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In addition, Halkes <italic>et al</italic>., study demonstrated that simvastatin therapy in patients with CAD significantly lowers C3 levels and then indirectly ASP serum levels[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that consistent with findings of the present study, but unfortunately serum C3 levels were not measured in the present study. In addition, terminal complement complex, ASP, and other inflammatory biomarkers that involved in pathogenesis of CAD appears to be a direct stimulant of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), thus HMG-CoA inhibitors such as cerivastatin will decrease ASP levels and other inflammatory mediator like IL-6[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which may explain the statins effect on ASP levels on CAD in the current study.</p><p>Both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in the present study showed comparable effects with significant differences in LDL, TG, and AI, since rosuvastatin is more potent and more efficacious than atorvastatin as supported by Qian <italic>et al</italic>., who disclosed a superior effect of rosuvastatin to atorvastatin effect on CAD,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] but there was insignificant differences between them regarding the ASP lowering effect, both decreases C3 and subsequently; ASP serum levels in patients with dyslipidemia and CAD.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Regarding other treatment for patients presented with acute MI, metformin drug was used in 57.65% of our patients due to type 2 DM, thus reduction in ASP levels might be due to metformin effects as observed by Oktenli <italic>et al</italic>., study that revealed a significant reduction in ASP levels in women patients with polycystic ovary syndrome following 3 months therapies with metformin;[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] however, the selected effect of metformin on ASP levels was not estimated at the present study since; we have a previous study regarding the cardioprotective effect of metformin in patients presented with acute MI that previously treated with metformin.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>ASP levels were negatively correlated with LDL cholesterol (LDL-c), HDL-c, and TC in both statins- and nonstatins-treated patients with acute MI, and positively correlated with other lipid profile and anthropometric variables, these findings are correlated with Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., findings that revealed a significant association and correlation between high serum ASP levels and total TG and BMI with significant negative correlation with LDL-c, HDL-c, and TC in diabetic obese patients regarding Han and Hui populations.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, ASP levels were positively correlated with cTnI in patients with acute MI regardless of statins therapy, since ASP levels are positively correlated with severity of CAD and cTnI indicating that ASP is implicated in pathogenesis of CAD due to metabolic alterations in lipid profile.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>There are numerous limitations of the current study, relative small sample size, determination of ASP receptors in coronary vessels, and HMG-CoA activity in response to the ASP levels are the main points that limit the present study.
