However, no randomized controlled trial has compared air-Q&#x02122; with i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122; in adult patient. Hence, we designed this study to compare air-Q&#x02122; with LMA-S&#x02122; and i-gel&#x02122; in adult patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 75 adult patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I/II of both sexes, between 18 and 60 years, were included in this prospective randomized controlled trial conducted in a tertiary care center. Randomization of patients was done in three equal groups according to the insertion of supraglottic airway device by a computer-generated random number sequence: group air-Q&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25), group i-gel&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25), and group LMA-S&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25).

Review of airway management data in the Fourth National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anesthetists and the Difficult Airway Society indicates that there is scope of improvement in the management.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Difficult Airway Society guideline recommends the use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or an intubating LMA in cases of failed intubation by direct laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Second-generation supraglottic airway devices provide an added safety margin from aspiration by incorporation of a gastric access port. Air-Q&#x02122; (Cookgas LLC, St. Louis, USA) is a supraglottic airway device with anterior curve and mask ridges with inflatable cuff which perfectly fits to perilaryngeal structure that provides adequate oropharyngeal seal pressure, and it can also be used as a conduit for endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] i-gel&#x02122; (Intersurgical, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) is also a second-generation supraglottic airway devices made up of thermoelastomer gel (styrene ethylene butadiene styrene) with inbuilt gastric drain tube.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It consists of an anatomical firm tube section and noninflatable cuff, which seals the laryngeal inlet and prevents neurovascular compression at the larynx. It also contains epiglottic rest to prevent downfolding. LMA Supreme&#x02122; (LMA-S&#x02122;, Laryngeal Mask Co. Ltd, Le Rocher, Victoria, Mahe Seychelles) is a polyvinyl chloride made, anatomically shaped, single-use supraglottic device that incorporates a gastric insufflation port.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although a number of randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis have compared i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122; in adult patients and found that both the device provided equivalent oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] After reviewing the literature, we did not found any study till now that has compared air-Q&#x02122; with either of these two devices in adult patients.

After obtained informed consent from the participants, 75 adult patients between the age of 18&#x02013;60 years of either sex and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask as a primary airway device were included in the study. Patients having gastroesophageal reflux disease, prior esophageal surgery, hiatus hernia known oropharyngeal morbidities, prior history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, full stomach with risk of aspiration, body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, any condition which requires endotracheal intubation, and difficult airway were excluded from this study.</p><p>Randomization of patients in this study was done in three equal groups according to a computer-generated random number sequence: group air-Q&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25), group i-gel&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25), and group LMA-S&#x02122; (<italic>n</italic> = 25). Randomization sequences were kept in opaque sealed envelope, and they were only opened at the time of induction of general anesthesia by a person not involved in the study and handed over to the anesthesia team.</p><p>It was impossible to blind the device operator due to obvious technical reasons, but investigators observing the patient in the postoperative period and those analyzing the data and participants were blinded to the group allocation.</p><p>Standard ASA fasting guidelines were followed in all patients. In the operation theater, pulse oximetry finger probe, noninvasive arterial blood pressure cuff, and electrocardiograph electrodes were attached. Induction of anesthesia was done with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and propofol 2&#x02013;3 mg/kg. Once the adequate depth of anesthesia was confirmed by jaw thrust, supraglottic airway device was placed as per manufacturer recommendations. For choosing the size of the device, we used manufacturers' recommendations. After the insertion, supraglottic device cuff was inflated using aneroid manometer and was connected to the circle system of an anesthesia workstation (Datex-ohmeda S/5 Avance), and device was checked for effective ventilation with the appearance of square wave capnograph trace and bilateral chest movements on gentle manual ventilation. In case of a significant air leak or a partial or complete airway obstruction, the device was removed and reinserted. Subsequently, orogastric tube (OGT) was inserted through the drain tube. The device was considered to be failure if more than three attempts required for successful placement.</p><p>OLP of the device was determined by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system with a fresh gas inflow of 3 L/min. The aneroid manometer dial was observed as the pressure increased, and when the dial reached stability, the airway pressure was recorded. This pressure was noted as OLP of the device. Expiratory valve was released completely once the pressure exceeded 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. We also recorded time for successful placement[s] of device (picking the device to appearance of EtCO<sub>2</sub> waveform), ease of device insertion (easy/moderate/difficult/impossible), number of attempts to insert device (first, second, or third), and ease of gastric tube insertion (easy/moderate/difficult/impossible). Spontaneous ventilation under general anesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide + oxygen and 1% isoflurane targeting an end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration of inhalation anesthetic agent around 1.0&#x02013;1.3 and EtCO<sub>2</sub> of 35&#x02013;45 mmHg. After the surgery, the device was removed under a deep plane of anesthesia. Intra- and post-operative complications were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Previously, no study compared all three devices in one setting. Hence, we calculated the sample size based on mean difference of airway leak pressure as 4.9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O between i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122; by Chew <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The sample size came out to be 21 patients per group at a power of 80% and confidence interval of 95%. With a possible dropout of 10%, we included 25 patients per group (total of 75 patients for three groups). The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., version 22.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). For normally distributed data, means of three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. Proportions were compared using Chi-square tests. For comparison of time-related variables, repeated measure ANOVA followed by one-way ANOVA was applied. If <italic>P</italic> value is significant, then multiple comparisons Bonferroni's tests for three groups were applied.

However, insertion of air-Q&#x02122; took significantly longer time than other two devices. Safety of any supraglottic airway device is determined mainly by its OLP and also indicates the feasibility of positive-pressure ventilation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A number of randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis also reported that OLP between i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122; is similar.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] On the contrary to our findings, Chew <italic>et al</italic>. and Ragazzi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that OLP in cases of LMA-S&#x02122; is higher than i-gel&#x02122;.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the other hand, reported mean OLP in adult patients in case of air-Q&#x02122; ranges between 19 cm and 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, it should be remembered that reported OLP for a supraglottic airway device depends on several factors such as use of muscle relaxant, methods of measurement, and type of ventilation (controlled vs. spontaneous respiration). We have found that time taken for air-Q&#x02122; insertion was significantly more than i-gel&#x02122; as well as LMA-S&#x02122; and insertion time is similar between i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122;. A number of RCTs also reported similar insertion time between LMA-S&#x02122; and i-gel&#x02122;.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Theiler <italic>et al</italic>. reported that LMA-S&#x02122; insertion is significantly shorter in patients with cervical collar.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Air-Q&#x02122; insertion time reported in this study is similar to the previous reports by Karim and Swanson and Galgon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, as the mean difference in insertion time is around 5 s between air-Q&#x02122; and i-gel&#x02122; or LMA-S&#x02122;, actual clinical significance of this small difference is questionable. We have found a similar first insertion success rate between all three devices, and Chen <italic>et al</italic>. also found similar first insertion success rate between i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122;.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In contrast to our results, Ragazzi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that first attempt success rate of LMA-S&#x02122; was significantly higher than i-gel&#x02122; (77% vs. 54%).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The reason for this difference could be due to device insertion by inexperienced operators as they mentioned. We have found that subjective ease of OGT insertion was comparable between all three devices, and overall success rates of OGT insertion were similar. One incidence of failure to insert OGT happened in air-Q&#x02122; group. We encountered slight difficulty in passing OGT through air-Q&#x02122; as it passes behind the cuff. The advantage of this technique was useful in suctioning supracuff area. Although many studies done on air-Q&#x02122;, most of these studies did not mention about gastric tube insertion success rate. Recently published study done by Youssef <italic>et al</italic>. alone mentioned that OGT insertion success rate in air-Q&#x02122; was 93%, which matched, with our study.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, they did not mention about the method of OGT insertion. In consistency with our result, Ragazzi <italic>et al</italic>. and Theiler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] mentioned that subjective ease of insertion of OGT was similar between i-gel&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122;, whereas Teoh <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the OGT insertion was subjectively easier for LMA-S&#x02122; than i-gel&#x02122; which was in contrast to our results.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although statistically insignificant, i-gel&#x02122; group had less postoperative sore throat than air-Q&#x02122; and LMA-S&#x02122;. This could be due to soft consistency of i-gel cuff material. As sore throat is uncommon, a larger sample size would be required to found a statistical difference.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, our study findings might not applicable to patients with difficult airway as this study was done in patients with normal airway. Second, it was impossible to blind the device operator, which could lead to bias.
