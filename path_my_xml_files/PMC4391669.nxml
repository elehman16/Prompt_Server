Therefore, it is important to document whether HA is safe and efficacious. We tested whether single and multiple injection viscosupplementation with HA is associated with clinically meaningful pain relief in a new randomized clinical trial (RCT). Our objective was to compare safety and efficacy of intra-articular HA in two formulations: one 3.0 ml injection of Durolane versus five 2.5 ml injections of Artz for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;349) from the People&#x02019;s Republic of China were randomized to treatment (Durolane&#x02009;=&#x02009;175, Artz&#x02009;=&#x02009;174). The Durolane group received a 3.0 ml injection at week 0 (baseline), with sham skin punctures at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. The Artz group received one 2.5 ml injection at each of the same time points. The primary assessment tool was the Likert-type Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) pain scale at weeks 0, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26. Secondary assessments were WOMAC physical function, knee stiffness, and global self-assessment, at identical time points. Statistically-controlled analyses were non-inferiority of Durolane over 18, then over 26 weeks, with <italic>a priori</italic> non-inferiority defined as 8% of the relevant scale. Acetaminophen was permitted as rescue analgesia and all adverse events (AEs) were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall study retention was excellent; 332 patients (95.1%) completed 18 weeks and 319 (91.4%) completed 26 weeks, with no significant retention difference between treatment arms. All variables met non-inferiority criteria over 18 and 26 weeks. Efficacy response in both arms was &#x0003e;90%. Treatment-related AEs were 9.8% (17/174) for Artz and 13.1% (23/175) for Durolane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single injection of Durolane is non-inferior to 5 injections of Artz over 18 and 26 weeks for pain, physical function, global self-assessment, and knee stiffness. Both treatments were efficacious, safe, and well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01295580">NCT01295580</ext-link>.

Aggregate economic costs are considerable because treatment is not curative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; current treatment focuses on relieving pain and other symptoms, as well as improving function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) is widely used as therapy because: it is less aggressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and less expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] than total knee replacement; HA has fewer and generally less serious adverse events (AEs) than total knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; and HA is documented to provide treatment efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis concluded that &#x02018;In patients with knee osteoarthritis, viscosupplementation is associated with a small and clinically irrelevant [pain] benefit and an increased risk for serious adverse events&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We seek to test whether single-injection and multiple-injection viscosupplementation is associated with clinically meaningful pain relief in a new randomized clinical trial (RCT).</p><p>Our goal was to test for non-inferiority of two formulations of HA in treatment of knee OA over an 18-week and then over a 26-week time period. We contrast Durolane (Q-med AB, Sweden), a stabilized HA that is obtained from a nonanimal source, with Artz (also marketed under the names Artzal and Supartz; Seikagaku Corporation Japan), a noncross-linked (native) animal-derived HA that has been available on the Chinese market since 1997.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>We report a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 26-week non-inferiority trial comparing intra-articular injection of Durolane (one dose plus four sham injections) with intra-articular Artz (five doses) in the treatment of knee pain among adults clinically diagnosed with mild-to-moderate knee OA.</p><p>The institutional review board or ethics committee for each study site (see Acknowledgements) was responsible for review and approval of the clinical study, in accordance with guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, as well as any local regulatory requirements of each site. Written approval of the protocol, amendments, and the patient informed consent form were submitted to Bioventus LLC (Durham, NC, USA) before study drugs were shipped to each site.</p><p>Subjects were recruited consecutively at any of seven hospitals between January 2011 and February 2012, a period of approximately 1 year. Each potential subject provided written informed consent and underwent a qualifying screening examination prior to study enrollment. Each patient consented that their study data could be examined by the sponsor, drug regulatory authorities, auditors, and study monitors, in compliance with the statement of confidentiality.</p><p>After consent, eligible subjects were allocated randomly to either Durolane or Artz. Randomization was double-blinded, using a 1:1 allocation in block sizes of four patients. The allocation schedule was generated by statisticians at TigerMed Consulting Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), using SAS Proc Plan (v9.1.3; Cary, NC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were recruited for the study from seven sites in the People&#x02019;s Republic of China (Beijing, four hospitals; Shanghai, two hospitals; Hangzhou, one hospital). Assessment at screening included a radiograph of the study knee in the standing, weight-bearing, semi-flexed, postero-anterior view, as assessed by the X-ray reader assigned to each study center. Inclusion criteria were as follows: males or females, age 40 to 80 years; physician diagnosis of mild-to-moderate OA fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], as recorded in the chart; radiographic evidence of OA (Kellgren&#x02013;Lawrence radiographic score of 2 or 3); Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) Likert pain subscore of 7 to 17 at both screening and baseline visits; and WOMAC Likert pain question score of 2 to 3 while walking on a flat surface.</p><p>Patient exclusion criteria were: clinically apparent tense effusion on physician examination, determined by either a positive bulge sign or positive ballottement of the patella; Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic score of 0, 1, or 4 in the study knee; symptomatic OA of the contralateral knee (or of either hip) that is not responsive to acetaminophen and/or that requires any change in physical therapy; WOMAC Likert pain question score &#x0003e;3 in the contralateral (nonstudied) knee; intra-articular injection of any HA in the study knee within 9 months prior to screening; previous allergic reaction to any HA product; intra-articular injection of corticosteroids in any joint within 6 months prior to screening; treatment with glucosamine&#x02013;chondroitin sulfate supplement initiated within the past 3 months, or dosage not stable for the past 3 months; active skin disease or infection at the injection site; active hepatic disease, abnormal liver function (Alanine transaminase, Aspartate transaminase or Total bilirubin level more than twice normal values), or renal dysfunction (blood creatinine over the upper limit of normal); systemic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, connective tissue diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, gout/acute pseudo-gout), or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; bleeding diathesis or use of anticoagulants (except aspirin &#x0003c;325 mg/day); and any other medical condition that might make the patient unsuitable for study (for example, any musculoskeletal condition impeding measurement of efficacy at the studied knee, severe progressive chronic disease, malignancy, bleeding disorder, fibromyalgia, significant venous or lymphatic stasis).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment</title><p>Treatment procedures for both products were identical. After screening, patients were given a 2-week washout period for analgesics other than acetaminophen. At week 0, patients were randomized 1:1 and received their first injection of either Durolane or Artz. Injections followed at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. For the Durolane arm, all subsequent injections were sham injections; for the Artz arm, all injections were active. Sham injections of Durolane were subcutaneous and used an empty syringe, and the needle did not enter the joint space. Subcutaneous sham needles have proven indistinguishable from deeper needles in clinical trials of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium salts such as benzalkonium chloride, which can induce HA precipitation, were avoided. Anesthetization of the injection site was permitted using a topical anesthetic (for example, ethyl chloride or lidocaine spray).</p><p>Patient blinding was achieved by draping, so that patients could not determine by sight how the injection was given or what product was injected. Patients were also told that each injection could feel different, to minimize the placebo effect in the Durolane arm. Physicians who gave injections could not be blinded, but outcome assessment was done by different physicians blind to the study treatment.</p><p>Physicians were allowed to inject HA at the knee portal with which they were most experienced (lateral upper patellar, lateral mid patellar, or medial mid patellar). Needles (sizes 20 G and 22 G) were supplied to each study site and unblinded personnel chose the appropriate needle. Joint fluid was withdrawn using an empty 20 ml syringe and the volume of aspirated fluid was recorded. Leaving the needle in place, the syringe was removed and replaced by a prefilled Durolane or Artz syringe. Care was taken when exchanging syringes to avoid displacement of the needle and to ensure that the syringe with the study product was securely attached prior to injection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The only permitted rescue medication for pain was acetaminophen, at doses up to 4 g daily. Efficacy assessments were collected at weeks 0 (baseline), 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26. The 18-week follow-up period was the primary efficacy assessment period. Efficacy assessments included the Likert-type WOMAC pain scale (range 0 to 20, higher scores better), with physical function (range 0 to 68) and knee function (range 0 to 8) subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The WOMAC translation into Chinese has been validated in Chinese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Global self-assessment scores (range 0 to 10, lower scores better) and total grams of acetaminophen used were also collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety</title><p>AE reports were collected continuously, physical examinations and vital signs were assessed at week 0 and 26, and electrocardiograms and blood and urine laboratories were assessed at weeks 0 and 10.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Three datasets were defined for analysis. The intention-to-treat (ITT) set included all patients randomized. The safety set included all patients who received treatment. The per-protocol set included ITT patients who completed all scheduled treatments and also completed all WOMAC pain subscale assessments through week 18, without any major protocol deviations. The per-protocol set was used to assess non-inferiority; since all patients received all treatments and had minimal protocol deviations, this should maximize the difference between treatment arms, if a difference truly exists.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable was the WOMAC pain subscale change from baseline (CFB). Secondary efficacy variables were the WOMAC physical function subscale CFB, the global self-assessment CFB, and the WOMAC knee stiffness subscale CFB. All other efficacy variables assessed were exploratory, including the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials &#x02013; Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) responder variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and use of rescue medications. Exploratory subgroups were split by gender, age (cutoff point &#x0003e;50 years old), and Kellgren&#x02013;Lawrence grade II and III at baseline.</p><p>Important AEs resulted in a dose adjustment, interruption, or permanent stop. AEs were defined as treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). TEAEs included all medical events reported after the first treatment. TRAEs were judged by the site investigator to have a definite, possible, or uncertain relationship to treatment. Both TEAEs and TRAEs were reported, including events classified by the investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely treatment related. Vital signs, blood, and chemistry laboratories were used to study the CFB. Laboratory values and electrocardiograms were also used to study shifts from baseline.</p><p>The required sample size was calculated under several assumptions for the WOMAC pain subscale; change standard deviation is 20 mm with a non-inferiority margin of +8 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] (8% on the 100 mm visual analog scale), which is +1.6 on a Likert 0 to 20 scale, with a type I error rate of 0.05 and a type II error rate of 0.10. The required sample size under these assumptions was 132 per arm, for a total of 264 patients. To account for an anticipated 25% loss to follow-up and important protocol deviations, the recruited sample size was increased to 175 per arm, for a final total of 350 patients.</p><p>Although the study sample size was based on the WOMAC pain scale, we also evaluated WOMAC physical function, knee stiffness, and global self-assessment in a stepwise manner to control overall type I error at 0.05. Non-inferiority tests used 8% margins of the respective scale: pain, +1.60; physical function, +5.44; knee stiffness, +0.64; and global self-assessment, &#x02212;0.80.</p><p>Non-inferiority hypotheses were tested using mixed-effects repeated-measures models. Primary and secondary variables were fitted to mixed-effects repeated-measures regressions, with subscale CFB the dependent variable. Subject baseline assessment, study site, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interactions were fixed effects, patients were the random effect, and degrees of freedom were calculated by an established method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the (Durolane &#x02013; Artz) 95% confidence interval was less than the non-inferiority margin; or, in the case of the patient global self-evaluation, if the lower bound was greater than this margin.</p><p>Because non-inferiority hypothesis testing was carried out over two time periods (18 and 26 weeks) and for four assessments (a primary aim for pain and secondary aims for physical function, global self-assessment, and knee stiffness), it was necessary to predefine test order to control for overall type I error. The pain primary variable was first tested for non-inferiority over 18 weeks; if non-inferiority was concluded, then non-inferiority was tested again over 26 weeks. Physical function was then tested in the same manner, followed by subject global self-assessment, and finally knee stiffness. If any individual test failed to conclude non-inferiority, then subsequent hypothesis tests for non-inferiority would not qualify as controlled for type I error.</p><p>Exploratory responder variables were analyzed using generalized estimable equation regressions with corresponding explanatory variables. No formal type I error-controlled hypothesis testing was planned.</p><p>Study results were audited by TigerMed Consulting Co., Ltd, evaluating each research site and assessing compliance to the clinical trial protocol. Site visits included a random audit of patient records, and a study report was filed at the People&#x02019;s Hospital of Beijing University and at Bioventus LLC. TigerMed Consulting Co., Ltd was also responsible for data management and statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 404 patients were screened and 349 (86.4%) patients were randomized to treatment (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Patients were well matched at baseline (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and study retention was excellent (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both treatment groups showed a clinically significant, identical, and robust response to treatment, for the primary aim of pain (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), for secondary aims of physical function, global self-assessment, and knee stiffness (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and for exploratory responder variables (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Use of rescue medications was low (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), and both Durolane and Artz are associated with few TRAEs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Our results provide rigorous evidence that Durolane is non-inferior to Artz; both Artz and Durolane are safe, efficacious, and well tolerated.</p><p>Patients responded comparably well to Durolane and Artz (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, there were statistically more nonresponders at weeks 18 and 26 with Durolane in the WOMAC pain &#x02018;walking on a flat surface&#x02019; item, although there were few nonresponders overall (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Conversely, there were numerically more nonresponders with Artz according to the OMERACT-OARSI criteria, although this difference did not attain statistical significance (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This discrepancy between measures may be a function of the small number of nonresponders and a large sample size.</p><p>Use of rescue medication by patients was quite low overall (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Only 14% of patients used rescue medication within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, and roughly 5% of patients used rescue medication during weeks 10 to 18 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Low use of rescue medication is consistent with the high perceived efficacy of treatment in reducing pain (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), even at weeks 18 and 26. After week 18, use of rescue medication began to increase, perhaps as a result of loss of efficacy of both products with time (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). A similar study in Germany, which used Euflexxa versus Synvisc in the treatment of knee OA, reported that 49.3% of patients using Euflexxa and 81.9% of patients using Synvisc required rescue medication at some point during the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Incidence of TEAEs was similar between the Durolane (47.5%) and Artz (42.5%) treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), consistent with similar knee HA trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A trial of different forms of HA reported that 37.1% of patients (119 of 321) experienced TEAEs, all of mild-to-moderate intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while a similar trial of two HAs reported that 55.0% of patients (326 of 588) experienced TEAEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. TRAEs were less prevalent than TEAEs. Arthralgia was the common TRAE here (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) and arthralgia is expected among patients who receive HA injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our results suggest that a single Durolane injection for treatment of OA knee pain was safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The conclusion that Durolane is non-inferior to Artz is robust, as all four indications more than satisfied 8% non-inferiority criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We report that the WOMAC pain response rate (Durolane&#x02009;+&#x02009;Artz) averaged 75.2% at week 18 and 80.3% at week 26 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), which is an unusually high response rate. In contrast, a RCT of HAs versus saline found that the WOMAC pain response rate to HA was 38.1% at week 13 and 36.3% at week 26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The OARSI response rates we report are also higher than is generally reported. For both Durolane and Artz, the OMERACT-OARSI response rate was at least 92% at weeks 18 and 26 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). One RCT of HAs versus steroid reported the OARSI response rate to HA was 63.3% at week 18 and 62.8% at week 26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The OARSI response rate to HA in a second RCT was 66% at week 12 and 67% at week 26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a RCT with unusually long follow-up, the OARSI response rate to HAs ranged from 71.1% at 7 months to 80.5% at 40 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is unclear how best to explain the strength of our results, although there are several possibilities.</p><p>It may be typical that Chinese patients respond well to HAs. To our knowledge, only four prior RCTs have been carried out in China to test HAs in treatment of knee OA, so we have no <italic>a priori</italic> expectations as to the robustness of expected responses. For example, HAs were compared with warm acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and with electroacupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and both studies documented a good response to treatment. In the study of electroacupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], response to HA was comparable in magnitude with what we report; patients with stage II Kellgren&#x02013;Lawrence scores showed a decline in total symptom scores from 12.2 to 6.5 over 5 weeks. Another Chinese study compared HA with glucosamine sulfate or to a combination of glucosamine sulfate and arthroscopic debridement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and this study found that all treatments were efficacious. A final study compared HA with meloxicam in adult patients with Kashin&#x02013;Beck disease, a chronic osteochondropathy largely limited to China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this study, patient improvement from baseline in the WOMAC A (pain) score was 4.6 points over 12 weeks, among 80 patients who had HA (25 mg) injected into the target knee at weekly intervals for 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The WOMAC A score was 12.5 at baseline and 7.9 at week 12, for an average improvement of 4.6 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, the WOMAC A score was 9.5 at baseline (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and improved by an average of 5.9 points over 18 weeks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Hence, our results show roughly comparable pain relief in OA patients with those in patients with Kashin&#x02013;Beck disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Most patients were na&#x000ef;ve to any treatment before study enrollment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and analgesic use in China is low overall compared with the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is therefore possible that patients benefitted from initiation of treatment or from encouragement to use analgesics for pain control. Nevertheless, analgesic use overall was quite low (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). There can be ethnic differences in how efficiently acetaminophen is metabolized; such differences in susceptibility to pain alleviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] could potentially explain low use of analgesics in our study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In addition, metabolism of acetaminophen is affected by gender, oral contraceptive use, and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and such factors can differ from study to study. Acetaminophen glucuronidation is higher in males than in females, such that male smokers have the highest rate and female nonsmokers or noncontraceptive users have the lowest rate of glucuronidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Ethnic differences in pain sensitivity have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and such differences could potentially result in clinically significant differences in reported pain. Little is known about whether documented experimental differences in the thermal pain threshold might influence patient willingness to rehabilitate aggressively or to abstain from use of rescue medications.</p><p>A criticism of our work is that we did not use an inactive placebo arm, so it is unclear how much of the documented efficacy (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) can be attributed to a placebo response. Placebo arms have been recommended even in surgical RCTs, and improvement in the placebo arm was documented in 39 of 53 surgical RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The majority of past HA trials have used placebo &#x02013; defined as saline injection or arthrocentesis of the joint space &#x02013; and the conclusion is broadly that HAs are superior to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, neither saline injection nor arthrocentesis is truly inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and subcutaneous placebos are known to be more effective than oral placebos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The alternative to inactive placebo is to compare a new medication with the best current medication, accepting that such comparator trials may produce higher placebo response rates than placebo-controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Comparator trials are ethically easier to defend than placebo-controlled trials because they provide treatment for more patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Further, because superiority of active medication may be easier to achieve over inactive placebo than over competing medication, placebo-controlled trials may allow drugs into the marketplace that are less efficacious than those already available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our goal here was conservative; to test the hypothesis that pain reduction with Durolane was non-inferior to Artz, because Artz has a long record of safety and efficacy in China. A placebo arm would have increased costs substantially, while providing no greater clarity as to whether Durolane is comparable with the established treatment option.</p><p>The relative merits of one injection versus five injections are an important issue for physicians using HA to treat knee OA. Patients might prefer to have one injection, if they could be certain that one injection was as effective as five injections. Such a preference could be driven by considerations such as pain of multiple injections and inconvenience of multiple clinic visits. However, physicians might prefer to give five injections, for several reasons: multiple patient visits give the physician more opportunity to monitor the patient over time and to address AEs that might otherwise go unaddressed; and the adverse consequences of accidentally missing the joint space in a single injection are minimized if the patient is scheduled to receive additional injections. How these considerations influence physician choice of medications is a topic that should be addressed in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that both Durolane and ARTZ were effective: more than 90% of all patients reported a favorable response by OMERACT-OARSI criteria over time periods as long as 18 and 26 weeks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>); at least 92% of patients had a decrease in pain while walking on a flat surface (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>); and more than 77% of patients reported a decrease in symptoms assessed by the WOMAC pain subscale (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results demonstrate that one injection of Durolane and five injections of ARTZ are comparably safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatments for mild to moderate knee OA.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFB</term><def><p>change from baseline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p>hyaluronic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OMERACT-OARSI</term><def><p>Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials &#x02013; Osteoarthritis Research Society International</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized clinical trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAE</term><def><p>treatment-emergent adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRAE</term><def><p>treatment-related adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p>Western Ontario and McMaster University</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>There are no conflicts of interest other than those that are made explicit by the description of author contributions and the role of the funding source.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HZ was responsible for the conception and design, acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the data, drafting and critical revision of the article for important intellectual content, final approval of the article, and accountability for all aspects of the work.
