The presence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ at surgical margins following resection of squamous carcinoma of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck has been shown to be associated with a higher incidence of local recurrence and reduced survival. While invasive carcinoma in mucosal surfaces can usually be distinguished from adjacent normal mucous membrane, pre-malignant disease is much less readily distinguished at operation. We describe a protocol for a randomised, controlled trial in which we will assess the effectiveness of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine staining in allowing visualisation and excision of cancer margin dysplasia at time of primary surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will recruit 300 patients diagnosed with oral cavity or oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma. All participants will be planned for primary surgery with curative intent. After completion of baseline assessment participants will be randomised into either a standard surgical treatment arm or surgical treatment including Lugol&#x02019;s iodine staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the rationale and design of a unique trial in head and neck surgical oncology. If margin dysplasia visualisation with Lugol&#x02019;s iodine allows complete excision of high-risk, pre-cancer mucosa at time of primary surgery, this may lead to a reduction in local recurrence and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN03712770">ISRCTN03712770</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Oral cavity</kwd><kwd>Oropharynx</kwd><kwd>Squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Lugol&#x02019;s iodine</kwd><kwd>Staining</kwd><kwd>Resection margins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The presence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ at surgical margins following resection of carcinoma of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, has been shown to be associated with a higher incidence of local recurrence events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>While invasive carcinoma in mucosal surfaces can usually be distinguished from adjacent normal mucous membrane, pre-malignant disease is much less readily distinguished at operation. The mucosal surfaces of the head and neck are not unique in this respect. Attempts to improve the identification of early carcinoma and intraepithelial neoplastic change using adjunctive techniques are employed in the cervix, large bowel and oesophagus. These include acetic acid topical application, contact endoscopy, auto fluorescence and the use of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. None of these has been subject of evaluation in a clinical trial setting in head and neck cancer.</p><p>Extensive literature exists regarding the use of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine, including use as an aid to the identification of neoplasia of the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus. The structure of the mucosal surfaces of the mouth and oropharynx are very similar to the proximal oesophagus and the risk factors for neoplastic transformation at these sites are similar. Lugol&#x02019;s iodine visualisation of dysplastic mucosa is employed in management of oesophageal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There is, however, a very limited literature describing the use of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine in the management of head and neck mucosal neoplasia and there are no reported clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The majority of the oral cavity and oropharynx is covered by stratified, non-keratinising, glycogen-containing squamous epithelium. It is opaque, has multiple (15 to 20) layers of cells and appears pale pink in colour on visual examination. The intermediate and superficial layer cells contain glycogen in their cytoplasm. In contrast, dysplastic and invasive cancer cells contain little or no glycogen. This is thought to be due to the Warburg effect of increased cytosol glycolysis consequent to the genomic chaos seen in the cancer cell.</p><p>Iodine is glycophilic and forms tri-iodide molecules within the glycogen polymer spiral. This results in chocolate brown staining of normal non-keratinised oral and oropharyngeal mucosa. Areas of dysplasia and invasive cancer do not take up iodine as they lack glycogen and appear as pale coloured areas.</p><p>Heavily keratinised areas of the mouth such as the attached gingivae and hard palate do not avidly take up Lugol&#x02019;s iodine. Respiratory mucosa also does not contain glycogen and does not stain. Thus detailed head and neck surgical anatomy knowledge is necessary in interpreting the information gained with Lugol&#x02019;s staining. The major cancer sub-sites within the oral cavity and oropharynx are lined with glycogen containing and therefore Lugol&#x02019;s iodine staining sites.</p><p>The presence of mucous on the surface interferes with the absorption of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine. This can be minimised by the use of 1.25% carbocisteine solution prior to Lugol&#x02019;s iodine.</p><p>Occasional mild adverse reactions have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but our pilot and feasibility studies have shown that the use of mucosal epithelial staining with Lugol&#x02019;s iodine is a safe technique, which is simply accomplished. With a short period of familiarisation it is readily adopted by experienced surgeons, is inexpensive, and seems likely to be effective. We believe that a trial demonstrating a clear benefit would have a substantial impact on clinical practice worldwide because of the simplicity of the technique and low cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of Lugol&#x02019;s iodine in assisting excision of moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ at mucosal resection margins of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

There will be planned sub-group analysis by T stage to assess the effect of tumour size. T1 and T2 primary cancers will be compared with T3 and T4 cancers. There will be a pre-planned interim analysis when the first 164 patients have been recruited in order to assess whether the assumptions made in the power calculations hold true.</p><p>The total sample size is to be 300 patients, with an estimated recruitment rate of 15 patients per site per year over a 2-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In an initial study of two series of 50 consecutive patients having resection of oral or oropharyngeal SCC 32% in the standard group and 4% in the Lugol&#x02019;s iodine group had dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or invasive SCC at a surgical margin (McMahon et al., 2012).</p><p>The primary outcome measure is rate of dysplasia of any grade at excision margins. We calculated that to detect a reduction from 30% in the control group (as in the initial cohort study) to 10% in the Lugol&#x02019;s iodine group with 90% power at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the number of patients required in each group is 82. The rate for the control arm may be a little lower. If it is 20% then a similar proportionate reduction to 7% would require 144 in each group. We propose to randomise 150 to each group, 300 patients in total. However, should the proportion of dysplasia positive cases change from 17% (control) to 4% in the Lugol&#x02019;s group, then the power calculation would require 100 patients in each group for 80% power and 130 patients in each group for 90% power. We therefore aim to continue planning for recruitment of 300 patients overall and 150 in each group.</p><p>The recurrence rate in the dysplasia group is estimated at 33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. To detect a difference of 25% in 20% of the patients (that is, those who convert from involved margins to non-involved as a result of the intervention), it is necessary to detect a difference of 5% overall and a much larger study would be needed (even with alpha = 0.1 and one-sided test over 1,200 patients would be needed).</p><p>Instead we will estimate a 95% CI for the hazard ratio.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Head and Neck Cancer research literature contains very few well-designed trials and there are no published trials in surgical oncology regarding primary surgery for cancer at this site.</p><p>Our cohort study data show a reduction in margin dysplasia using Lugol&#x02019;s iodine at cancer resection from 32% for control to 4% for intervention groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].
