This suggests that self-expanding activities can potentially substitute for the reward from nicotine. We tested this model among nicotine-deprived smokers who, during fMRI scanning, played a series of two-player cooperative games with a relationship partner. Games were randomized in a 2 (self-expanding vs. not) x 2 (cigarette cue present vs. absent) design. Self-expansion conditions yielded significantly greater activation in a reward region (caudate) than did non-self-expansion conditions. Moreover, when exposed to smoking cues during the self-expanding versus the non-self-expanding cooperative games, smokers showed less activation in a cigarette cue-reactivity region, <italic>a priori</italic> defined [temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)] from a recent meta-analysis of cue-reactivity. In smoking cue conditions, increases in excitement associated with the self-expanding condition (versus the non-self-expanding condition) were also negatively correlated with TPJ activation. These results support the idea that a self-expanding activity promoting reward activation attenuates cigarette cue-reactivity among nicotine-deprived smokers. Future research could focus on the parameters of self-expanding activities that produce this effect, as well as test the utility of self-expansion in clinical interventions for smoking cessation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided to Dr. Xu by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (F31DA024941-01A2), the American Psychological Association (Dissertation Research Award), the American Psychological Foundation/Council of Graduate Departments of Psychology (Graduate Research Scholarship), Stony Brook University's Psychology Department (Retirees' Dissertation Fellowship), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (2T32HL076134-06).

One example is clinical accounts of drugs or behaviors with similar hedonics substituting for one another <xref rid="pone.0094598-Donovan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094598-Haylett1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This phenomenon also occurs in response to public policy, such as when adolescent rates of marijuana smoking increase following more stringent regulations on underage drinking <xref rid="pone.0094598-Alter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094598-DiNardo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and experimentally with food and drug rewards in animal models. For example, Wellman and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0094598-Wellman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> found that rats maintained on a high-fat diet (compared to rats maintained on a standard pellet diet) exhibited diminished acquisition of self-administered cocaine.</p><p>The mechanism for this reward substitution/replacement effect involves the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is strongly linked to the reinforcing effects of drugs <xref rid="pone.0094598-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094598-Volkow1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Dopamine and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system of the brain are also involved in the rewarding and motivating aspects of social relationships. Social relationship reward has been shown to substitute for food among young adults <xref rid="pone.0094598-Salvy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and social bonding has been shown to decrease amphetamine reward (mediated through dopamine) among prairie voles, a monogamous mammalian species <xref rid="pone.0094598-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Social relationships may be rewarding because they are often a form of &#x0201c;self-expansion.&#x0201d; The self-expansion model states that people are motivated to expand their identity and increase their physical, informational, and social resources <xref rid="pone.0094598-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Self-expansion is rooted in approach motivation <xref rid="pone.0094598-Mattingly1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and is characterized by novelty, excitement, and interest or challenge, such that those who engage in these self-expanding activities experience a sense of growth in their self-concept <xref rid="pone.0094598-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Xu et al. <xref rid="pone.0094598-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of nicotine-deprived smokers who were in the early stage of a romantic relationship (and reported intense love for their partner as assessed by the Passionate Love Scale; PLS) <xref rid="pone.0094598-Hatfield1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

For example, research on self-expansion as an aid in smoking abstinence and cessation <xref rid="pone.0094598-Xu3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> found that smokers who successfully quit had experienced significantly more self-expanding events in their lives prior to their quit attempt (e.g., learning a new skill, taking an exciting course) compared with smokers who tried to quit but ultimately failed. Even among smokers who attempted to quit but failed, self-expansion appeared to be beneficial, as there was a significant positive correlation between the number of self-expanding events prior to the quit attempt and how long smokers were able to abstain.</p><p>The current research sought to build on findings by Xu et al. <xref rid="pone.0094598-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094598-Xu3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> on self-expansion and smoking. It is the first fMRI study to look at self-expansion and cigarette-cue reactivity outside of the context of early-stage intense passionate love. It is also the first to utilize an experimental paradigm involving an active response task instead of having participants passively view images of their romantic partner.</p><p>In the current study, couples in long-term relationships played cooperative games together that were either self-expanding (particularly exciting, novel, and challenging) or not, and in which a cigarette cue did or did not appear. We predicted that the self-expansion reward of participating in a socially-shared novel, challenging, and exciting activity would undermine nicotine craving and result in less activation in cigarette-cue related brain areas such as the ventral striatum, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala <xref rid="pone.0094598-Khn1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This research was approved by the IRB committee of Stony Brook University and all participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 20 couples from the Long Island (NY) community who were in long term relationships (at least 2 years). Each couple had at least one member who currently smoked at least eight cigarettes per day and was not attempting to quit (10 couples had both members as smokers). The smoker in the couple was the one who was scanned (if both members of the couple were smokers who met inclusion criteria and scanner screening requirements, the couple decided who entered the scanner). Participants ranged in age from 19&#x02013;42 years (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24.10, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.17).

Smokers who entered the scanner (12 men, 8 women) smoked an average of 13.25 cigarettes per day (<italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.59). Smokers began smoking on average at the age of 15.85 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.31) and had been smoking on average 7.97 years (<italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7.59). Four of the 20 participants scanned preferred their left hand.</p><p>Only one member of each couple was scanned, significant others who were not scanned filled out questionnaires and played the co-operative games with their partners on a computer outside the scanner. In accordance with ethical standards, this study was approved by an Institutional Review Board and all participants (and their significant others) completed written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>General procedure</title><p>After a telephone screening, the 20 couples visited the laboratory twice. Scanner participants smoked ad libitum prior to the initial session, during which they completed demographic questionnaires. Inclusion criteria for scanner participants included that it was safe them to enter scanner (e.g. no embedded metals, no history of claustrophobia etc.), and a willingness to abstain from smoking overnight. Baseline (ad libitum) breath carbon monoxide (CO) for the scanner participant was assessed on a 1 (non-smoker) to 7 (very heavy smoker) scale using the Bedfont Smokerlyzer (Bedfont Scientific Limited; Rochester, Kent, UK). Scanner participants were then asked to abstain from nicotine products for at least 8 hours prior to coming in with their partner for the second session.</p><p>During the second session, scanner participants confirmed that they had abstained from nicotine for 8 hours and had their CO levels measured with the Bedfont Smokerlyzer. While CO parts per million data was not obtained, expired CO levels (via the 1&#x02013;7 scale) were used in both sessions to verify smoker and non-smoker status, to determine whether or not participants abstained from smoking as instructed, and to improve compliance. Both members of the couple then completed pre-scan questionnaires. The Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale (IOS) <xref rid="pone.0094598-Aron3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> was used to assess closeness. The IOS comprises 7 pairs of circles representing the self and the partner, and participants indicated which pair of circles best fit their relationship. The scale was scored from 0 (circles did not overlap at all) to 6 (circles overlapped almost completely). Couples also rated on a 1 (&#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;) to 7 (&#x0201c;completely&#x0201d;) scale how happy they were generally, how happy they were in their relationship, and how committed they felt towards their partner. Prior to scanning, couples played a practice round of the two-player game to get acquainted with the set-up. After scanning, couples repeated the pre-scan questionnaires, were debriefed, thanked, and compensated for their time ($60 to each member of the couple).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Scanning stimuli and procedure</title><p>We utilized a 3 tesla Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio scanner, and Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) responses were recorded. We acquired functional images via T2* Gradient-Echo EPI scans: 30 ms TE, 2500 ms TR, 80&#x000b0; flip angle, 220 mm FOV, 4 mm slice thickness, 64&#x000d7;64 matrix, 34 slices. Voxel size was 3.4&#x000d7;3.4&#x000d7;4.0 mm. High resolution whole-brain T1 images were also acquired for anatomical reference.</p><p>Scanner participants viewed stimuli via an angled mirror mounted on the RF coil and responded with their dominant hand using a four-button response box. Partners used a desktop computer with a cloned screen outside the scanner.</p><p>All participants viewed 24 blocks of stimuli split into four conditions (six blocks each) presented in random order. The four conditions were (1) self-expanding with cigarette cue (SECig), (2) self-expanding without cigarette cue (SEnoCig), (3) non-self-expanding with cigarette cue (NSECig), and (4) non-self-expanding without cigarette cue (NSEnoCig). Self-expanding (SE) conditions were programmed to be more exciting, novel, and challenging, with the game requiring more frequent and quicker responses compared with non-self-expanding (NSE) conditions. Additionally, images used to gain points in the game were novel in SE conditions, whereas in NSE conditions they consisted of images all participants had seen during the practice session. The cigarette cue image used in all conditions was that of a lit cigarette. The practice round did not contain cigarette cues and trials were 2 seconds in length.</p><p>SECig and SEnoCig conditions each contained 15 trials (1.5 seconds per trial) per block and a total of 6 blocks. NSECig and NSEnoCig conditions each contained 9 trials (2.5 seconds per trial) per block and a total of 6 blocks. Thus all conditions each totaled 135 seconds (2.25 minutes) per block.</p><p>Each block consisted of a series of trials where 4 black-and-white images simultaneously appeared horizontally on the screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094598-g001">Figure 1A-1D</xref> for example stimuli for each condition). Images were everyday objects (e.g., toothbrush, pencil). The goal of the two-player game was for each member of the couple to &#x0201c;mark&#x0201d; when a feather (the target) was presented by pressing buttons on the button-box (or keyboard) that corresponded to the positions of the feather. The game was cooperative such that players each got 1 point for every feather image's position they correctly marked (correct and incorrect selections were visible to both members of the couple via check marks and Xs, in each player's color, over each selected image). If both members of the couple were correct, 2 points were added to their team score (which appeared at the top of the screen throughout the game). The team score received a 1-point deduction for every incorrect selection of a non-feather image by either player.</p><fig id="pone-0094598-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094598.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A-D: Examples of game stimuli for each condition.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0094598.g001"/></fig><p>For SECig and NSECig conditions, an image of a cigarette appeared in at least half of the trials for those blocks.

Four of the 20 scanner participants exhibited excessive motion (&#x02265;4 mm) and were dropped from further fMRI analyses. Thus, results are presented for the remaining 16 participants. The 4 participants who exhibited excessive motion were significantly older and had longer smoking histories. It may be that withdrawal was more intense for these participants and thus they had more difficulty remaining still in the scanner. The 16 participants (6 women, 10 men) who did not exhibit excessive motion in the scanner ranged in age from 19&#x02013;30 years (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22.44, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.33) and had been with their romantic partner for at least 2 years with an average of 2.91 years (<italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.11).

The data were then spatially smoothed using a 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter, excluding non-brain voxels. First-level analyses of individual brain responses were characterized using general linear modeling (GLM) with regressors representing the temporal course of each condition (SECig, SEnoCig, NSECig, NSEnoCig) convolved with a gamma function. We applied eight nuisance regressors to account for motion (X, Y, Z, roll, pitch, yaw) and stimuli of no interest between blocks (rest and ratings); the GLM also incorporated linear and quadratic trends in the data.

There were no significant main effects of game condition on pleasantness, positive mood, or negative mood.

Based on the remaining in-scanner data (from 13 scans), self-reported ratings of craving did not differ across conditions. As we asked participants to rate their craving every 30 seconds, and on a scale that offered only 4 options, this rating system may not have been sensitive enough to pick up on variances in subjective craving. This paper therefore focuses on objective brain responses to cues.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Results of fMRI Data</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>

Indeed, participants rated the self-expansion games significantly more exciting than they did the non- self-expansion games, and the self-expansion games elicited significantly greater activation in the caudate, a reward-related region associated with self-expansion in the context of intense romantic love and in the context of rewarding interactive video games <xref rid="pone.0094598-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The non-self-expanding games were still rated as being equally pleasant and did not elicit significantly less positive mood or significantly more negative mood compared with the self-expanding games. This indicates that self-expansion effects were due to novelty, challenge, and excitement rather than simply positive affect.</p><p>Results also indicated that the protocol was associated with significant increases in reported general happiness and relationship happiness. Closeness and commitment to the romantic partner also increased from pre-to-post scan (although neither of these increases was statistically significant). This pattern of improvements corroborates that overall, the two-player game was self-expanding; engaging in self-expanding activities with a partner has been shown to lead to such increases <xref rid="pone.0094598-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094598-Carson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094598-Reissman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These improvements were evident after a simple 15&#x02013;20 minute protocol that interspersed self-expansion conditions with non-self-expansion conditions, even though participants were being exposed to cigarette cues during some of these conditions.</p><p>We had hypothesized a replacement effect such that we expected more activation in cigarette cue-reactivity regions when cigarette cues were present during the non-self-expanding game compared to when cigarette cues were present during the self-expanding game. We found support for our hypothesis in the TPJ, an <italic>a priori</italic> anatomically defined ROI. In addition, we found that ratings of excitement during self-expansion games (above and beyond the excitement during non-self-expansion games) was significantly correlated with the attenuation effect in the TPJ, suggesting a potential dose-response effect.</p><p>These results support the proposition that engaging in self-expanding activities with a long-term partner is rewarding and can attenuate cigarette cue-reactivity among nicotine-deprived smokers. While the cooperative two-player game yielded self-reported relationship improvements and may have contributed to overall excitement, another paradigm involving other social contacts (e.g. a friend, a stranger) or at the individual level (e.g. a one-player game) would theoretically be just as effective as long as the components of self-expansion (e.g. novelty, excitement, challenge) were present. Future research should explicitly test whether the cue-reactivity attenuation effect would be present in these other contexts.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the lack of eye-tracking or other methodology to measure distraction from the cigarette cue. While it is likely that any task that is exciting will offer some distraction, it would be useful for future research to explicitly examine the amount of variance that is accounted for by distraction. However, as past research has shown that it is the reward of self-expansion (rather than distraction) that accounts for pain mitigation effects <xref rid="pone.0094598-Younger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, it is unlikely that distraction accounts for the main effect in our study. In addition, our findings that the protocol produced improvements on relationship factors are in line with predictions from the self-expansion model but not from a model of simple distraction. This study also had a modest sample size and thus we cannot make conclusions about how results might differ based on individual or couple variables. Future research with larger samples is needed to specifically investigate the influence of demographics, relationship length, and smoking variables on self-expansion and cigarette cue attenuation.</p><p>Finally, future research could examine, among smokers attempting to quit, the extent to which attenuation of brain cue-reactivity is associated with behavioral responses such as subsequent abstinence or time to next cigarette. Positive effects found would justify developing an analogue of the game we used for deployment on smartphones, which are increasingly being used as tools for behavior change including smoking cessation <xref rid="pone.0094598-Krishna1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Together with pharmacotherapies and other cessation strategies, such games may be a useful addition to the armamentarium of strategies to help smokers quit, a substantial number of whom do so without clinical assistance <xref rid="pone.0094598-Fiore1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0094598-Donovan1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Donovan JM (1988) Assessment of addictive behaviors: implications of an emerging biopsychosocial model.
