Compression rate, depth, and chest recoil were measured. In Phase II, the highest-performing Phase I subjects were placed into 2-, 3-, and/or 4-compressor teams; 2-compressor teams were assigned either to control group (no recovery exercises) or intervention group (recovery exercises during rest). All Phase II teams participated in 20-minute simulations with compressor rotation every two minutes.

In their first rotations, all Phase II subjects delivered compressions of similar quality and correctness (p=0.09). Bivariate analyses of 2-, 3-, and 4-compressor teams&#x02019; subject compression characteristics by subsequent rotation did not identify significant differences within or across teams. On multivariate analyses, only subjects in 2-compressor teams exhibited significantly lower compression rates (control subjects; p&#x0003c;0.01), diminished chest release (intervention subjects; p=0.03), and greater exertion over successive rotations (both control [p&#x02264;0.03] and intervention [p&#x02264;0.02] subjects).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>During simulated resuscitations, 2-compressor teams exhibited increased levels of exertion relative to 3- and 4-compressor teams for comparable compression delivery.

After a scripted introduction to research aims, study methods and simulation setting, subjects were oriented to the study manikin system. A Resusci-Anne SkillReporter manikin (Laerdal, Wappingers Falls, NY) was situated on a waist-height table, a footstool was provided, and compressions were performed in the standing position.

Measurements of compression rate, compression depth, and chest recoil were continuously obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-wjem-18-1025">Figure 1</xref>). Of note, Phase II compressions were performed by kneeling subjects on a manikin placed on the floor in order to accommodate the significant height differences between alternating subjects, as the frequent bed-height adjustments necessary to minimize subject height-related research confounds otherwise would have proved impractical. (Previous studies have evaluated the quality of continuous chest compressions while kneeling, standing on the floor, or standing on a footstool with bed height adjustment for each provider &#x02013; these found no significant difference in compression quality between subjects in kneeling and those in footstool positions.<xref rid="b23-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</p><p>Investigators used compressions delivered during a single rotation by an individual subject in 2-compressor (control or intervention group), 3-compressor, and/or 4-compressor teams to calculate the following variables: compression rate, compression depth, and chest recoil; percent of compressions with correct depth and recoil; and number of correct compressions delivered.

Only the 2-compressor teams were assigned to one of seven control or six intervention groups prior to the start of the session (due to inadequate numbers of 3- and 4-compressor teams for controlled experimentation). Those in the intervention group were instructed on how to perform the stretch and diaphragmatic breathing exercises immediately before simulations; control subjects were instructed to rest in a chair between compressor rotations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Investigators analyzed participant demographic data on age, gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) with Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests.

Given that a significant proportion of chest compressions and cardiac resuscitations take place in settings with smaller cohorts of qualified personnel on duty at any one time, investigators applied basic cardiac arrest resuscitation simulation scenarios to examine the potential impact of smaller team sizes on compression performance and compressor exertion.</p><p>The experimental study of 2-, 3-, and 4-compressor teams revealed a definite reduction of approximately 3% in compression rate per rotation for only control 2-compressor teams on multivariate analyses (and without changes in other compression characteristics). Concurrently, levels of subject exertion displayed small, orderly, and coherent differences that were significantly associated with study group assignment. Specifically, all subjects featured similar baseline %mHR measurements despite considerable differences in the quality of their chest compressions. It is therefore of interest to note that subsequent physiologic monitoring revealed that only subjects in the 2-compressor teams exhibited increases in caloric expenditure and exertion over successive rotations. These findings suggest that the size of a smaller CPR compressor team may have a demonstrable effect on the quality of chest compressions delivered and provider exertion over the course of a typical cardiac arrest resuscitation. At the same time, the data suggest that teams with more than three compressors do not appear to differentially perform higher-quality chest compressions or exhibit reduced levels of provider exertion. Larger teams may therefore elect to direct additional personnel resources to perform other critical tasks during resuscitations without potentially compromising the quality of chest compressions performed.</p><p>Investigators also evaluated whether an experimental rest-recovery intervention would reduce provider exertion and improve compression quality in 2-compressor teams. Whereas data regarding the effects of static stretching on exercise performance are conflicting,<xref rid="b15-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> several previous studies have demonstrated improvement in pulmonary and cardiovascular function with deep breathing exercises.<xref rid="b19-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In the current study, the 2-compressor team subjects who performed the recovery intervention exercises during rest periods were able to sustain adequate chest compression rates throughout the simulation and with less exertion when compared to control group 2-compressor team subjects. This suggests that targeted recovery exercises performed during rest periods may help mitigate provider fatigue and help facilitate the sustainment of adequate chest compression quality during cardiac arrest resuscitations. Providers in clinical practice settings where few compressors are available may benefit from performing the studied recovery exercises during cardiac arrest resuscitations.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s findings are in agreement with numerous previous studies that have established the provider-dependent and generally poor quality of CPR.<xref rid="b1-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b6-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b22-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b27-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Study simulation sessions elicited a broad spectrum of chest compression performances from a cohort of young medical student subjects with normal BMI. Objective measurements revealed that 25% of Phase 1 participants were unable to deliver a single correct compression during their four-minute simulation session (data not shown). Despite the use of Phase I sessions as a screening process to enroll higher-performing subjects, approximately 50% of all Phase II chest compressions were still performed incorrectly (primarily due to inadequate compression depth). These findings raise significant concerns with respect to the current approaches of training and entrusting the delivery of critical life-saving interventions to the general CPR resuscitator cohort. Furthermore, specific subject predictors of chest compression performance could not be derived from the dataset, with only correlations of intermediate strength identified between compression quality and subject weight (r=0.4) or BMI (r=0.35) for the studied demographic characteristics (data not shown).</p><p>It is somewhat remarkable that a significant proportion of the study&#x02019;s healthy, young, motivated, and recently-trained medical students delivered suboptimal (simulated) chest compressions. Accordingly, we expect that a typical CPR team (comprised of individuals of greater diversity with respect to age, gender, and baseline health and physical capability) would deliver chest compressions of even poorer quality in simulated and/or live settings. As a result, next-step interventions are not entirely clear. Advocacy for more frequent training with the judicious use of simulation technologies and the widespread application of accelerometer-based, real-time feedback devices for monitoring and assurance of compression quality are distinct possibilities.<xref rid="b1-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b28-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>On the other hand, the objective identification and in-resuscitation recognition of poor CPR quality may fail to resolve a critical issue, i.e., the existence of a significant population of up-to-date BLS-certified healthcare professionals who are physically incapable of delivering chest compressions as specified by formal guidelines. The challenge is further complicated by the failure of mechanical auto-compression devices (engineered to methodically deliver correct compressions) to improve patient outcomes.<xref rid="b29-wjem-18-1025" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In the interim, further investigation into compressor team compositions and rest-recovery interventions may be warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>The research budget and subject pool limited the Phase I sample size; investigators were unable to enroll a sufficient number of Phase II subjects to reach the target number of study teams. Study groups of 2-, 3-, and 4-compressor teams may not have been fully matched in baseline performance; this limited comparative assessments across teams of different sizes.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Members of 2-compressor teams exhibited greater levels of exertion relative to members of larger compressor teams for comparable simulated chest compression performance. Stretching and breathing exercises intended to assist with compressor recovery exhibited mixed effects on compression performance and subject exertion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The study team would like to acknowledge Sara Whitney, DPT, for her expertise and the students of Alpert Medical School of Brown University who participated in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-wjem-18-1025"><p><italic>Section Editor:</italic> Christopher R.
