Its clinical course is characterized by unpredictable periods of disease flare, and remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The typical UC flare presents as a constellation of symptoms, including rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, tenesmus, fatigue, and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The estimated incidence of UC in North America ranges from 2.3 to 15.6 cases per 100,000 patient-years, and the prevalence rate is 37.5&#x02013;246 cases per 100,000 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Notably, UC is associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and economic burden, with estimated annual costs approaching $2.7 billion in the USA (measured in 2003&#x02013;2004 US dollars) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) formulations are considered first-line options for the induction and maintenance of remission of mild-to-moderate UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several formulations have been developed to help improve patient adherence (e.g., a formulation with reduced dosing frequency) and to more directly target a higher concentration of active agent to the colon. Mesalamine granules (MG), an extended-release capsule formulation (Apriso<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raleigh, NC), is indicated for the maintenance of UC remission in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This formulation combines a delayed- and extended-release delivery mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Specifically, each granule is designed to initiate the release of mesalamine at a pH&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;6, and the polymer matrix facilitates a slow, sustained release of mesalamine in the terminal ileum and throughout the colon. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Two identically designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of once-daily MG (1.5&#x000a0;g/day) for the maintenance of UC remission, with significantly more patients treated with MG remaining relapse-free at 6&#x000a0;months compared with placebo in the pooled analysis (79.4 vs. 62.4&#x000a0;%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Systemic corticosteroids may be administered for the induction of remission in cases of acute relapse of UC, especially when an oral 5-ASA is ineffective, or for patients presenting with severe symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the adverse effect profile of corticosteroids has led healthcare providers to limit their use when possible and to seek safer long-term alternatives. Furthermore, patients with UC who achieve remission with corticosteroid treatment often experience a relapse of symptoms during tapering or soon after discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, a steroid-sparing therapy for the treatment of UC might aid in reducing the burden of UC.</p><p>The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily MG in patients who had previously received corticosteroid therapy to achieve their UC remission. Patients in this analysis participated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], including a cohort of these patients who enrolled in a 24-month open-label extension (OLE) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Data were analyzed from three multicenter trials, including two identically designed, randomized, double-blind, 6-month, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (MPUC3003 and MPUC3004) and a 24-month OLE trial (MPUC3005), all of which were registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00744016, NCT00767728, and NCT00326209, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patient populations and study design for the three trials have been previously published and are briefly described in this manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. All patients included in the current analysis had a history of previous steroid use to achieve their current UC remission and, upon enrollment, satisfied the entry criteria for all studies as summarized below. Patients enrolled in the OLE trial who were included in this pooled analysis had been previously enrolled in one of the double-blind trials.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and Treatment</title><p>Male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age were eligible for participation in the double-blind trials if they had a confirmed diagnosis of mild-to-moderate UC, determined using the revised Sutherland Disease Activity Index (SDAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with defined subscale scores at screening (rectal bleeding score of 0 and mucosal appearance score of 0 or 1). In addition, all patients had a history of at least 1 flare requiring therapeutic intervention within the past 1&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months and were documented to be in remission for &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;month but &#x0003c;12&#x000a0;months. Primary exclusion criteria included receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids (oral, rectal, intravenous) within 30&#x000a0;days prior to screening.</p><p>Forty-eight centers participated in trial MPUC3003, 40 in MPUC3004, and 66 in MPUC3005. The double-blind trials started in December 2004 and were completed by April or August 2007; the OLE trial started in December 2005 and was completed in May 2008. Each protocol was approved by institutional review boards or ethics committees and conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>In the double-blind trials, patients were randomly assigned to consecutive treatment numbers allocated in the order of enrollment and in a 2:1 ratio received MG 1.5&#x000a0;g (dosed as four capsules, each containing 0.375&#x000a0;g of mesalamine) or matching placebo once daily. The use of concomitant medications including immunosuppressants, chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, oral antibiotics (except as 7- to 10-day courses for conditions unrelated to UC), psyllium-containing compounds, and other 5-ASA formulations was prohibited in the double-blind trials. The investigators, patients, and research staff members (including project biostatisticians) were blinded to study medication assignment until after database lock at the end of each study. The OLE was unblinded, and all patients received MG 1.5&#x000a0;g once daily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The double-blind trials consisted of a 1-week screening phase, a 6-month treatment phase, and a follow-up visit (2&#x000a0;weeks after the end-of-treatment phase). The OLE trial consisted of a 24-month treatment phase and a follow-up visit 2&#x000a0;weeks after the last dose of MG. The 6-month treatment phase of the double-blind, randomized trials consisted of four clinic visits to assess disease activity and monitor adverse events (AEs) at baseline and months 1, 3, and 6. The 24-month OLE trial consisted of clinic visits to monitor AEs at baseline, months 1, 3, and 6, and then every 3&#x000a0;months for up to 24&#x000a0;months. In addition, during the OLE trial, telephone interviews were conducted at week 2, months 2, 4, and 5, and then at every subsequent month between clinic visits.</p><p>For the double-blind trials, a complete UC disease activity assessment, including flexible sigmoidoscopy, was performed at screening or baseline and at the 6-month visit using the revised SDAI (all 4 components) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The revision to the SDAI was the deletion of &#x0201c;friability&#x0201d; from a mucosal appearance score equal to 1 to clarify the definition of remission. The revised SDAI total score evaluated each of the following four parameters on a scale of 0&#x02013;3, with a maximum total score of 12: (1) stool frequency (i.e., 0 to&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;4 stools/day more than normal); (2) rectal bleeding (i.e., none to mostly blood); (3) mucosal appearance (i.e., intact mucosa with preserved or distorted vessels to blood in lumen, gross ulceration, exudates), and (4) physician&#x02019;s rating of disease activity (i.e., normal to severe).</p><p>In the OLE trial, only patients entering the trial more than 30&#x000a0;days after having completed the double-blind trial were screened using the revised SDAI to confirm remission; for the remainder of patients, the baseline SDAI from the end-of-treatment visit for the double-blind trial was used. AEs were monitored throughout the three trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Endpoints and Data Analyses</title><p>Three populations of patients with a history of previous corticosteroid use were analyzed: (1) the pooled intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as randomized patients in either of the double-blind trials who received at least one dose of study medication and had a revised SDAI response at the 6-month endpoint visit; (2) the short-term safety population, defined as the ITT population with at least one post-baseline safety assessment, and (3) the long-term safety population, defined as patients who completed one of the double-blind trials, received at least one dose of MG during the OLE trial and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.</p><p>Demographics and baseline disease characteristics, exposure, and safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics. The primary efficacy endpoint during the double-blind trials was the percentage of patients who remained relapse-free from baseline through the 6-month evaluation. Relapse was defined as a revised SDAI individual component score for rectal bleeding of &#x02265;1 and mucosal appearance score &#x02265;2, or early study termination when the reason for termination was lack of efficacy or discontinuation due to a UC-related AE. The treatment groups were compared for the primary endpoint using a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean change from baseline in the revised total SDAI score at the 6-month endpoint; change from baseline at month 6 in the subcomponents of the SDAI score (rectal bleeding score, mucosal appearance score, physician&#x02019;s rating of disease activity, and stool frequency); percentage of patients classified as achieving treatment success (defined as maintaining an SDAI total score &#x02264;2 with no individual component &#x0003e;1 and a rectal bleeding score of 0 at month 6); and the 6-month cumulative relapse-free probability.</p><p>Statistical analyses of the secondary endpoints were performed in a predefined hierarchical fashion until a non-significant <italic>P</italic> value was identified (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05), after which point significance tests were considered exploratory. For relapse-free duration, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess differences between treatment groups, a hazard ratio (HR) with associated 95&#x000a0;% CI was generated to determine reduction in risk (1-HR) over the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment, and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methods were used to calculate cumulative relapse-free probability estimates.</p><p>Although no formal efficacy assessments were performed in the OLE trial, the effects of MG on maintenance of UC remission were assessed by evaluating UC-related AEs, which were defined as UC, hematochezia, and frequent bowel movements. The percentage of patients in the short- and long-term safety populations who remained free from UC-related AEs for the double-blind and OLE trials was assessed from start of MG therapy through 6 and 30&#x000a0;months of therapy. UC-related, AE-free duration was computed as the number of days between the start of MG or placebo use (double-blind studies only), and the date on which at least 1 of the predefined UC-related AEs was first detected, or the date of early termination from the trial, plus 1&#x000a0;day. Patients who completed 6 and 30&#x000a0;months of treatment, or who withdrew from the trial without evidence of a UC-related AE, were censored at the time of their final evaluation; censoring time was calculated as the date of final evaluation minus the start of study drug, plus 1&#x000a0;day.</p><p>For the short-term safety population, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess differences in UC-related, AE-free duration between MG and placebo. The HR and associated 95&#x000a0;% CI were obtained from this model to determine reduction in risk (1-HR) over the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment. Cumulative UC-related, AE-free probability estimates were calculated using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methods.</p><p>Person-years of exposure (PYE) was calculated as ([mean exposure in days&#x000a0;&#x000f7;&#x000a0;365.25]&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;no. of patients). PYE rate was calculated as (events&#x000a0;&#x000f7;&#x000a0;PYE).

These findings are comparable to the results from the overall population of the two double-blind trials (which included the corticosteroid population assessed in the current analysis), wherein the UC relapse-free rate at 6&#x000a0;months was significantly higher in patients treated with MG compared with placebo (79.4 vs. 62.4&#x000a0;%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the current analysis at 6&#x000a0;months, patients previously treated with corticosteroids also experienced a significantly higher relapse-free rate in the MG group (77.1&#x000a0;%) compared with placebo (54.7&#x000a0;%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006), supporting MG as being efficacious in maintaining UC remission in this patient population.</p><p>Although relapse-free rates were not prospectively assessed throughout the course of the long-term OLE trial (e.g., using the SDAI), monitoring of UC-related AEs in patients previously treated with corticosteroids provided further evidence of the short- and long-term benefits of MG. In this pooled analysis, the lower rate of UC-related AEs with MG versus placebo during the 6-month, double-blind treatment period was sustained in patients continuing to receive MG once daily for up to 30&#x000a0;months. Thus, consideration of UC-related AE rates over time may offer a long-term surrogate for assessing the potential benefit of MG.</p><p>It is noteworthy that, for the 74 MG-treated patients in the long-term safety population and the 102 MG-treated patients in the short-term population, the reported incidence of a UC flare AE was similar (14.9 and 17.6&#x000a0;%, respectively), with both incidences nearly half the reported incidence observed in the placebo-treated ITT population (30.8&#x000a0;%). Further examination of UC flare AE rates based on PYE revealed a low rate (0.3 events/PYE) after MG treatment for up to 30&#x000a0;months, which was approximately one-third the rate observed in patients receiving placebo (1.1 events/PYE) in the double-blind trials.</p><p>This analysis also demonstrated that MG was well tolerated for up to 30&#x000a0;months in patients with UC who had received prior corticosteroid therapy. The percentage of patients treated with MG 1.5&#x000a0;g once daily with a drug-related AE in the long-term safety population was similar to that observed in the short-term safety population (both 10.8&#x000a0;%), and comparable to findings from the overall study population in the original double-blind trials (10.6&#x000a0;%). Headache was the only non-GI-related AE reported in &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;% of MG-treated patients, (11.8 and 13.5&#x000a0;% of patients in short- and long-term safety populations, respectively). Hepatic and renal system-related AEs were infrequently observed with long-term MG use.

Despite their benefits, it is widely recognized that prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids may expose patients to potential toxicities and occasionally result in severe complications.

Accordingly, to minimize the risk of steroid-induced AEs in patients with UC, it is recommended that corticosteroid administration be restricted to short-term use only and at the lowest possible effective dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Another dilemma with corticosteroid use in UC patients is the highly recognized &#x0201c;rebound effect&#x0201d; that often occurs following tapering or discontinuation when switching to alternative therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, there is a need for agents to be identified that may minimize or prevent steroid-induced UC rebound, prolong the duration of remission, and reduce the need for future systemic corticosteroid therapy, especially for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. The current data from this study support MG administration for the long-term maintenance of UC remission in a population of patients previously treated with corticosteroids to induce remission.</p><p>The lack of objective response measurements (SDAI), the lack of availability of placebo-controlled data after 6&#x000a0;months, and the small patient population assessed during the OLE trial (long-term population) were limitations of this study. In addition, conclusions suggesting the role of MG in steroid switching or tapering cannot be decisively drawn from this post hoc analysis because patients did not immediately switch or taper corticosteroid therapy and begin MG or placebo therapy in the current study. One eligibility requirement for both double-blind trials was that patients were not permitted to use corticosteroids within 30&#x000a0;days of screening. In addition, as patients were in UC remission at enrollment, initial disease severity scores prior to use of steroid therapy were not available. Thus, disease severity at the time of steroid-treated UC flare (i.e., mild versus moderate) could have theoretically impacted maintenance of remission during treatment. Therefore, the results from this study are considered exploratory and need validation with prospective trials, and the generalizability of these findings should be further explored.</p><p>In conclusion, this pooled post hoc analysis demonstrated that MG provides long-term (up to 30&#x000a0;months) maintenance of UC remission in patients with a history of prior corticosteroid therapy for UC flares or maintenance of UC remission. Accordingly, treatment with once-daily MG may allow for avoidance of or reduction in corticosteroid use in the maintenance of remission for patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Future large, well-designed, prospective clinical trials are necessary to fully validate these initial observations suggesting that there is long-term benefit with using MG for maintenance of remission in patients with UC who received corticosteroids to induce remission.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing and editorial support were provided under the direction of the authors by Mary Beth Moncrief, Ph.D., and Teresa Tartaglione, Pharm.D., of Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA and funded by Salix, a Division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, Bridgewater, NJ, USA.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded in full by Salix, a Division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, Bridgewater, NJ, USA.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Gary R.
