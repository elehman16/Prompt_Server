This virus has a high mutation rate, leading to the presence of numerous FCV strains in the field. The objectives of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of two vaccines (Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP and Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV), which differ by their nature (live vs. inactivated) and the vaccinal strains, against circulating FCV strains. Thirty 9-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) kittens were thus randomised into 3 groups and were either not vaccinated (control) or vaccinated (2 injections, 3&#x000a0;weeks apart) with one of the vaccines. Four weeks after the second injection of primary vaccination, the cats were inoculated with a pathogenic strain representative of the ones circulating in Europe (FCV-FR4_01) and followed for 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">After challenge, significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) between control cats and cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP or Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV were observed for body weight variation, rectal temperature rise and maximum clinical scores, reflecting the intensity of the signs (83% and 67% lower in the respective vaccinated groups than in the control group). Significant differences were observed between the vaccinated groups, as cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP had a lower temperature rise (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 at days post-challenge 3 to 5) and lower virus shedding titres (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 at days post-challenge 8, 9 and 11) than cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV. Finally, only cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP had a significantly lower cumulative score, reflecting the intensity and duration of calicivirosis clinical signs, than the control cats (77% lower vs. 62% lower for cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Both vaccines, Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP and Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV, were found to be efficacious in reducing clinical signs induced by FCV-FR4_01, a FCV strain representative of the circulating ones. However, cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP were able to control the infection more efficiently than those vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV, as evidenced by the shorter duration of clinical signs and lower viral titre in excretions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Calicivirus</kwd><kwd>Coryza</kwd><kwd>Cat</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Efficacy</kwd><kwd>Live</kwd><kwd>Leucofeligen</kwd><kwd>Feligen</kwd><kwd>Purevax</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008096</institution-id><institution>Virbac</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a RNA virus which can cause various symptoms that affect mainly the oral cavity and, occasionally, the upper respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is one of the main pathogens responsible for coryza (cat flu), a very common disease in cats. Symptoms possibly induced by FCV include oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, sneezing and nasal discharge. Some atypical FCV can cause lameness or skin ulcerations while some hypervirulent strains can lead to systemic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Feline calicivirus shows a high antigen variability and can evolve quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a recent study conducted in Europe, 46 strains (pairwise genetic distance &#x0003e;20%) were identified from 72 FCV isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the phylogenetic analysis of partial variable regions of polymerase or capsid sequences showed that the different strains found in the field had a median uncorrected nucleotide distance of around 40% when compared pairwise or when compared with the F9 strain, currently used in some live vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Vaccines against FCV are available and widely used. They contain one or two FCV strains that are either live attenuated or inactivated. Although regulatory agency approved vaccines should trigger protective immunity, their efficacy can differ according to the type of immunity stimulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Inactivated vaccines are known to elicit the production of neutralising antibodies (NAb) directed against specific extracellular antigens (humoral immunity). Live vaccines, however, mimic the natural infection and stimulate the cellular component of the immune system (cell-mediated immunity) in addition to the humoral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since live attenuated viruses can replicate, live vaccines generally induce a quicker, longer lasting and more efficient immune response than inactivated vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The first aim of this study was to confirm that currently commercialised vaccines against FCV are still efficacious against circulating strains. The second aim was to compare the efficacy of two vaccines containing either the live attenuated strain FCV-F9 (Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP, Virbac, France) or two inactivated strains of FCV (431 and G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV, Merial, France).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">This controlled, randomised, not blinded, experimental study was carried out under the supervision of the Ethical Committee of Virbac, in accordance with the recommendations issued in the European Pharmacopoeia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and study protocols</title><p id="Par21">Thirty specific-pathogen free European kittens (9&#x000a0;weeks old; average&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD body weight of 1.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.12&#x000a0;kg, ranging from 0.87 to 1.34&#x000a0;kg) obtained from a commercial supplier (Liberty Research, USA), were randomly assigned to 3 groups: group 1 (vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP), group 2 (vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV) and group 3 (not vaccinated).

Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV is presented as a freeze-dried fraction containing inactivated strains of FCV (431 and G1) and attenuated strains of FHV (F2) and FPV (PLI IV), and a liquid fraction containing a recombinant virus canarypox FeLV (vCP97).</p><p id="Par25">The vaccine vials were stored between +2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and +8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and were reconstituted immediately prior to use by rehydrating the freeze-dried fraction with the liquid fraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Challenge</title><p id="Par26">The FCV-FR4_01 strain (Genbank accession number MF882991) was isolated during the field epidemiology study performed by Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This strain was chosen for the challenge since it was identified as a single isolate (unique sequence) with a high titration from a single cat presenting various clinical signs typical of a calicivirus infection. The strain was amplified through two passages on CRFK cells and controlled in order to ensure the absence of any interfering pathogens. Regulatory compliant reproducible experimental infections were developed (internal data). The same clinical signs, identical to the ones observed in the original cat, were constantly reproduced: a marked weight loss in the first week, hyperthermia, a depression of the general status and apparition of oral and nasal ulcers, typical of FCV infections. Minor nasal and ocular discharge could also be observed. The FCV-FR4_01 challenge strain was therefore considered as representative of the initial FCV-FR4_01 isolate and thus representative also of the FCV circulating strains.</p><p id="Par27">Further analyses of the sequence identities, performed on partial capside sequences, showed that the FCV-FR4_01 strain had 73% homology with FCV-F9, 75% with FCV-G1 and 76% with FCV-431 while the three vaccination strains shared between 70% and 74% identities. These levels of homology were in accordance with the homology found between circulating strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

A score was given for each parameter, each cat, on every assessment day. For comparison of scores between groups, two methods were used. The first method, the cumulative score, consisted of adding up all daily scores recorded for each cat and for each parameter (cumulative score per cat for parameter x&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;sum of scores recorded from DPC 0 to DPC 14).

Because of the heterogeneity between strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it was of importance to verify that vaccines formulated with strains isolated a few years ago were still efficacious against circulating strains.</p><p id="Par50">In this study, cats were inoculated with one of the strains (FCV-FR4_01) isolated during a field epidemiology study conducted in Europe and published in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This strain was chosen as it was genetically representative of the circulating classical FCV pathogenic strains. This statement is based on the lack of evidence for FCV sub-species clustering or serotypes except for viruses sharing immediate temporal or spatial links [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, the clinical signs induced by the FCV-FR4_01 challenge strain were also representatives of a classical feline calicivirosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In all cats (10/10) in the control group, the dose and route of administration used for the experimental infection induced one or several typical signs of feline calicivirosis, ie a marked weight loss in the first week, hyperthermia, a depression of the general status and apparition of oral and nasal ulcers. These signs were similar to those presented by the initial cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and cats previously challenged with this strain (internal data). This percentage of unvaccinated cats showing notable clinical signs of feline calicivirosis (hyperthermia, bucal ulcers and respiratory signs) is higher than the minimum of 80% required by the European pharmacopeia to validate a FCV experimental infection. This result suggests that the experimental FCV-FR4_01 infection performed was particularly severe and that this strain can be an excellent candidate to test FCV vaccines efficacy in the future.</p><p id="Par51">The efficacy evaluations of the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP and of the Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV vaccines against this heterologous strain were based on the scores obtained for different parameters. Their efficacy against FCV heterologous strains has been reported in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but not against circulating ones. Consistently with the results obtained in these previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the median of the total of maximum clinical scores obtained in the vaccinated groups were significantly lower than the one obtained in the control group (83% and 67% lower for the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP and Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV vaccines, respectively). The maintenance of the protection conferred by the commercial vaccines against circulating FCV strains supports the idea that the observed inter-strain genetic difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] may not induce a significant change in the FCV capsid amino acid sequence and/or configuration. These data also show that the clinical cross-protection triggered by a FCV vaccine is independent of the number of strains it contains. Indeed, the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP vaccine, containing one FCV strain (FCV-F9), brings a similar (or even better under the experimental conditions of this study) clinical cross-protection than the Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV vaccine which contains two FCV stains (FCV-G1 and FCV-431) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Interestingly, vaccinated cats were protected despite the lack of detectable SN during the vaccination phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This observation is in agreement with previous studies showing that the absence of seroneutralising FCV antibodies is not correlated with an absence of protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and in terms of antibody protection, the levels of IgA mucosal antibodies, if available, would be a more appropriate marker of the efficacy of the mucosal defense and ultimate shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Indeed, despite a certain level of cross-neutralisation, NAbs are quite specific of the strain used to induce them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The protection against heterologous strains is also and sometimes mainly induced by the cell-mediated immune response triggered by the vaccine and the IgGs, not necessarily neutralising, directed against various viral or infected-cell antigens (total IgGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

However, since no technique can be routinely used to assess<italic>,</italic> in vitro, the cell-mediated immune response, experimental infection in vivo remains the only reliable way to assess FCV vaccines efficacy.</p><p id="Par53">Both vaccines were deemed efficacious. However, some differences were observed between the cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV and those vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP. First, the cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP could seroconvert faster (within the 3&#x000a0;weeks after the first primary injection) than some cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV (two injections of primary vaccination required for seroconversion of all cats) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The difference in the types of vaccine used, live versus killed, may provide a partial explanation for this result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, live organisms induce a greater up-regulation of activation molecules and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors than do killed organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This difference may explain both, the delay in producing IgGs and the requirement for two injection of primary vaccination for the cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. On the contrary, the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP vaccine may require only one injection as a primary vaccination since IgGs were detected after the first injection. Further tests are required to confirm this. Similar findings regarding the speed of onset of immunity, number of injections for primary vaccination and clinical efficacy properties of vaccines depending on their nature, live or killed, might also be observed in other mammals including humans.</p><p id="Par54">The severity and duration of symptoms such as temperature rise or ulcerations also differed between groups. The median of the total cumulative scores was lower in cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP than in cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV. Although this difference was not statistically significant, only the group of cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP had a significantly lower score than the control group (77% lower vs. 62% lower for the group vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV). These data suggest that the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP vaccine would bring a better protection against the heterologous FCV-FR4_01 strain than the Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV vaccine. Indeed, when assessing the viral shedding, it was found that the titres of viruses eliminated by cats vaccinated with Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP was lower than in cats vaccinated with Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV on DPC 8, 9 and 11. No difference was found between this latter group and the control group, though. These results are consistent with previous studies and the general knowledge that live attenuated vaccines provide a quicker and more efficient protection than inactivated vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. They further confirm that a vaccine with a combination of several FCV strains (e.g. Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV) is not more efficient against heterologous strains than a vaccine with one FCV valence (e.g. Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP) and does not seem to broaden the protection against antigenically distant strains, as previously mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">In this study, an FCV strain representative of the circulating ones was used for the challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] to ensure that currently commercialised FCV vaccines were efficacious against heterologous circulating strains.

Both vaccines were found to be efficacious in reducing the clinical signs induced by this strain, compared to an unvaccinated group. However, some differences concerning the rapidity of seroconversion, the duration of clinical signs, and the reduction in viral titre in excretions were found, in favor of the Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP vaccine. This study therefore showed that both vaccines still have a good efficacy against circulating strains but that Leucofeligen&#x02122; FeLV/RCP may bring a better protection than Purevax&#x02122; RCP FeLV against a heterologous strain.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>Ab</term><def><p id="Par4">Antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCID<sub>50</sub></term><def><p id="Par5">Cell culture infecting dose, 50% endpoint</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRFK</term><def><p id="Par6">Crandell Rees feline kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPC</term><def><p id="Par06">Day post-challenge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCV</term><def><p id="Par7">Feline calicivirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FeLV</term><def><p id="Par8">Feline leukemia virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FHV</term><def><p id="Par9">Feline herpesvirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPV</term><def><p id="Par10">Feline panleukopenia virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IgG</term><def><p id="Par11">Immunoglobulin G</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par12">Inter-quartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAb</term><def><p id="Par13">Neutralising antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCP</term><def><p id="Par14">Feline rhinotracheitis virus, calicivirus and panleukopenia virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par15">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar4"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par57">This study was funded by Virbac.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par58">The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CL and TA conceived of and designed the study.
