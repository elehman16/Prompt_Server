This research aimed to comparison of the efficacy and satisfaction of Cyclofem with oral contraceptives (OCs) among females. A descriptive-comparative method was conducted on 80 women who were selected through cluster sampling during November 2011-December 2012. The selected subjects start using OCs or Cyclofem for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in their life. They evaluated in 2 times frames, at the beginning of the study and then 3 and 6 months after the contraceptive precautions. The data were collected by questionnaire. The data were analysed using parametric and nonparametric test in SPSS 16 software. The reasons for discontinuation of the methods were varied, in which 50% of the sample group were Cyclofem users who discontinued because of menstrual changes and the desire to use other methods, and 50% were the OC users whose reason was medical problems, and absent-mindedness was the last reason for 35.7% of the cases. The efficacy of the both (OCs and Cyclofem) was high and only one unwanted pregnancy occurred at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> month among OC users. There was no significant difference in term of satisfaction of two groups at the end of 3-6 months (PV = 0.433). The results indicated that Cyclofem can be well used by those women who desire for an easy and effective method which is not disturbing the sexual activity and does not also need to be used daily, but the users should be consulted before using the method.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Combined oral contraceptive pills</kwd><kwd>Cyclofem</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>satisfaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Over the last two decades, Iran has achieved significant success in terms of birth control,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] though in the meantime, it has faced many failures as such many reports reveal about one-third of unwanted pregnancies in Tehran, the capital of Iran.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The unwanted pregnancy is one of the most important social health problems related to birth control plans which may result in serious mental and physical problem for mother and kid, and for all the family members as well.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The hormonal contraceptive methods are the most effective ways in birth control, though despite of their efficacy and usefulness they may have some defaults such as headache, depression, anxiety etc., and the users may complain normally.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Using oral contraceptive (OC) pills is the most effective method which is taken by 100 million women in worldwide. Although the number of women who are using this method is great, yet the discontinuation of this method is also significant because of two main reasons, the side effects, that is, weight gain, headache, depression etc., and the need for daily use.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The validity of this method is 99.9% if it will be used correctly,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but many people reported problem regarding daily use of OC, Consequently 5% of the women, for the low acceptability of this method, are about to become pregnant unwontedly and the lack of high acceptability of this method is due to its daily use.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Immunity, easy to use and efficacy are the main factors to decide for using hormonal contraceptives, Hence, spreading contraceptive methods which have been accepted by the clients well and which have had useful effects without having any relation to coitus or disturbing the daily users, are the strongest stimuli for decreasing unwanted pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Meanwhile Cyclofem is one of the methods designed for this purpose.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Cyclofem is a combination of 25 mg of medroxyprostrogen acetate and 5 mg of estradiol cypionate which has been widely studied outside of the US by the World Health Organization (WHO)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and was confirmed by Food and Drug Administration in October 2000.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This method is safe and tolerated well[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with low rate of unwanted pregnancy. The continuation rate is high and has rapid return of fertility after discontinuation which is comparable with other contraceptive methods.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, since Cyclofem is using monthly, it doesn't result in the inconvenience and discomfort of females and its efficacy and side effects is relatively similar with OC, medroxy progesterone acetate and norplant.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The cumulative pregnancy rate in the 1<sup>st</sup> year of using is, 0.2%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] As well, in worldwide studies Cyclofem has been accepted by females and their satisfaction was as high as OC users.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In a study about Cyclofem acceptance which was done by Yazdanpanah, only 12.6% of the females had choice Cyclofem. The reasons for rejection were the side effects, injection fears, referral problems and their last contraceptive method satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Since improving the acceptability of a method requires the users' satisfaction and the efficacy of the method, and satisfaction of users from the contraceptives influence their applicability and the amount of usage.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Conversely, such a comparative study has not been done in our country, a thorough study needed to be conducted to comparison of the efficacy and satisfaction of Cyclofem and contraceptive pills. Surely being aware of these important facts is a valuable finding which can be useful in solving some of the problems related to contraceptive methods and helps to plan some educational programs and appropriate interventions. Clarifying the effective methods with fewer side effects will result the continuation of the usage, efficacy feeling, and also being at ease. Therefore we aimed to evaluate and compare the satisfaction and efficacy of Cyclofem and contraceptive pills among user females of Northern Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a descriptive and comparative one. The subjects were those women who came to the health center for the 1<sup>st</sup> time to take OC pills or Cyclofem.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sampling</title><p>To determine the sample size, the Pocock formula[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was used. 80 females selected and randomized in two groups (<italic>N</italic> = 40 each group). The subjects selected through two-stage cluster sampling method so among the Health Care Centers in Babol six Centers were chosen by random. Then among the referrals, after the required explanation about the research, the subjects were chosen through an introductory interview and also based on their own will (by filling out a consent form) to participate in the study. Gathering subjects and follow up steps lasted from November 2011 to January 2012. The exclusion criteria were the subjects with any forms of contraindications to OC, for instance; those women with chronic blood pressure &#x0003e; 160.90, diabetes, chronic headaches, and obesity. The research units accepted to use their contraceptive method in 26 weeks (6 months).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Tool</title><p>The data was completed by expert interviewers. The data-gathering tools were included two-part questionnaires in which the first part included demographic data, menstrual changes, side effects, desire to continue, reasons for discontinuation, recording of the weight and blood pressure; and the second part of the questionnaire (the satisfaction part) contained eight questions which were planned to ask the users' ideas and to analyze based on likert scale. Consulting the lecturer staff members of the universities and also the clear-sighted authorities, the validity of the tools was estimated and the reliability came to be seven based on Cronbache's alpha coefficient.</p><p>In each month of the study period, the research units had daily note taking cards about menstrual patterns in which they recorded the patterns based on the following definition: Nothing = no spotting or bleeding; spotting = requiring light pads, not sanitary protection; bleeding = requiring sanitary protection.</p><p>The efficacy of the method was evaluated based on the number of pregnancies occurred within 6 months of the study (Gathering samples, intervention and follow ups take around one half year). The additional evaluated results were: menstrual bleeding patterns, the willingness to continue to use the method and the immunity (based on side effects such as: Spotting, breast tenderness, headaches, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, acne, etc). The subjects were evaluated at the beginning of the study, then at the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> month and 6 months after using the OC or injection, or they were evaluated as long as they quitted from the study for any reasons. The subjects' weight and blood pressure were measured at their first visit and then at the end of the third and the 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Analysis</title><p>The data was analyzed by using parametric test like <italic>t</italic>-test and variance analysis by repetitive measurement and nonparametric tests like Chi-square, Man-Whitney, Friedman and Cochran in SPSS 16 (Released 2007.

Based on the independent <italic>t</italic>-test, there was no significant difference between the weight and the blood pressure in both groups of OC and Cyclofem users during the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study confirmed that both contraceptive methods were very effective ones which indicated a high efficacy so that after 6 months of using the methods, only one unwanted pregnancy occurred in the subjects who used OC pills. While, other studies have shown that unwanted pregnancy didn't occur during the research.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, the failure rate of Cyclofem users in this research is ideally comparable with other reports related to researches done in various countries for the women who participated in clinical trial held by WHO[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the efficacy of Cyclofem based on WHO's international studies and other wide-spread research was 99.9%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It is note worthy to mention that Cyclofem users and their husbands were more educated than the OC users because the continuation or discontinuation of a method is affected by different factors such as knowledge, necessities, expectations, and mutual understandings of the participants.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Women's satisfaction in both groups was similar at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> month. Often, the efficacy is influenced by the effects of the methods on subjects' health. Relevant studies have also shown that Cyclofem and OC users' satisfaction was also the same which shows that the subjects who want to use daily OC pills, are interested in injecting monthly contraceptive Ampulla, too; and the similar level of satisfaction in both groups may be due to the safety and the low side effects of the two methods.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The hormonal methods satisfaction is influenced by different factors such as knowledge, life styles, religion, side effects, mutual understanding, anxiety, and apprehension; therefore, it affects the person's idea on the method and its continuation or discontinuation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In this study, at the beginning of using contraceptives, spotting was more in Cyclofem users than in other group and finally at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> month it declined and was the same in both groups. In a study conducted in Kenya, spotting in Cyclofem users was more, but taking all things into account, it was little (the maximum rate was 6.8% after 6 months injecting), and none of the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or Cyclofem users reported spotting after 12 months.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In another study conducted on Cyclofem in Iran, also reveals that the abnormal menstrual cycle of most women (90%) turns to become normal after 6 months.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The main reasons for discontinuation of both options were method related (such as; menstrual cycle changes, absent-mindedness, medical problems, etc). Also, studies in other countries have shown that, menstrual cycle changes were one of the main reasons for discontinuation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The immune histochemical studies on Iranian women have been shown that those who used Cyclofem or DMPA for 3-6 months, the density of endometrial vessel decreases and become atrophic which by itself causes the menstrual disorders (Simbar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007). These findings about menstrual changes indicate the importance of appropriate consulting before monthly injection or before taking contraceptive pills and also pursuing the process after beginning the methods,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which in fact, the organized consulting decrease the discontinuation of the methods significantly (Ruminjo <italic>et al</italic>., 2005). In another study in US, also, most subjects discontinued their contraceptive methods because of nonmedical reasons of which the most common one was unwilling to go to the health center for next visits.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It has been proved some women may find the monthly injection in health center annoying for some reasons such as transportation costs, confusion in going to school or work-place, and baby keeping. It is possible to enhance the subjects' satisfaction to their contraceptive methods by suitable choosing of the women and teaching them the correct self-injection and promoting the success of the methods.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Consequently, it may be useful to do a comparative study between self-injection and injection by personals of health care centers in Iran.</p><p>The results of this study show the high efficacy, satisfaction and immunity of Cyclofem. Finally, this primarily done study suggests strong evidences that Cyclofem can be used by those women who desire for an easy, effective and a comfortable, but non coital and nondaily contraceptive method. Furthermore, if consulting appropriately about birth control, it can be probably a suitable choice among other choices for women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We would like to Islamic Azad University of the city of Babol for their supports and the women who participated in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mehryar</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmad-Nia</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazemipour</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reproductive health in Iran: Pragmatic achievements, unmet needs, and ethical challenges in a theocratic system</article-title><source>Stud Fam Plann</source><year>2007</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>352</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18284048</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Faghihzadeh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Babaee Rochee</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lmyian</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mansourian</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Rezasoltani</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Factors associated with unwanted pregnancy</article-title><source>J Sex Marital Ther</source><year>2003</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>157</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12623767</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Delaram</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sereshti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rafieean</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation etiology of unwanted pregnancy in user of oral contraception pills in who refer to treatment center of Hajer 81-82</article-title><source>J Med Univ Shahrkord</source><year>2004</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>55</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moradan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghorbani</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Baghani</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding in individuals who used hormonal contraceptive methods and referred to Semnan health centers</article-title><source>Koomesh</source><year>2009</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>219</fpage><lpage>24</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crosignani</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Nappi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ronsini</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruni</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Marelli</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonnino</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Satisfaction and compliance in hormonal contraception: the result of a multicentre clinical study on women's experience with the ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin contraceptive patch in Italy</article-title><source>BMC Womens Health</source><year>2009</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>18</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19566925</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kaunitz</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lunelle monthly injectable contraceptive.
