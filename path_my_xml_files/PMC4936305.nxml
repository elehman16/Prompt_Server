Our study were aimed to 1) examine the reliability and validity of the MIBQ for clinical use among pregnant and postpartum women; and 2) examine the factor structure of the items, create subscales, and confirm the stability of the MIBQ in the pregnancy and postpartum periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;751, mean age 32.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.4&#x000a0;years) completed the MIBQ and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in early pregnancy (before week 25), in late pregnancy (around week 36), 5&#x000a0;days after delivery, and 1&#x000a0;month after delivery. We randomly divided participants into two sample sets. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the nine MIBQ items using data from one group of mothers (Group 1; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;376) in all four periods.

This important psychological process was named &#x0201c;bonding&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Kumar reported that some mothers showed a delay in the development of maternal bonding, resulting in infant neglect or impulses to harm the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This finding was supported by subsequent observational studies. For example, cross-sectional studies suggested that poor mother-infant bonding was associated with less interactive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Kitamura et al. performed path analysis to elucidate causal relationships between maternal bonding and abusive parenting, and indicated that bonding failure in the postpartum period predicted abusive parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, a longitudinal study also showed that bonding impairment in the postpartum period was related to insecure parenting behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Maternal bonding starts to develop before a child is born [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Observational studies examined whether negative maternal involvement with the fetus was correlated with adverse effects on the infant&#x02019;s outcome. Alhusen et al. reported that the children whose mothers reported lower maternal emotional involvement during pregnancy had less optimal early childhood development and less secure interactions with their mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition, it has been suggested that maternal bonding in pregnancy predicts maternal bonding in the postpartum period. In a longitudinal study, women with more feelings of closeness and tenderness toward their fetuses in pregnancy reported more feelings of pleasure and affiliation in the relationship with their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These results suggest that maternal bonding disturbances start in pregnancy and are related to impairments in the mother-child relationship, which may result in maltreatment or child abuse. To ensure a positive relationship between the mother and infant in the postpartum period, it is essential to detect maternal bonding disturbances earlier in the perinatal period, and to follow up on the status of these disturbances. Therefore, it is important to assess maternal bonding during pregnancy and the postpartum period over time, using the same instruments. However, there have been no appropriate instruments to assess maternal bonding in both pregnancy and the postpartum period over time. The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) has been standardized for the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some items on the PBQ are applicable only to postpartum women (e.g., &#x0201c;I feel happy when my baby smiles or laughs). The Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS) is a widely used measure of maternal-fetal attachment during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some items on the MAAS are applicable only to pregnant women (e.g., &#x0201c;Frequent/infrequent picturing of the fetus in my imagination&#x0201d;).</p><p>Kumar developed a self-report screening scale, based on the mother&#x02019;s narrative accounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This scale was named the Mother-Infant Bonding Questionnaire (MIBQ), which has nine items: &#x0201c;loving&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disappointed&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;neutral or felt nothing&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;possessive&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;resentful&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;dislike&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;joyful&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;aggressive&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All items on the MIBQ are applicable during for the pregnancy and postpartum periods. The MIBQ does not require a high reading level, and takes only a few minutes to complete. Although the reliability and validity of the MIBQ in the postpartum period has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it remains unclear whether the MIBQ is also appropriate during pregnancy.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of our study were as follows: 1) to examine the reliability and validity of the MIBQ for clinical use among pregnant and postpartum women; and 2) to examine the factor structure of the items, create subscales, and confirm the stability of the MIBQ in the pregnancy and postpartum periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in this study were recruited from perinatal classes for pregnant women (starting before week 25 of pregnancy) at two obstetrical hospitals and one university hospital in central Nagoya, Japan (with a population of approximately 2 million) between August 2004 and March 2015. Mothers with current or past histories of mental illness were excluded from the study, as well as mothers with children born before week 32 of gestation. In addition, participants were required to be at least 20&#x000a0;years old and capable of understanding the Japanese language.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedures</title><p>Pregnant women attending perinatal classes were given detailed information about the study design and methods. This information was given orally and on paper in the three hospitals. Women who agreed to cooperate in the study were asked to complete self-reporting questionnaires, which included social demographic questions, the MIBQ, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in early pregnancy before week 25 (T1), and return them by mail. After receiving the completed consent forms and questionnaires, the MIBQ and the EPDS questionnaires were sent again around week 36 of pregnancy (T2) and returned by mail. At day 5 and 1&#x000a0;month after delivery (T3, T4), the MIBQ and the EPDS were sent and returned by mail. A total of 990 women agreed to participate at the perinatal classes starting before week 25 of pregnancy; 751 (75.9&#x000a0;%) mothers completed all questionnaires for all periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Mother-Infant Bonding Questionnaire (MIBQ)</title><p>The MIBQ is a self-reporting scale designed to assess maternal bonding with their baby during the postpartum period; it is composed of nine items: &#x0201c;loving&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disappointed&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;neutral or felt nothing&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;possessive&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;resentful&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;dislike&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;joyful&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;aggressive&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Yamashita translated the MIBQ into Japanese, and then the Japanese version was retranslated back into English by a native English translator who was unaware of the original wording to confirm that the translation was consistent with the original meaning.

Numerous studies have used this instrument during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The EPDS Japanese version showed good internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.78) and test-retest reliability (Spearman&#x02019;s correlation&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

In this cohort, the two-factor structure, LA and AR, was confirmed in all four periods. The internal consistencies of the two factors were reasonable. The two subscales of the MIBQ were positively correlated with EPDS scores over time and demonstrated acceptable construct validity. In addition, the scores of LA were significantly correlated over the four time points, as were the scores of AR. These results demonstrated the stability of the MIBQ over the periods of the current study. Therefore, the MIBQ should be considered a reasonable scale to assess maternal emotional involvement with the fetus and infant during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.</p><p>The strength of our study is that we conducted an EFA for half of the participants (Group 1; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;376) and confirmed stability of factor structure in the other half (Group 2; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;375) to compare our four time points. The present study suggested that the MIBQ items fit the two-factor model for data in EFA. Taylor et al. also investigated the psychometric properties of the MIBQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. He examined inter-item correlations of the MIBQ by using principal components analysis, and proposed that the original nine-item Kumar&#x02019;s MIBQ score fit a one-factor model after discarding one item (item 4; possessive). We also tested Taylor&#x02019;s one-factor model. The results did not show goodness-of-fit with our data (CMIN/<italic>df</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.42, CFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.691, RMSEA&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.182, AIC&#x02009;=&#x02009;300.328). Therefore, our two-factor model had an adequate fit to our data and was superior in statistical significance to the one-factor model.</p><p>According to our two-factor model, the MIBQ is likely to detect LA and AR. These subscales correspond with the factors that were proposed in previous studies using other instruments that assessed maternal bonding (PBQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Our two subscales correspond with &#x0201c;Impaired bonding&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Rejection and Anger&#x0201d; in the 25-item PBQ by Brockington et al. that revealed a four-factor structure. Brockington et al. examined PBQ and proposed the following four-factor model: Scale 1 is &#x0201c;Impaired bonding&#x0201d;; Scale 2 is &#x0201c;Rejection and Anger&#x0201d;; Scale 3 may be useful in anxious mothers; and Scale 4 signaled the presence of incipient abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, our two subscale correspond with &#x0201c;Lack of Affection&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Anger and Rejection&#x0201d; in the 10-item Japanese version of the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale by Yoshida et al. and Kitamura et al. that revealed a two-factor structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>It is should be emphasized that the EPDS showed correlations with both LA and AR. This means that both LA and AR were associated with the psychopathology of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the correlation was especially large in the AR factor over the four periods. This finding suggests that depressive symptoms might be especially linked with anger and rejection toward a child. This study elucidated the associations between depressive symptoms and bonding disturbances. This is in line with previous reports. For example, Moehler et al. examined the relationship between postnatal depression and maternal bonding to the infant with the PBQ and EPDS using multivariate analysis. They reported that maternal depressive symptoms in the postnatal period were associated with long-term impairment of mother-child bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, Sockol also investigated correlates of mother-infant bonding among postpartum women with the PBQ and EPDS using multiple regression analysis. They reported that one of the strongest predictors of impairments in mother-infant bonding was maternal depressive symptom level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, there are numerous variables known to be associated with bonding disturbances and depressive symptoms. Further study is needed to elucidate these two issues.</p><p>Several limitations of this study need to be addressed. First, participants of this study were recruited from perinatal classes for pregnant women, and they participated in this study voluntarily. Therefore, this sample may not be representative of the total population. Second, this study was based only on self-administered questionnaires without diagnostic procedures based on external criteria. Therefore, criterion validity was not investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that the MIBQ should be considered a reasonable scale to assess maternal emotional involvement with the fetus and infant during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. In addition, the MIBQ has two subscales, LA and AR. The EPDS showed a correlation with both LA and AR. This study suggests associations between depressive symptoms and bonding disorder. These results indicate that the MIBQ is appropriate for pregnant as well as postpartum women to assess maternal bonding toward a fetus and infant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AIC, Akaike Information Criterion; AR, anger and rejection; CFA, confirmatory factor analysis; CFI, comparative fit index; CMIN, chi-squared; DF, degree of freedom; EFA, exploratory factor analysis; EPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; LA, lack of affection; MAAS, Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale; MIBQ, Mother-Infant Bonding Questionnaire; PBQ, Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire; RMSEA, root mean square error of approximation; T1, early pregnancy before week 25; T2, late pregnancy around week 36; T3, 5&#x000a0;days after delivery; T4, 1&#x000a0;month after delivery</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the staff of Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya Teishin Hospital, and Kaseki Hospital for their cooperation.
