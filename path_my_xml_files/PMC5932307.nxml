Increasing the frequency of IHD, while offering the possible advantage of reduced ultrafiltration requirement and less hemodynamic instability per session, amplifies patient contact with an extracorporeal circuit with possible deleterious cardiovascular and immunological consequences. A recent study suggested that intensive renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with a decrease in urine output during AKI. We hypothesized that increased frequency of IHD may be associated with delayed renal recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study. The ATN study was a large randomized multicenter trial of intensive versus less-intensive RRT in critically ill patients with AKI. This study used either continuous RRT or IHD, depending on the hemodynamic status of the patient. Of 1124 patients, 246 were treated solely with IHD during the study period and were included in this analysis. The participants were randomized to receive IHD 3 days per week (L-IntRRT) or 6 days per week (IntRRT). The primary outcome of interest was renal recovery at day&#x000a0;28.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>L-IntRRT was associated with higher number of RRT-free days through day 28 than IntRRT (mean difference 2.5 days; 95% confidence interval [CI]:&#x000a0;&#x02212;4.79 to&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.27 days; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.028).

Complete recovery of renal function was defined as SCr&#x000a0;&#x02264;0.5 mg/dl above the baseline value. Partial recovery was defined as SCr &#x0003e;0.5 mg/dl from baseline, but not dialysis dependent. Patients who were dialysis dependent at study completion or time of death were categorized as having no renal recovery. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality at day 60, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year all-cause mortality. Additional endpoints included duration of renal support and lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stay, as well as dialysis independence at day 60. Duration of renal support was defined as the number of days from initiation of RRT to the final dialysis treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Statistics</title><p id="p0045">We present categorical variables as proportions and continuous variables as mean &#x000b1; SD.

As expected, based on the study protocol, patients randomized to the IntRRT group underwent more IHD treatments. Because the protocol permitted isolated ultrafiltration treatments to provide volume management independent of solute management, more isolated ultrafiltration treatments were provided in the L-IntRRT group (101 [0.73/patient] vs. 6 [0.06/patient]). Blood and dialysate flow rates were similar between the 2 groups and there was no difference in the initial or subsequent delivered Kt/V<sub>urea</sub>.

RRT-free days were calculated as the number of days from last IHD treatment to day 28. L-IntRRT was associated with a significantly higher number of RRT-free days (12.95 &#x000b1; 0.88 days) through day 28 than IntRRT (10.42 &#x000b1; 0.97 days) (mean difference 2.5 days; 95% CI:&#x000a0;&#x02212;4.79 to&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.27 days; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.028) (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>).

This <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analysis of the study comprises the largest randomized cohort evaluating the use of IHD in the management of critically ill patients with AKI. Increasing the frequency of IHD from 3 to 6 days per week, with an average delivered spKt/V<sub>urea</sub> of &#x0003e;1.2 per treatment (after the first treatment), did not improve 60-day or 1-year all-cause mortality. In the primary ATN study, overall 60-day mortality was 53.6%, and in the current IHD-only cohort, it was 29%, reflecting the lower acuity of illness and greater hemodynamic stability in the group that was initiated and maintained on IHD per protocol and did not receive any CRRT. It is important to note that urea kinetics were closely monitored and the prescribed dose of dialysis was delivered to both groups to ensure adequacy of therapy. Patients in the L-IntRRT arm were significantly more likely to recover renal function (using the prespecified definition of creatinine clearance &#x0003e;20 ml/min) by day 28 and had 2.5 more RRT-free days compared with the IntRRT group. However, it is unclear if this is just a perceived delay in renal recovery in the IntRRT group, as the decision to assess for renal recovery was based on increase in urine output and/or spontaneous fall in SCr. It would be difficult to appreciate spontaneous down-trending of SCr when patients are being dialyzed 6 days per week. Also, a counting bias could have led to a difference of 0.5 fewer RRT-free day between the 2 groups, because by design, there is always a skip day between IHD sessions in the L-IntRRT arm.</p><p id="p0075">Even though our analysis did not document a difference in renal independence among the 2 groups, we believe there are possible explanations that can be postulated to account for an actual, albeit modest, delay in recovery of renal function with intensive RRT. Although the IntRRT resulted in lower rates of net ultrafiltration during each IHD session, which we had hypothesized would be associated with less frequent rates of intradialytic hypotension, the rates of intradialytic hypotension per treatment were similar between the 2 groups, resulting in a greater number of treatments complicated by intradialytic hypotension in the IntRRT strategy. Intradialytic hypotension could result in recurrent renal ischemia, which might delay recovery of kidney function. Hemodynamic alterations during hemodialysis have been associated with new ischemic lesions in the kidney late in the course of clinical AKI.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Renal autoregulation is significantly impaired in an injured kidney (even in the early phases of recovery) and even a slight decrease in blood pressure can potentially affect renal perfusion pressure and blood flow, thus resulting in additional ischemic tubular damage. Alternatively, the more aggressive solute and volume control associated with the more intensive RRT strategy may have diminished the stimulus for an increase in urine output as renal function is beginning to recover. A recent study has shown that intensive RRT is associated with decreased urine output early in the course of AKI.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Despite differences in the recovery of renal function between the 2 groups, it did not translate to significant differences in dialysis independence at day 28 or&#x000a0;60.</p><p id="p0080">More frequent IHD did not offer any mortality benefit, and this could be due to several factors. Higher dialysis frequency led to more repeated exposure of the patient to an extracorporeal circuit and this can have deleterious effects. Exposure to bioincompatible, cellulose (cuprophane) dialysis membranes have been demonstrated to cause complement activation and is associated with nonrecovery of renal function and overall mortality.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Even though biocompatible synthetic membranes were recommended for the ATN study, an extremely small number of hemodialysis treatments (&#x0003c;1%) in this subgroup were performed using semisynthetic cellulose triacetate membranes. We do not believe this played a role in the final results of this study; however, new data suggest that even exposure to synthetic dialyzer cartridges and tubing sets can generate toxic hydrocarbons and halocarbons and incite inflammation in the body.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Long-term exposure to these agents is associated with malignancies, but risks of daily short-term contact remains unclear, especially with regard to recovery of renal function or mortality. Frequent exposure to conventional non-ultrapure dialysate also may trigger inflammatory mediators with resultant adverse effects.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In addition, acute myocardial dysfunction, which has been demonstrated during hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, may occur in AKI, thereby negating other putative benefits of more frequent dialysis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Increasing the intensity of IHD also affects the pharmacokinetics of various therapeutic agents, especially antimicrobials, and if not carefully monitored and adjusted, underdosing can lead to poor outcomes.</p><p id="p0085">CRRT is associated with more hemodynamic stability during therapy and it is generally the treatment of choice for the severely ill patients with AKI who are in the intensive care unit. Some practitioners believe that the initial modality of RRT may play a role in renal recovery and dialysis independence. A retrospective cohort study demonstrated that patients who initially received CRRT were less likely to be on chronic dialysis as compared with those who received IHD.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In that study, the acuity of illness, based on SOFA and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, was not defined and therefore may not be comparable to our study population.

They remained hemodynamically stable and were therefore continued on IHD for the duration of the study. By design, patients in the ATN study who received only IHD had lower acuity of illness and greater hemodynamic stability, and had lower overall mortality than observed across the entire cohort. Although the ATN study was not designed to compare outcomes across modalities of RRT, rates of recovery of kidney function among surviving patients treated exclusively with IHD (78.1% with IntRRT and 77.6% with L-IntRRT) were similar to those observed across the entire study cohort (74.6% with IntRRT and 76.2% with L-IntRRT). We believe that in hemodynamically stable patients with AKI, provision of IHD 3 times per week, with a target delivered spKt/V<sub>urea</sub> of 1.2 to 1.4 per treatment, is a suitable option, and this recommendation has been emphasized in recent guidelines.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p id="p0090">Our study has a few strengths and limitations. The major strength is that patients were carefully randomized in the primary ATN study, with respect to demographics and comorbidities. The IHD treatments were monitored closely to ensure that the prescribed dose of dialysis was delivered. Unlike the previous IHD study,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> the dose of dialysis as measured by spKt/V<sub>urea</sub> was adequate in both arms. A major limitation of this study was that even though this constitutes the largest cohort evaluating intensity of IHD in AKI, this was a <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analysis and is likely underpowered. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses carry the risk of imbalance in baseline characteristics despite randomization and therefore increasing the probability of both type I and type II errors. Therefore, the results of this study do not approach the reliability of a prospective prespecified analysis and should be regarded as &#x0201c;hypothesis-generating&#x0201d; for planning future trials.</p><p id="p0095">In conclusion, this subgroup analysis of the ATN study comprises the largest IHD study in AKI. IHD can be safely provided to hemodynamically stable patients with AKI, and if an adequate dose of hemodialysis (spKt/V<sub>urea</sub> of 1.2&#x02013;1.4) is delivered 3 times per week, then increasing the frequency of hemodialysis to 6 days per week does not improve outcomes and may potentially delay renal recovery. Pre&#x02013; and post&#x02013;blood urea nitrogen measurements performed during IHD treatments for AKI will aid in ensuring adequate delivered dose of dialysis. Additional IHD treatments can be provided as needed for volume control and management of electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, or if the target dose of dialysis is not achieved.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0100">PMP has been a consultant for Baxter.
