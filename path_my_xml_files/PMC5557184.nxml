The short duration of this study (24 weeks) made it difficult to evaluate the steroid-sparing effects of tacrolimus. Notably, the patients were only prohibited from receiving blood purification therapy 8 weeks prior to the study, which may not have been a sufficient length of time to eliminate the possibility of patients responding to these therapies during the study.</p><p>A significant limitation of this study was the disparity between the two treatment groups regarding the duration of MG (27.9 months in the tacrolimus group <italic>versus</italic> 63.5 months in the placebo group).
