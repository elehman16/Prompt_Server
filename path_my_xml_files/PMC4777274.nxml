We found the acetazolamide group had significantly improved perimetric mean deviation (MD), papilledema grade, quality of life measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>It is well known that visual field defects in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can be improved with treatment<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and can be due to a variety of mechanisms. The main mechanism is thought to be CSF pressure&#x02013;related disruption of axonal transport<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> leading to intraneuronal optic nerve ischemia at the level of the optic nerve head. Another common mechanism is enlargement of the blind spot; this type of visual loss, mostly from peripapillary hyperopia, is refractive in origin.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Less common causes of visual loss are fluid tracking from the optic disc to the fovea (neurosensory detachment) and the refractive visual loss related to choroidal folds.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>A study of patients with highly asymmetric papilledema has suggested a model of visual loss in IIH characterized by a generalized depression of the visual field.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The model predicts visual loss greater in magnitude with increasing visual field eccentricity.

Both eyes were tested and the eye with the most negative MD (greater visual field loss) was designated as the study eye. The two sets of visual fields were averaged to obtain the mean baseline MD for each of the study and nonstudy eyes. The examinations were required to have adequate gaze tracking, meet IIHTT reliability criteria of &#x0003c;15% false positives and &#x0003c;33% fixation losses, and demonstrate reproducible visual loss on both sets of examinations at baseline and 6 months.

However, the other deviation plot, as well as the gray scale, was evaluated to confirm the appropriateness of the classification. Abnormal test locations that were extraneous to the salient pattern were considered less important for the determination of the hemifield classification. Thus, the most predominant pattern was classified. Baseline and month 6 visual field examinations were evaluated in this report, which included 1511 of 1982 hemifields that met the IIHTT criteria for abnormality. Since the readers were masked to the subject's optic disc characteristics and randomized treatment assignment, the classification of the visual field deficit is strictly based on the pattern of abnormality.</p><p>Three readers (CAJ, KEC, JLK) reviewed 500 visual field examinations (1000 hemifields) at baseline and 491 (982 hemifields) at 6 months from 125 subjects who performed the two exams at baseline and the two exams at 6 months and classified the superior and inferior hemifields separately as to the presence of an abnormality that met the secondary criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-s02">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

If all three readers disagreed, then the visual fields were adjudicated by group consensus to reach a final classification of the hemifield.</p><p>A logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with the presence of a normal hemifield using the first examination at each time point. The model included terms for time (baseline, month 6), hemifield (superior, inferior), and eye (study eye, nonstudy eye); model parameters and standard errors were estimated using generalized estimating equations to account for the dependence among the eight observations for each person (2 time points &#x000d7; 2 hemifields &#x000d7; 2 eyes).

The consensus ratings of the three readers also showed that most subjects improved or stayed the same.</p><p>In a previous study, it was shown that IIH patients with highly asymmetric papilledema generally have more loss in the eye having the higher papilledema grade.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The visual field function of the eye with the lower grade is also abnormal across the visual field when compared to controls.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The visual damage in this prior study in both the higher and lower grade eyes included fixation and the magnitude of the loss increased with eccentricity.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We have proposed a model of visual loss in IIH based on these findings characterized by a generalized depression of the visual field with increasing loss with eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-f05">Fig. 5</xref>). While nerve fiber bundle-like defects are frequently observed (especially inferior nasal nerve fiber bundle defects),<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> the overall pattern when multiple subjects are averaged is a generalized depression. The results of the IIHTT support this model of visual loss in IIH. Studies have also shown that the amount of visual loss is associated with the severity of papilledema.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This relationship suggests that visual loss in IIH occurs due to papilledema and not to a retrolaminar mechanism.</p><fig id="i1552-5783-57-3-805-f05" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Schematic of the visual island of a right eye in IIH modelling damage due to high- and low-grade papilledema.

With papilledema, there is forward protrusion of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina into the vitreous.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This leads to hyperopic peripapillary retina and a reduction in visual sensitivity (enlargement of the blind spot). Unlike most of the visual loss in IIH that is related to dysfunction or damage to nerve fiber bundles, the hyperopic retina functions well for the most part and the blind spot enlargement found on perimetry can be mostly refracted away using plus lenses.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Optical coherence tomography of the IIHTT subjects showed considerable distortion in the peripapillary retina.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Since both the acetazolamide and placebo groups experienced reduction in CSF pressure and papilledema over the 6-month period, there was reduction of the blind spot enlargement and improvement in the peripapillary visual sensitivity.</p><p>The magnitudes of the pointwise changes we found were modest. This likely related to our entry criteria that required a MD between &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;7 dB to be enrolled.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-3-805-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Most of the MDs were closer to the &#x02212;2 dB end of the distribution as the mean MD in each treatment group at study onset was &#x02212;3.5 dB. Therefore, there was likely a floor effect and little room for many subjects to improve. Although pointwise dB analysis showed there was significantly more visual field improvement in the acetazolamide group than in the placebo group, no significant differences were found with PLR or consensus of clinical readers. Again, this lack of difference likely relates to both groups improving, the lack of a substantial amount of visual loss at baseline and the categorical nature of some of the measures.</p><p>In conclusion, both the acetazolamide and placebo groups in the IIHTT demonstrated improvement across the visual field increasing with eccentricity, especially nasally; there was also substantial improvement in the visual field around the blind spot. This supports use of the MD as a useful measure to follow IIH patients over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="i1552-5783-57-3-805-s01"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="i1552-5783-57-3-805-s01.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="i1552-5783-57-3-805-s02"><label>Supplement 2</label><media xlink:href="i1552-5783-57-3-805-s02.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by NEI Grant NORDIC 1U10EY017281-01A1.
