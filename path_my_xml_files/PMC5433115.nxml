It has been reported by Casey[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Salomon and Vella[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in 2012 that the number of stress victims is growing at an alarming rate indicating stress to become a global problem by the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Along with several reports on mental stress and depression worldwide, a recent report by Towers Watson &#x0201c;The Business Value of a Healthy Workforce: 2013/2014 Staying at Work Survey Report&#x0201d; on May 6, 2014, presents a very critical scene of mental stress in our society. According to Towers Watson, stress is the number one lifestyle risk factor, ranking above physical inactivity and obesity. The countless deadlines of the tasks at workplace, unstable economies, frequent traveling, and odd hours of working are contributing to increased mental stress level in the society. According to Roozendaal <italic>et al</italic>. 2009, it is an emotional strain resulted from psychophysiological responses to perceive demands and pressures.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One can parameterize the stress as a stimulus that produces a negative emotional reaction including fear and loss of control.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recent developments in technology enabled to quantify many psychophysiological changes related to mental stress using electroencephalogram (EEG), MEG, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, ECG, and skin conductance or other psychological tests[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which use different parameters and algorithms to recognize stress.</p><p>Due to its higher temporal resolution,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] EEG is an important noninvasive method for studying the transient dynamics of the human brain's neuronal circuitry and it provides good observational data of variability in different mental states. As stress affects neural activity, EEG signals could be used as a better tool to quantify it. It consists several frequency bands, i.e., delta (0.5&#x02013;4 Hz), theta (4&#x02013;8 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz), beta (13&#x02013;30 Hz), gamma (30&#x02013;100 Hz) which are affected by different conscious states. Out of these sub-bands, alpha wave (8&#x02013;12 Hz) is associated with idleness of our brain; it shows the best correlation with mental stress.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Wheeler <italic>et al</italic>. (1990, 1993) showed the inverse relation between alpha band power and its corresponding activation in the brain.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Thus, as mental stress level increases, the alpha activity in the brain also increases resulting the decrement of alpha band power. The other sub-band theta power is found to be increasing with increasing level of stress.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Increase in alpha power reflects to relax and conscious conditions while decrease of alpha power and increase of beta power indicates that the subject is under intense activity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Alpha waves are more active in frontal and occipital lobes of the brain. Stress due to tension, excitement, and anxiety has high power of beta band.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Beta waves show varying behavior in different parts of the brain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Frontal brain asymmetry (FBA) is also a prominent tool for mental stress as well as emotion recognition. Wheeler <italic>et al</italic>., Niemiec and Lithgow[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied the brain asymmetry and quantified emotion on the basis of alpha band power ratio between left-right frontal lobes. The relative increase of alpha band power in the left frontal lobe indicates negative emotions (mental stress, sorrow, disgusted) while in the right frontal lobe indicates positive emotions (joy, surprise).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Asymmetry in brain activity also indicates some mental problems such as fatigues, depression, stress, emotional-inconsistence.</p><p>Besides brain, heart also shows significant functional variation due to some psychological situations and its functioning is affected by mental stress.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We analyzed Poincare plot for ECG's RR interval for mental stress recognition.</p><p>Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a powerful rhythmic breathing technique that balances the autonomic nervous system and influences psychophysiological disorders. SKY includes Sudarshan kriya, Bhastrika pranayama, and Yoga nidra and is an integral part of art of living (AOL) programs. Today, its effectiveness is universally acclaimed that it reduces stress, anger, anxiety, and depression bringing one in a pleasant state.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There are many published works related to stress recognition by EEG[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and ECG.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, a very few combined study of EEG and ECG have been done with SKY and mental stress.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A combined study of both brain and cardio signals will lead to increase accuracy and reliability of experiment and would be synergetic to each other. It also shows the interrelation between brain and heart functions during mental stress. We assessed neurophysiologic features of twenty subjects for stress recognition and showed the effect of SKY on those. We observed that SKY plays an important role in stress reduction. This paper presents a cross-validation among determination test (DT)-scores,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] EEG power spectrum, and ECG features in different mental stress states. Along with these, an objective study of SKY has been done to evaluate its benefits in stress reduction and improving stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Experimental setup</title><p>First, EEG and ECG signals were recorded from twenty healthy human subjects (ten male and ten female), aged between 21 and 30 (mean 26.3) years.

Initially, each subject filled a consent form having some lifestyle questionnaires. Then he was sat on a nonconducting comfortable chair in front of a computer having DT. The baseline EEG data was recorded for 5 min. EEG data for all the subjects during the DT have been recorded. Further, all subjects were given SKY session for 30 days for 1 h daily under the guidance of a trainer from AOL society. After 30 days of SKY session, post psychophysiological data of all subjects were recorded and compared with their prerecorded data.

However, it shows a relative increase after the SKY under the same DT test. It indicates that under the same stressor task, the brain can bear more stress after the exposure of SKY, i.e., stress tolerance increases. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the negative values of the alpha band power ratio (R<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>), during the DT, indicates that the subjects were in stress, but their values (weights) in post condition (after SKY) decreased compared to the precondition which showed that FBA during a stressor task decreased after SKY. Here, we got small changes in FBA in the case of some subjects (such as 2, 6, and 8) while greater changes in some of them (such as 7, 9, 10, and 11). This irregular variation could be justified by the self-assessment questionnaire (consent form) which they filled before the tests. As per that subjects 2, 6, and 8 felt less stressed during DT task even before the SKY session and subjects 7, 9, 10, and 11 felt more stressed as compared to the others. After SKY, significant changes were found in all of them, but more stressed subjects were more benefitted as compared to the less stressed.</p><p>In case of ECG before SKY, the Poincare plot shows more dispersion of RR data points from the line of identity indicating more variations in heart rate variability HRV but after SKY, the accumulation RR data points increases near line of identity showing that variation in RR interval decreases, i.e. the function of heart is going to be more relaxed, and the stress tolerance increases.</p><p>In DT scores, the average response time and delayed reactions decrease while the total number of responses during the task increases after SKY session, i.e., it is going to be easier to handle the task after the session. Thus, after SKY session, the stress tolerance increases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we found from the experiment that both brain and heart functions are affected by mental stress, and combined features provide a more effective tool to recognize the mental stress.
