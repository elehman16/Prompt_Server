Bacterial sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Assuming the mother is the main source for bacterial transmission to newborns, the primary objective of the trial is to determine the impact of one oral dose of azithromycin, given to women in labour, on the newborn&#x02019;s bacterial carriage in the nasopharynx. Secondary objectives include the impact of the intervention on bacterial colonization in the baby and the mother during the first month of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a Phase III, double -blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in which 830 women in labour were randomized to either a single dose of 2&#x000a0;g oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:1). The trial included pregnant women in labour aged 18 to 45&#x000a0;years attending study health centres in the Western Gambia. A post-natal check of the mother and baby was conducted at the health centre by study clinicians before discharge and 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days after delivery. Home follow up visits were conducted daily during the first week and then weekly until week 8 after delivery. Vaginal swabs and breast milk samples were collected from the mothers, and the pathogens <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Group B Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were isolated from the study samples. For bacterial isolates, susceptibility pattern to azithromycin was determined using disk diffusion and E-test. Eye swabs were collected from newborns with eye discharge during the follow up period, and Chlamydial infection was assessed using molecular methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is a proof-of-concept study to assess the impact of antibiotic preventive treatment of women during labour on bacterial infections in the newborn. If the trial confirms this hypothesis, the next step will be to assess the impact of this intervention on neonatal sepsis. The proposed intervention should be easily implementable in developing countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier -<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/">NCT01800942</ext-link>- First received: February 26, 2013.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bacterial colonization</kwd><kwd>Neonatal sepsis</kwd><kwd>Azithromycin</kwd><kwd>Randomized clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Sub-Saharan Africa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The last decade witnessed a substantial reduction in the risk of under-five child mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the greatest reduction occurred in children older than 1&#x000a0;month. Neonatal deaths, estimated at approximately 4 million annually, now account for almost 40&#x000a0;% of the world&#x02019;s deaths in children under-five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] with approximately 75&#x000a0;% of these deaths occurring during the first week of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The highest rates of mortality in this age group occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).</p><p>Invasive bacterial disease, which mainly presents as sepsis, is estimated to cause one out of three deaths in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the African continent, neonatal sepsis is caused by a wide range of bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that differ between the early (first week of life) and late (days 8 to 28) neonatal period. During the early neonatal period, when most neonatal sepsis occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], gram positive bacteria predominate among sepsis case with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> being the most frequently bacteria isolated, closely followed by group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Vertical transmission from the mother plays an important role in early neonatal sepsis. Newborns may be infected during labour as they pass through the birth canal, or during the first hours/days of life through close physical contact with the mother, if, as is commonly the case in SSA, the mother carries pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharyngeal tract or breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Azithromycin (AZI) is a macrolide with a wide antimicrobial spectrum; it is effective against organisms such as macrolide-susceptible <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. AZI is currently licensed for use in infants aged &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months and is used to treat a wide range of infections, including those occurring during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Data on the effect of treating pregnant women with up to 2&#x000a0;g of AZI for prevention of malaria and preterm birth are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although scarce information exists, AZI appears to be excreted in human milk at a very low concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to a case report, an infant who is exclusively breastfed would receive approximately 1/10 or 1/20 of the dose recommended in infants &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus far, there are limited safety data on AZI in neonates. Two trials among hospitalized neonates (one including 111 low birth weight neonates admitted to hospital and the other involved 2400 infants including neonates) have not shown severe adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another published study, AZI was given to 58 newborns as prophylaxis for pertussis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and only mild gastrointestinal adverse reactions were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. No additional adverse events were observed in the same study among newborns from AZI treated mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Orally administered AZI is widely distributed throughout the body. In pregnant women, after one oral dose, peak plasma concentrations are attained within 6&#x000a0;h; myometrium concentrations reach high levels within this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The elimination half-life from plasma and tissues is 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days. Some published literature show adverse reactions (i.e. gastrointestinal, headache) or allergic reactions (i.e. rash or swelling).</p><p>As part of the WHO-recommended trachoma control strategy, mass AZI treatment campaigns have been carried out in several trachoma endemic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], including The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The additional benefits of these campaigns include decreased nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and childhood morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>In The Gambia, the prevalence of AZI resistance after these mass AZI treatment campaigns was very low. For example, among <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic> isolates collected 6 to 30&#x000a0;months after treatment, resistance ranged between 0.3 and 0.9&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The relevance of acquired macrolide resistance for bacterial infections is uncertain but likely to be minimal in settings like the Gambia (and other African countries) where macrolides are very rarely used as empirical antibiotic therapy. In addition, there is evidence elsewhere from patients with cystic fibrosis receiving long term AZI, that although macrolide resistance develops in <italic>S. aureus</italic> among treated patients, these resistant organisms are not transmitted to their close family contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>New interventions to decrease neonatal mortality are urgently needed. If the mother is an important source of bacterial transmission to the newborn, then an intervention that reduces bacterial infections in the mother may prevent bacterial transmission and neonatal sepsis. In this study, we evaluate the impact of one oral dose of AZI given during labour on the asymptomatic bacterial carriage in the newborn baby as well as the mother. If successful, this simple intervention could be easily implemented at even the most remote health facilities. It has the potential to achieve wide coverage in SSA where low-cost interventions to reduce neonatal mortality are urgently needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The <underline>primary objective</underline> of the trial is to determine the impact of one oral dose of 2&#x000a0;g of AZI, given during labour, on the newborn&#x02019;s nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage at the age of 6&#x000a0;days for at least one of three pathogens: <italic>S.aureus</italic>, GBS and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p><underline>Secondary objectives</underline> are to determine the impact of the intervention on bacterial carriage in the nasopharyx of the baby, and in the vaginal tract and breast milk of the mother at different time points within the first 4&#x000a0;weeks after delivery.

Based on data from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], bacterial carriage (<italic>S.aureus</italic>, GBS or <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic>) on day 6 was assumed to be 60&#x000a0;% in the control arm. According to these assumptions, the study has 98&#x000a0;% power to detect a 25&#x000a0;% reduction in bacterial carriage (GBS, <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>S.aureus</italic>) and 88&#x000a0;% power to detect a 20&#x000a0;% reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A flow chart will be used to describe the number of mothers who were eligible, randomised and treated, and the number of samples obtained from mothers and children at each time point.</p><p>The adequacy of the randomisation procedure will be checked by comparing baseline characteristics of mothers (ethnicity, age, season enrolled, hours from treatment to delivery, mode of delivery, time to rupture of membrane, apgar score, multiple pregnancy) and newborns (sex, birth weight, gestational age) between arms. Some of these variables are measured post intervention, but are unlikely to be influenced by the intervention (time from treatment to delivery, mode of delivery, time to rupture of membrane, Apgar score). Prevalence of bacterial carriage in the mother pre-intervention will also be used to check comparability of baseline characteristics (NPS and vaginal swab).</p><p>The primary analysis will be based on intention to treat (ITT). We will include data on twins but will not adjust for the effect of clustering (the average cluster size will be close to 1 so the design effect will be negligible). A per protocol analysis will be conducted excluding samples from mothers who vomited less than 15&#x000a0;min after medication was taken, samples collected after the use of antibiotics, and samples arriving at the lab more than 8&#x000a0;h after collection.</p><p>The prevalence of bacterial carriage will be compared between arms at each time point (in NPS, vaginal swabs and breast milk). The prevalence of carriage will be presented separately for each species and combined (i.e., carriage of <italic>S.aureus</italic>, GBS or <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic>). In addition, carriage acquisition rates will be compared between arms for the periods 0&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days and 7&#x02013;28&#x000a0;days (acquisition will happen when a non-carrier will become carrier in the subseuqent sample). Ratios of prevalence and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals will be calculated for each of these comparisons, and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used to compute p-values for the comparisons of prevalence.</p><p>A Poisson regression model will be used to assess the effect of the intervention on prevalence of carriage across all time points. The model will include time, baseline carriage status of the mother, mother&#x02019;s age, ethnicity, season, sex of the newborn, and gestational age. Robust standard errors will be used to account for the dependence between observations from the same individual as well as the model misspecification (carriage status is binary and therefore does not follow a Poisson distribution).</p><p>To calculate prevalence of carriage at day 3 and day 6 we will use data from samples (NPS newborns and mothers, breast milk) collected within 1&#x000a0;day of the scheduled visit. At 14&#x000a0;days we will use samples collected between 12 and 18&#x000a0;days, and at 28&#x000a0;days we will use samples collected between 25 and 31&#x000a0;days. For vaginal bacterial carriage at day 8&#x02013;10 we will use samples collected between 7 and 13&#x000a0;days. Samples were not collected after children received antibiotics. Where a sample was collected in lieu of the missing sample (i.e., before antibiotics were given) this will be used in place of the missing sample, even if it was collected outside the appropriate window period.</p><p>We will present analyses based on the available data. For the primary outcome we will conduct two additional analyses using the ITT cohort. First, a subgroup analysis in women who gave birth 2&#x000a0;h or more after taking the drug. And second, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation of missing data. In the imputation model, bacterial carriage in missing samples will be imputed from data on bacterial carriage at other time points and baseline demographic data (age and ethnicity for mothers, and sex and birth weight for newborns).</p><p>Changes in prevalence of bacterial carriage over time will be plotted for NPS in mothers and newborns, and breast milk. The plots will include point-wise 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals for each prevalence estimate.</p><p>The numbers and rates of adverse events, serious adverse events (overall and specifically with a diagnosis of neonatal sepsis), purulent conjunctivitis, Chlamydial conjunctivitis, and deaths in newborns will be reported by trial arm. Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported in mothers. Rates will be compared between trial arms using Poisson regression, and robust standard errors will be used to allow for heterogeneity in the rates between individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neonatal deaths, estimated at approximately 4 million annually, represent up to 40&#x000a0;% of all child fatalities with 3 out of 4 of these neonatal deaths occurring during the first week of life with maximum risk during the first 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days. Interventions designed to impact on child mortality should target this vulnerable age group.</p><p>Sepsis causes up to 1 out of 3 neonatal deaths. Many neonatal casualties associated with sepsis are preventable when appropriate interventions are put into place. In resource-rich countries, GBS infections were substantially reduced with antibiotic-based prevention strategies. For example, chemoprophylaxis with ampicillin or penicillin in the USA reduced the incidence of early onset neonatal sepsis caused by GBS from 1.8 per 1,000 live births in the early 90&#x02019;s to 0.28 per 1,000 in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In these countries, when a screened woman is identified as a GBS vaginal carrier, she is treated during labour intravenously with antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To reach maximum effectiveness, treatment should last at least 4&#x000a0;h before delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Maternal antibiotic treatment during labour blocks bacterial transmission to the newborn at birth. Because the newborn does not become infected, s/he is not at risk of developing early neonatal severe disease. Before GBS screening was introduced in USA and other developed countries, the great majority of neonatal sepsis, especially those occurring during the early neonatal period, were caused by this bacterium.</p><p>To roll-out a potentially successful intervention to developing countries within Africa and elsewhere, main epidemiological and contextual differences between the regions need to be considered. Unlike developed countries, several bacteria are associated with early and late neonatal sepsis in the African continent and intravenous antibiotics are generally unavailable. Approximately two thirds of neonatal sepsis cases in Africa are caused by gram positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and in some countries gram positive bacteria represent up to 80&#x000a0;% of all sepsis during the first month as well as the first week of life. Due to costs, limited infrastructure and diagnostic facilities, screening programmes are difficult to implement in SSA and other developing regions. Still, screening may not be needed where at least half of pregnant women are vaginal carriers of one of the most common bacteria associated with neonatal sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In Africa, other known risk factors for early neonatal sepsis, such as preterm or low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and premature rupture of membranes or prolonged labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], are also common.</p><p>The relevance of acquired macrolide resistance for outcome of episodes of clinical infection is uncertain, but is likely to be minimal in a setting like the Gambia and other African countries where macrolides are very rarely used as empirical antibiotic therapy. Also, previous studies in The Gambia show that after mass AZI campaigns for trachoma control, prevalence of AZI resistance among <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic> isolates was re-establisehd to baseline levels (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence elsehwere from patients with cystic fibrosis receiving long term AZI, that although macrolide resistance develops in <italic>S. aureus</italic> among treated patients, these resistant organisms are not transmitted to their close family contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this proof-of-concept study, we propose an intervention that would be easily implementable in developing countries. We treat women in labour attending a health facility with one dose of AZI, an oral antibiotic that is cheap and does not need specific storage conditions (can be kept at room temperature), and we will assess whether this antibiotic decreases the risk of bacterial colonization in the baby during the neonatal period (primary endpoint during the first week of life or early neonatal period) and the mother during the same period. The hypothesis that motivates our intervention is that the mother is the main source of bacterial transmission to the baby. If the intervention is successful in proving our hypothesis, then we will design several additional studies. First, we will assess the impact of the intervention on severe clinical endpoints such as neonatal sepsis and mortality in the baby and puerperal sepsis in the mother. If this is shown to be of benefit, we will then test the intervention in the context of home delivery, as in Africa, many women deliver at home attended by traditional birth attendants.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission of this manuscript, ethical approval had been obtained and recruitment had finished.
