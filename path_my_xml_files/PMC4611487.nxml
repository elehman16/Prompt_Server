Krill oil is produced from small oceanic crustaceans at the base of the food chain (krill) that primarily ingest algae rich in &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids. The oils produced by krill are thought to be a less polluted and more pure source of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids, notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), compared with other fish oils.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> EPA and DHA are the primary fatty acids that contribute toward improved cardiovascular health.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>While both krill and fish oils possess &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids, the fatty acids in fish oil are attached to either triglycerides or ethyl esters which reportedly produce a high abundance of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids in whole blood.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, it has been suggested that krill oil has better bioavailability because the &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, are attached to phospholipids and multiple reports have shown superior absorption in the intestines and further increased phospholipid-bound &#x003c9;-3 fatty acid plasma and red blood cell levels.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant, which may reduce the presence of free radicals, free oxygen, and inflammation in humans.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Oxidative stress and inflammation are known contributors to atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and overall CVD risk.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, despite the great abundance of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids available in fish oil, the delivery of fatty acids and presence of astaxanthin in krill oil may provide superior health benefits and meets the AHA recommendations of 1000&#x02005;mg of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acid consumption.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes have a high incidence of CVD and often have traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hyperlipidemia, elevated blood glucose, insulin resistance, and hypertension.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation have also been reported.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Identifying opportunities for prevention of CVD progression in patients with type 2 diabetes is critically important and may be underappreciated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of krill oil supplementation on CVD risk and blood glucose control among patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind trial using a cross-over design, the effect of krill oil (Prograde Inc, Lutz, Florida, USA) as compared with olive oil was evaluated in participants with type 2 diabetes.

Research staff requested that participants bring their supplement bottles to their study visits to further assess subject compliance, and any changes in medication throughout the course of the study were documented.</p><p>This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the start of the trial after the experimental protocol had been explained to them in detail. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02091193).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Trial population</title><p>Participants were enrolled in the trial between June 2012 and December 2013. Recruitment methods included medical provider referrals, newspaper advertisements, and flyers distributed throughout the greater Danbury, Connecticut area. Inclusion criteria included adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and on stable oral glucose-lowering agents and/or insulin that could be confirmed by a healthcare provider. Patients were excluded from the study if they were less than 18&#x02005;years of age, were pregnant or lactating, had a blood coagulation disorder or used oral anticoagulants other than aspirin, had a seafood allergy, or consumed fish oil or krill oil supplements within 2&#x02005;weeks of the start of the study. The trial protocol was reviewed with all eligible participants and written consent was obtained from each participant. Each participant's baseline medical and social history, including duration of diagnosis with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, were documented at the time of enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Trial visits and laboratory procedures</title><p>The endothelial function of participants was tested at each visit using an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved device, the EndoPAT2000 (Itamar Medical Inc, Franklin, Massachusetts, USA). The EndoPAT2000 is a non-invasive method to assess peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) in the fingers.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Endothelial function testing was conducted in a quiet, temperature-controlled room following the manufacturer's recommendations. Each participant was placed in a supine position and the PAT sensors were placed on the same finger of the left and right hands. A sphygmomanometer cuff was placed on the participant's non-dominant arm and the dominant arm acted as the control. Measurement included a 5&#x02005;min baseline or basal recording of PAT, 5&#x02005;min of brachial artery occlusion in the non-dominant arm by inflating the blood pressure cuff, and 5&#x02005;min of a reactive hyperemia measurement for a total of 15&#x02005;min of testing. Brachial artery occlusion was achieved by inflating the sphygmomanometer cuff to at least 60&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg over the patient's systolic blood pressure (with a minimum of 200&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and a maximum of 260&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg). The Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) was automatically analyzed and calculated using EndoPAT2000 software, V.3.4.4. An RHI above 1.67 represents moderate risk of endothelial dysfunction and above 2.0 indicates low risk of endothelial dysfunction. Patients with an RHI below 1.67 are high risk for endothelial dysfunction.</p><p>Fasting blood (8&#x02005;h minimum) specimens were collected from participants using venipuncture at the baseline visit (T<sub>0</sub>), at the end point of each treatment (T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>) and following the 17-week supplementation period if they chose to participate. The specimens were used to determine the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and non-HDL cholesterol. Serum for lipid profiles, glucose, total antioxidant capacity, and C peptide measurements were collected in BD Vacutainer Serum Separator Tubes (SST). Serum was then stored in microcentrifuge tubes at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>80&#x000b0;C until it was thawed for analysis. HbA1c analysis was performed with whole blood using a self-contained bench-top immunoassay (Seimens DCA Vantage, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA). Lipid profiles and glucose were measured using 50&#x02005;&#x003bc;L of serum loaded onto a room temperature Cholestech Lipid Profile and Glucose cassette (Alere San Diego, Inc, San Diego, California, USA). The cassette was then loaded onto the Cholestech LDX analyzer (Alere San Diego, Inc) following product protocols.</p><p>Total antioxidant capacity and C peptide measurements were performed at the Western Connecticut Health Network Biomedical Research Institute using commercially available ELISA kits and their specified protocols (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, and Mercodia, Inc, Winston Salem, North Carolina, USA, respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessments of Insulin Resistance (HOMA2-IR) were calculated using the HOMA2-IR (V.2.2.3, University of Oxford) calculator using measured glucose and C peptide values. The University of Oxford's HOMA2-IR calculator allows for C peptide to be used in calculations instead of insulin because generally, C peptide is produced in equal amounts to insulin. C peptide is also more stable with a longer half-life than insulin, ensuring accurate measurement following a freeze-thaw cycle.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

An estimation of the difference in endothelial function between the participants receiving krill oil and olive oil was used to calculate a sample size that would detect a reduction in cardiovascular risk factor measures with an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a power of 80%. This required a sample size of 50 participants. Participants were block randomized by research coordinators to two equal groups using a computer-generated list prior to the start of enrollment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The allocation between the two groups determined whether the subject first received krill oil capsule supplements or olive oil capsule supplements. Both supplements were blinded to the trial coordinators and the participants until the completion of the trial. Participants were assigned their group on sequential enrollment and the randomized group placement.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Calculations and statistical analysis</title><p>The efficacy of olive oil and krill oil was assessed on the basis of within-participant differences between the two treatments with regard to the outcome variables. The described procedure assumes normality of the distributions to be analyzed.</p><p>To separate treatment effects from period effects, treatment effects were computed separately in the two sequence groups. In order for the procedure to be valid, we had to check the assumption of negligible carry-over effects by conducting a pretest of the data conceived by Wellek and Blettner.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For this test, the sum of the values measured in both periods were calculated for each participant and compared across the two sequence groups by means of a test of independent samples.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Once we confirmed that there was negligible carry-over effect, the difference between treatment effects was assessed by means of a standard t test for independent samples using the intraindividual differences between values measured in both periods (difference scores).</p><p>Outcomes following the optional 17-week supplementation period were compared with the respective baseline measures and analyzed using the t test. Statistical significance for this study was defined at p&#x0003c;0.05.

C peptide and insulin resistance were also reduced after 4&#x02005;weeks of supplementation, but was not observed after 17&#x02005;weeks of supplementation. However, on further analysis, a reduction of C peptide in patients receiving insulin therapy was not observed, but was in patients receiving oral glucose-lowering agents after 4&#x02005;weeks of supplementation. Because CVD is the most common cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes, both providers and patients seek solutions to minimize cardiovascular risk factors and increase lifespan in this high-risk population.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The reduction of traditionally measured risk factors, such as high cholesterol and hypertension, or those less often measured, such as endothelial dysfunction, can typically be achieved by pharmacological or lifestyle interventions. Endothelial function has been shown to be impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes and is further exacerbated when these patients also have hypertension.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our sample was at high risk for endothelial dysfunction and CVD, as approximately three out of four participants had both type 2 diabetes and hypertension.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>Based on the cross-over results, krill oil supplementation may improve endothelial function better than olive oil. The mechanism for this improvement could be attributed to the bioavailability and structure of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids in krill oil and its ability to reduce inflammation or other physiological properties, but would require further studies to characterize the mechanism.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Insulin resistance may contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction and is common among participants with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, HOMA estimated insulin resistance, when measured as cohorts and not individually, may be suggestive of CVD risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A significant reduction of HOMA2-IR, or insulin resistance, in participants receiving krill oil during the initial cross-over supplementation period was observed. While HOMA2-IR cannot be used to make generalized statements about insulin resistance on an individual basis, it is useful when evaluating the effect of a supplement or treatment in a population.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Insulin activates intracellular signaling pathways that are critical to maintaining a healthy endothelium. Insulin resistance may contribute to deficiencies in the signaling pathway and result in impaired maintenance of the endothelium, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory, and thrombotic effects.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In brief, krill oil's observed reduction of insulin resistance or HOMA2-IR may provide a short-term mechanism to maintain healthy endothelium, but may not be responsible for the overall improvement of endothelial function observed in this trial and may only apply to patients who are not receiving insulin therapy. In addition, future studies should consider other methods to evaluate insulin resistance to confirm this finding due to HOMA2-IR's existing limitations around the interpretation of individual results.</p><p>A significant improvement in serum HDL was observed following 17&#x02005;weeks of krill oil supplementation in participants with type 2 diabetes. Though this effect was not observed during the 4-week cross-over period of the trial, the sustained use of krill oil may increase the serum HDL in type 2 diabetes participants. An increase of HDL in patients with type 2 diabetes may reduce the risk for CVD, especially when patients are diagnosed with other comorbidities causing an increased risk of CVD, like hypertension or dyslipidemia (73.9% and 74.5% of participants enrolled, respectively).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The observed improvement of EndoPAT and HDL after 17&#x02005;weeks suggests that future studies should consider supplementation periods longer than 4&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>This study included a free-living design allowing the participants to control their diets (including other fatty fish consumption) and activity to simulate krill oil consumption and its potential effect in patients in the uncontrollable world.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To be able to compare participants despite their differences in lifestyles, participants acted as their own controls for comparison and none reported any changes in their diet or level of activity throughout the duration of the study. The krill oil still displayed significant improvement in endothelial function and blood HDL levels, despite the variability between subject lifestyles and clinical histories. Our results suggest that krill oil supplementation may provide similar benefits to patients outside of this clinical study regardless of lifestyle differences. These results are a conservative estimate and thus, if the diets of participants were restricted and they were placed on an exercise regimen, the effect of krill oil supplementation could be even greater.</p><p>Further, olive oil contains a plant-derived &#x003c9;-3 fatty acid called &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (ALA) which is known to have strong health benefits.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The dose of ALA in olive oil consumed by participants in this study was 8&#x02005;mg/day and is below the minimum dosage of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids recommended by the AHA to reduce the risk of developing CVD. While using olive oil in the cross-over design may appear as a limitation, the margin of improvement when comparing the results of olive oil and krill oil actually narrows. This suggests that if something more benign were used instead, like water, the improvement of cardiovascular risk factors may have been even greater after supplementation with krill oil.</p><p>This study also sought to evaluate krill oil's effect on glucose control. HbA1c represents a patient's glucose control over the 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months prior to testing. Thus, while the 4&#x02005;weeks in the cross-over design was not long enough to evaluate krill oil's effect on glucose control, 17&#x02005;weeks is sufficient time and there was no significant improvement.</p><p>Additional longitudinal studies must be performed to confirm our finding that krill oil reduces some cardiovascular risks in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike other similar studies, this study did not measure participants&#x02019; blood pressures at each time point, despite the high proportion of patients with hypertension in this study.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Future studies should include methods to better evaluate insulin resistance and include blood pressure measurements. Krill oil supplementation should also be compared with the effect of prescription &#x003c9;-3-acid ethyl esters products, like Lovaza, as krill oil supplementation may be a less expensive option for some patients. It is also important to note that the US FDA does not require approval for supplements, so thorough investigation of supplement effects on patients is important.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors of the trial wish to acknowledge Joseph Belsky, MD for his help with trial implementation, Tannaz Sedghi, Kyaw Sint, MPH and Mahshid Mohammadi, MD for their statistical expertise, and Kara Crowley, MS for her support and assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JML, ADB, JRP, and RA were responsible for conception and trial design.
