<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These malignancies can be effectively prevented by the prophylactic vaccination against HPV and by safe sex (condom use) in addition to the regular screening.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> Many countries have implemented national HPV immunisation programmes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In Sweden, from 2012, girls aged 10&#x02013;12&#x02005;years are being offered the quadrivalent vaccine as part of the school-based vaccination programme administered by the school nurse, while older girls and young women are offered the vaccine in the catch-up programme administered in the primary care setting.

According to Swedish law, all students should have access to school health. The school health work is mainly preventive and involves at least a school nurse and a school physician; however, only the nurse works in the school on a regular basis. In Sweden, sexual education is mandatory in primary and secondary school, and includes topics such as anatomy, sexuality, prevention of sexually transmitted infections and reproductive health.</p><p>All first year upper secondary school students (aged 16&#x02005;years) are offered a health interview with the school nurse, who provides a dialogue regarding psychosocial health, eating habits, sleep, physical activity, intake of tobacco, alcohol and drugs, as well as sexual health and relationships. This intervention is optional, although usually all students do participate in it. The interview is scheduled for approximately 1&#x02005;h and conducted in an empathic atmosphere based on Motivational Interviewing<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> that focuses on the individual student's health and well-being.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Population and sample</title><p>First year upper secondary school students attending the regular health interview with the school nurse in the autumn semester of 2014 were eligible for participation. We excluded students who were not able to speak or write Swedish (ie, recently arrived immigrants), and adolescents with severe learning disabilities and development disorders (ie, studying at special schools). Upper secondary schools (n=18) in nine municipalities in central Sweden a total of about 600&#x02005;000 rural and urban inhabitants who represented different socioeconomic levels-were included. The participating schools included both municipally and privately managed schools that offered vocational as well as theoretically-oriented education, and had a varying number of students.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>School nurses were recruited to the project via the school heads and through direct contact at a national school health conference. For logistical reasons, those working in the far north or south of Sweden were not invited. Initially 59 upper secondary schools were approached and eventually 18 of these were included; details of the recruitment are given in the flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009875F1">figure 1</xref>. A total of 23 school nurses working in 20 schools in 9 municipalities agreed to participate in the study. Three nurses in two schools dropped out at the start of the intervention due to heavy workload. This opportunistic selection resulted in a total of 20 school nurses working in 18 schools.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009875F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow of schools and students through trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009875f01"/></fig><p>Randomisation was performed in two steps. First, in order to avoid contamination, the schools were randomised into either the intervention group or the control group. The schools were randomly drawn by administrative personnel not involved in the project. Second, 113 school classes within these schools were randomly selected to be included in the study; this number was chosen in order to achieve the desired number of students according to the power calculations (described below). The school nurses provided basic details about the classes (eg, Social science 14A), and number of students in each class. If the class consisted of less than 25 students, an additional class was allocated. The students were recruited by the school nurses, as described below. The end result was an intervention group of 394 students from 60 classes and a control group of 357 students from 53 classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009875F1">figure 1</xref>). Recruitment did not begin until registration was made public.</p><p>Two school nurses in two schools dropped out during the intervention due to termination of employment and personal reasons, and they did not complete the health interviews with their allotted students. In order to compensate for these losses, which were all from the intervention group, all school nurses in the intervention group were advised to perform health interviews with an additional class. Consequently, similar classes were included in the study.</p><p>The students (n=832) were invited to participate in the study when they met the school nurse for the general health interview. Those who agreed to participate (n=751) gave informed written consent. Before the health interview started, all students were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. A follow-up questionnaire was completed after 3&#x02005;months (n=741). The baseline questionnaire was completed individually at the school nurse's office while the follow-up questionnaire was given to the whole class. Students not present at this time could complete the follow-up questionnaire afterwards at the school nurse's office. School nurses were provided with checklists regarding the procedure and used log lists (protocols completed after each health interview) to assure that the intervention was performed in a uniform fashion. For obvious reasons, the school nurse could not be blinded to whether the student belonged to the intervention or control group, but the research assistant who recorded the data from the participants did not possess this knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework. This model has previously been used in studies about HPV and HPV vaccination,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and in interventions with the aim to increase prevention of sexually transmitted infections.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> According to the HBM framework, a person's health behaviour can be explained by the individual's beliefs regarding health actions. HBM includes the following central constructs: perceived <italic>susceptibility</italic>, perceived <italic>severity</italic>, perceived <italic>benefit</italic> and perceived <italic>barriers</italic>. Furthermore, sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity and parental education level, as well as knowledge, are recognised as factors that can indirectly influence the individual's behaviour. The main limitation of the model is that it does not consider emotional or relational aspects involved in decisions regarding health behaviour.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was included in the general 1&#x02005;h face-to-face health interview. Thus, while the controls received general information, including those on sexual health, the intervention group received specific HPV education guided by HBM and a predesigned informational structure format. The school nurse showed a specially designed flipchart with pictures and brief information to the students (see example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009875TB1">table 1</xref>). She also handed out a specially designed leaflet. The intervention took about 30&#x02005;min and included the following information:

The nurses' experiences resulted in minor revisions: for logistic reasons the intervention procedure was modified to having the follow-up for all students together in the classroom, instead of having individual follow-ups at the school nurses office. Furthermore, the educational material was shortened, some statements were simplified and the additional response alternative &#x02018;do not know&#x02019; was added to the block of questions regarding beliefs about HPV. A few of the questions were clarified; two were considered redundant and therefore these were removed. In parallel, the questionnaire was tested among adolescents aged 17&#x02005;years (n=230)<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and they confirmed the school nurses&#x02019; observations.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Instrument</title><p>The questionnaire was based on previous research and clinical experience.

Two focus group interviews were undertaken with adolescents (n=8) aged 16&#x02013;17&#x02005;years (both boys and girls) who were asked what they considered important to include in an intervention regarding prevention of HPV. Cognitive interviews (n=5) and discussion sessions (n=8) regarding the questionnaire were performed with adolescents aged 15&#x02013;18&#x02005;years.</p><p>To test the stability and reliability of the intervention over time, a test&#x02013;retest evaluation was undertaken in 2014 with first year upper secondary school students (n=29) randomly selected from a school in a city of 200&#x02005;000 inhabitants that was located in mid-Sweden. The questionnaire was distributed on two occasions with a time interval of 2&#x02005;weeks. Analysis was based on Cronbach's &#x003b1; and showed high reliability scores for the questions regarding the decision-making process relating to HPV vaccination (0.800&#x02013;0.998), except for the single question &#x02018;Do you want to be vaccinated later&#x02019; (0.436). Statements regarding beliefs about HPV ranged from low to high (scores 0.331&#x02013;0.918); consequently, two statements were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants received oral and written information before giving their written consent. The participants were informed that participation was voluntary, that they could withdraw participation at any time without providing a motivation or incurring any negative consequences for themselves. They were also informed that only the researchers would have access to the data, and that all data would be presented at a group level. Contact details to the researchers were provided in case of further questions. According to the Swedish law, children above 15&#x02005;years of age who understand what participation means have the right to give informed consent regarding participation in research studies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Therefore, informed consent was not obtained from the parents.

The education comprised factual information about HPV and the HPV vaccine. The flipchart educational material was presented, and the nurses were encouraged to give comments if anything was unclear or if anything they considered as important was missing. Furthermore, each school nurse received a minimum of 1&#x02005;h additional education at the time for the start of the intervention at the school where she worked.

For each individual item in the HBM index, the answers on the 5-point Likert scale (&#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019;) where scored 0 to 4 for negative questions (ie, when &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; implied higher health beliefs while &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; implied lower health beliefs) and 4 to 0 for positive questions (ie, when &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; implied lower health beliefs while &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; implied higher health beliefs). &#x02018;Do not know&#x02019; was classified as an answer for the neutral option. Finally, scores from all included individuals were summarised to give a total score. The McNemar test was used to determine differences in actual HPV vaccinations and actual condom use from baseline to follow-up; we have excluded the &#x02018;do not know&#x02019; group for vaccination in the analysis. The analyses are conducted at an individual level and are based on intention-to-treat principle; these comprise all the 741 students completing the follow-up questionnaire.</p><p>In order to take into account the dependence between students who were informed by the same school nurse, generalised estimating equations models were used for examining the results of the intervention on the outcome measures. The differences between the outcome variables at baseline and follow-up were used as dependent variables in the generalised estimating equations models, while the treatment group (intervention or control) was used as a predictor together with the socioeconomic and demographic variables, sex and immigrant background, which differed significantly between the two groups at baseline. These variables were only included as main effects in the regression models, with no interaction being used. In all the analyses, a two-sided p value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics V.22.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants and sample</title><p>As mentioned above, a flow chart with details of the participants and samples is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009875F1">figure 1</xref>.

After the intervention, the students had significantly more favourable beliefs towards HPV prevention, and were more inclined to use condom during sex with a new partner. In addition, the intervention increased actual HPV vaccination rates.</p><p>It is encouraging that the changes from baseline to follow-up on the intention to use condom was higher among boys than among girls, since they are neither included in the national HPV vaccination programme nor receive any organised information about HPV. Our finding gives support for the speculation that boys also want to protect themselves and their partners against the virus.</p><p>It was frustrating that the effects on the students&#x02019; intentions did not result in clear differences in actual reported condom use. However, it should be kept in mind that this is a small group and the follow-up was short. The results might have been different with a longer follow-up&#x02014;not all of them were sexually active, and those who were may not have had a new opportunity to use a condom with a new partner during the period between the intervention and the follow-up questionnaire. Consequently, too much weight should not be given to this finding. More important is the finding that several girls (and 1 boy) chose to have themselves vaccinated shortly after the intervention. Since the older girls are offered the vaccine in the catch-up programme and the families have to personally contact the primary care centre to book an appointment, it is encouraging that the intervention had effects on the vaccination rates.</p><p>There were significant effects on the HBM total score, which includes the parameters perceived <italic>susceptibility</italic>, perceived <italic>severity</italic>, perceived <italic>benefits</italic> and perceived <italic>barriers</italic>. Interestingly, the increase in beliefs about HPV prevention from baseline to follow-up was higher among adolescents with an immigrant background. This is an important finding since Sweden is a multicultural country, with many immigrants from countries with limited access to healthcare and health education. It was also encouraging that these students reported higher scores for perceived <italic>susceptibility</italic>, that is, they were aware of the risks. Immigrant background is known to be associated with increased risk for cervical cancer<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and lower attendance in cervical cancer screening programmes.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>We also found significant differences between the intervention and control groups regarding perceived <italic>severity</italic>. According to HBM, the combination of <italic>susceptibility</italic> and <italic>severity</italic> are labelled as perceived <italic>threat</italic>.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Since adolescence is a time in life when the perception of being at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection is generally low, especially among boys,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and the sexual risk taking is increasing,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> we are happy to note that the intervention increased the adolescents&#x02019; perception of HPV as a serious threat. This is beneficial for their future sexual health behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths</title><p>This complex educational intervention was carefully developed, standardised, validated, and monitored, and it had a high response rate; 89.1% completed the study. Further major strengths are the randomised control trial design and the fact that various kinds of schools with a representative sample of both boys and girls were included. The percentage of adolescents with an immigrant background, as well as the number of HPV-vaccinated girls at baseline, are representative for the Swedish population in general. This means that the findings can, with a fair degree of certainty, be extrapolated to the population at large. The target group, adolescents aged 16&#x02005;years, is adequate since this is a time in life when many become sexually active. The school nurses, with their professional role and experience of discussing sensitive issues, are the proper persons to deliver the intervention. Finally, a school-based intervention reaches all adolescents regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity or cultural background.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Weaknesses</title><p>For logistic reasons, we could not randomise the students one by one, since the school nurses could not perform the follow-up at an individual level. This became clear during the evaluation of the pilot study. Consequently, the groups differed somewhat at baseline with, for example, more girls in the intervention group and more boys in the control group. We took this into account in the generalised estimating equations model and adjusted for the demographic differences at baseline.</p><p>It is possible that the participating school nurses are more committed to HPV prevention and sexual health issues than their colleagues. These nurses&#x02019; commitment and personal communication skills might have affected the outcome of the intervention in a favourable direction. To compensate for this and ensure uniformity, the intervention was highly structured, the school nurses were provided with exhaustive instructions, and the researchers regularly contacted them, asking questions systematically about <italic>&#x02018;how does it work for you?&#x02019;.</italic> The initial process evaluation and log lists indicate that the fidelity was very high; all school nurses performed the intervention according to the given guidelines. Also, as in all studies including self-reported questionnaires, there is a risk of participants&#x02019; over-reporting or under-reporting or having recall bias; however, we consider this risk to be small in the present study.</p><p>Finally, although our study was fairly large, it would have been even better if we had been able to include more participants in order to be able to go into further detail and perform more subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first randomised, educational, school-based face-to-face intervention study among a diverse population of adolescents with the aim to improve primary prevention of HPV.

<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As discussed in the systematic review by Shepherd <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> there is a need for interventions with greater focus on HPV and especially for the link between HPV and cancer. Previous interventions have tended to focus on prevention of cervical cancer only.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> It is also an advantage to use a theoretical framework such as HBM when developing an educational intervention with preventive aims. HBM is a systematic way to explain a person's health behavior and therefore this clarifies the use of key concepts on which the intervention is based.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Our results stand in contrast to previous school-based interventions delivered in the class for which no significant effects on beliefs<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> neither about condom use nor HPV vaccination, were found.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This discrepancy indicates that it is beneficial to have a face-to-face intervention delivered by school nurses; similar interventions have previously been delivered by the researchers.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
