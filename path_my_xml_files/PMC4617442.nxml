Early detection/management of side-effects is vital to improve patient outcomes, decrease morbidity and limit lengthy/costly hospital admissions. The ability to capture patient-reported health data in real-time, is regarded as the &#x02018;gold-standard&#x02019; to allow rapid clinical decision-making/intervention. This paper presents the protocol for a Phase 3 multi-site randomised controlled trial evaluating a novel nurse-led Telehealth intervention for remote monitoring/management of chemotherapy side-effects in Australian haematological cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Two hundred and twenty-two patients will be recruited from two hospitals. Eligibility criteria include: diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/Hodgkin&#x02019;s/non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma; aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years; receiving&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;cycles chemotherapy. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either the control or intervention arm with stratification by diagnosis, chemotherapy toxicity (high versus low), receipt of previous chemotherapy and hospital. Patients allocated to the control arm will receive &#x02018;Usual Care&#x02019; whilst those allocated to the intervention will receive the intervention <italic>in addition</italic> to &#x02018;Usual Care&#x02019;. Intervention patients will be provided with a computer tablet and software prompting twice-daily completion of physical/emotional scales for up to four chemotherapy cycles. Should patient data exceed pre-determined limits an Email alert is delivered to the treatment team, prompting nurses to view patient data, and contact the patient to provide clinical intervention. In addition, six scheduled nursing interventions will be completed to educate/support patients in use of the software. Patient outcomes will be measured cyclically (midpoint and end of cycles) via pen-and-paper self-report alongside review of the patient medical record. The primary outcome is burden due to nausea, mucositis, constipation and fatigue. Secondary outcomes include: burden due to vomiting and diarrhoea; psychological distress; ability to self-manage health; level of cancer information/support needs and; utilisation of health services. Analyses will be intention-to-treat. A cost-effectiveness analysis is planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is the first in the world to test a remote monitoring/management intervention for adult haematological cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy is a core treatment for haematological malignancies; however, its toxicities often lead to potentially life-threatening or distressing side-effects (eg febrile neutropenia, infections, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, fatigue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Toxicities such as mucositis are more commonly experienced in haematological maligancies than solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and are associated with poorer treatment adherence, impaired quality of life, increased infections, mortality, hospitalisations and ultimately with a higher cost/economic burden to the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Need for real-time assessment of side-effects</title><p>The early detection of side-effects such as severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia is vital, as they are potentially life-threatening and often lead to costly hospital admissions and higher patient morbidity, especially in haematological cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Management of non-life- threatening side-effects, such as fatigue, are also important as they impact on quality of life, daily living activities and may result in mood disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High symptom burden is also a known risk factor for adverse psychological adjustment in people with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>People with haematological cancers receive chemotherapy in either day treatment units or in-patient settings, followed by discharge into the community. Patients are required to monitor their side-effects at home but may be reluctant to inform their treatment team when problems arise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Structured symptom assessment tools and the implementation of timely management strategies improve patient physical and emotional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but traditionally rely on retrospective patient recall (from their previous appointment or treatment), are prone to recall bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and impede timely clinical responses. The ability to capture patient-reported symptom data in real-time is, therefore, the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; to allow rapid clinical decision-making and interventions to improve patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Need for patient self-management of side-effects and the role of the specialist nurse</title><p>Patients discharged into the community setting following each chemotherapy treatment cycle are also required to monitor their health and engage in self-care activities to prevent, or reduce, the severity of numerous, and possibly complex side-effects. In addition, patients often report the need &#x02018;to be informed about the things you can do to help yourself get well&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Developing patients&#x02019; self-care skills is critically important to ensure safe and high quality care at home. Previous studies examining the nurse&#x02019;s role in promoting patient self-care demonstrate the potential of nurses to reduce psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], reduce patient concerns about treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], decrease barriers to self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and improve symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] using short duration nurse-led interventions. Various strategies have also been used to boost these interventions including, evidence-based messages via DVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], or telephone follow-up, in addition to face-to-face sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite positive results, these interventions were hampered by the inability to respond to patient concerns in real-time. Systematic reviews in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], conclude that research, in particular intervention studies, are a priority to guide practice to improve patient self-management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Telehealth systems can improve patient outcomes</title><p>The International Organisation for Standardisation defines Telehealth as the &#x02018;Use of telecommunication techniques for the purpose of providing telemedicine, medical education and health education over a distance&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More specifically this relates to the real-time remote exchange of physiological or symptom data between patients in the community and clinicians within a treatment facility and includes: the Internet; phone lines (land or mobile); or video links. To date, technology has enabled successful assessment of symptoms in patients with chronic disease resulting in improved patient outcomes and decreased hospital stays/health system costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, few studies report Telehealth systems for cancer patients and most only focus on acceptability, feasibility or useability data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Only five papers to date attempt to quantify benefits in patients with cancer (eg during chemotherapy treatment; post-surgery) which include: decreases in fatigue, pain, depression, post-operative symptom threshold events; interference with activities of daily living and; preventable use of health care services (eg clinic visits, bed days of care) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Despite the promising early findings, all Telehealth research in cancer to date has serious limitations including sub-optimal study design (insufficient power, no record of patient adherence to self-care/intervention adherence) or health economic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, no cancer Telehealth systems have incorporated explicit coaching of patients in the self-care advice delivered; or have been developed for use with high-risk clinical groups or within an Australian context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Development of a remote monitoring system for haematological cancer patients</title><p>Given the early success of the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS) developed in the UK by Kearney and colleagues, a remote-monitoring system used in a range of patient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] a collaboration to develop a remote monitoring system specifically for Australian patients with haematological cancers (i.e. those at increased risk of chemotherapy toxicities) was undertaken. ASyMS uses a touch screen mobile phone application to collect daily data about patient chemotherapy side-effects. Side-effects which exceed pre-determined limits (as assessed by underlying software algorithms) create alerts in real-time to the hospital treatment team who would log into the secure system website, review patient data and contact the patient for further assessment/clinical intervention. The application also provided tailored self-care for patients reporting side-effects alongside plotting side-effect data over time.</p><p>Content for the Australian system to be utilised by haematological cancer patients (i.e. side-effects monitored, evidence-based self-care advice and alerting algorithms) was developed following a review of the literature and extensive consultation with haematology nurses, clinicians and patients. The system was piloted and found to be highly acceptable to both patients and clinicians with feedback around content and functionality used to improve the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, it was noted that some patients required additional/ongoing support to utilise the full functionality of the remote monitoring system; to understand that system alerts were expected from patients receiving treatment and; that patients should not feel uncomfortable or guilty about triggering these alerts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Value adding to remote side-effect monitoring</title><p>It is important that Telehealth systems evolve to combine ongoing human contact (eg nurse coaching/support) with technology delivered care, rather than relying on the technology alone. This means that a remote monitoring system is only <italic>part</italic> of a structured patient intervention. A vital addition to ASyMS in the Australian system is an evidence-based nursing intervention, including patient education and coaching in self-care. Coaching patients in self-care is associated with improved patient outcomes/decreased psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and previous studies have identified that nurse-led interventions focusing on patient education and self-care coaching can improve patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>However</italic>, <italic>these study results were limited by not being able to respond to patient side</italic>-<italic>effects in real-time</italic>. Telehealth, therefore, have the potential to influence supportive care outcomes by assisting nurses to respond to a patient&#x02019;s <italic>actual</italic> symptoms with evidenced-based self-care, rather than preparing patients for <italic>potential</italic> side-effects which may never occur.</p><p>We have developed a dual intervention, the Patient Remote Intervention and Symptom Management System (PRISMS) which combines a remote monitoring system based on the ASyMS system developed by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] with an evidence-based nurse-led intervention to improve patient outcomes during chemotherapy. Ongoing monitoring and clinical response to patient alerts will, therefore, be accompanied by scheduled nurse follow-ups to ensure appropriate: usage of system functionality by patients, uptake of self-care behaviours and normalisation/reassurance that symptom alerts are expected and part of the nurses role. This intervention was previously successfully trialled in a small Phase II trial from which the methods remain largely unchanged.</p><p>This Phase III multi-site randomised controlled trial will determine the effectiveness of the PRISMS intervention to improve patient physical chemotherapy related side-effects and psychological health, alongside a cost-effectiveness analysis. This protocol describes the methods proposed in the conduct of the Phase III trial which is set within the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a multi-site, parallel group, multi-site Phase III randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants will be randomised in a stratified 1:1 allocation ratio based on factors such as cancer type to one of two arms: an intervention arm in which the participants receive the PRISMS remote symptom monitoring nurse-led intervention <italic>in addition</italic> to their Usual Care and a control arm in which they receive only Usual Care.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>Patients will be recruited from two institutions located in two capital cities of two different states of Australia.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patient inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients will be eligible to participate in the trial if they have: a confirmed diagnosis of Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); are scheduled to receive at least 2&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy; are aged 18&#x000a0;years and over; and are able to provide informed consent prior to commencing chemotherapy treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients are ineligible to participate if they: are unable to read/write/speak English sufficiently to complete study measures; are unable to complete the study measures due to a pre-existing disability; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 3 or greater; have severe cognitive or emotional issues (as assessed by the treatment team) which could limit the completion of the study measures or; are participating in a conflicting drug trial such as a non-standard or trial chemotherapy agent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention nurse selection</title><p>Senior cancer nurses from the Chemotherapy Units at both sites will be selected by Nursing Unit Managers and trained to deliver the intervention/respond to PRISMS alerts during business hours. All senior nurses in the role of Patient Service Manager at the Melbourne site will be trained to respond to PRISMS alerts after hours. At the Brisbane site no nurses will be trained to respond to after-hours alerts but rather patient alerts will be directed to the consulting haematologist to fit in with Usual Care at this site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The following recruitment processes will be tailored in consultation with staff from each site, to ensure that they comply with existing clinical procedures and systems. Data managers (DM) based at each site will identify eligible patients from the haematological outpatient and chemotherapy treatment lists, with the assistance of haematology clinicians, nurse coordinators and senior ward staff. Eligibility will be confirmed with a member of the treating team prior to approaching any patients to clarify any details from the medical records, and to ensure the team is aware of the patient&#x02019;s involvement with the study. If a patient is considered too unwell by his/her treatment team to participate in the study at the time of initial screening, the patient will be excluded from participation and will not be re-approached at a later date. No further action will be required from the treatment team.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Recruitment from clinical areas</title><p>The DM will approach eligible patients at a convenient time before or after a medical appointment. The study will be explained verbally and a copy of the Participant Information and Consent Form will be provided. Patients will be reminded that participation in the study is voluntary and given the opportunity to ask questions. They may take the information home for further consideration. People who would like to participate will be asked to sign the consent form (ie to provide written informed consent for study participation). Those who decline will be asked for verbal consent to collect basic demographic and clinical information (including age, sex, diagnosis and chemotherapy protocol) from their records to examine potential recruitment bias. Reasons for refusal will be recorded when provided and no further contact will be made with these patients.

The DM will explain the study verbally and ask for patient consent to post more information about the study to the patient (i.e. the study consent form and a postage paid return envelope) and organise a time to call the patient back to address any questions they may have. People who would like to participate will be asked to sign the consent form.

The participant will be randomised by the DM using a centralised randomisation database 1:1 to either the control or intervention groups. Participants will be stratified according to treating hospital, cancer type, treatment toxicity (high versus low as predetermined by clinical investigators based on the likelihood of patients developing febrile neutropenia during treatment) and receipt of previous chemotherapy treatment (received no previous chemotherapy versus received some form of previous chemotherapy either orally or intravenously). Minimisation will be used to balance randomisation across strata (also known as baseline adaptive allocation) &#x02013; this is a dynamic allocation process where the probability of a patient being allocated to a particular arm varies for each patient being randomised, depending on the patients who have previously been randomised in the study and their status at the stratification factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. No sequence is generated in advance, instead the randomisation database generates a set of probabilities the particular patient will be allocated to an arm, based on the above set of pre-specified rules. The minimisation process aims to allocate equal numbers of patients to each arm simultaneously over many strata. The multiple strata are combined into a score for the degree of imbalance between arms, and then the allocation is made based on a coin algorithm.</p><p>Participants randomised to the intervention arm will be scheduled for their first session with an intervention nurse for education and training in the use of the Android tablet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Patients</title><p>Baseline data will be collected prior to the first chemotherapy treatment cycle.

Checklists will be based on the nursing intervention manual as previously developed by the research team. A sub-set of recordings (20&#x000a0;%) will be listened to by 2 members of the research team and a percentage completeness figure calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Cost utility analysis (a form of cost-effectiveness analysis), measures benefits in quality- adjusted life years (QALYS). This will allow for the comparison of efficiency of patients receiving the PRISMS intervention and those receiving Usual Care in terms of cost-per-QALY gained. Analyses will be undertaken both from a broad societal perspective in addition to a health care perspective.</p><p>The incremental cost of the intervention will be compared to the incremental health outcome improvement attributed to the intervention. Results will be expressed as cost per QALY gained (i.e. the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be determined for patients receiving either the PRISMS intervention or Usual Care) within the trial period and projected beyond the trial period using appropriate economic modelling. Uncertainty in the cost and outcome data will be further evaluated via sensitivity analyses whereby key evaluation parameters (such as unit costs) are varied to assess the impact on study conclusions.</p><p>Economic measures for both benefits and costs utilised in these analyses include the EQ-5D as a utility measure of patient quality of life; the Health Services and Costs Questionnaire to determine use of health care services and medicines and; a medical record (MR) audit of both treating hospital records and any external hospital records (eg emergency admissions). More specifically, MR audits and the Health Services Usage and Costs Questionnaire will document: emergency room presentations, planned/unplanned hospital admissions, total bed days of care and reasons of hospitalisation, use of nursing/allied health resources, clinical investigations, medications prescribed (including chemotherapy and dose reductions and treatment delays), use of community health resources (eg general practitioners (GPs), allied health), use of alternative therapies, community services (eg meals on wheels); use of transport; days out of role (paid/unpaid) for both patients and carers, alongside any other costs incurred to patients/carers as a result of their cancer treatment. Data collection will cover both that paid for by the individual (before/without rebate) and also that paid for by third parties (eg rebated dollar amount by Medicare or private health insurance companies). Calculation of the cost of the PRISMS intervention itself will include only the costs of the intervention delivery (i.e. excluding development or research costs). Research team records (eg PRISMS website; data transmission costs, training time/materials) will be used to determine the cost of the intervention. Measured resource use will be valued using existing unit costs such as the National Hospital Cost Data Collection-Cost Report; Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups for inpatient health costs, Medicare Benefits Schedule for outpatient costs, Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme for pharmaceutical costs and Australian Bureau of Statistics for estimates of Australian earnings for productivity effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The study protocol has been ethically approved by institutional ethical review committees at both participating sites (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Human Research Ethics Committee and Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee for ICON Cancer Care). The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected according to the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia&#x02019;s National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. Clinical care and emergency medical services are provided by participating institutions. Data that is collected as part of the study will not be linked to any individual.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec53" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed system combines cutting edge technology with systematic evidence-based, nursing consultation. It is internationally innovative and tailored to the real-time monitoring of CTx toxicities and the provision of tailored self-care to address individual needs. Given the aging of the Australian population and the consequent expected increase in people diagnosed with cancer, it is imperative to find cost-effective strategies to improve the quality and safety of cancer care in the community whilst improving patient outcomes. These systems are most critical where CTx treatment has a high-risk of toxicity and potentially life-threatening consequences leading to unplanned hospitalisations, such as with haematological malignancies, including leukaemia and lymphoma. The development of Telehealth systems and interventions which allow for the real-time remote monitoring and management of high risk patients during treatment are, therefore, a priority.</p><sec id="Sec54"><title>Methodological rigour</title><p>This study will be the first technology-mediated nurse-led intervention study for cancer patients that meets the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria for randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and fits within the MRC framework for the analysis of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Participants will be randomly allocated by a computer after eligibility assessment and the collection of baseline data. Intervention procedures will be strictly monitored for protocol adherence. The relatively short follow-up period will minimise dropout. Reasons for attrition will be recorded, and recruitment and dropout bias assessed. Blinding of patients and providers cannot be achieved with this study design. However, outcome assessment will be by patient self-report questionnaire, obviating the need for researcher blinding. A previous shortcoming of similar research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] is the lack of knowledge of patient adherence to completing self-care behaviours when interpreting study outcomes. This system is, therefore, also unique in its ability to regularly measure patient adherence to self-care behaviours for key side-effects. Quantitative assessment of both nursing and patient intervention compliance will also be invaluable in guiding system or intervention changes needed to maximise system useability and intervention compliance for future studies.</p><p>As the intervention has been grounded in the current nursing models of patient care, alongside the development of detailed study training materials, the roll-out of the intervention to routine clinical practice following a successful Phase III trial could also be completed relatively efficaciously. The suitability of the system for both in-patient and out-patient treatment populations also makes it widely applicable to a range of chemotherapy treatment protocols.</p><p>The PRISMS intervention is innovative and tailored to the real-time monitoring of chemotherapy toxicities and the provision of tailored self-care to address individual needs. It is the first system designed to specifically monitor adult patients with haematological cancers undergoing chemotherapy. It is also the first randomised controlled trial of any Telehealth- mediated nurse-led intervention for cancer patients and builds from earlier ASyMS work and will, in tandem with the current large European (&#x0003e;1000 patients) ASyMS randomised controlled trial, add to our growing knowledge of the impact of these interventions on patient health outcomes and health system costs. Nursing interventions, combined with remote monitoring systems, such as those described in this protocol, are, therefore, likely to enable both more accurate symptom monitoring and management, combined with greater efficiency and effectiveness of nursing roles in haematology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently in the process of recruiting patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ASyMS</term><def><p>Advanced Symptom Management System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CaTS</term><def><p>Cancer Treatment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDU</term><def><p>Chemotherapy Day Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CLL</term><def><p>chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DM</term><def><p>data manager</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG</term><def><p>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol-5D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACT-G</term><def><p>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy &#x02013; General scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FU</term><def><p>follow up</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p>medical record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHL</term><def><p>non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM</term><def><p>Patient Activation Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRISMS</term><def><p>Patient Remote Intervention and Symptom Management System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality-adjusted life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p>health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSCL</term><def><p>Rotterdam Symptom Checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTx</term><def><p>chemotherapy treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>This manuscript was drafted by SB and RK based on a grant co-authored by SA, SB, DR, NS, KG, YH, NK and RM. The protocol was written by SB, SA and DR whilst PS and KG contributed to the study design and refined the protocol. KG devised the statistical analysis plan, YH devised the health economic analysis plan, whilst SB and RK wrote the ethics applications for the study. The prototype remote monitoring upon which this system was based was developed and tested by SB, SA, DR, NK and RM. The current version of the remote monitoring system was developed by SB, SA, DR, NK and RM with the assistance of Aridhia Informatics Limited. Nursing response algorithms were developed by SB, SA and DR following on from work by Ms Tracey Dryden at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Patient evidence-based self-care information contained in the system was based on that developed for previous studies by SA, PS and SB and was amended for use in this study by SB, SA and DR. Nursing training manuals and materials were developed by SB, SA, and RK and patient training materials were developed by SB and RK. Nurse training was completed by SB and RK. Clinical expertise was provided at all stages of the project by SA and DR. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This trial is financially supported by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council.
