The quality of the intubating conditions is not only determined by muscle relaxation, but also by the quality of anesthesia and the suppression of the laryngeal reflexes by the induction agents.</p><p>Thus, it has been suggested that the choice of induction agent may influence the rate of onset of satisfactory intubating conditions . Propofol is known to depress laryngeal reflexes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and may therefore be a more appropriate induction agent when rocuronium bromide is used for neuro-muscular blockade (NMB).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Rocuronium (ORG-9426) a new non-depolarizing amino steroidal NMB is chemically 2-morpholino, 3-desacetyl, 16-N-allyl pyrrolidino derivative of vecuronium, differing from it at three positions on steroid nucleus. It has a low potency and intermediate duration of action. It has a rapid onset of action and more importantly rapid development of good intubating conditions at standard intubating dose. Rocuronium is about six times less potent than vecuronium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Rocuronium has an intermediate time course of action and is free of clinically significant cardiovascular side effects at effective NMB doses. It has further been shown that neither accumulation, nor production of active metabolites occurs after repeated administration of rocuronium. The rocuronium has flexibility in dosage for onset time and clinical duration. These properties together render rocuronium a flexible NMB, suitable for routine intubation as well as for intubation during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia. Uses of opioid during induction obtund the upper airway reflexes and give better clinically acceptable intubating conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Generally, propofol and thiopentone are commonly used for induction of anesthesia and succinylcholine or vecuronium is used as NMB for endotracheal intubation. Thus, we designed this study to use rocuronium 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for endotracheal intubation at 60 seconds in adult patients induced with either propofol or thiopentone and evaluated intubating conditions and degree of neuromuscular paralysis at adductor pollicis muscle using TOFR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After informed consent and approval from Hospital ethics committee, 60 patients of ASA physical status I-II of both sex and age group18-50 years were selected. The patients underwent elective surgical procedures of moderate duration. Exclusion criteria included patients with difficult airway, receiving drugs altering neuro-muscular function or affecting metabolism of NMB drugs, myopathies, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes mellitus or hepato-renal disease and pregnancy. All patients underwent pre-anesthetic evaluation as per protocol.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 each on the basis of induction agent. The PR group patients administered propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> i.v and rocuronium 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The TR group patients administered thiopentone 5 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and rocuronium 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>Preoperatively, the patient's vitals were recorded and intravenous infusion with Ringer's lactate solution started in the left upper limb. The peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) was attached over the right ulnar nerve using silver surface electrodes and transducer was fixed on the thumb.</p><p>In all patients HR, noninvasive BP, oxygen saturation, ECG and end tidal carbon-dioxide were monitored. All the patients were premedicated 15 min before induction with midazolam 0.03 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>; ondansetron 0.1 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>and tramadol 2 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> intravenously. After pre-oxygenation with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3-5 min, patient was induced with propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> i.v (in the PR group) or thiopentone 5 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> i.v (in the TR group). Immediately after induction of anesthesia, rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was administered over 5 s. One anesthesiologist (intubator) performed all the intubations. Intubation was attempted at 60 s from the end of the administration of rocuronium. The intubating conditions were evaluated using the grading scheme as described by Dobson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grading of laryngoscopy and intubating conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-27-215-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Excellent and good intubating conditions were considered as clinically acceptable (CA) and poor and impossible intubating conditions as clinically non-acceptable (CNA) as described by Viby-Mogensen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. In case of failure to intubate, second attempt was taken after 30 s and intubating conditions were assessed again. Degree of paralysis in adductor pollicis was measured using TOFR at the time of intubation by an assistant. Patients requiring more than two attempts were considered as failure. Anesthesia was maintained with halothane 0.5-1.0% and N<sub>2</sub>O in oxygen (5:3). At the end of the surgery, reversal of neuromuscular blockade was achieved with neostigmine 0.04 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> titrated according to response and the trachea extubated after ensuring full recovery of the patient.</p><p>The results were analyzed with the help of a biostatician.

Rocuronium is considered better agent for endotracheal intubation among non-depolarizing NMB. The choice of induction agent may influence the rate of onset of satisfactory intubating conditions .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Propofol is known to depress laryngeal reflexes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and may therefore be a more appropriate induction agent than thiopentone sodium when rocuronium bromide is used as a NMB.</p><p>The age, sex distribution and body weights were nearly similar in both the groups and the difference was not statically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The high proportion of females in both the groups was due to the inclusion of patients undergoing gynecological surgery and cholecystectomy.</p><p>We did not use opioid like fentanyl, sufentanil, alfentanil, or remifentanil as in other studies, as the use of opioid during induction of anesthesia depress upper airway reflexes and gives better clinically acceptable intubating conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] which may have influenced the result of the study.</p><p>When the overall intubating conditions were compared, both groups were found to be satisfactory, and the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

In the PR group, 36.67% patients were rated as having a good intubating score, which are more than in the TR group (26.67% patients). The incidence of poor intubating condition is same (13.33%) in both groups. The 3 out of 30 (10%) patients in the PR group were placed in the impossible grade on first attempt as vocal cords were closed at 60 s but these patients were intubated at second attempt at 90 s and placed in good intubating conditions.

They concluded that no significant difference exists in intubating conditions at 60 s after injection of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in patients induced with either propofol or thiopentone. Dobson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] found in their study that at 60 s after being anesthetized with propofol and rocuronium 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 7 out of 12 (58.33%) patients rated as excellent and 4 out of 12 (33.33%) patients as good, and with thiopentone and rocuronium, 6 out of 12 (50%) patients rated as excellent and 1 out of 12 (8.33%) patients as good.</p><p>TOFR was measured at the time of intubation by an assistant who assessed the degree of paralysis of the adductor pollicis and correlated it with intubating conditions. The overall the degree of paralysis of adductor pollicis (determined by TOFR) in excellent intubating condition was better in the PR group (31.8 &#x000b1; 17.9%) as compared with the TR group (41.2 &#x000b1; 28.3%).

Bowman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] suggested that the low potency of rocuronium results in a higher molecular load being present at the neuromuscular junction, producing an initial high concentration gradient. Another possible reason could be the more rapid action of rocuronium at vocal cord than at the adductor pollicis muscle.</p><p>Dubois <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] confirmed these findings in clinical practice and demonstrated that when using rocuronium, good to excellent intubating conditions are achieved before 100% block is obtained, i.e. faster than onset time. Paralysis occurs first in the well-perfused fast muscles and last in the diaphragm. At the adductor muscles of the larynx, the onset of block is faster but less intense, than is the case for the adductor pollicis muscle. As the rocuronium bromide induced neuromuscular block develops faster, though less deeply, at the larynx adductor muscles than at the adductor pollicis muscle, it appears that intubation may be performed before complete block is achieved as measured at the thumb.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>We concluded that the completed block of the adductor pollicis muscle is not required for the provision of good intubating conditions. The clinical intubating conditions after rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in adults anaesthetized with propofol or thiopentone sodium are same, in view of clinical intubating
