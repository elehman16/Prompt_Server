This condition is called cyclic mastalgia and is often associated with premenstrual syndrome. Among women, the reported prevalence of mastalgia ranges from 41 to 79%, and the most common type is associated with menstruation. Cyclic mastalgia typically occurs monthly before the beginning of the menstrual period, is of mild severity, and is relieved within 7 days of the onset of menses. Spontaneous remission often occurs, but many women experience cyclic mastalgia for years, often with increasing severity until menopause. In some women, this pain interferes with activity, relationships, and quality of life. Cyclic mastalgia interferes with sexual activity (48%), Physical and social activities (21%), and employment or education (8%).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Cyclical mastalgia may be associated with excessive use of mammograms with unnecessary, ineffective, or undesirable self-medication. When the lumps become significant enough to be called cysts, the condition is called fibrocystic breast disease. Besides discomfort, perhaps the worst problem of this condition is that it can mimic the appearance of breast cancer on mammograms, leading to false alarms. To make matters worse, fibrocystic changes can also hide true cancers, and some evidence hints that women with fibrocystic breast disease may also have a greater tendency toward breast cancer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The main etiologies of cyclic mastalgia remain unknown. However, various physiological conditions, inflammatory processes, and even underlying psychological disturbances have been postulated in affected patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Among pathophysiological aspects, increased water retention in breast and ductal ectasia have been suggested to be the causes in these patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Also, regarding the role of inflammatory mechanisms, increased level of some inflammatory biomarkers such as some interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b1;) and tissue necrotizing factor (TNF-&#x003b1;) has been reported following the appearance of cyclic mastalgia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Recently, perceived stress and anxiety has been found to be associated with cyclic mastalgia. Cyclic mastalgia is one of the major causes of breast pain for women visiting primary care clinics.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Due to the multifactorial features of this phenomenon, its management using single drug regimens seems not to be proper.</p><p>Recent attempts have been focused on employing chemical and natural supplemental agents for treatment of cyclic mastalgia. Among synthetic agents, the potential effects of some drugs such as Danazol as a gonadotrophin release inhibitor,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Bromocriptine as a dopamine agonist,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Tamoxifen as an anti-estrogen,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Goserline as a, luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) analog [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have been examined and their benefits have been proved. However, the low response rate along with their serious side effects have limited their prescription and continued usage. In order to overcome these limitations, some approaches have started using agents of natural origin.</p><p>Evening primrose (<italic>Oenothera biennis</italic>) is a North American wild flower that has escaped cultivation and is a precursor of prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, which is one of the anti-inflammatory prostaglandins.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Because of the underlying abnormal metabolism of fatty acids in cyclic mastalgia and as this oil is rich in essential fatty acids, the use of this agent has been also considered as a first-line treatment for cyclic mastalgia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Recently, it has been recommended to add an antioxidant agent or co-factors in the proposed metabolic pathway for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of other drugs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In fact, these agents may be considered as safe alternatives to hormonal therapies or may be used in combination with hormonal drugs as they result in lesser drug-related side effects. Even these co-factor supplements may be employed for treatment of cyclic mastalgia. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of two types of vitamin supplements (vitamin E and vitamin B6) in improving pain severity in cyclic mastalgia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>In this randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, Trial registration code of project was IRCT201106266888N1 80 patients of reproductive age who were suffering from cyclic mastalgia and referred to the medical and health centers in Hamadan city were included. They were randomly allocated into two groups. The main inclusion criteria were: Diagnosis of cyclic mastalgia, no previous history of breast malignancies, and not having consumed other vitamin supplements within 2 months of the study period. The main exclusion criteria included allergy to drug, pregnancy, and unwillingness to continue in the research.</p><p>Study design was approved by the ethics committee of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. On admission to clinic, all relevant information was collected by interviewing, including demographic characteristics, marital state, occupation, educational level, characteristics related to cyclic mastalgia such as its time and duration, characteristics related to menstrual cycles, results of diagnostic interventions (breast sonography and mammography), and also, previous history of psychological disorders including depression or anxiety. Cyclical mastalgia was defined as a bilateral painful breast swelling lasting for &#x0003e;4 days and up to 3 weeks, premenstrually and always preceding menses, and subsiding progressively during menstruation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] After initial evaluation, patients with cyclic mastalgia were randomly assigned to receive 200 IU vitamin E daily or 40 mg/day vitamin B6 for 2 months. Severity of cyclic mastalgia was determined by the Cardiff breast pain score during one cycle before and two cycles after the intervention. Cardiff breast pain score was finally classified as one of the following levels: None, mild, moderate, or severe breast pain. Cyclical mastalgia characterized by a swelling and minor discomfort lasting 1&#x02013;4 days premenstrually is considered mild and the symptoms lasting for 5&#x02013;14 days or more every month is considered moderate to severe.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The Cardiff breast pain chart has been utilized and it is a daily chart for monitoring breast pain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cardiff breast pain chart (daily chart of breast pain)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-723-g001"/></fig><p>Results were reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) for the quantitative variables and percentages for the categorical variables.

Trend of changes in pain severity score within the study period (during one menstrual cycle before and two menstrual cycles after the intervention) was examined by repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The change in pain severity score was also examined by multivariate regression analysis to examine the treatment efficacy of the treatment protocols, with the baseline variables considered as probable potential confounders. <italic>P</italic> values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the two groups treated with vitamin E and vitamin B6 were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics including age, age of marriage, socioeconomic level, body mass index, marital status, as well as the number of parity and menstrual regularity. Also, family history of breast cancer, exercise activity, and history of anxiety were similar between both groups. However, breastfeeding was reported to be more in the group treated with vitamin E and the mean age of menarche was also lower in this group compared with vitamin B6 group. Also, the prevalence of some underling comorbidities including premenstrual syndrome, pelvic pain, and history of depression was higher in the latter group. There was no significant difference in the mean of severity of cyclic mastalgia during one menstrual cycle before the intervention between the vitamin E and B6 groups (9.1 &#x000b1; 2.1 and 8.4 &#x000b1; 3.1, respectively), but the difference was significant in the two groups during the first cycle (5.1 &#x000b1; 1.6 and 5.2 &#x000b1; 2.5, respectively) and the second menstrual cycle (2.3 &#x000b1; 1.0 and 2.6 &#x000b1; 2.0, respectively) after the intervention.

Recently, direct attention has been paid toward using vitamins to facilitate pain relief in these patients. It has been suggested that use of adequate levels of vitamins as co-factors in the proposed metabolic pathways involving this complaint may be fully beneficial.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although some controlled trials could demonstrate the effects of vitamins in relieving cyclical mastalgia pain, some others failed to support the efficacy. Thus, previous studies gave questionable results with conflicting evidence.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In a similar randomized trial of Iranian women suffering from mastalgia, administration of 200 mg twice daily could effectively reduce pain severity both 2 and 4 months after treatment, compared with the placebo group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In another trial, daily doses of 1200 IU vitamin E alone or in combination with evening primrose oil taken for 6 months decreased the severity of cyclical mastalgia.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Also, a study similar to the present trial was conducted in the United Kingdom by Goyal and Mansel, who used a combination treatment arm of antioxidants and minerals which included beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin B6, zinc, niacin, and selenium in a coconut oil base and essential fatty acids. The investigators obtained equivocal results in the reduction of breast pain symptoms.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Three clinical trials have been performed, and all have shown vitamin E to be no better than placebo in the treatment of benign breast disease. In the first trial, 50 patients were asked whether their breast pain was better, worse, or unchanged after 2&#x02013;3 months of therapy. In each group, 40% reported improvement.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The second trial did not assess breast pain, but found no reduction in nodularity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The third trial found no reduction in nodularity or mammographic density, and although a larger proportion of women in the vitamin E group reported reduction in breast tenderness, this was statistically not significant.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Contrarily, some studies could not find beneficial effects of supplemental vitamins on mastalgia, probably because of small sample size or inappropriate nature of the study designs including ignoring adequate inclusion criteria or incorrect adjusting for confounders.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In uncontrolled studies, vitamin B6 has been used to treat cyclical mastalgia with mixed results. A small (<italic>n</italic> = 42), double-blinded, controlled study found that vitamin B6 did not significantly reduce cyclical mastalgia at a dose of 200 mg daily, as compared with a placebo.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Considering the key role of oxidation and inflammation processes in the appearance and expansion of cyclical mastalgia, it is believed that the use of vitamin supplements, especially of our studied vitamins, can successfully decrease the pain severity related to this phenomenon. However, it seems that the dosages of vitamins, duration of administration, as well as using them concurrently with other standard therapeutic regimens can all potentially influence the clinical results of these regimens, and thus, examining different regimens containing these vitamins in different doses and durations should be considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Both regimens containing vitamin E and vitamin B6 can similarly reduce breast pain severity in cyclic mastalgia.
