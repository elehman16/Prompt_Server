To evaluate the cardiac safety of luseogliflozin, a thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in healthy Japanese subjects. The effects of moxifloxacin on QT prolongation in Japanese subjects were also evaluated. In this double-blind, placebo- and open-label positive-controlled, 4-way crossover study, 28 male and 28 female subjects received a single dose of luseogliflozin 5 mg (therapeutic dose), luseogliflozin 20 mg (supratherapeutic dose), placebo, and moxifloxacin 400 mg. Serial triplicate digital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded before and after dosing, and results were analyzed using the Fridericia correction (QTcF) method. Serial blood sampling was performed for pharmacokinetic analyses of luseogliflozin and moxifloxacin to analyze the relationship between QTcF interval and plasma concentration. The upper limits of the two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for baseline and placebo-adjusted QTcF intervals (&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF) in the 5 mg and 20 mg luseogliflozin groups were less than 10 ms at all time points. No correlation between plasma luseogliflozin concentrations and &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF was observed. In the moxifloxacin group, the lower limits of the two-sided 90% CIs for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF were greater than 5 ms at all time points. A positive relationship was observed between plasma moxifloxacin concentration and change in &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF. Luseogliflozin was well tolerated at both dose levels. The majority of adverse events were mild in severity, and no serious or life-threatening adverse events occurred. Neither therapeutic (5 mg) nor supratherapeutic (20 mg) doses of luseogliflozin affected QT prolongation in healthy Japanese subjects.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

Luseogliflozin specifically inhibits the activity of SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule and shows hypoglycemic effects based on promotion of urinary glucose excretion in various animal models [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The action of luseogliflozin is postulated to normalize hyperglycemia by stimulating excretion of glucose from blood into urine via inhibition of the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the renal proximal tubule. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are insulin independent, making them an attractive new therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several SGLT2 inhibitors have already appeared on the market, and others are under the development. Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in most [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In clinical studies, a single dose of luseogliflozin (1&#x02013;25 mg) was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum plasma concentration [T<sub>max</sub>] &#x02264; 2.25 hours), maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) were dose proportional, and half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) ranged from 9.2 to 14 h. None of the major pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and T<sub>1/2</sub>) were affected by feeding. Additionally, PK parameters were not affected after multiple doses of luseogliflozin (5 or 10 mg/day), indicating no clinically significant accumulation. In these studies, no serious adverse events were observed. All adverse drug reactions were transient and mild in severity in healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, PK parameters were similar to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacodynamic activity as measured by urinary glucose excretion was significantly increased in all luseogliflozin treatment groups (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/day) in comparison to placebo, and cumulative urinary glucose excretion for the 24-h period after dosing was dose dependent. Additionally, significant hypoglycemic activity persisted from dosing before breakfast until after supper on Day 7 [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In non-clinical studies, effects of luseogliflozin on the cardiovascular system were investigated via the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) current in hERG-transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) <italic>in vitro</italic>; action potential in the papillary muscle of anesthetized guinea pigs; and blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in conscious beagle dogs. A slight suppression of hERG current (7.7%) <italic>in vitro</italic> was observed at 9.6 &#x003bc;mol/L, a concentration that was approximately 370 times greater than the maximum observed C<sub>max</sub> of a 5 mg dose in diabetic subjects in a clinical study. No effect on the cardiovascular system was observed in guinea pigs or dogs.</p><p>Establishing the cardiac safety of new drugs is critically important, particularly for drugs used to treat diabetes, because patients with type 2 diabetes have increased risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and several antidiabetic agents have the potential for QT prolongation. [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] To evaluate the cardiac safety of therapeutic (5 mg) and supratherapeutic (20 mg) doses of luseogliflozin, a thorough QT/QTc study based on the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was conducted in healthy Japanese subjects at a single clinical site in Japan.

The study was conducted at Kitasato Institute Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) from July 6<sup>th</sup> 2011 to September 15<sup>th</sup> 2011. Eligible subjects received a single dose of luseogliflozin 5 mg, luseogliflozin 20 mg, placebo, and moxifloxacin 400 mg (positive control; Avelox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tablets 400mg; manufactured by Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd.) with a minimum 7-day interim washout period after each dose period. All treatments were administered with 200 mL of water after at least 10-hour overnight fast, and no food was allowed until 4 hours after dosing. All treatments were administered in a randomized sequence. The random assignment manager randomly assigned treatment groups using the Williams Design to determine the order of treatments within each treatment sequence by the time of study drug administration to the first admission group. A randomization code was created for each treatment sequence sealed and securely retained until unblinding and were provided to the sponsor after unblinding.</p><p>Prior to the initial review by the IRB, amendments were made in the protocol including changes in the volume of blood and number of blood sampling for pharmacokinetics and changes in wordings for clarification; the protocol was revised from Version 1 to Version 2.

The same model of 12-lead digital surface ECG monitor was employed for all subjects at all time points. The same lead was used throughout the study. The interval between the start of each recording was &#x02265;1 min, and ECG was recorded for 10 s for each chart. All 12-lead ECG charts for QT/QTc analysis were sent electronically to the central ECG analysis facility. RR and QT intervals were measured in accordance with the procedures of the facility. The time of recording and subject identification information were blinded before measurement. QTc intervals were corrected by Fridericia&#x02019;s (QTcF = QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>) and Bazett&#x02019;s (QTcB = QT/RR<sup>1/2</sup>) formulae.

Blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h post-dose in each study period. If blood collection coincided with 12-lead ECG recording, blood was collected after ECG recording. To measure unchanged luseogliflozin and its metabolites or moxifloxacin, 5 mL or 7mL blood samples were collected into tubes containing sodium heparin, respectively. Whole blood was centrifuged immediately after collection at the site (4&#x000b0;C, 3000 rpm, 15 min) to obtain plasma samples, which were stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis. The plasma concentrations of luseogliflozin and its metabolites were determined by two separate methods at JCL Bioassay Corp. (Hyogo, Japan). Luseogliflozin, its metabolites and its deuterium-labeled internal standard (luseogliflozin-d5, M2-d5 and M17-d5, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan) were extracted from plasma by solid phase extraction. Extracts were analysed by LC-MS/MS. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for luseogliflozin and its metabolites (M2 and M17) in plasma were 0.05 and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. The plasma concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma were determined at Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). Moxifloxacin and internal standard (moxifloxacin-d4, Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Canada) were extracted from plasma by protein precipitation. Extracts were analysed by LC-MS/MS. The LLOQ for moxifloxacin was 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL. The pharmacokinetic parameters, including C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and AUC<sub>inf</sub>, were derived by noncompartmental analysis based on the plasma concentrations of unchanged luseogliflozin and its metabolites (M2 and M17) and unchanged moxifloxacin.

The effect of luseogliflozin on QT/QTc interval prolongation was regarded as negative when the upper bound of the 90% two-sided confidence interval (CI) for the mean effect on the QT/QTc interval exceeded 10 ms at all time points in the luseogliflozin groups [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A categorical analysis was also performed.

All events were mild in severity, requiring no treatment or action, and most of them were transient fluctuations observed only at 24 h after dosing. As cardiovascular adverse events, one subject in the 5 mg luseogliflozin group experienced first-degree atrioventricular block, and one subject each in the 5 mg and 20 mg luseogliflozin groups and 23 in the 400 mg moxifloxacin group experienced electrocardiogram QT prolongation. First-degree atrioventricular block was identified as the expression of prolonged PR interval to 452 ms at 48 h after administration of luseogliflozin 5 mg. This event was mild in severity and required no action or treatment; however, the subject was withdrawn from the study.</p><p>All cardiovascular adverse events reported following administration of luseogliflozin were assessed as not related to the study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although a decrease in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases is expected during the treatment of diabetes, drug therapies do not always decrease the morbidity of cardiovascular diseases, and some therapies increase the risk of these diseases. Some commonly used drugs have QT prolonging effects, which may consequently cause lethal arrhythmia. In addition, some diabetes drugs may also have potential QT prolonging effects [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139873.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, cardiac safety evaluation is particularly important for diabetes drugs. Currently, new drug development requires examination of proarrhythmic effects via thorough QT (TQT) investigation for almost all drugs. Despite lagging behind the USA and EU, Japan fully adopted the ICH E14 guidelines in 2010 and has begun to conduct TQT studies. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first placebo- and positive-controlled thorough QT/QTc study of an oral hypoglycemic agent performed in Japan. In this study, a supratherapeutic dose of luseoflozin (20 mg) was used at four times the clinical dose (5 mg) [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139873.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139873.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The data obtained to date have confirmed that pharmacokinetic changes in this drug are small in elderly people [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as people with renal [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and hepatic disorders, and that this drug has no interaction with other oral hypoglycemic agents or diuretics [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; we believe that the supratherapeutic dose used in this study can fully encompass the maximum exposure expected in the clinical use. Moxifloxacin 400 mg, which has been used in many reports, served as a positive control [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139873.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the ICH E14 guidelines state that ethnic factors are not expected to have an impact on the results of QT/QTc studies, the question remains as to whether specific ethnic studies are required to assess cardiac safety in Japanese subjects. For example, the QT prolonging effects of quinidine were observed to differ between Koreans and Caucasians [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the QT prolonging effects of norfloxacin demonstrated a slight difference between Japanese and Caucasians [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, whether moxifloxacin hydrochloride can be used as a positive control for TQT studies in Japanese subjects was one of our interests in this study.</p><p>The upper bound of the 90% two-sided CI for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF was below 10 ms at all time points for both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of luseogliflozin, while the lower bound of the 90% two-sided CI for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF of moxifloxacin was greater than 0 ms at all time points. These findings indicate that luseogliflozin does not affect QT prolongation in a clinical setting within the limits of assay sensitivity. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses also revealed no relationship between plasma concentration of luseogliflozin and changes in QT interval. This observation indicates that luseogliflozin did not demonstrate a significant proarrhythmic effect.</p><p>When conducting TQT studies, ICH E14 guidance recommends using a positive control group to establish assay sensitivity. The positive control should have an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval of approximately 5 ms. Detecting the effect of the positive control on QT/QTc interval is important in terms of assuring the ability of the study to detect such an effect of the study drug. Japan has less experience in TQT studies, prompting some discussion concerning an appropriate positive control in Japanese subjects; in this study, we used moxifloxacin 400 mg, which had been previously reported as a positive control. We found that the effect of moxifloxacin on QT/QTc interval was sufficiently high in Japanese healthy subjects. The lower limit of the two-sided 90% CIs of the baseline adjusted and placebo adjusted mean QTcF (&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF) was more than 5 ms at all time points. The least squares mean &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF values for moxifloxacin ranged from 7.7 ms (24 h post-dose) to 13.4 ms (3 and 4 hour post-dose). Generally, QT interval-prolonging effects of moxifloxacin are supposed to relate linearly to serum concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0139873.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; in this study, however, counterclockwise hysteresis was observed in this relationship, which could be a reflection of differences in ethnicity. However, as the hysteresis loop was small and a linear correlation was also observed, the hysteresis effects may be attributed to factors such as the timing of measurements, method of measurement, and variability.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, the sufficient number of cases to demonstrate assay sensitivity associated with moxifloxacin is much smaller than that which has been commonly adopted. If the same design was used, the number of subjects could be reduced in a study in Japan, which requires further accumulation of data.</p><p>The limitation of a thorough QT/QTc study is to predict the frequency of rare cardiovascular events such as arrhythmia with mean change of QT/QTc interval which is recognized as imperfect biomarker for the potential occurrence of drug-induced TdP. Therefore prolongation of a QTc interval is not directly associated with cardiovascular events. The adverse events that occurred in this study were all transient and mild with no findings associated with safety problems. One subject withdrew from the study due to a first-degree atrioventricular block. This event was determined to be unrelated to the study drug because it developed 48 hours after administration, thus there was no temporal relationship between the event and the dose, considering the pharmacokinetic profile of luseogliflozin and its metabolites.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Summary</title><p>The design of this thorough QT study, whose population is healthy Japanese subjects, is typical based on ICH E14 guidance. This study suggests that luseogliflozin carries no concerns for possible QT prolonging effects and demonstrates that moxifloxacin can be used as a positive control in Japanese thorough QT studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single dose of luseogliflozin 5 mg or 20 mg was safe and well tolerated in Japanese healthy male and female subjects. This study was established as a negative thorough QT/QTc study based on the development of rigorous assay sensitivity, as well as observation of moxifloxacin activity. No arrhythmogenic effects of either therapeutic (5 mg) or supratherapeutic (20 mg) doses of luseogliflozin were observed in healthy Japanese subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0139873.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0139873.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0139873.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Luseogliflozin TQT study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0139873.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Assays for plasma concentrations of luseogliflozin were performed by JCL Bioassay Corporation, Hyogo, Japan.
