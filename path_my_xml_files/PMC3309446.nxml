These ideas are supported by some medical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>] which have found a connection between the lunar phase and certain medical phenomena.</p><p>10.5% of the German population believe in lunar effects on man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. In addition, an increasing number of books, guides and astrological tables recommend a lifestyle according to the moon and therefore advise certain days to see the hairdresser (in order to obtain good hair), mow the lawn (for thicker grass) or even see the doctor for a special procedure (to prevent complications). In a survey conducted at our hospital, 21.3% of our in-hospital patients own a moon calendar and schedule their appointments, whether it is the hairdresser or an operation, depending on lunar cycles. As a result we increasingly see patients with distinct, moon-dependent ideas about their surgery date. This can sometimes lead to rearrangements on the operating schedule at short notice and decline of workload on specific days as well as dissatisfaction of the patient if a certain date is unavailable.</p><p>Previously published studies investigating lunar effects examined if certain medical phenomena, e.g. myocardial infarction, accumulate on specific days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>] or considered several surgical procedures at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. So far there is no such study evaluating possible effects of the lunar cycle on perioperative complications in a <italic>single</italic> standardized procedure. Because total hip arthroplasty is one of our major procedures which can be timed by the patient, the present retrospective study investigated the association of the lunar cycle and total hip arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0006"><title>Material and methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective study with 305 patients being provided with a primary total hip arthroplasty. Patients with a prior arthroplasty, no matter which joint, were excluded. Subjects were 19 to 91 years of age (mean 62.61 &#x000b1;13.97 years) and mainly women (<italic>n</italic> = 168 or 55.1%). The operations were all performed by 4 senior physicians who were the chief or a member of the arthroplasty department at the time of surgery. Moon illumination was scaled into 4 periods: full moon, new moon, waxing moon and waning moon.</p><p>To identify possible influences of the lunar cycle on perioperative complications, we investigated data collected during the patients&#x02019; stay in the hospital and allocated them to moon illumination. The following data were acquired: duration of surgery, loss of haemoglobin, temperature profile, differences in preoperative and postoperative leukocytes and C-reactive protein. Time spent in hospital postoperatively was also included. The technical value of the arthroplasty was included by measuring the varus/valgus-angle.</p><p>For statistical analysis, Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used. A <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S0007"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-one operations (20%) were performed during full moon, 80 (26.2%) during new moon, 77 (25.2%) during decreasing moon and 87 (28.5%) during increasing moon. The mean age and gender did not differ significantly in the 4 groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The mean operation length was 103.62 min (SD 32.05 min) during full moon, 103.91 min (SD 33.56 min) during decreasing moon, 106.16 min (SD 29.44 min) during new moon and 99.2 min (SD 29.96 min) during increasing moon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The mean loss of haemoglobin was 2.77 g/dl (SD 1.47 g/dl) in full moon, 2.28 g/dl (SD 1.29 g/dl) in decreasing moon, 2.4 g/dl (SD 1.65 g/dl) during increasing moon and 2.4 g/dl (SD 1.49 g/dl) during new moon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Eighty patients received erythrocyte concentrates postoperatively, but these were distributed equally over the moon phases. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> for white blood cell (WBC) differences in the four groups. A total of 25 major complications such as leg length discrepancy (15), femur fracture (6), pulmonary embolism (2), lesion of the sciatic nerve (1) and lesion of the obturator nerve (1) were found. The mean varus/valgus angle was 0.28&#x000b0; (SD 1.05&#x000b0;) varus during full moon, 0.13&#x000b0; (SD 1.17&#x000b0;) varus during decreasing moon, 0&#x000b0; (SD 1.04&#x000b0;) varus/valgus during new moon and 0.17&#x000b0; (SD 1.07&#x000b0;) varus during increasing moon.

There are several studies which have found an association between moon phase and crime, myocardial infarction, delivery and general practice consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>].

Because 21.3% of our in-hospital patients strongly believe in lunar influences and often demand specific surgery dates dependent on the lunar cycle, we conducted this study. As far as we know, there are no studies evaluating possible effects of the lunar cycle on perioperative complications in a <italic>single</italic> standardized procedure. Because total hip arthroplasty is one of our major procedures which in addition can be scheduled by the patient, the present retrospective study investigated the association of the lunar cycle and total hip arthroplasty.</p><p>We evaluated data of 305 patients which were collected pre-, intra- and postoperatively and allocated them to the 4 lunar phases: full moon, new moon, waxing moon and waning moon. None of the collected parameters differed significantly from the other (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In addition, we only observed 25 major complications such as leg length discrepancy (15), femur fracture (6), pulmonary embolism (2), lesion of the sciatic nerve (1) and lesion of the obturator nerve (1). The number of minor complications was even smaller. None of them differed significantly among the 4 groups.</p><p>The results of our study are in agreement with other recently published studies investigating the effect of lunar phase on outcome for patients after operations. Outcome of breast cancer patients was not different when the timing of breast cancer surgery during the lunar cycle was considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. In a survey concerning postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) an unexpected high number of participants stressed the impact of environmental factors, e.g., weather or lunar phase. However, in 2488 patients who were followed up for 24 h postoperatively the days with a high or low incidence of PONV were equally distributed within the four phases of the moon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. Others observed no correlation of lunar phases with acute coronary events leading to myocardial infarction or sudden death in 1240 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. At the University of Graz, Austria, nearly 15 000 consecutive inpatients with surgical procedures including abdominal, vascular, cardiac, thoracic, plastic and orthopaedic operations showed no relationship between perioperative mortality and lunar phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].</p><p>Our analysis demonstrated no predictable influence of the lunar phase on perioperative complications. Although this was not a prospective randomized trial, the statistical magnitude of the results does not support any recommendations for scheduling patients for total hip arthroplasty at any particular day of the lunar phase.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eisenburger</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Vergeiner</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Lunar phases are not related to the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death</article-title><source>Resuscitation</source><year>2003</year><volume>56</volume><fpage>187</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12589993</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sha</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>NT</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>XH</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>LP</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lunar phases, myocardial infarction and hemorrheological character.
