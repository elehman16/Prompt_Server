The aim of this study was to determine the impact of long-term treatment with neuroleptic agents upon global cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Design: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel two-group treatment discontinuation trial.</p><p>Setting: Oxfordshire, Newcastle and Gateshead, London and Edinburgh, United Kingdom.</p><p>Participants: Patients currently prescribed the neuroleptics thioridazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol trifluoperazine or risperidone for behavioural or psychiatric disturbance in dementia for at least 3 mo.</p><p>Interventions: Continue neuroleptic treatment for 12 mo or switch to an identical placebo.</p><p>Outcome measures: Primary outcome was total Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) score. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).</p><p>Results: 165 patients were randomised (83 to continue treatment and 82 to placebo, i.e., discontinue treatment), of whom 128 (78&#x00025;) commenced treatment (64 continue/64 placebo). Of those, 26 were lost to follow-up (13 per arm), resulting in 51 patients per arm analysed for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups in the estimated mean change in SIB scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring placebo) &#x02212;0.4 (95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; &#x02212;6.4 to 5.5), adjusted for baseline value (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.9). For neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 56 and 53, respectively) in the estimated mean change in NPI scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring continue treatment) &#x02212;2.4 (95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;8.2 to 3.5), adjusted for baseline value (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.4).

The risk of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, increases sharply with age: Alzheimer's Disease International estimates that 1.4&#x00025; of people 65&#x02013;69 have dementia, whereas almost a full quarter of those over the age of 85 years are affected. Almost all older dementia patients will experience, along with the cognitive and functional decline typical of the illness, some neuropsychiatric symptoms. These symptoms can include agitation, aggression, and psychosis, and are often devastating for the older patient and his or her family and caregiver. Managing these symptoms is often a prime concern for health-care providers and families. Neuroleptics (sometimes called antipsychotics) are the class of drugs often used to manage or control neuropsychiatric problems, but there have been questions about their safety and appropriateness. Safety concerns involve risk of stroke, parkinsonism, sedation, edema, and chest infections but also include a worsening of cognitive decline with prolonged use of neuroleptics.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was the Study Done?</title><p>Previous studies on the effectiveness and safety of neuroleptics in older people have been short term. Ballard and colleagues wanted to study over a longer period of time the impact of neuroleptic drugs on elderly patients with dementia. Specifically, they wanted to know if being on a neuroleptic was associated with more cognitive decline than coming off the drug. They also wanted to investigate whether discontinuing the drug exacerbated any neuropsychiatric symptoms, Parkinson disease-like symptoms, or other functional, language, and cognition difficulties frequently associated with dementia.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers recruited older patients with Alzheimer disease from across England who had been on neuroleptics for at least three months. They randomised patients to one of two groups: the first group continued taking the same neuroleptic at the same dosage level while the second group was switched to an identical-looking placebo. The researchers assessed the patients' cognitive status and neuropsychiatric symptoms upon their entry into the study. Six and 12 months later the researchers assessed any cognitive decline and the level of neuropsychiatric and other problems that patients were experiencing.</p><p>At both 6 and 12 months, the researchers found that there were no differences between the two groups (continued treatment and placebo) in terms of cognitive decline. The placebo group may have had less cognitive decline, but this was not statistically significant. They also found no overall differences between the two groups in the change in the number of neuropsychiatric symptoms over these time periods. Patients with severe neuropsychiatric problems at the outset of the trial did better on continued neuroleptic therapy, but this advantage was not statistically significant. There was a significant decline on the verbal fluency language tests among the patients who continued on their neuroleptic.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do these Findings Mean?</title><p>The researchers report perhaps the first trial of this duration on continued versus withdrawn neuroleptic treatment among older dementia patients. The findings do not indicate any benefit of continuing neuroleptic therapies in older patients on either cognitive or neuropsychiatric outcomes. The researchers conclude that neuroleptics, with their known safety issues, should not be used as first-line treatment to manage problems such as agitation or aggression. For older dementia patients whose neuropsychiatric symptoms are not remedied by nonpharmaceutical treatments, the researchers advise caution. More studies are urgently needed to find better solutions to help older patients with dementia who have agitation, aggression, and psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050076">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050076</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alz.co.uk/">Alzheimer's Disease International</ext-link> is an umbrella organisation of organisations worldwide</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alzheimers-research.org.uk/">Alzheimer's Research Trust</ext-link> in the UK is a charity funding research to cure or prevent dementias</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institutes of Aging has information on Alzheimer Disease in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/Alzheimers/Publications/adfact.htm">English</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/Alzheimers/Publications/factsheet_sp.htm">Spanish</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Two governmental regulatory agencies&#x02014;the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/index.htm">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency</ext-link> in the UK and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</ext-link> in the US&#x02014;offer information about antipsychotics in people with dementia</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ballard C, Lana MM, Theodoulou M, Douglas S, McShane R, et al.

It is a devastating illness that results in a progressive decline in cognitive ability and functional capacity, causes immense distress to patients, their carers, and families, and has an enormous societal impact. Currently the most frequent treatment issue for people with AD presenting to clinical services remains the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as aggression, agitation, and psychosis. Over 90&#x00025; of people with dementia develop these symptoms at some point during their illness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, given that in the US and Europe, up to 60&#x00025; of people with dementia residing in care facilities are prescribed neuroleptics (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;) for median periods of greater than a year &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, the pivotal question is whether longer-term therapy with atypical neuroleptics confers any treatment benefit. There are only two placebo-controlled trials of a neuroleptic for more than 14 wk, and neither showed significant efficacy of neuroleptic treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, all of the withdrawal studies continued for 3 mo or less, leaving some uncertainty regarding long-term symptom outcome. In addition, the largest study did suggest a benefit for treatment with atypical neuroleptics in people with scores greater than 14 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Any beneficial effects of neuroleptics in people with AD must be weighed against the short- and long-term adverse effects which, according to meta-analyses, include parkinsonism, sedation, oedema, chest infections, stroke (odds ratio 2.5&#x02013;3) and mortality (odds ratio 1.5&#x02013;1.7) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

In the absence of data from randomized clinical trials to inform power calculations at the time the protocol was developed, this calculation was undertaken using two different approaches. First, based upon the occurrence of clinically significant cognitive decline (defined as decline greater than the mean expected cognitive decline of four points per year on the MMSE), in 50&#x00025; of patients continuing on neuroleptics versus 30&#x00025; on placebo, allowing for a dropout rate of 15&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025;. Second, using a generic approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, the same sample size gives 80&#x00025; power to the 5&#x00025; level of significance to detect an effect size of 0.43 (regarded conservatively as a medium effect size). As we expected the SIB to be a more sensitive measure than MMSE, it was anticipated that the sample size would have more than sufficient power to detect a clinically important difference.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was performed centrally at the Centre for Statistics in Medicine in Oxford (CSMO), using dedicated computer software (MINIM). The clinician responsible for randomisation of a patient faxed a randomisation form to the CSMO (or sent e-mail in exceptional circumstances) and provided details appropriate and sufficient for establishing eligibility. If a patient was eligible and informed consent/assent had been obtained and baseline assessments had been completed, the patient was randomised by the statistician either to continue taking medication or to discontinue (placebo group). The statistician directly communicated the allocation to the relevant trial pharmacy, ensuring concealment. The randomisation programme included a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation of participants across the intervention groups for the following important prognostic factors: presence or absence of extrapyramidal signs (EPS); visual hallucinations and delusions; use of cholinesterase inhibitors (y/n); SMMSE score (&#x0003c;6/&#x02265;6); and current neuroleptic medication (atypical/typical). The first 22 patients (10&#x00025; of the target sample size) were allocated randomly to avoid predictability at the outset. These allocations were computer generated using block randomisation (block sizes of two and four) using Stata version 7 software (ralloc.ado v3.2.3 subroutine) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Subsequently, the minimisation algorithm was applied with an allocation ratio that was not fully deterministic. The statistician carrying out the randomisation had no direct contact with patients and allocation was, therefore, totally independent of patient recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Blinding</title><p>The clinicians, those administering the trial medication, the caregivers, the relatives, the patients themselves, and those assessing the outcomes were all blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>We used SPSS (release 12.0.1) to enter and manage data, and Stata (release 9.2) for analysis. Demographic factors and clinical characteristics were summarised with counts (percentages) for categorical variables, mean (standard deviation &#x0005b;SD&#x0005d;) for normally distributed continuous variables, or median (interquartile &#x0005b;IQR&#x0005d; or entire range) for other continuous variables. We restricted comparative analysis to those patients who started allocated treatment and had at least one assessment after randomisation, and participants were analysed in the groups to which they were allocated. Primary analysis was performed on patients with complete data at both baseline and week 26, including those who did not adhere to the protocol (e.g., those who never started treatment but for whom we had complete data). As the trial was conducted with masking of treatments, knowledge of allocation could not have contributed to drop-outs before or after treatment, so that exclusion of such patients did not impart bias. For the primary analysis, we summarised the change in the severe impairment battery (i.e., SIB at 6 mo &#x02212; SIB at baseline) score from baseline to 6 mo using the mean and SD. To establish the magnitude and direction of the treatment effect, we used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the two groups, giving the mean difference (in change in SIB from baseline to 6 mo) between groups (plus 95&#x00025; CIs and <italic>p</italic>-values) with adjustment for baseline value. An additional ANCOVA was performed with adjustment for the minimisation factors, as well as geographical centre, in addition to the treatment contrast and baseline values. Changes in secondary outcomes were summarised and compared similarly.</p><p>For non-normally distributed continuous outcomes, we performed nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to investigate differences between the treatment groups.</p><p>Prespecified sensitivity analyses were carried out to examine the robustness of conclusions to different assumptions about departures from randomised policies, dependent on the availability of data and the particular set of circumstances, namely:</p><p>1. Imputation is a method of &#x0201c;filling in&#x0201d; missing data with plausible values to give a completed dataset. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. The procedure involves filling in missing data <italic>m</italic> times to generate <italic>m</italic> complete datasets. Then the <italic>m</italic> complete datasets are analysed by using standard statistical analyses, and finally, the results from the <italic>m</italic> complete datasets are combined to produce inferential results. Variables that were included in the imputation model were all assessments of SIB, NPI, FAS, SMMSE, BADLS, STALD-receptive, STALD-expressive, FAST, and CGIC collected at baseline, 6, and 12 mo. Other baseline covariates that were also included in the imputation model were allocated treatment group, sex, centre, presence of significant EPS, visual hallucinations or delusions, age at randomisation, type of neuroleptic drug at baseline, and whether the participant was taking cholinesterase inhibitors at trial entry.</p><p>2. In order to test the robustness of the SIB result, we limited a sensitivity analysis to those patients for whom the risk of possible floor and ceiling effects was smallest, i.e., SIB baseline cut-off values &#x02265; 40 but &#x02264; 90. Prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out on change in SIB and change in NPI. We performed the test of interaction, i.e., examined whether the treatment effects were consistent across subgroups. The subgroups investigated were (a) type of neuroleptic (atypical versus typical)&#x02014;it made clinical sense to examine whether the type of neuroleptic (atypical versus typical) at baseline made a difference since, if one type was more harmful than the other, then discontinuation would benefit those patients more; (b) baseline NPI (&#x02264; 14 versus &#x02265; 15)&#x02014;we intended to look at consistency of treatment effect in relation to baseline NPI (&#x02264; 14 versus 15 or more) in an attempt to replicate Ballard et al. 2004 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;; and (c) centre effects (Newcastle versus Oxford versus London/Edinburgh).

The failure of these differences to attain statistical significance may be because of limited statistical power (a type II error), as the magnitude of difference in change in global cognition between neuroleptics and placebo at 6 mo was consistent with the effect size identified in a recent meta-analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, and became more substantial over further follow-up. It would be more usual in a study of this type to hypothesise equivalence or the absence of an advantage to the treatment that is being removed, and there is certainly no evidence at all from these results suggesting any cognitive advantage favouring antipsychotics.</p><p>On secondary cognitive outcomes, there was a significant deterioration in verbal fluency for patients taking neuroleptics compared to people receiving placebo, and there was a nonsignificant numerical advantage for the placebo-treated group on the BADLS. There were nonsignificant numerical advantages for the placebo group with respect to the severity of parkinsonism.</p><p>There was a marginal nonsignificant 2.4 point advantage on the total NPI score for continuing neuroleptic treatment over the first 6 mo of treatment. Using a baseline NPI threshold &#x02264;14, previously reported to be predictive of outcome in a 3 mo neuroleptic withdrawal trial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, the change in NPI did not differ between the treatment groups. Participants with baseline NPI scores &#x0003e; 14 had an almost 5 point advantage (albeit nonsignificant) if they remained on neuroleptics, whereas there was no benefit for people with NPI scores below this threshold. For patients with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, there were modest benefits at 6 mo and more substantial advantages at 12 mo, which have to be weighed against the potential for serious adverse events. Some of the changes in NPI score are likely to be related to natural symptom course, or a Hawthorne effect, or regression to the mean, although there should be no imbalance in these factors between groups. There were no differences between groups for global clinician-rated outcome, and in an additional descriptive evaluation there appeared to be no difference in emergent delusions or agitation between groups.</p><p>In the post-hoc analysis there was no indication of a difference between people taking typical or atypical neuroleptics. The majority of individuals were taking risperidone or haloperidol, and the number of people taking other drugs was too small to enable any meaningful comparison. In particular, it will be important in further work to determine whether neuroleptics with more prominent antimuscarinic properties have a more potent impact on cognition in patients with dementia.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that psychological management approaches can replace neuroleptic therapy without any significant worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;; and evidence is emerging that cholinesterase inhibitors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; or memantine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; may be safer, effective alternatives for some symptoms. The authors of the recent CATIE study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, a large, pragmatic, 36-wk placebo-controlled trial of atypical neuroleptics in AD, concluded that the modest benefits were not sufficient to justify therapy in the presence of the increased risk of serious adverse events. Clinicians should certainly try to replace atypical neuroleptics with safer management approaches. Taking into consideration CATIE, the results of 6- to 12-wk placebo-controlled trials, and our own data, we would suggest that there is, however, a limited place for atypical neuroleptics in the maintenance treatment of severe neuropsychiatric manifestations (particularly aggression) in AD when there is tangible risk or severe distress, and the symptoms have been refractory to other treatment approaches.</p><p>The magnitude of the impact of neuroleptics upon cognition, although consistent with a recent meta-analysis, was considerably less marked than reported in a recent 6 mo placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. There are numerous possible explanations for this difference, although it may be noted that unlike quetiapine, none of the atypical antipsychotics used in the current study had substantial antimuscarinic properties, and it is possible that antimuscarinic properties may exacerbate the impact of neuroleptics upon cognition. Although this is speculative, it is consistent with a study comparing cognition in patients with AD treated with either risperidone or olanzapine, where olanzapine treatment was associated with greater impairment of attentional and executive performance related to anticholinergic activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050076-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Within the current study there was a significant detrimental impact upon expressive language function, an important skill to enable social communication and maintain quality of life in people with AD residing in care facilities. Further work is needed to examine the effects on different aspects of cognitive function, to clarify the differential impact of individual neuroleptic drugs, and to determine whether the impact upon cognition is sufficient to interfere with everyday activities.</p><p>The results of the current study must be interpreted within the context of a number of limitations. In particular, the sample size was much smaller than intended, conferring limited statistical power, and the number of deaths and withdrawals precluded meaningful analysis of data beyond the 6 mo follow-up. In addition a sizeable proportion of patients did not start their allocated treatment for a variety of reasons, mainly related to frailty and concurrent illnesses. The sample size achieved was short of the 220 target due mainly to problems identifying eligible patients, which in turn led to slow recruitment, bringing on more centres, and ultimately curtailing recruitment due to a lack of resources. Given the vulnerability of the study population, a substantial number of deaths and withdrawals are an almost inevitable problem to contend with. Probably the only solution would be to exclude people with profound dementia or with a certain degree of physical frailty, but this would then diminish the validity of drawing more general conclusions from the results. Although it is difficult, therefore, to see how this problem could have been avoided, the high number of drop-outs must be considered when interpreting the results.</p><p>In addition, the reason for the initial prescription of neuroleptic drugs was unclear in the majority of instances. Most prescriptions had been instigated by primary care physicians and, as a number of the individuals had changed their primary care physician, or been admitted to a care facility, or changed care facility since neuroleptics were first prescribed, the clinical indication for the original prescription was often lost. Although in many ways this lack of information is unsatisfactory, it does reflect real clinical practice, so that the population studied and the information available were representative of what faces clinicians in their routine practice. As few individuals were under specialist care, it is unlikely that treatment-refractory symptoms were a reason for neuroleptic use in most of the participants. The data regarding outcome and the baseline severity of symptoms do, however, provide a useful basis for clinical decisions. It is possible that the profile of the original symptoms for which the neuroleptics were prescribed may have influenced outcome, but this possibility could practically be investigated only in people with neuroleptic prescriptions of shorter duration, for which the presenting symptoms would be easier to ascertain.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For most patients with AD, withdrawal of neuroleptics had no overall detrimental effect on functional and cognitive status and by some measures improved functional and cognitive status. Neuroleptics may have some value in the maintenance treatment of more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, but this possibility must be weighed against the unwanted effects of therapy. The current study helps to inform a clinical management strategy for current practice, but the considerable risks of maintenance therapy highlight the urgency of further work to find, develop, and implement safer and more effective treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with AD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050076-se001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist</title><p>(44 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050076.sd001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Other DART AD investigators: Timothy Smith, Ruth Elvish, Claire Maddison, Carol Bannister.</p><p>Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee: Clive Holmes (Chair), John Geddes and Robert Clarke.</p><p>DART-AD Pharmacists: (North East) Vranda Barbieri, Kay Carson, Gavin Mankin; (Oxfordshire) Michael Marven, Kim Gray; (London) Charlotte Gibbs.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p>Alzheimer disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BADLS</term><def><p>Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGIC</term><def><p>Clinician's Global Impression of Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMC</term><def><p>data-monitoring committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPS</term><def><p>extrapyramidal signs and symptoms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p>Verbal Fluency Task</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAST</term><def><p>Functional Assessment Staging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p>interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPI</term><def><p>Neuropsychiatric Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIB</term><def><p>Severe Impairment Battery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(S)MMSE</term><def><p>(Standardised) Mini Mental State Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STALD</term><def><p>Sheffield Test for Acquired Language Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UPDRS</term><def><p>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pmed-0050076-b001"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferri</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>Prince</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Brayne</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brodaty</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Fratiglioni</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Alzheimer's Disease International.
