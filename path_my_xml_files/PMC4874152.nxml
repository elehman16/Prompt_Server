The SCP TS will be given to the participant and general practitioner (GP).

These needs relate to physical and psychosocial impacts such as fear of recurrence, fatigue, poor nutrition, exercise, fertility, relationship, financial, employment and insurance issues.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, these patients commonly experience related health problems earlier than the general population<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and are at risk of specific late effects.

This phase II trial of an intervention is aimed at reducing the immediate and long-term physical and psychosocial consequences of haematological cancer treatment and to enable the participant to return to normal functioning sooner. The nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic has three core components: (1) needs assessments to determine individual informational or practical issues or concerns; (2) provision of a tailored survivorship care plan and treatment summary to enhance communication between the participant and all other health professionals with whom the patient has contact post-treatment; and (3) provision of individualised evidence-based education, information and resources to address patient-reported needs, likely post-treatment physical and emotional concerns and maximising participant involvement in healthy lifestyle behaviours. The aims are aligned with the Australian national research priority for preventative healthcare to reduce comorbid diseases in cancer survivors.</p><p>The Medical Research Council framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions has guided the development of this trial.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>

Consenting participants randomised to the intervention group (n=30) will be offered the opportunity to consent to a qualitative interview at completion of all time points.

Many institutions in Australia are using US-based templates that are large (up to 20 pages), not tailored to the individual and provide resources that are not contextualised to the Australian healthcare setting. Therefore, we developed a lymphoma SCP TS in collaboration with a haematology consultant, GP and other multidisciplinary team members (eg, consumers, psychologists, cancer nurses and academic cancer researchers). This has been created as a word document template to be filled in by the nurse. The perspectives of lymphoma survivors (n=6) and clinicians (including GPs; n=6) were sought to determine the relevance of the proposed SCP TS items. Each item was assessed for content and apparent internal consistency (whether items should be included and the general fit with other items) using either yes or no responses to the items. Content validity used a rating scale (1=not relevant to 4=highly relevant). The content validity index (CVI)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> was generated for each item by adding the number of &#x02018;yes&#x02019; scores (content, clarity and apparent internal consistency) and scores of 3 or 4 (content validity). The mean CVI consumer results were as follows: clarity 0.98; apparent internal consistency 100; content validity 0.95. Consumers demonstrated complete agreement of 1.0 for internal consistency items. The mean CVI clinician results were as follows: clarity 0.99; apparent internal consistency 0.95; content validity 0.84. Feedback in the comments section of the evaluation interestingly indicated GPs did not value or require a large TS document. Consensus of the research team was reached for the TS (half a page in length) and SCP (one and a half pages in length).</p><p>The TS is completed using existing medical record information such as diagnosis, treatment, complications and use of allied health providers. The first section of the SCP includes a table for the inclusion of individualised potential late effects. This table comprises the late effect; information for the GP about tests or follow-up required and when; and the symptomology the participant needs to be aware of, with encouragement to follow these up with the GP. Prior to recruitment, a comprehensive list of potential late effects and follow-up required was developed for each lymphoma type using available published literature and guidelines (KT). This list was circulated, discussed and amended by the haematologists who were aware these would be used to guide their population of the table. Tailored individualised potential late effects will be documented based on treatments administered, participants&#x02019; demographics and health characteristics. Once the TS and this aspect of the SCP are completed, it will be emailed to the haematologist for final approval. Once amendments (if any) are made, the haematologist signs the TS. The second page of the SCP is patient centred and populated by the nurse in consultation with the participant. Participants will be asked to identify three main concerns, health goals and proposed actions to achieve these goals.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Sample size</title><p>The calculation of a sample size is not required for pilot RCTs as effect size is not yet known. Rather the purpose of the pilot is to determine variability in measures from which effect sizes can be calculated. Approximately 75 patients are seen per year at the study setting; however, this figure&#x000a0;is inclusive of new and existing patients. Therefore, a consecutive sample of 60 participants will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to either control or intervention group (30 participants are expected in each group). It is necessary to establish test&#x02013;retest reliability for the SF-SUNS by demonstrating a minimum intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.8.

All participants will self-report demographic information and complete the four assessment instruments. In addition, they will receive a second SF-SUNS instrument to complete no later than 5&#x02005;days after the baseline testing. These will be returned via a reply-paid envelope to allow the researchers to undertake test&#x02013;retest reliability testing. Medical demographic information obtained will include type of haematological cancer, stage of disease, type of treatment received (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy), date of diagnosis, time since diagnosis, treatment complications or dose modifications, and comorbidities. Personal demographic information collected will include sex, age, marital status, age of children (if any), postcode, occupation, income level, education level&#x000a0;and health behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption and weight.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After baseline assessment, participants will be randomised to either the current standard of care or intervention group. Computer-generated random numbers using a four-digit sequence have been generated and linked to group allocation by an independent statistician. An independent member of the research team, to ensure confidentiality and offset bias in randomisation, has sealed a hard copy of each individual number and group in an opaque envelope. The envelopes are consecutively numbered and will be distributed to consenting participants in this order. Control group participants will be made aware that another researcher will follow-up non-questionnaire return with a telephone call to the participant after 2&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Control group</title><p>Control group participants will receive follow-up care as per haematologists' usual practice. At 3 and 6&#x02005;months after baseline, the same four assessment instruments will be sent to the participant, and they will self-report any issues or unmet supportive care needs. An addressed reply paid envelope will be provided to return assessments. Participants who score high unmet needs will be encouraged to discuss these with their haematologist at their usual follow-up appointment.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Intervention group</title><p>Following baseline data collection, intervention group participants will have an appointment at the nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic. The first page of the SCP TS will be populated prior to this appointment. At the first nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic, any concerns the participant has regarding the end of treatment will be discussed and normalised. The nurse will discuss the TS and potential late effects. The second page of the SCP will be completed by the nurse using an electronic template in collaboration with the participant. At this time, the importance of follow-up recommendations will be emphasised. The SCP will then be printed, signed and dated by the participant and the nurse. The completed SCP TS will then be copied, with the original given to the participant, a copy placed in the participant's medical records and a copy sent to their GP. Motivational interviewing techniques will be employed for healthy lifestyle behaviours and to assess for readiness to make behavioural change. Participants will be encouraged to identify and explore behaviours they would like to modify using a chart that enables them to list likes and dislikes of specific behaviours and potential impacts of perceived behavioural change. By listening to concerns, highlighting conflicts arising from behaviour and documenting on the chart will potentially enable participants to assume control of decision-making related to behavioural change. Participants will be encouraged to set realistic time frames and identify habits and beliefs that may possibly be hindering change. Tailored evidenced-based information and advice in a resource pack will then be issued. It is anticipated that a consultation of 60&#x02005;min will be required in a private clinic room.</p><p>A further two appointments will be made at 3 and 6&#x02005;months after baseline, where the same four assessment instruments will be completed by the participant, and they will self-report any issues or unmet supportive care needs. These will be discussed and the appropriate resources, support and information provided. Participants will be encouraged to discuss their health concerns, goals and progress with any action they may have taken. Participants will be asked if they have seen their GP in the last 3&#x02005;months and if they took the SCP TS and discussed any of the late-effect screening recommendations, their participant-identified concerns or goals. This will aid the transition to GP follow-up where the benefits of shared care will be explained. A checklist for each participant of the resources provided will be kept.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Quantitative data will be analysed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques with SPSS data analysis software. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the demographic variables collected. Responses to the SF-SUNS, DASS21, Mini-MAC and PES will be scored according to the algorithms in the instrument manuals. Measures from all instruments will be checked for normal variance within the two groups. Within each group, paired t test comparisons will be made between baseline measurements and at each time point: baseline, 3&#x02005;months and 6&#x02005;months. Differences between intervention and control groups will then be assessed at each time point. Test&#x02013;retest reliability using ICC will be undertaken on the SF-SUNS instrument. The minimum ICC value required for this scale is 0.8. Participants who drop out or are lost to follow-up or need to be excluded after the start will be accounted for by intention-to-treat analyses. CIs will reflect the contrast between groups to show treatment effect. Missing data, incomplete answers and non-response will be recorded.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Qualitative interviews</title><p>Supplementary in-depth, semistructured interviews will occur with &#x0223c;10 consenting participants when they have completed all intervention components (after 6&#x02005;months).

This will guide future refinement of the SCP TS. Analysis will use descriptive statistics and distribution analysis techniques. Open-ended questions will use content analysis techniques. GPs will be called by the researcher after 2&#x02005;weeks for non-return of the questionnaire to remind them to fill in and return the evaluation in the reply-paid envelope.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s6"><title>Discussion</title><p>A significant culture change is required for providers to recognise survivorship care as a standard component of quality cancer care that involves all health professionals, participants and families. The gap in knowledge contributes to a current model of survivorship care that is fragmented, with inadequate service provision at treatment completion, leading to unmet needs along the survivorship continuum.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> The cancer specialist is not necessarily required for routine screening and follow-up. However, the involvement of other health professionals, including primary care, necessitates the need for an awareness of the treatment delivered and the long-term and late-effect risks.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>This study will address the lack of robust empirical evidence in haematology survivorship care. A nurse-led model of care would assist patients transitioning from the end of treatment to the survivorship phase. Furthermore, the provision of an individualised SCP TS is a means to empower individuals with knowledge about their disease and treatment and to assume responsibility for future surveillance and disease management. It will likewise take advantage of &#x02018;teachable moments&#x02019; at the end of active treatment to support and promote patient participation in healthy lifestyle behaviours.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This is particularly vital for younger survivors, given the expectation of a longer survivorship period.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>The intervention has been timed to occur in the early survivorship phase. This has been supported by preliminary focus group work including lymphoma cancer survivors who indicated they often felt abandoned at treatment completion.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This timing also concords with McDowell <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> who found assessments and interventions undertaken in the early survivorship phase (up to 2&#x02005;years post diagnosis) led to fewer unmet needs moving into the extended survivorship phase (over 5&#x02005;years).</p><p>The CALy trial will examine the impact and effectiveness of the nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic intervention through an assessment of the important clinical outcomes: unmet informational and practical needs; depression, anxiety and stress; coping; and self-empowerment as measured by the instruments chosen. It is therefore designed to improve the identification of unmet needs. Testing of such an intervention by an RCT has not been published in lymphoma survivorship studies to date. Consequently, it will make a significant contribution to the planning and delivery of survivorship care. Likewise, it represents a substantial and original contribution to knowledge and support for haematology survivorship care as few studies aim to improve the psychosocial and supportive care of this cohort. If the intervention achieves its intended outcomes, it may potentially lead to the development of nurse-led haematology survivorship clinics across the tertiary health sector in Western Australia that could ultimately be expanded to all cancer survivors.</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethics approval has been gained from the relevant hospital (2015-020) and university (015007F) Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs). The trial is registered at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 1261500530527) and the Western Australia Cancer Clinical Trials Registry. The trial is open to patient recruitment. It is not expected participants will be exposed to any undue risks or harm by participation. Participant information will remain confidential and deidentified where appropriate. Economic harm will be minimised by providing appointments when the participant is already attending the hospital. Exploring concerns may be distressing and if this occurs, participants will be referred to the appropriate counselling services as per usual clinical practice.
