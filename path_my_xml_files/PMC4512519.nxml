An independent data safety monitoring board concluded that these events were not likely related to study drug and did not change the risk&#x02013;benefit profile of peginteferon beta-1a.</p><p>In Year 2, the incidence of potentially clinically significant abnormalities in white blood cell counts (defined as &#x0003c;3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/l), lymphocyte counts (defined as &#x0003c;0.8&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/l), and absolute neutrophil count (defined as &#x02264;1.0&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/l) remained low (&#x02264;10% of patients) across peginterferon beta-1a dosing groups (Table S3 in the supplementary materials). The majority of hepatic transaminase elevations were &#x0003c;3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (Table S4 in the supplementary materials). During Year 2, one patient had asymptomatic concurrent elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &#x02265;3 &#x000d7; ULN and elevation of total bilirubin &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; ULN. For both dosing regimens, in majority of subjects who reported hepatic or hematological laboratory abnormalities, the abnormal values returned to normal at the end of Year 2. Lab abnormalities over 2 years are presented in Tables S5 and S6 in the online supplementary materials.</p><p>Over 2 years, the incidence (number of patients at risk) of NAbs against IFN (anti-IFN NAbs) (&#x0003c;1% every 4 weeks; &#x0003c;1% every 2 weeks), binding antibodies to IFN moieties (5% every 4 weeks; 8% every 2 weeks), and antibodies against peginterferon (anti-PEG Abs) (8% every 4 weeks; 6% every 2 weeks), were similar for both peginterferon beta-1a dosing groups (Table S7 in the supplementary materials).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section17-1352458514557986"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from ADVANCE show that the clinical and neuroradiologic efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a was maintained beyond 1 year of treatment. Compared with Year 1, further reductions in ARR were observed with peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks and the same level of reductions was achieved with peginterferon beta-1a every 4 weeks in Year 2. The number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions was further reduced in Year 2 compared with Year 1 in the continuous peginterferon beta-1a groups, with greater reductions observed for peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks. The safety profile of peginterferon beta-1a over 2 years was consistent with that in Year 1.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458514557986" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Assessment of endpoints by original randomization group generally showed that peginterferon beta-1a had greater effects relative to delayed treatment. Importantly, these results demonstrated that the benefits of earlier therapy initiation remain significant for a minimum of 1 year following treatment delay. However, due to the nature of the comparator group, results should be interpreted with caution as the effect sizes are likely underestimates of those against a &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; placebo group. While the every 2 weeks dosing group demonstrated superiority over the delayed treatment group for all endpoints, the every 4 weeks dosing group only demonstrated significant improvement at one endpoint (proportion of relapsed patients). Although comparisons between dosing groups were not pre-specified, assessment of peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks versus every 4 weeks over 2 years showed that peginterferon beta-1a administered every 2 weeks provided larger statistically significant treatment effects over 2 years versus every 4 weeks administration on ARR, proportion of relapse patients, 24-week disability progression, and all MRI endpoints (12-week disability progression was numerically but not significantly superior).</p><p>Comparison of safety results over 2 years with Year 1 showed that the nature, type, and frequency of AEs remained consistent with the longer duration of treatment. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between Year 1 (94% for each peginterferon beta-1a dosing group) and over 2 years (94% for each peginterferon beta-1a dosing group). The most common AEs reported over 2 years were similar to those in Year 1 (injection site erythema, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, and headache). Incidence of severe and serious AEs and rate of infections and serious infections were higher over 2 years than in Year 1 due to the longer duration of follow-up. Safety profiles of peginterferon beta-1a by study year (Year 1 and Year 2) were similar.</p><p>The incidence of AEs, serious AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs was also similar across dose regimens (the incidence of serious AEs was slightly higher in the every 4 week dosing group than every 2 week dosing group) and are consistent with the known profiles of IFN beta therapies in MS. For the deaths occurring in Year 1, there was no specific pattern. In Year 2, the nature of deaths was consistent with those expected in the MS population and an independent data safety monitoring board concluded that they did not change the risk&#x02013;benefit profile of peginterferon beta-1a. The incidence of potentially clinically significant lab abnormalities was low across treatment groups in Year 1 and in Year 2.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458514557986" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Development of NAbs against IFN beta has been associated with reduced levels of efficacy based on clinical and MRI variables.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458514557986" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-1352458514557986" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr11-1352458514557986" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Immunogenicity remained low over 2 years; the development of NAbs to IFN beta-1a in Year 1 was similar to that over 2 years (&#x0003c;1%).

Greater efficacy was observed with every 2 week versus every 4 week administration, and safety results show that peginterferon beta-1a is well tolerated over 2 years. Peginterferon beta-1a offers an effective and safe treatment option with the benefit of less frequent administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Appendix.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1397" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the patients who volunteered for this study and the many site staff members who helped to conduct the study.
