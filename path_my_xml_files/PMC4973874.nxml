This study examined the psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions. Twenty-seven adults completed two group exercise training sessions of moderate and vigorous exercise intensities in a random and counterbalanced order. The %HRR and the exertional and arousal responses to vigorous session were higher than those during the moderate session (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Consequently, the affective responses to vigorous session were less pleasant than those during moderate session (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These results suggest that the psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions are intensity-dependent. From an adherence perspective, interventionists are encouraged to emphasize group exercise training sessions at a moderate intensity to maximize affective responses and to minimize exertional responses, which in turn may positively affect future exercise behavior.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Epidemiological data indicate that more than 60% of the worldwide population does not engage in either moderate physical activity for &#x02265; 30 min at least five times a week or vigorous physical activity for &#x02265; 20 min at least three times a week [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dropout is considered one of the major contributing factors to the low rates of exercise participation. Evidence shows that approximately 50% of individuals who initiate an exercise program drop out within the first few months of participation [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, many people withdraw from exercise programs before physiological gains occur. The identification of potential factors that contribute to non-adherence has been one of the greatest challenges in exercise research over the last few years.</p><p>The prescription of vigorous-intensity activities has been recognized as a contributing factor to non-adherence to exercise programs. The current recommendations developed by the American College of Sports Medicine confirmed that adherence is lower in higher-intensity exercise programs. Data from both epidemiological and intervention studies have also shown that sedentary individuals are more likely to adhere to low-intensity activities than to high-intensity activities [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These studies support the notion that exercise intensity influences the adherence to exercise programs. However, none of these investigations provide any information about potential mediators of the relationship between exercise intensity and adherence.</p><p>There is speculation that the relationship between exercise intensity and adherence to an exercise program might be mediated by the amount of pleasure that an individual experiences during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A positive affective response experienced during exercise may lead to greater enjoyment of the activity, creation of a positive memory of the exercise experience, and possibly increased motivation for engagement in future physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This hypothesis has been presented using the so-called hedonic theory of motivation [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which argues that if people derive pleasure from exercise participation, then they would presumably seek to repeat this activity. Conversely, if people derive displeasure from exercise participation, the chances of them repeating this activity would be reduced. In fact, a recent study conducted by Williams et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that affective responses to a moderately intense stimulus were predictive of exercise participation up to 6 and 12 months later. However, the relationship between affective responses and later exercise participation becomes nonsignificant when controlling for perceived exertion, thus suggesting a crucial role for both affective and exertional responses in the adherence to exercise programs.</p><p>Group exercise training programs have been introduced in many fitness centers around the world. These programs involve exercising the major muscle groups using weights and/or bodyweight, a standard sequence of music selections, and choreography that is followed by the practitioners. One of the main purposes of these sessions is to improve the health and fitness of the practitioners. Studies utilizing this type of activity have shown that, on average, individuals are predisposed to exercise at intensities that lie within the range recommended to provide health and fitness benefits by the American College of Sports Medicine [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, none of these studies provided any information about the affective and exertional responses to group exercise training programs, which may play a key role in determining the adherence to such an activity [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another unsolved issue is whether the psychophysiological responses to this type of activity vary across the range of exercise intensities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions performed at moderate and vigorous intensities. Based upon previous data and theories, we hypothesized that a moderate-intensity exercise trial would result in a more positive affective valence and a less strenuous perceived exertion compared with a vigorous-intensity exercise trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study Design</title><p>To examine our hypothesis, a group of active, young men and women completed four trials, scheduled on different days, with at least 48&#x02013;72 h between trials. On Day 1, participants underwent a medical screening, anthropometric measurement, and familiarization with the experimental procedures. On Day 2, they performed a maximal graded exercise test. Finally, on Days 3&#x02013;4, participants performed two group exercise training sessions at moderate and vigorous intensities, in a random and counterbalanced order. This study design enables for the direct comparison of the effects of exercise intensity and gender (independent variables) on psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions (dependent variables: %HRR, perceived exertion, affective valence, and perceived activation).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-seven individuals (17 men and 10 women) between 18 and 28 years of age volunteered to participate in this study, which was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Each participant gave their written informed consent after the purpose, experimental procedures, possible risks, and benefits of the study were explained to them. The participants received no monetary compensation but were given the results of their maximal exercise test and an individualized exercise prescription upon completion of the study. Based on a power analysis considering the correlation among measures [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the a priori sample size was calculated using a software package, GPower, [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This power analysis was conducted as follows: 2 (exercise intensity trials) &#x000d7; 5 (time), within subject factorial design with repeated measures, with effect size estimates derived from previous work [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For this study design, 6 participants were required for each of the cells to result in a statistical power of 0.99, with a large effect size, <italic>f</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 1.00, [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a moderate correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.50), and an overall level of significance of <italic>p</italic> = 0.05. In sum, the sample size of 27 participants was large enough to detect the expected differences between exercise intensity trials.</p><p>Participants were recruited from exercise and health courses at the University. However, to be eligible for participation, individuals were required to have engaged in &#x0003e; 30 min of moderate physical activity per day on most days of the week for the previous six months [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Specifically, the participants performed two sessions of group exercise training, involving selected bodyweight exercises targeting the major muscle groups and performed according to music and choreography sequences. All sessions were structured as follows: 15 min of standard warm up with no music, 60 min of functional exercises with synchronous music, and 15 min of cool down with no music. As noted by Simpson and Karageorghis [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the use of synchronous music entails the conscious performance of repetitive movements in time with the rhythmical elements of music, such as the beat or tempo. In the present study, the trials were performed using synchronous medium-tempo (120 beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup>) or fast-tempo (145 beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup>) music, and participants were instructed to synchronize their body movements according to the music tempo and the trainer&#x02019;s choreography. Therefore, the trials used in this study were described as moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise trials, respectively. As proposed by Karageorghis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the aforementioned synchronous tempo music may adequately lead to moderate-intensity (120 beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup>) and vigorous-intensity (145 beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup>) exercises. The music was played through wall-mounted speakers at a safe and effective standardized intensity [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in each of the trials. To avoid any influence of different music on the psychophysiological responses to exercise, standardized music was used in the trials [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All participants were instructed to individually report their psychological responses to exercise to minimize any possible effects of group dynamics or social interactions. All participants performed the two experimental trials in a random and counterbalanced order. They were instructed to refrain from exercise, avoid alcoholic and caffeinated products in the 24 h before the trials, and present themselves at the laboratory in a 2-h post-absorptive state. All experimental trials were conducted in the morning (between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm) under similar environmental conditions.</p><p>HR was continuously recorded before and throughout the trials using a short-range radio telemetry HR monitor (Polar Team System, Polar Electro<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, Kempele, Finland). The HR responses were then averaged for the final 30-sec intervals of every 15-min period of each trial and 1 min before and 1 min after exercise. For each participant, heart rate reserve (HRR) was calculated by subtracting the HR<sub>Rest</sub> value from the respective maximal value (i.e., HR<sub>max</sub>). Accordingly, for each 15-min interval of each of the trials, as well as 1 min before and 1 min after exercise, the increment above resting for each value was divided by the calculated reserve and multiplied by 100 to derive %HRR [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Maximal Graded Exercise Test</title><p>After 5 min of seated rest, participants performed a maximal graded exercise test on a motorized treadmill. The standard Bruce protocol was used to determine maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>). Each participant was verbally encouraged to continue to exercise until the point of volitional exhaustion. To achieve a VO<sub>2max</sub>, participants were required to meet two of the following criteria: (a) a plateau in VO<sub>2</sub> (changes of &#x0003c; 150 mL &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup> in the last three consecutive 15 sec averages), (b) a respiratory exchange ratio of &#x02265; 1.15, and (c) a heart rate (HR) within 10 beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup> of the age-predicted maximum. Therefore, VO<sub>2max</sub> was defined as the highest value of VO<sub>2</sub> attained after reaching the aforementioned criteria. HR<sub>max</sub> was defined as the highest HR value recorded over any continuous 15-sec interval during the test, whereas HR<sub>Rest</sub> was considered the average HR value recorded over the last 2 min of seated rest [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ventilatory threshold (VT) was determined by two independent experienced investigators in a blind fashion using the ventilatory equivalent method [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149997.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>HR (beats &#x000b7; min<sup>-1</sup>) was continuously recorded before and throughout the test using an HR monitor (RS400, Polar Electro&#x02122;, Kempele, Finland).

This scale is a 15-point single-item measure, ranging from 6 to 20, with verbal anchors ranging from &#x0201c;no exertion at all&#x0201d; (6) to &#x0201c;maximal exertion&#x0201d; (20). Participants were previously anchored to the scale during the orientation session using memory-anchoring procedures [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The ratings of perceived exertion were estimated at the end of each 3-min stage of the maximal graded exercise test and at every 15-min interval of the exercise intensity trials.</p><p>Affective valence was measured using the Feeling Scale (FS) [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The FS is a single-item indicator of affective valence scored on an 11-point scale ranging from -5 &#x0201c;very bad&#x0201d; to +5 &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;. The &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; affective valence measured by the FS is a major component of the circumplex model, presented by Russell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which incorporates affective valence and activation as orthogonal and bipolar dimensions of the affective space. In the present study, the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was used as a measure of perceived activation, which is considered a global index of &#x0201c;somatic&#x0201d; arousal. The FAS is a 6-point, single-item, bipolar measure, ranging from 1 to 6, with verbal anchors of &#x0201c;low arousal&#x0201d; (1) and &#x0201c;high arousal&#x0201d; (6). In a counterbalanced manner 6&#x02013;20 Borg RPE, FS, and FAS scales were administered at the end of each 3-min stage of the maximal graded exercise test and at every 15-min interval of the exercise intensity trials. Additionally, these scales were administered at two points in the exercise intensity trial: (i) immediately after the warm up (0 min) and (ii) immediately after the cool down. Participants rated &#x0201c;how&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; they felt at these particular moments. Standard definitions of perceived exertion, affective valence, and perceived activation, along with separate instructional sets for the 6&#x02013;20 Borg RPE, FS, and FAS scales, were read to the participants before the maximal graded exercise test and exercise intensity trials [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

[<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the eight-item PRETIE-Q Preference Scale contains four items that tap preference for high intensity (e.g., &#x0201c;I would rather have a short, intense workout than a long, low-intensity workout&#x0201d;) and four that tap preference for low intensity and are reverse-scored (e.g., &#x0201c;when I exercise, I usually prefer a slow, steady pace&#x0201d;).

At the end of the orientation session, the participants were given copies of the eight-item PRETIE-Q Preference Scale and were asked to complete and return them upon arrival for the next session.

To examine these objectives, the present research design involved participants performing two group exercise training sessions at different intensities on separate days, which were administered in a counterbalanced order. Specifically, participants were instructed to synchronize their body movements according to music tempo and the trainer&#x02019;s choreography during moderate (120 beats&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) and vigorous (145 beats&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) sessions. As proposed by Karageorghis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], synchronous music at these tempos may lead participants to exercise at moderate and vigorous intensities, respectively. The group exercise training trials used in this study resulted in different %HRR values (by approximately 15%). Importantly, the %HRR responses to group exercise training trials during both the moderate (from 59% to 79% HRR) and vigorous (from 80% to 90% HRR) sessions were within the exercise intensity range recommended by the ACSM [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] to promote fitness and health benefits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149997.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

These responses are consistent with the fundamental assumptions of the dual mode model [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which suggest an interplay of cognitive appraisal processes and interoceptive cues in the generation of affective responses during exercise. According to this model, cognitive appraisal processes are the primary determinants of affective responses as the exercise intensity is below or near to the VT. At these exercise intensities, affective responses are pleasant by most people but also unpleasant by many other people. Once the exercise intensity is beyond the VT, interoceptive cues gain salience and become the primary determinant of affective responses. At exercise intensities exceeding the VT, affective responses tend to be homogeneously negative.</p><p>The reduction in the affective valence began at the first assessment during exercise and continued until completion of the exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149997.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, there was no significant effect of exercise intensity on post-exercise affect and arousal. Both trials resulted in similar changes in the perceived activation and affective valence immediately after exercise. The reasons for this phenomenon are unclear. However, it is likely that the effects of exercise intensity on affect during exercise are unrelated to affect after exercise. This repeated assessment of &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; affect could be considered a strength of this investigation, as few studies have utilized this methodological approach [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, the approach underscores the importance of both assessing and comparing affective responses, both during and after exercise.</p><p>The findings of the present study may have implications for exercise prescription in group exercise training programs that differ in intensity. As highlighted, the prescription of vigorous-intensity activities is correlated with less favorable affective responses during exercise. Importantly, the amount of pleasure one experiences during exercise might play a key role in later participation in physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A more positive affective response experienced during exercise might lead to a greater enjoyment of the activity, creating a positive memory of the exercise experience that may increase the motivation to participate in physical activity in the future. A recent prospective study by Williams et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] confirmed that affective responses to a moderately intense stimulus were predictive of participation in physical activity up to 6 and 12 months later. Thus, interventionists are encouraged to consider that even a very subtle increase in intensity during group exercise training sessions can be enough to make an individual feel less positive about their exercise experience. Given the proposed link between affect and adherence [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the influence that this "extra" exercise intensity can have on affective responses may be enough to discourage future exercise participation because the experience was less pleasant than one is willing to tolerate.</p><p>Although the affective responses experienced during exercise may play a role in predicting adherence to physical activity programs, the exertional responses also have consequences for future physical activity behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, both affective ("how" a person feels) and exertional ("what" a person feels) responses were assessed to provide a more complete picture of the subjective exercise experience. This combination is useful, as the affect and perceived exertion are not isomorphic constructs [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As expected, the results from the current study indicate that the vigorous-intensity trial produced more strenuous exertional responses. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the effects of exercise intensity on perceived exertion are unrelated to the self-efficacy and self-reported intensity preference of the participants. Although both trials resulted in similar increases in perceived exertion, the vigorous-intensity trial resulted in a significant increase in effort perception. This increase began at the first assessment during exercise and continued until completion of the exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149997.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Based on the principles of Borg's [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] model of effort continua, the higher exertional responses reported by the participants during the vigorous-intensity trial are likely to be attributable, at least in part, to the greater physiological requirements of the trial. However, there was no significant effect of exercise intensity on post-exercise perceived exertion. Both trials resulted in similar changes in perceived exertion immediately after exercise. The reasons for this &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; effect in the temporal dynamics of the exertional responses are unclear, but the influences of cognitive-social factors [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and dissociative cues [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] may be plausible explanations. Further research is warranted to elucidate how specific cognitive-social factors and associative/dissociative cues affect exertional and affective responses to group exercise training sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations</title><p>In interpreting the results of this study, readers should take into account its inherent limitations. The sample is the primary limitation. The current sample is rather narrow in terms of age, fitness level, weight status, and socio-educational status. On the one hand, this cohort may not be representative of the adult population at large. On the other hand, this population is appropriate for a preliminary exploration of the effects of exercise intensity on psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions. Therefore, the present findings cannot be applied to older adults or individuals with chronic diseases. Similar research with more diverse populations is needed. Secondly, this study did not control for the effects of dispositional variables (extraversion, neuroticism, behavioral inhibition) on affective valence and perceived exertion [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is likely that a degree of the observed variation in the psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions may be accounted for by dispositional variables20.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study has provided evidence that psychophysiological responses to group exercise training sessions are intensity-dependent, regardless of differences in self-efficacy beliefs and intensity preferences. Specifically, a moderate-intensity session resulted in lower exercise intensity and perceived activation, less strenuous perceived exertion, and more pleasant affective valence when compared with a vigorous-intensity session performed by active, young adults. From a theoretical perspective, the results of this study provides useful insight into how exercise intensity may influence the associated affective and exertional responses. More importantly, from a practical perspective, it appears that individuals report more positive affective and exertional responses during moderate-intensity exercise sessions, which could create a positive memory of the activity and could hopefully lead to increased motivation for future participation in physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Implications</title><p>The strength of this investigation lies in the implications of the data for professionals involved in exercise prescription. Interventionists can be confident that group exercise training sessions may elicit physiological requirements that fall within the exercise intensity range recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine to promote fitness and health benefits. On the basis of emerging evidence [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it seems appropriate to highlight the potential role of group exercise training programs as a valuable and effective strategy for improving health and fitness in active, young adults. Interventionists can also be confident that group exercise training sessions at moderate intensities are more helpful for maximizing affective responses and minimizing exertional responses than group exercise training sessions at vigorous intensities, regardless of the self-efficacy beliefs or predispositions for certain exercise intensities among the participants. Such recommendations support the growing sentiment that vigorous-intensity exercise may negatively affect future participation in physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149997.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. That is, vigorous intensities may elicit less pleasant exercise experiences, discouraging the continuation of participation in such strenuous activities in favor of more moderate intensities that result in more positive experiences.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0149997.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>American College of Sports Medicine</collab>. <source>ACSM&#x02019;s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription</source>. <publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Lippincott Williams &#x00026; Wilkins</publisher-name>; <year>2006</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0149997.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab>. <source>A global strategy for diet, physical activity, and health</source>. <publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Technical Report Series</publisher-name>; <year>2004</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0149997.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Dishman</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Buckworth</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Increasing physical activity: a quantitative synthesis</article-title>. <source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source>. <year>1996</year>;<volume>28</volume>: <fpage>706</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>719</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8784759</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0149997.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sallis</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haskell</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fortmann</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Vranizan</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Predictors of adoption and maintenance of physical activity in a community sample</article-title>. <source>Prev Med</source>. <year>1986</year>;<volume>15</volume>: <fpage>331</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>341</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3763558</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0149997.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Perri</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anton</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Durning</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ketterson</surname><given-names>TU</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sydeman</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Berlant</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
