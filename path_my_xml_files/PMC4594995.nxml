It causes bouts of acute intestinal inflammation, in an unpredictable relapsing-remitting course, with bloody diarrhoea and extreme urgency to access a toilet. Faecal incontinence is a devastating social and hygiene problem, impacting heavily on quality of life and ability to work and socialise. Faecal incontinence affects 2&#x02013;10 % of adults in the general population. People with inflammatory bowel disease have a high risk of incontinence with up to 74 % affected. No previous study has explored conservative interventions for these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will recruit 186 participants to answer the research question: does implementation of the UK nationally recommended guidance approach to stepwise management of faecal incontinence improve bowel control and quality of life in people with inflammatory bowel disease? We have worked with people with inflammatory bowel disease to translate this guidance into a condition-specific information booklet on managing incontinence. We will randomise participants to receive the booklet, or the booklet plus up to four 30-minute sessions with an inflammatory bowel disease specialist nurse. To be eligible, patients must be in disease remission and report incontinence. The primary outcome measure at 6 months after randomisation is the St Mark&#x02019;s incontinence score. Other outcomes include quality of life, MY-MOP (generic tool: participants set two goals for intervention, grading goals at baseline and then re-scoring after intervention) and EQ-5D-5 L to enable calculation of quality-adjusted life years. Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Qualitative interviews will explore participant and health professionals&#x02019; views on the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Few high-quality studies of conservative interventions in inflammatory bowel disease, and none for faecal incontinence, have been conducted. We have collaborated with patients to design this study. Blinding to this behavioural intervention is not possible, but our self-report outcome measures with a degree of objectivity. There is genuine equipoise between the booklet only and booklet plus nurse arms, and the study will determine if additional support from a nurse is a crucial element in implementing advice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinitrials.gov.uk: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02355834?term=NCT02355834&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02355834</ext-link> (Date of registration: 12 December 2014).</p><p>Protocol version: 4.0. 08.04.15</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0962-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Inflammatory bowel disease</kwd><kwd>Faecal incontinence</kwd><kwd>Nurse-led intervention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, comprising mostly Crohn&#x02019;s disease and ulcerative colitis) is a life-long currently incurable disease affecting approximately 250,000 adults in the UK, 2.2 million in Europe and 1.4 million in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It causes bouts of acute intestinal inflammation in an unpredictable relapsing-remitting pattern, with bloody diarrhoea and extreme urgency to access a toilet. Chronic diarrhoea, rectal inflammation and reduced rectal capacity, disease or surgery which affect the continence mechanism, and a fatigable anal sphincter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] all contribute to a high risk of faecal incontinence (FI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>FI is a devastating social and hygiene problem, impacting heavily on quality of life and ability to work and socialise, and affecting 2&#x02013;10 % of adults in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Urgency and FI are accepted by both patients and clinicians in IBD flare-up, but at least a quarter of people with IBD also report extremely limiting symptoms persisting in remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some young adults are completely housebound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interviews with people with IBD-related FI (IBD-FI) describe multiple life limitations: &#x02018;<italic>the fear of being faecally incontinent has a great impact on your life, and&#x02026; this fear turns into stress and anxiety, which make it more likely that you will be incontinent&#x02026; you enter a vicious cycle. It makes you nervous about going out, using public transport, going on holiday, and having intimate relationships</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The imperative to find a toilet immediately is as limiting as frank incontinence and is reported as happening daily by 89 % of people with IBD during a disease flare and 66 % in remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Poor bowel control and the need for urgent toilet access are among the top ten concerns of people with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some 81.3 % of people with IBD in the UK worry about the availability of toilets whenever they go somewhere new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Crohn&#x02019;s and Colitis UK (patient charity) have prioritised the issue of FI in IBD, funding studies on prevalence and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], experiences of IBD-FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and development of a patient-reported questionnaire for IBD-FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Previous work on FI in non-IBD populations has found that 70&#x02013;80 % cure and improvement is feasible. Patients receiving conservative management in specialist nurse services are highly satisfied with their improvement and report improved ability to live with symptoms and better quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. IBD nurse specialists are widespread in the UK National Health Service (NHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], are highly valued by patients, and view FI as one of their core areas of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, our qualitative and quantitative work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] has found that few IBD nurses offer any intervention specifically for FI. Reasons for this are unclear, but informal discussions suggest the primary barrier is lack of training for IBD nurses in managing FI. Small studies have suggested some benefit for individual specialist interventions for IBD-FI but no comprehensive approach has been evaluated.</p><p>The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] recommends a step-wise intervention algorithm for FI, starting with low-cost conservative interventions such as diet and anti-diarrhoeal medication, bowel retraining and pelvic floor exercises, estimating that 70 % of people with FI can be improved. There are several Cochrane reviews finding that treatments are effective for FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. None has included people with IBD. Co-author AE has found that 18/27 (66 %) IBD patients managed in a nurse-led FI service reported improved continence and 63 % a significantly reduced continence score (unpublished audit). In 218 patients with radiation bowel disease (with similar symptoms) it was found that nurse intervention improves FI and quality of life and produces similar response to gastroenterologist intervention and is significantly better than a booklet alone, with improvements sustained at 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our specialist clinical experience suggests that people with IBD are likely to respond well to the NICE algorithmic approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>We aim to answer the research question &#x0201c;Does implementation of the UK nationally (NICE)-recommended approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to stepwise management of FI improve bowel control and quality of life in people with IBD?&#x0201d; Our objectives are to determine the effectiveness of using IBD nurses to deliver the algorithm of care proposed by NICE for people with FI, compared to provision of the same information in a self-management booklet and to obtain detailed qualitative feedback from patients and staff on the best way of enabling health-seeking, the experience of the intervention and suggestions for future service development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a two-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation intended to show superiority of IBD nurse intervention plus an information booklet, compared with an information booklet alone.

We will emphasise during training the importance of trying not to influence usual care for the booklet arm participants and wherever feasible for another team member to see these patients in consultations (teams are large enough to accommodate this). In reality the IBD nurses are very busy managing acute aspects of IBD and are unlikely to have time to spontaneously provide more intensive input for FI. Our interviews (below) will explore perceptions of whether usual care was influenced by having the trial in progress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Withdrawal criteria</title><p>Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, despite having given consent to take part, without having to give a reason for doing so.

We will ask those who withdraw if their withdrawal is due to the conditions of the study (i.e. too onerous/difficult to adhere to), seeking a simple yes/no answer. No further detail will be sought.

Economic evaluation methods will adhere, as far as possible, to the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The cost of delivery of the nurse-led FI management programme will include: the cost of booklet development and production; the cost of training IBD nurses; the cost of consultations with IBD nurses. In addition to the cost of delivery of the FI management programme, the costs of health care services use by participants will be studied. These costs will cover primary care services including consultations, medication, investigations and referrals to secondary care. Secondary care services will include outpatient appointments, inpatient episodes and accident and emergency department (A&#x00026;E) visits. A resource-use questionnaire asking participants about their use of health care services and medication has been developed using the online Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Primary and secondary care unit costs will be derived from the UK Unit Costs of Health and Social Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

It is important to clinicians as currently they do not address the issue of FI in IBD and have the potential to extend their services to address aspects that bother patients in more holistic care than currently offered. Current clinical services for IBD focus almost entirely on treatment of active disease and gut inflammation, with (to date) very limited attention to other symptoms and problems which stop patients working, participating in society and having a good quality of life. Our qualitative work and data on which interventions patients engage in and why will inform the way services are configured in the future. With a growing number of people living with long-term IBD there are many who could benefit from this research.</p><p>Relatively few high-quality studies of conservative interventions in inflammatory bowel disease have been conducted. We have collaborated closely with patients to design this study to meet their needs. Blinding to this behavioural intervention is not possible, but we have selected self-report outcome measures with a degree of objectivity. There is genuine equipoise between the booklet only and booklet plus nurse arms, and the study will determine if additional support from a nurse is a crucial element in implementing advice.</p><sec id="Sec42"><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered on the publicly accessible registry (clinitrials.gov.uk: NCT02355834).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Trial status</title><p>This protocol (version 4.0, dated 8 April 2015) is that approved by the Research Ethics Committee on 15 April 2015.
