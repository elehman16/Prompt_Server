One session focused on the technical aspects of the tablet and physical measurements. Another session focuses on general disease awareness and communication with patients. The training was performed by members of the trial administration office. General practitioners were responsible for establishing threshold values for physical measurements. Nurses in the patient&#x02019;s residing municipality were responsible for monitoring the data obtained and should incorporate monitoring time duties with their existing job responsibilities. Exemptions were patients with COPD receiving oxygen therapy and patients with COPD with open hospital admissions who were monitored at their hospital as usual. Patients were monitored asynchronously by a nurse on a daily basis. Measurements were classified with either a green, yellow or red code (green code: no threshold values were exceeded; yellow code: one or more values exceeded the threshold values; red code: one or more values exceeded the threshold values and had not previously been recorded). The nurse had the option to contact the patient by telephone and/or the patient&#x02019;s general practitioner and/or dispatch an ambulance.

For those who wished to receive the tablet at a municipality health centre, a 75&#x02009;min appointment was scheduled with 3&#x02013;4 patients in each group. At both appointments, a nurse from the patients&#x02019; municipalities demonstrated the use of the tablet and instructed patients in how to conduct physical measurement. Patients were asked to measure their vital signs daily during the first 2&#x02009;weeks (both weekdays and weekends) and 1&#x02013;2 times weekly after the first 2&#x000a0;weeks. A 45&#x02009;min follow-up visit was scheduled 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;weeks after the first appointment to check if the patient used the device appropriately and if the threshold values of the physical measurements needed to be adjusted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group: device</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All patients received the same device and peripherals.

Community care administered by municipality district personnel comes at regular intervals based on a clinically based estimate of the patients&#x02019; needs, but these personnel are not necessarily certified nurses and often not fully educated in COPD and not on call</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as the total cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained measured from baseline to follow-up at 12 months. In defining the total costs, this trial adopted a healthcare and social care sector perspective (including hospital services, primary care, medicine, home care services and rehabilitation).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Healthcare service use and healthcare costs</title><p>Healthcare and social care service use were all estimated based on register data by applying a unique civil registration number that all Danish citizens have and that makes precise linkage between registers possible. National patient-level data for all hospital contacts were collected from the Danish National Patient Register,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which contains all inpatient, outpatient and emergency ward visits in Denmark. The total costs for each contact is a variable in these datasets and are valued based on the diagnose-related group, the actual procedures conducted and the duration of the contact.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The included admissions, outpatient and emergency ward visits were in the main analysis restricted to those defined as COPD-specific in the Danish Register for COPD.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p><p>All contacts between patients and the primary care sector were collected from the National Health Insurance Service Register.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The costs for each contact is part of the dataset and are valued based on fees negotiated in a collective agreement.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> At present, it is not possible to identify the cause of contact to the primary care sector, so all contacts are included.</p><p>Medication use was taken from The Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics that contains information about what prescribed medicine citizens purchase in Denmark.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> For this analysis, these are restricted to patient-level medicine associated with COPD (R03 ATC codes), specific antibiotics, antifungals and medicine for anxiety, all associated with the treatment of COPD&#x000a0;exacerbations, as well as medicine for smoking cessation. The costs for each product is given in this dataset and is valued based on a standardised pharmacy consumer price.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p><p>Patient-level community care service use was collected from individual care systems in each of the 26 included municipality districts. The type and duration of standard care activities such as personal care, practical help, home nursing care and rehabilitation activities are routinely recorded for each contact. Each municipality district values contacts differently based on an internal calculated mean hourly cost. It was pragmatically decided to value time consumption in municipality districts as an average of the reported hourly costs from municipality districts. Four of the 26 municipality districts in the trial were implementing a different information technology (IT) system at the time of data collection, which meant that rehabilitation costs for these four municipality districts were unavailable (2 municipality districts in the telehealthcare group and 2 in the usual care group).</p><p>Healthcare service use was collected for 12&#x02009;months to allow for within-trial costs to be calculated. In addition, patient-level health service use was also collected 12 months prior to randomisation, because it was suspected that baseline differences in costs could occur that would not be explained by differences in health status or sociodemographic characteristics by patients, for example, due to variations in referral and visitation practises across municipality districts.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention costs</title><p>Costs associated only with the clinical trial, preparing the organisation and developing the telehealthcare solution were excluded. Intervention costs were costs of hardware and peripherals, installation and deinstallation costs, maintenance and support costs, training costs for healthcare professionals, patient-specific training, monitoring costs and project management costs.</p><p>Per person costs of the &#x02018;package&#x02019; of telehealthcare equipment (the so-called &#x02018;Telekits&#x02019; consisting of a tablet and peripherals) were calculated. The &#x02018;Telekits&#x02019; supplied were exactly the same for all patients and was purchased to each patient ahead of the trial and valued as prices paid. The per person costs of installation/deinstallation and swopping any defects in the equipment was negotiated with an external supplier prior to the trial and valued as prices paid. Per patient maintenance and support costs consisted of software licenses and data charges, technical support to patients and healthcare professionals as well as IT&#x000a0;infrastructure and application maintenance and valued as prices paid. Costs associated with IT&#x000a0;infrastructure&#x000a0; and application maintenance was not dependent on the number of patients in the trial but the software and hardware configuration employed by the telehealthcare solution which in principle could include all patients with COPD and patients with chronic heart failure. It was decided to allocate these costs on the estimated number of patients with COPD and chronic heart failure in North Denmark Region (10&#x02009;500 patients).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> The per patient costs of training healthcare professionals were based on planned time spent conducting education workshops in COPD disease awareness and the telehealthcare solution, the number of conducted workshops and the average hourly wage for a community district nurse. Per patient costs of patient-specific training were based on planned time and valued based on a mean hourly wage for a community district nurse. Time spent per patient on monitoring were estimated by time registries in the municipality districts and valued based on a mean hourly wage for a community district nurse. Based on the experiences gained with the implementation in the trial period, it was estimated that it would be necessary to have an administrative officer employed to &#x02018;run&#x02019; the telehealthcare solution, should it be implemented in routine practise (coordinating activities, contract supervision, etc). Project management costs were valued as mean yearly salary for an administrative officer including all standardly available pensions and pay supplements.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> As with IT&#x000a0;infrastructure and application maintenance, these costs could be allocated on more patients than in the trial and they were therefore also allocated on the estimated number of patients with COPD and chronic heart failure in North Denmark Region (10&#x02009;500 patients).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref>

At baseline, missing data for the EQ5D summary score were present for 8% of the participants (48 in the telehealthcare group; 53 in the control group). One hundred and three patients died during the trial period (8%; 50 in telehealthcare group; 53 in control group) and they were assigned an EQ5D summary score of 0 at follow-up that were used in the QALY calculation.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In addition, 27% had missing data on the EQ5D summary score at follow-up (199 in the telehealthcare group; 133 in the control group) either due to non-response or to incomplete registration of EQ5D questionnaire items. Twelve percent had missing values on rehabilitation costs (79 in the telehealthcare group; 73 in the control group). Complete data for both total costs (ie, all cost categories), baseline EQ5D score and EQ5D score at follow-up were available for 751 patients (61%; 325 in telehealthcare group; 426 in control group).</p><p>Current good practise for trial-based economic evaluation recommends that analyses should account for missing data by imputation, especially when there is a large amount of missing data.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The applied imputation procedure followed the principles recommended by Faria <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Missing data were assumed missing at random (MAR), which can be a plausible assumption if a wide range of variables, and variables that are predictive of missingness, are included in the imputation model.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Therefore, missing data on EQ5D scores, rehabilitation costs and baseline characteristics were imputed using the <italic>mi impute chained</italic> command in STATA12.1 and 30 complete datasets were created. Continuous variables were imputed by predictive mean matching and categorical variables by multinomial logistic or logistic regression. Imputation models included outcome variables, predictors for the outcomes at both time points and predictors for missing observations in the individual variables. The imputation models were estimated separately by treatment group and included the clustering variable, measures of health-related quality-of-life (EQ5D scores), costs at baseline or at 12 months follow-up (in the categories presented in table 4), measures of disease status (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), diastolic and systolic blood pressure), smoking status, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, mental illness or musculoskeletal disorders) and sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status, education and employment status).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis followed an intention-to-treat principle. The statistical analysis applied multilevel modelling for continuous variables that rely on near-normality,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> which has been suggested as an analysis strategy for cost-effectiveness research of cluster-randomised trials.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> To allow for different sets of covariates, estimation of incremental total costs and incremental QALYs gained was based on two separate linear mixed effects models; one for total costs and one for QALYs. Total costs were controlled for treatment arm, baseline EQ5D score, baseline costs (total costs 12 months prior to randomisation), age, baseline FEV1%, presence of musculoskeletal disease (a significant cost driver in municipality districts) and clustering. QALYs gained were controlled for treatment group, baseline EQ5D score, age, gender, baseline FEV1%, marital status, presence of diabetes, presence of cancer and clustering. These estimations were facilitated by the <italic>mi estimate: xtmixed</italic> command with robust standard errors.

However, it became apparent that the included patients suffer from a variety of diseases concomitant with COPD (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>). As part of the intervention, it is therefore plausible that a more integrated care and monitoring approach assisted by the telehealthcare technology could also prevent some hospital contacts due to comorbidities. Some of the measurements facilitated by the Telekits could be indicative of cardiovascular disease and especially chronic heart failure. The effect on incremental costs of including all hospital contacts was therefore explored.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Baseline

Therefore, an effect of a 30% discount on Telekit equipment, installation, support and maintenance was explored. Thirty&#x000a0;percent is an estimate stemming from experiences with negotiating procurement prices subject to large-scale implementation of telehealthcare in the Danish healthcare sector.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> In addition, suppliers have stated that the costs of maintenance (IT&#x000a0;infrastructure and applications) and support costs does not depend on the number of patients included, but the complexity of the hardware and software configuration.

Only in the most optimistic scenario combining the effects of all sensitivity analyses, does the ICER fall below the&#x000a0;UK thresholds. The telehealthcare solution is therefore unlikely to be cost-effective for all included patients with COPD.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study is the largest trial-based cost-utility study of telehealthcare to patients with COPD in Denmark so far. A relatively broad range of cost categories from contacts with healthcare and social services are included and these contacts are all based on register data routinely registered in Denmark. A healthcare and social sector perspective was chosen that excludes transportation costs, time spent by patients and relatives and productivity loss to society. But travel distances in Denmark are relatively short compared with other larger countries (the longest distance to a university hospital is 160&#x02009;km) and only 11% of the patients enrolled in the trial stated that they are employed (5% are full-time; 6% part-time).</p><p>Data on each monitoring contact was available for 21 of the 26 municipality districts included (the remaining 5 districts has reported aggregated time spent monitoring each participant during the trial&#x000a0;period). The median number of monitoring encounters within these 21 districts was 53 out of 64 planned contacts.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although monitoring does not represent all facets of adherence and we do not have complete data for each individual encounter, it does suggest that participants in general were willing to engage with the TeleCare North initiative.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that single-level multiple imputation with clustering as a fixed effect was performed. Gomes <italic>et al</italic> has found that an imputation approach that accounts for clustering as a random effect performs better than single-level imputation.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> More specifically, Andridge have in a simulation study found that including clustering as a fixed effect in the imputation model could overestimate the uncertainty of the estimates, especially if the number of clusters are small and the ICC is low as in this case.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, a barrier to the adoption of multilevel multiple imputation is that these techniques are not part of conventional statistical software. Furthermore, separate modelling of costs and effects were performed in the analyses of incremental QALYs and costs, which could be less statistically efficient than joint modelling,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> although a multiway sensitivity analysis in a simulated cost-effectiveness study of bivariate multilevel models set to small correlations between costs and outcomes also perform reasonably well under the circumstances of this trial (eg, a small number of clusters and unequal cluster sizes).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
</p><p>Smoking status is an important risk factor for COPD<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and the proportion of non-smokers was lower in the intervention arm, which was not accounted for in the randomisation (eg, through minimisation). However, the difference in smoking status between intervention and control group is not statistically significant (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, p=0.103) and including smoking status as an additional covariate in the QALY and cost models have little impact on treatment effects (ie, incremental QALYs is reduced from 0.01316 to 0.01288 with smoking status included and incremental costs is changed from &#x020ac;728 to &#x020ac;705).</p><p>The way telehealthcare was implemented may have affected cost-effectiveness. The involved organisations and healthcare professionals underwent a steep learning curve after implementation of the telehealthcare solution, where they had to find new ways of working together and adapt to new work procedures. Monitoring is one example and personnel became more efficient at the end of the trial, when the needs and reactions of patients as well as work tasks were more familiar to municipality healthcare personnel. Other implementation effects such as how care-coordination across municipality districts, hospitals and general practitioners&#x000a0;actually occurred or the engagement of health professionals and involved organisations could also have affected cost-effectiveness, but is hard to quantify post hoc.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>To our knowledge, three other studies have recently published cost-effectiveness results for telehealthcare involving patients with COPD and they all demonstrated a low probability of cost-effectiveness by the standards of their countries.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54&#x02013;56</xref> A British study (Whole System Demonstrator) concludes that telehealth as a supplement to usual care is not likely to be cost-effective for patients with COPD, diabetes and chronic heart failure primarily due to a &#x02018;similar&#x02019; QALY-gain and high intervention costs,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> although this does not exclude that the COPD subgroup is cost-effective. The Telescot initiative for patients with COPD concludes that their telehealth initiative was associated with a non-significant QALY-gain and higher costs.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> A study based in Northern Ireland also concludes that telehealthcare is not cost-effective.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Our findings are similar (non-significant QALY-gain and higher costs), but contrary to the UK experiences, it is not the intervention costs alone that have a considerable effect on the cost-effectiveness of telehealthcare, but rather differences in community care costs and the failure to save costs on COPD-related hospital contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Implications for clinicians and decision-makers</title><p>When interpreting small differences in effectiveness, it is important to be aware that results can be highly sensitive to between-group differences in death. Even though, it is standard practise to assign an EQ5D summary score of 0 to deceased patients<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> in order to calculate incremental QALYs, this practise could potentially have a drastic effect on estimated cost-effectiveness. However, in this case the estimated between-arm QALY difference from the imputed dataset and an analysis where this EQ5D scoring is not done, is similar (QALY difference reduced from 0.01316 to 0.01004).</p><p>With regard to cost&#x000a0;differences, it was suspected that baseline differences in costs could occur that would not necessarily be explained by differences in health or sociodemographic characteristics, for example, due to variations in visitation practise across municipality districts. The results demonstrate a big difference between adjusted and unadjusted costs and this raises the issue of the relevance of adjusting for baseline cost, if it makes such a large difference in a randomised study design. If baseline cost is removed as a covariate in the analysis of adjusted total costs, incremental costs rise from &#x020ac;728 to &#x020ac;1334. Recent guidance for trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluation suggest that baseline resource use should be collected and that the analysis of both costs and effects <italic>could</italic> include baseline measures of costs,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> which is also recommended by van Asselt <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> However, guidance is not as explicit as including baseline utility in the analysis of QALYs.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> In our opinion, the baseline difference in cost reported in this study underlines the importance of requesting information on institutional context, such as variations in existing resource patterns, when interpreting cost-effectiveness research.</p><p>Danish decision-makers has determined that if the telehealthcare solution in this trial proves cost-effective, it can serve as a national Danish standard for a technological platform as well as an implementation model for telehealthcare to this patient group.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> However, the results suggest that the target COPD&#x000a0;population in this study may have proven to be too broad. An implication could be that decision-makers should await further research, at least into sources of heterogeneity or explanations of the results from this trial, for&#x000a0;example, there was a 10% difference in service cost before inclusion of intervention-related costs and plausible explanations could be that patients randomised to telehealthcare became more aware of their disease and hence used more resources or it could be that especially municipalities discovered patients with an unmet need for home care when telehealthcare was introduced. Future research planned within this trial would seek to tap into explanations for this difference. It is unknown whether the telehealthcare solution has released its full potential for cost-effectiveness. It is therefore important for healthcare professionals and decision-makers to spend time learning from the experiences gained within the trial in order to investigate if any best practises could be implemented that would increase effectiveness and/or reduce cost without compromising safety and effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Future studies</title><p>This study indicates that telehealthcare could potentially assist in hindering some COPD-related hospital contacts&#x000a0;and hospital contacts associated with other diseases (incremental costs were reduced by applying all-cause hospital contacts). It could be a coincidence but also due to closer collaboration between healthcare delivery organisations or more frequent monitoring of physical measurements that may also be indicative of other diseases. Future studies should therefore investigate the link between telehealthcare, patients with COPD with well-defined comorbidities and hospital contacts.</p><p>Average cost-effectiveness estimates applied in this and other studies could in general hide important sources of heterogeneity. Not much is known on prognostic criteria (eg, sociodemographic, geographic, lifestyle or health characteristics of the patients) for cost-effectiveness of telehealthcare to chronically ill patients, so further heterogeneity studies should be conducted and are also planned within this trial.</p><p>Telehealthcare is a complex intervention involving a broad class of technologies&#x000a0;and organisational infrastructures, actions of healthcare professionals and patients. Experimental evaluation research has been criticised for being atheoretical in nature in trying to understand why and under what circumstances complex interventions are (un)likely to lead to desired outcomes.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> In this study, mechanisms leading to higher health-related quality of life and cost in the telehealthcare group has largely been treated as a black-box, where patient education, monitoring, emotional support, assisted planning, etc could all have an effect.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We would recommend that future cost-effectiveness studies are more informed by a programme theory, such as the TECH model<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> that was used in the Healthlines cost-effectiveness studies.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62 63</xref> These studies explicitly sought to describe implementation context or account for the causation of the most important telehealthcare&#x000a0;activities that were most likely to activate mechanisms that could lead to &#x02018;efficient&#x02019; design and deployment of telehealthcare. However, context and mechanisms that specifically gave rise to between-arm differences in EQ5D in the Healthlines studies are difficult to identify, reflecting that programme theories are often focused on explaining trial-related aspects or outcomes (eg, smoking cessation or weight loss). In the future, context and mechanisms leading to between-arm differences in EQ5D and costs should receive more attention in programme theory development.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014616.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><p>
