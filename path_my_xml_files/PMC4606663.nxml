To prevent endodontic treatment failure irrigation is mandatory for the effective removal of smear layer, pulp tissue, and microorganisms.

In 1965, Kakehashi <italic>et al.</italic> convincingly established the role of bacterial infection in pulpitis and apical periodontitis. In 1970, Sundqvist determined that most bacteria in endodontic infections are strict anaerobes.</p><p><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is the most commonly isolated species from oral infections including marginal periodontitis, infected root canals, periradicular abscesses, and also detected in cases of failed endodontic therapy. <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has the potential to get adapted for the survival in a variety of adverse environments. Moreover, hence it can survive in root canal infections where the availability of nutrients.</p><p>Shaping and cleaning is the most important step in root canal treatment. This eliminates the microbial infection from the root canal space and from the dentinal tubules. This can be achieved with the help of irrigants for the removal of organic tissue, smear layer, as well as the microorganisms. Irrigation dynamics also play an important role, and the effectiveness of irrigation depends on many factors like the working mechanism of the irrigant and the ability to contact with the microorganisms and the tissue debris present in the root canal complex.</p><p>There are many innovative approaches in irrigation protocol to enhance the action of irrigants. The combined use of many irrigants in sequential order may help in eliminating the organisms effectively. However, caution should be exercised when using the combined irrigation protocol because of the chemical interaction between the irrigation solutions that result in precipitation in the root canal space. Hence, the application of final irrigating solution should remain active at the time of application, as well as over a long period of time, for preventing bacterial recolonization or eliminating the bacteria that persist after root canal treatment. The most common final irrigation protocol includes various irrigants specifically, a chelating agent followed by an antimicrobial irrigant to remove both the inorganic and organic components of smear layer from the surface of instrumented root canals. The alternate use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), a deproteinizing agent, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a calcium chelating agent has been recommended for its efficient removal.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These irrigants must be brought into direct contact with the entire canal wall for effective action.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Most of the studies, done on the microbiota of root canals in teeth with failed endodontic treatment have used culture techniques for bacterial identification. Cultivation, which is the traditional identification method has limitations when it comes to microbiological identification. In contrast, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection methods enable rapid identification of both uncultivable and cultivable microbial species with high specificity and sensitivity. Hence, in the current study, PCR was selected to evaluate the effectiveness of different irrigants against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Twenty single rooted premolars were taken were taken stored in 0.1% thymol solution at 4&#x000b0;C decoronated to obtain 12 mm length, teeth were autoclaved at 121&#x000b0;C, canals were instrumented up to 35k file (International Organization for Standardization).

It is commonly associated with root canal failure cases, and it is able to survive in the root canal as a single organism or as a major component of the flora. <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe, and is most commonly found in the root canals of failing endodontically treated cases.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It can survive as a monoinfection in root canals.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has displayed resistance to chemo-mechanical preparation[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and intracanal medication.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The persistence of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> may stem, from its capability to form biofilms in root canals.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] If bacteria are located only on the root canal surface, the intracanal medicaments can reach and may present efficacy against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. <italic>E. faecalis</italic> showed resistant to the antibacterial action of irrigants when they are lodged in deep layers that are within the dentinal tubules.</p><p>In the current study, PCR was used as measuring tool since it provides many advantages than the traditional culture methods. PCR is currently a more precise method for detection of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This method provides to be faster, more sensitive, and more accurate than culturing methods and has enabled researchers to detect bacteria that were difficult.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] When compared to detection of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> by culturing (24&#x02013;70%), <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has been found at consistently higher percentages (67&#x02013;77%) when a PCR detection method is used.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] An important distinction needs to be made between what is evaluated by culture and PCR assays.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The viable bacterial cells were counted by culturing as colony-forming units. Molecular methods measure nucleotide sequences, and the PCR method allow amplification of very minute quantities of deoxyribonucleic acid to detectable levels.</p><p>The selection of endodontic irrigants that synergistically have the ideal properties was a major point in the present study. CHX, in a 2% gel or liquid concentration, is effective at eliminating <italic>E. faecalis</italic> from the dentinal tubules.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A 2 min rinse of 2% CHX liquid can be used to remove <italic>E. faecalis</italic> from the superficial layers of dentinal tubules up to 100 _m.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Concentrations of 1&#x02013;2% CHX when combined with calcium hydroxide had the efficacy at killing <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] When CHX was combined with calcium hydroxide, the combined mixture had a greater ability to kill <italic>E. faecalis</italic> than calcium hydroxide mixed with water.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Two percentage CHX gel, when combined with calcium hydroxide, achieves a pH of 12.8 and can completely eradicate <italic>E. faecalis</italic> within dentinal tubules.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It is important that CHX alone has been shown to provide as good or even better, antimicrobial action against <italic>E. faecalis</italic> than calcium hydroxide/CHX combinations.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Until further studies have been conducted, an intracanal dressing of 2% CHX placed for 7 days may be the best way to eradicate <italic>E. faecalis</italic> from dentinal tubules and the root canal space[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In other <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, CHX -impregnated, and iodoform-containing gutta-percha points have shown little inhibitory action against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Unlike NaOCl, CHX lacks a tissue dissolving property. Therefore, NaOCl is still considered to be the primary irrigation solution used in endodontics.</p><p>This study, Group III treated with 5.25% NaOCL and 17% EDTA and 2% CHX showed the least regrowth, followed by Group II 17% EDTA and 2% CHX after 14 days and rest of the groups showed increased regrowth after 14 days.</p><p>The final irrigation with CHX provides good antimicrobial activity and imparts substantivity. This Group III irrigation combination and the order of irrigation solution used both provide higher antimicrobial activity when compared to Group I and II. The NaOCl at 5.25% dissolves organic tissue and kill bacteria. And EDTA was used as the next irrigant, which act as chelating agent removes the smear layer. Since EDTA effectively abolishes the tissue dissolving effect of NaOCl this was not used as the final irrigant. Alternating use of NaOCl and EDTA during instrumentation is a common practice. Since EDTA abolishes the tissue dissolving effect of NaOCl and should not be used until at the end of the treatment as the final rinse.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] CHX was used as final irrigant that increases the antimicrobial spectral activity. This result is in accordance with Zamany <italic>et al.</italic> in 2003 reported a further reduction in the proportion of positive cultures in the CHX group. Their results showed a better disinfection of the root canals using CHX compared to saline as a final rinse.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The main use of an irrigant is to reduce the bacterial load during root canal treatment. The application of a final irrigating solution that remains active not only at the time of application but over a fairly long period of time is paramount.</p><p>The sequential use of NaOCl and a chelating agent or acid that dissolves inorganic tissue is required. Hence, the protocol for smear layer removal is NaOCl followed by EDTA or citric acid. Even though EDTA or citric acid removes the smear layer, they cannot do it completely without the preceding use of NaOCl. Water, saline CHX or iodine compounds have no dissolving effect on the smear layer.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The Group II, which is 5.25% NaOCl, and CHX provide better antimicrobial activity than Group I.</p><p>Moreover, Group I showed the least antimicrobial activity. Moreover, when using the irrigants in combination, the chemical interaction between the irrigants should also be considered.</p><p>Bui <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] evaluated the effect of irrigating root canals with a combination of NaOCl and CHX on root dentin and dentinal tubules by using scanning electron microscope and indicated that there were no significant differences in the amount of debris remaining between the negative control group and the experimental groups, although there were significantly fewer patent tubules when compared with the negative control group and concluded that the NaOCl/CHX precipitate tends to occlude the dentinal tubules and suggested that, and caution should be exercised when irrigating with both NaOCl and CHX. However, CHX lacks a tissue dissolving property. Therefore, NaOCl is still considered to be the primary irrigation solution used in endodontics.</p><p>Grawehr, <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] studied the interactions of EDTA with NaOCl and concluded that EDTA retained its calcium-complexing ability when mixed with NaOCl. However, NaOCl loses its tissue dissolving capacity when used with EDTA. Hence, EDTA and NaOCl should be used separately. In few situations the copious amount of NaOCl should be administered to wash out remnants of EDTA.</p><p>Sodium hypochlorite is the most important irrigating solution during root canal treatment and should be used throughout the instrumentation. In higher concentrations, it kills bacteria and lower concentrations it dissolves organic tissue. Final irrigation with EDTA should be done to complete the removal of the smear layer and to continue the antimicrobial effect. Using CHX as final irrigation after EDTA provides good antimicrobial activity because of its substantivity. Alternating the use of NaOCl and EDTA during instrumentation is not advocated as EDTA effectively abolished the tissue dissolving effect of NaOCl and may increase erosion of dentin. For the same reason, a final NaOCL rinse after smear layer removal is not recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of this study combination of irrigants and its sequential use have a valuable role in root canal treatment in eliminating the microorganisms.
