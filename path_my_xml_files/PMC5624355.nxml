Several different MRI protocols have been described: combined MRI investigations appear to be most reliable while unenhanced MRI protocols show lower risk of complications from contrast media (<xref rid="bibr3-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). MRI has not been established yet in clinical practice (<xref rid="bibr5-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) but shows high sensitivity and specificity on a patient based level, in particular for central PE (<xref rid="bibr3-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Among the limitations of MRI have been a high proportion of technically inadequate investigations (<xref rid="bibr3-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), mainly due to poor vessel opacification and motion artifacts. We have developed a steady-state free precession (SSFP) protocol, with five repetitive slices in each anatomical position instead of respiratory gating, which shows promising results (<xref rid="bibr7-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies regarding MRI for detection of PE, it is mostly experienced senior radiologists who have interpreted the exams (<xref rid="bibr1-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, in a clinical setting, radiology residents are often the first to review emergency investigations such as cases of suspected PE (<xref rid="bibr9-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We wanted to investigate if it would be possible for residents to review MRI exams regarding PE. A supported self-directed training program consisting of a brief introduction followed by training sessions was developed consisting of MRI exams from a previous study (<xref rid="bibr7-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Measurable data regarding the learning process during radiology residency is scarce (<xref rid="bibr10-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

By plotting learning curves with performance against amount of practice, it is possible to detect at which levels education is most efficient and amount of training required for a certain level of competence (<xref rid="bibr12-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate if radiology residents can be trained to review MRI regarding PE.

In the previous study, the diagnostic performance of MRI was compared to CTA. All patients were examined with a diagnostic CTA according to clinical routine, followed by the MRI exam within a maximum of 48&#x02009;h after the CTA. The local ethics committee has approved the study and informed consent was obtained from each resident participating in the training program within the study. Informed consent from the patients was obtained within the previous study.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2058460117734244"><title>CT protocol</title><p>The CT exams were performed by a 64-section CT scanner (Lightspeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) according to the standard protocol for investigating PE at the radiology department.

The protocol was based on a two-dimensional free-breathing SSFP protocol performed in three orthogonal planes. No intravenous contrast agents or respiratory gating was used. More detailed information regarding MRI parameters can be found in our previous study (<xref rid="bibr7-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In each anatomic position five repetitive slices were acquired, which were sorted by position producing stacks with multiple images in different phases of the cardiac and breathing cycle.

Location of PE was assessed based on vascular territories as described by Joshi: central; lobar (right upper lobe, middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe, lingula and left lower lobe); segmental; and subsegmental (<xref rid="bibr9-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Segmental and subsegmental arteries were sorted by their supplying lobar artery.</p><p>The residents were instructed to only read and report findings regarding PE in the pulmonary arteries. Secondary findings of PE, such as pulmonary infarction and other potential findings, e.g. pleural effusion, infiltrates, and tumors, were not assessed. The most proximal embolus in each vascular territory was reported. Review time for each examination was also registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec7-2058460117734244"><title>Training program</title><p>The 70 individuals were divided into ten training sessions with seven MRI exams in each. After completing a training session, the resident submitted the results and received feedback on each case compared to a reference standard based on a consensus reading by two specialists. The residents also obtained corresponding CTA exams for comparison before continuing with the following training session.</p><p>Four residents in radiology (R1&#x02013;R4) performed the training program independently after receiving brief instructions. Resident R1 had 3.5 years of experience in radiology and five weeks of experience in general MRI. R2 had three years of experience in radiology and three weeks of MRI experience. R3 had 4.5 years of training in radiology and three months of practice in MRI. R4 had 2.5 years of training in radiology and two weeks of practice in MRI. Thus, all residents were familiar with CTA to diagnose PE but had limited experience in MRI and none had any previous experience in vascular MRI. To compensate for potential differences in difficulty in the different sessions, two residents (R1 and R2) analyzed the data in chronological order starting with session 1, while the other two residents (R3 and R4) analyzed the data in the reversed order starting with session 10.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-2058460117734244"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Regarding review time, descriptive statistics, including mean and range for each reviewer, and MRI protocol were obtained.

There was also a small reduction of false negatives, from two during the first three sessions to none in the last three sessions. It was also noted that all residents except for R3 found session 6 more difficult than previous sessions.

The study showed a significant reduction in reading time and improved inter-reader agreement compared to the reference standard during the training program.</p><p>Comparing the first three training sessions with the last three sessions, the review time was nearly halved during the training program. Three out of four residents showed a similar learning curve effect, with a steep decrease in review time during the first training sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2058460117734244">Fig. 2</xref>). The pattern was similar regardless of the order of the training program, which favors a learning-curve effect before random differences in difficulty in the different sessions. The resident (R3) with the different learning curve appearance, without a steep decrease during early training sessions, was the most experienced reader and also by far the fastest at the beginning. His learning curve showed a gradual slight decline in reading similar to the other residents following the first sessions of steep decrease. The appearance of PE in MRI and CTA are similar and it is possible that R3 had an advantage of being more experienced in CTA compared to the other residents. However, his result regarding inter-reader agreement at the beginning of the program was not better than the others.</p><p>The shortest review time was merely 13&#x02009;s, which would seem extremely short from a clinical point of view. However, this was a case of a saddle embolus affecting both the right and left pulmonary artery. Since the resident had been instructed to only record the most proximal finding in each vascular territory, no further evaluation was required within the study, which explains the short reading time.</p><p>Inter-reader agreement compared to the reference standard illustrated by kappa values was chosen as measure of diagnostic accuracy. Two residents (R3 and R4) showed a clear improvement during the training program while the other two residents (R1 and R2) showed a weaker improvement over time both with a difficulty in session six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2058460117734244">Fig. 1</xref>). Cohen described kappa values in the range of 0.81&#x02013;1.00 as nearly perfect to perfect agreement. However, in medical sciences it has been argued that kappa values &#x0003c;0.80 should not be accepted (<xref rid="bibr14-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). By the final three training sessions, the residents provided kappa values in the range of 0.91&#x02013;1.00 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2058460117734244">Table 1</xref>), which would seem to be a clinically acceptable level.</p><p>The average review time for the training program was 4&#x02009;h 35&#x02009;min. We did not register the amount of time used for feedback and comparison with the reference standard, but the estimated average time spent on the training program was about one day per resident spread over 1&#x02013;2 weeks. The teaching effort was also limited including the gathering of cases and a short introduction for each resident. Therefore, we argue that similar training programs can be easily applied in most radiological departments.</p><p>Two previous studies comparing residents&#x02019; reading of CTA regarding PE with fully trained radiologists in a clinical setting (<xref rid="bibr9-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) did use discrepancy rates instead of inter-reader agreement. Despite the different statistical methods, the results by the end of our training program appear similar, which also suggests that the diagnostic level of our residents was sufficient. Comparing our results with a previous study on learning curve effects in residents regarding a muscular structure on MRI (<xref rid="bibr10-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), we found a larger variance regarding initial kappa values, but better results by the end of the training program with nearly perfect or perfect agreement. A contributing factor to our results could be that PE has a similar appearance on CTA and MRI, why detection of PE might be easier than identification of a previously unknown muscular structure. However, there are differences in MRI signal compared to CTA attenuation regarding the assessment of PE, which the novice reader must get used to. Also, the artifacts differ in MRI compared to CTA and might be mistaken for embolus by an inexperienced reader. Among our MRI exams there were cases of phase mismapping, since no gating was used. The repetitive series in each anatomical position were supposed to account for these and we assume they did as the reviewers got used to the exams. There are also a number of flow motion artifacts that may be misinterpreted. It should be mentioned that our study did not focus on the kind of artifacts occurring but rather on the presence or absence of PE.</p><p>There were a high proportion of false positives at the beginning of the training program, probably due to misinterpreted artifacts, while only a few false negatives were recorded. In our previous study where two specialists reviewed the MRI exams, there were no false positives (<xref rid="bibr7-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which suggests a learning-curve effect in less experienced readers.</p><p>Although the results in our study show promising learning curve effects regarding both time and inter-reader agreement, there are a number of weaknesses in the study design. First, the occurrence of PE and the number of larger emboli was higher than expected, which indicates selection bias. This has been discussed in our previous study (<xref rid="bibr7-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Second, the number of residents is small, but the consistent findings support the results. Third, the size of each training session was small, only consisting of seven individuals; however, we wanted the residents to receive feedback within short intervals. In a few groups, there were no true positives, thus it was impossible to calculate kappa values. To solve the problem, consecutive sessions were grouped into pairs and kappa values were calculated based on 14 individuals. Fourth, using a consensus reading of the MRI exams by two specialists instead of the CTA exams as the reference standard makes the results dependent on the specialists&#x02019; level of expertise. We chose this reference standard because it was known that there were two cases in the training program where isolated subsegmental emboli had disappeared between the CTA and MRI exams. It should also be noted that many studies on learning curve effect use a senior experienced radiologist as the reference (<xref rid="bibr9-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Lastly, each resident except for R2 had forgotten to record the review time for one exam: R1 in session 3; R3 in session 1; and R4 in session 8. However, this is not likely to have had a significant effect on the results.</p><p>The training program used in our study was designed as a supported self-directed learning program, which has been suggested as a method to stimulate deep learning (<xref rid="bibr10-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Reviewer training and experience are considered important factors in achieving a high diagnostic accuracy (<xref rid="bibr16-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) but the effects of previous radiologic experience on the ability to learn new radiologic methods have not been determined (<xref rid="bibr10-2058460117734244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In our study, we found a learning curve effect for all residents, but the most experienced resident did not perform better on diagnostic accuracy by the end of the training program than the less experienced residents.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that residents can review our MRI protocol regarding PE following a short training program. It also illustrates the benefits of self-directed training programs when residents are introduced to a new kind of examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-2058460117734244"><title>Declaration of conflicting interests</title><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="sec15-2058460117734244"><title>Funding</title><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine and Stockholm City Council.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2058460117734244"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ohno</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Higashino</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Takenaka</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>
