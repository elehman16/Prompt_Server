We addressed the hypothesis that anthelminthic treatment in pregnancy and early childhood would improve responses to immunisation and modulate disease incidence in early childhood with both beneficial and detrimental effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Entebbe, Uganda [ISRCTN32849447]. In three independent randomisations, 2507 pregnant women were allocated to receive single-dose albendazole or placebo, and praziquantel or placebo; 2016 of their offspring were randomised to receive quarterly single-dose albendazole or placebo from age 15 months to 5 years. Primary outcomes were post-immunisation recall responses to BCG and tetanus antigens, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia; incidence of eczema was an important secondary outcome. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Of 2345 live births, 1622 (69%) children remained in follow-up at age 5 years. 68% of mothers at enrolment, and 11% of five-year-olds, had helminth infections. Maternal hookworm and <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> were effectively treated by albendazole and praziquantel, respectively; and childhood hookworm and <italic>Ascaris</italic> by quarterly albendazole. Incidence rates of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 py, respectively. Albendazole during pregnancy caused an increased rate of eczema in the children (HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.15&#x02013;2.17), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005). Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reduced incidence of clinical malaria (HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.73&#x02013;0.98), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). There were no consistent effects of the interventions on any other outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Routine use of albendazole in pregnancy may not always be beneficial, even in tropical developing countries. By contrast, regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control where helminths and malaria are co-endemic. Given the low helminth prevalence in our children, the effect of albendazole on malaria is likely to be direct.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN32849447">ISRCTN32849447</ext-link>

</p><p>Helminths induce potent type 2 and regulatory immune responses, both of which may oppose the type 1 responses required for protection against other pathogens, or by vaccines, <xref rid="pone.0050325-vanRiet1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> thus increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases either directly, or through diminution of vaccine effectiveness. Conversely, down-regulation of unwanted inflammatory responses during chronic helminth infection may have benefits. Contrasting effects of helminths on susceptibility to malaria infection, and on the damaging inflammatory sequelae, may explain in part the conflicting results of previous studies on helminth-malaria interactions, some of which suggest detrimental, and some beneficial, effects. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Nacher1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> Benefits may also include the prevention of allergy and autoimmunity, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Bach1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> which are rare in tropical, developing countries. <xref rid="pone.0050325-1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Prenatal exposure to helminths may be particularly important: <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to maternal helminths has long term implications for the child's response to related worm infections <xref rid="pone.0050325-Malhotra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but whether such immunological effects have a measurable impact on efficacy of unrelated vaccines <xref rid="pone.0050325-Labeaud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or on incidence of unrelated infectious diseases, and whether these effects may be reversed by the administration of anthelminthics during pregnancy and early childhood, is less clear. Helminth infections in early childhood may also have important effects on the responses generated as children undergo their initial exposures to infections and allergens.</p><p>We established the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study to investigate effects of helminths and their treatment during pregnancy and early childhood on immune responses to vaccines and on susceptibility to infectious and allergy-related diseases in early childhood. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Findings in infancy showed little effect of maternal helminths, or of their treatment during pregnancy, on vaccine and infectious outcomes, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Elliott2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> but significant adverse effects of maternal anthelminthic treatment on infantile eczema. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Mpairwe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> We have now investigated the effects of quarterly albendazole versus placebo in preschool children, as well as the longer-term effects to age 5 years of the intervention in pregnancy, on the recall response to BCG and tetanus immunisation given in infancy, on incidence of infectious diseases (malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia) and eczema, and on other outcomes for which anthelminthic therapy has been proposed to be beneficial: anaemia, growth and cognitive development. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Bethony1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>

The intervention was given under direct observation, during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>When children made their first quarterly visits from age 15 months onwards, they were randomised in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio to receive quarterly albendazole or placebo. All children of participating mothers were eligible for inclusion. From age 15 to 21 months, children received syrups (5 ml) equivalent to 200 mg albendazole or matching placebo, labelled according to the randomisation code by the manufacturer. From age 2 to 5 years, children received chewable tablets of albendazole (400 mg) or matching placebo, packaged and sealed by an independent committee of Medical Research Council staff in Entebbe, not otherwise involved in the study, into consecutively numbered envelopes according to the randomisation code. Trained study nurses allocated the numbers sequentially and gave the quarterly intervention, observing that it was taken correctly. All participants and study staff were blinded to the drug allocation throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>Women provided a single stool sample prior to randomisation and following delivery; all received anthelminthic treatment six weeks after delivery. Their children were followed up for routine immunisations, and then quarterly, to age 5 years. Children received BCG and oral polio immunisations at birth, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B immunisations at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, and measles immunisation at 9 months. At routine annual visits, blood and stool samples were collected, and growth outcomes recorded. Irrespective of their allocated intervention group, children found to have helminth infections on examination of the annual stool sample were treated as indicated for the species identified.</p><p>Primary outcomes were immune response at age 5 years to BCG and tetanus immunisation, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and tuberculosis during childhood. Following evidence from our preliminary study of a possible effect of maternal helminths and of albendazole treatment during pregnancy on infantile eczema, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Elliott3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> allergy-related disease events were added as an important secondary outcome for the main trial. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Other secondary outcomes were growth and anaemia assessed at routine annual visits, and cognitive development. We also considered asymptomatic <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasitaemia recorded at routine annual visits, as an unplanned exploratory outcome.</p><p>Immunological assays were simplified compared to the original protocol, for logistic and cost reasons. The recall response to vaccines given during infancy was assessed at 5 years using cytokine responses to crude culture filtrate proteins (cCFP) of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and antigen 85 (a major secreted protein complex that exhibits cross-reactivity between many mycobacterial species), and to tetanus toxoid, as indicators of response to BCG and tetanus immunisation. We examined stimulated interferon-&#x003b3; (type 1), interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 (type 2), and interleukin-10 (regulatory) responses in a whole-blood assay, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0050325-Elliott4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

</p><p>Illness outcomes were detected prospectively when sick children were brought to the clinic for treatment. Malaria was diagnosed as fever (&#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C) with any parasitaemia (whether asexual forms or gametocytes); diarrhoea was diagnosed based on the mother's definition; <xref rid="pone.0050325-Cousens1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> pneumonia was defined as cough with difficulty in breathing, and fast breathing (defined by age), with or without abnormal breath sounds; <xref rid="pone.0050325-WHO4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> measles was defined by standard clinical criteria confirmed by measurement of specific antibody; <xref rid="pone.0050325-Morley1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> children with suspected tuberculosis were investigated as clinically indicated; <xref rid="pone.0050325-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> eczema was defined as a recurrent itchy rash with either wet, weeping skin or dry, scaly skin, and with a typical distribution. One study doctor underwent specialised training in the diagnosis of skin conditions at the National Referral and Teaching hospital in Uganda, and trained other doctors at the study clinic, to ensure accurate and consistent definition of eczema. For development outcomes, children were assessed at age 5 years at the study clinic for cognitive ability, executive function and motor ability using 13 measures created or adapted for the study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050325.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050325.s002">Table S1</xref>). <xref rid="pone.0050325-Nampijja1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>
</p><p>Haemoglobin was estimated by Coulter analyzer (Beckman Coulter AC-T 5 diff CP; Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland).

For recall responses to immunisation, allowing for anticipated loss to follow-up, samples from 1046 children assessed at 5 years would detect differences in cytokine responses of 0.14 log<sub>10</sub> between maternal or childhood intervention groups, assuming a standard deviation of 0.80 log<sub>10</sub>.</p><p>For illness events, a detrimental effect of anthelminthic treatment was anticipated for malaria and eczema, and a beneficial effect for other infections. For the childhood intervention, estimated effect sizes that could be detected were rate ratios of 1.07, 0.94, 0.81 and 1.30 for malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and eczema, assuming rates in the placebo group of 80, 100, 10 and 5 per 100 person-years, respectively. The study had power to detect slightly smaller long-term effects of the maternal interventions, since the follow-up time (from birth to 5 years) was longer. The incidence of both tuberculosis and measles was expected to be low, therefore only very large differences in rates would be detected.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the childhood intervention on the prevalence of each helminth, we combined data from all annual visits, examining the overall effect of each treatment using generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) allowing for within-child correlations.</p><p>Cytokine and antibody responses showed skewed distributions, some with disproportionate numbers of zero values. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> were transformed to log<sub>10</sub>(concentration+1) and analysed by linear regression with bootstrapping to estimate bias-corrected accelerated confidence intervals. <xref rid="pone.0050325-McGuinness1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> Regression coefficients were back-transformed to give geometric mean ratios.</p><p>For long-term effects of maternal interventions on incidence of diseases in childhood, time at risk began at birth. For effects of the childhood intervention, sample size calculations assumed time at risk from age 1 to 5 years. However, recognising that the intervention actually commenced when the child took the first intervention dose, the analysis plan was modified such that time at risk began at the date of randomisation and receipt of the first dose (age 15 months, or later if the child missed the 15-month visit). For both analyses, time at risk was censored at loss to follow-up, death or age 5 years. All children were included until censoring, regardless of whether or not they had made a clinic visit for illness. For each disease, we calculated incidence rates for all events. Episodes within 14 days of an initial presentation with the disease were considered to be part of the same episode and excluded from the analysis; time at risk was adjusted accordingly. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the effect of treatment on all-events disease incidence were calculated using Cox regression with robust standard errors to allow for within-child clustering. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia at each annual visit was compared between treatment groups using logistic regression.</p><p>Sex-specific z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height at 5 years were derived from WHO growth standard reference scales, using WHO Anthro version 3 for children measured when aged less than 5 years and 1 month and WHO AnthroPlus version 3 for children who were measured more than 1 month (and less than 2 months) after their fifth birthday. We examined the effects of the interventions on the continuous z-scores and on haemoglobin at each annual visit using linear regression. We also combined data from all annual visits, examining the overall effect of each treatment using GEE linear regression models to allow for within-child correlations. Effects of the interventions on tests of motor and cognitive functioning at 5 years were examined using linear regression.</p><p>For the maternal interventions, two pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed, examining effects of albendazole treatment in children of mothers with hookworm infection, and effects of praziquantel treatment in children of mothers with schistosomiasis. Differences between subgroups were examined by fitting interaction terms in regression models. For the childhood intervention we conducted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of malaria incidence by age group, fitting an interaction term to test for effect modification. Interactions between the childhood intervention and each maternal intervention were also examined by fitting interaction terms in the regression models.</p><p>All p-values are two-sided with no adjustment made for multiple comparisons. Data were analysed using Stata version 11, except for developmental scores, for which SPSS version 16.0 was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>2507 women were enrolled between April 2003 and November 2005.

All-event incidence rates for malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 person-years, respectively. Measles and tuberculosis were very rare in the cohort with only 1 and 4 episodes observed, respectively, so it was not possible to evaluate the impact of anthelminthic treatment on incidence of these diseases. Neither maternal albendazole nor maternal praziquantel had any effect on the incidence of malaria, diarrhoea or pneumonia overall, or in the pre-specified sub-group analyses. Maternal albendazole was associated with a higher rate of eczema overall (HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.15, 2.17), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005) but maternal praziquantel showed no such effect (HR 1.15 (95% CI 0.83, 1.58), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050325-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050325-t005">Table 5</xref>). The effect of maternal albendazole treatment was strong in infancy (HR 1.78 (95% CI 1.25, 2.55), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002) and a diagnosis of eczema during infancy was a strong predictor of further eczema in 1&#x02013;5 year olds (HR 6.36 (95% CI 3.60, 11.22), p&#x0003c;0.001). After adjusting for a previous diagnosis of eczema in infancy there was little evidence of an independent effect of maternal albendazole in children aged 1 to 5 years (HR 1.20 (95% CI 0.75, 1.93), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.44). The adverse effect of maternal albendazole appeared to be stronger among children of mothers without hookworm than among children of mothers with hookworm, but the interaction was not statistically significant (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15).

We found no substantial effect of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy on the child's response to immunogens, on infectious disease incidence, or on anaemia, growth, motor or cognitive development, to age 5 years. By contrast, treatment with albendazole during pregnancy had an adverse effect on the incidence of eczema in childhood. These longer-term results accord with our findings in infancy <xref rid="pone.0050325-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Mpairwe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Helminth infection prevalence was unexpectedly low during early childhood, and this limited our ability to assess the effects of the childhood intervention against them. However, we found that quarterly albendazole from age 15 months to 5 years reduced malaria incidence, with strongest effect between age 15 months and 2 years.</p><p>Many studies on the effects of helminths and their treatment are flawed due to bias and confounding, because of strong associations between helminth infections and poverty, deprivation and poor health care. A strength of this study was its randomised, placebo-controlled design, which resulted in the balanced distribution of many potential confounding factors between the treatment arms. Helminth prevalence during pregnancy was high: the detection of at least one species among 68% of women using a single stool sample implies that almost all women were infected. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Knopp1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Utzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> By contrast, the low prevalence of helminth infection among children was our chief limitation. For ethical reasons, effective treatment was provided annually to children found to be helminth-infected; therefore annual prevalence figures represent not cumulative infection since birth, but cumulative incidence since the most recent treatment. Although quarterly albendazole reduced infection rates with <italic>Ascaris</italic> and hookworm, the numbers infected were so small that any consequence of this reduction would have had to have been very strong to be detected in this study. Questions as to the effects of helminth infection and their regular treatment in preschool children therefore remain unanswered. A possible bias is suggested by the somewhat higher uptake of the childhood intervention by children receiving placebo, compared to those receiving active drug. However, we had no evidence that either staff or participants had inadvertently been unblinded to treatment allocation. Mothers of children who participated in the childhood intervention differed from mothers of children who did not. This is unlikely to have biased our treatment effect estimates since characteristics of participants were balanced between treatment groups. However it may have reduced our power to detect effects of anthelminthic treatment since the participants who were lost tended to have higher prevalence of some helminths, and could have some implications for generalisability since children who participated in the childhood intervention were on average from slightly more well-off families within the study setting. We examined the effects of three interventions, each on multiple outcomes; all analyses except for one exploratory outcome (asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia) were pre-specified, however the possibility that our positive findings are due to chance alone cannot be discounted. Rather than formally adjusting for multiple testing we interpret consistent results for related outcomes as providing stronger evidence of a true treatment effect.</p><p>In keeping with results in infancy, we found no effect of maternal anthelminthic treatment on recall responses to vaccine antigens at age 5 years. Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reductions in type one and type two immune responses to cCFP, but this was contrary to the predicted effect of removing either worms or malaria and was not reflected by responses to antigen 85, so these rather weak effects may have arisen by chance.</p><p>We have previously reported that albendazole treatment during pregnancy was associated with increased incidence of infantile eczema, while praziquantel was associated with increased infantile eczema among the offspring of mothers with schistosomiasis, and that infantile eczema was associated with skin prick test positivity to common allergens in this cohort. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Mpairwe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> Eczema incidence declined, as expected, after infancy and we now show that the incidence of newly diagnosed eczema after age 1 year was similar between maternal treatment groups: thus the principal impact of maternal albendazole was in infancy. The effect of praziquantel treatment during pregnancy among infants of mothers with schistosomiasis <xref rid="pone.0050325-Mpairwe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> waned with the longer follow-up period. Eczema in infancy, however, remained a strong predictor of subsequent episodes, and the long term impact of intrauterine exposure on allergy-related outcomes such as asthma remains to be determined. The effect of maternal albendazole was as strong among children of women without hookworm (and indeed among women without any helminth infection) as among children of hookworm-infected women, implying a mechanism involving effects on other organisms (such as malaria, as discussed below), or a direct effect on the developing immune system. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Mpairwe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> The lack of effect of our childhood intervention on eczema &#x02013; unintentionally tested largely in the absence of helminths &#x02013; suggests that this adverse effect of albendazole was confined to the prenatal period, in keeping with studies suggesting that prenatal exposures are critical in the programming of allergy-related disease. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Martino1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>
</p><p>Given the low prevalence of helminths in childhood, we were surprised by the effect of childhood albendazole on malaria incidence. This seems unlikely to be a chance finding, because illness events and asymptomatic parasitaemia showed the same pattern. Direct inhibition of malaria by benzimidazoles, including albendazole, has been demonstrated in vitro, <xref rid="pone.0050325-SkinnerAdams1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> but effects in vivo differ between animal models. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Dow1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> The effect was predominantly seen between age 1 and 2 years, in the vulnerable period when maternal immunity has waned and individual immunity has not yet been established: but this does not accord with the general experience that antimalarial drugs have greater benefit among individuals with good immunity than among those with poor immunity. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Rogerson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Thus the potential contribution of regular albendazole treatment to the control of malaria in young children merits further investigation in trials designed with this as the primary outcome. The observed effect of childhood albendazole on malaria also has implications for the interpretation of other studies addressing effects of benzimidazole anthelminthics on growth, anaemia and mortality: outcomes for which malaria is likely to have a more potent impact than helminths. For example, Alderman and colleagues found benefits of albendazole for growth when given to preschool children on child health days in malaria-endemic regions of Uganda. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Alderman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> Similarly, the findings complicate the interpretation of trials intended to assess the immunological effects of removing helminths on susceptibility to malaria, such as that recently reported from Nigeria, in which regular provision of albendazole in preschool children reduced the prevalence of <italic>Ascaris</italic> and attenuated the increase in malaria prevalence that occurred over time. <xref rid="pone.0050325-Kirwan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>
</p><p>Our findings raise concerns regarding the policy of routine &#x0201c;deworming&#x0201d; with albendazole during pregnancy in developing countries. Our study commenced in a setting of high helminth prevalence, but low intensity. This picture has changed rapidly in Entebbe, as in many towns across sub-Saharan Africa, with rapid development and urbanisation over the last two decades: over 30% of Africans are now estimated to be &#x0201c;middle class&#x0201d;. <xref rid="pone.0050325-AfDB1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> These demographic changes are accompanied by epidemiological transition with non-communicable diseases, including allergy-related conditions, <xref rid="pone.0050325-AddoYobo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> emerging as important health issues. While routine anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy may be acceptable in rural settings where hookworm infection is still high, we believe it should be avoided in urban settings where helminth infections are now low. Conversely, we found no statistically significant adverse effect of albendazole in preschool children, and large controlled trials suggest little impact of routine anthelminthic treatment among school children on allergy-related disease, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050325-Flohr1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> so it seems reasonable for on-going mass treatment of worms to continue in these age groups, even as helminth prevalence becomes marginal. Regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control, especially in areas where helminths and malaria are co-endemic, and where IPTi is hampered because SP resistance is high.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050325.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>
