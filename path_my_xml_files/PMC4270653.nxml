Background</title><p>Anxiety is the most common emotional response in women during delivery, which can be accompanied with adverse effects on fetus and mother (<xref rid="A14455R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). During labor and childbirth, anxiety, fear, stress and pain is a continuous chain and more anxious mothers need more sedatives at different stages of labor (<xref rid="A14455R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Anxiety is often involved in pain, especially chronic pain, due to its progressive and gradual nature. When the pain becomes uncontrollable, human coping skills are declined and anxiety increases. Anxiety leads to feel intense pain and a vicious cycle begins (<xref rid="A14455R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Increased anxiety and pain improve catecholamine release and stimulation of alpha receptors by sympathetic nervous system, which in turn causes vasoconstriction, increased muscle tone and decreased uterine blood flow, increased blood pressure, loss of uterine contractions, slowing progression, and increased metabolism and oxygen consumption in mothers (<xref rid="A14455R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, techniques to reduce anxiety would decrease both anxiety and pain. Special training in labor anxiety management is essential for maternity professionals, especially midwives (<xref rid="A14455R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Antianxiety agents have some side effects including anesthesia and muscles relaxation, headache (<xref rid="A14455R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Recently, complementary and attributable medicine CAM has been under investigation as a new obstetric care for women during pregnancy and after delivery (<xref rid="A14455R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Aromatherapy is a kind of alternative medicine using essential oils and fragrant with stimulating the olfactory system to induce relaxation and reduce anxiety (<xref rid="A14455R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Although scientific studies have not shown its complete efficacy, it is believed that aromatherapy can act like medications on brain and nervous system. Aromatherapy decreases pain and induces relaxation by increasing neurotransmitter and reduces epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood (<xref rid="A14455R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The ester in oily essences prevents muscle spasms, anxiety and depression (<xref rid="A14455R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Different methods of aromatherapy in labor such as inhalation, bath, footbath, and massage could be helpful (<xref rid="A14455R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="A14455R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Essential oils can be absorbed through the respiratory system, leading to stimulation of the brain and relieving anxiety (<xref rid="A14455R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Footbath is a common practice in aromatherapy. Local heat therapies are generally safe and considered as an effective form of complementary medicine. It basically means "as a tool to promote peace, create positive emotions, comfort, pleasure and fun to be part of supportive care". Mechanisms responsible for the influence of footbath are not yet fully clear, but soaking feet in warm water to stimulate the sense of touch by massaging or washing can reduce sympathetic nerve activity, which its cause is not known, as the main mechanism is to increase comfort to reduce pain (<xref rid="A14455R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As an experimental care, footbath is applied by midwives in Japan during the first stages of labor (<xref rid="A14455R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>One of the essential herbs used in aromatherapy is rose. Rose scent is effective on the central nervous system. Two materials, sytrinol and 2-phenyl ethyl alcohol, in roses are known as antianxiety agents (<xref rid="A14455R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Using oil rose reduces anxiety by 71% in labor and only 14% of them need local anesthesia (<xref rid="A14455R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The difference in results of various studies is probably due to different techniques of aromatherapy (<xref rid="A14455R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In a review on the use of aromatherapy in childbirth, Caroline and colleagues found different results and recommended further researches (<xref rid="A14455R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Using complementary and alternative medicine as a low-risk, cost-effective, easy and with limited side effects treatment in nursing and midwifery cares is growing in many medical centers. Although some scientific evidences showed safety and efficacy of most CAM methods on people's health, proving the effectiveness and usefulness of this method of treatment requires further studies (<xref rid="A14455R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Despite the acceptance of alternative medicine techniques, physicians rarely use CAM due to lack of adequate investigations (<xref rid="A14455R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is necessary to conduct more clinical studies to find safe and effective psychotherapeutic approaches to reduce anxiety and pain in labor. </p></sec><sec id="sec65892"><title>2.

Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomized clinical trial study was conducted with two intervention groups and a control group in Akbar Abadi hospital in Tehran, Iran in 2012. Akbar Abadi Hospital is a governmental referral specialized hospital for women. </p><p>This research project was part of a thesis approved by the Research Council of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Code; 8743/250/DE/90) and was approved by the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, (code; 90/D/130/2260 date 2012/2/18) and registered in Iranian registry of clinical trials (code; IRCT201112192751N4). The participants were given a full explanation before sampling. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients were excluded at any time if were not willing to continue. Blindness was not possible due to the nature of the intervention in this study. The sample size was calculated as (power = 80%, exposure = 20%, &#x003b1; = 0/05) 120 patients. Nulliparous women with gestational age of 38-42 weeks, cephalic presentation and 3 cm dilatation without a history of asthma, allergies and skin disorders like eczema and any skin disorder were included. Exclusion criteria were all mothers not in the natural course of labor who required special care or emergency cesarean or had sensitivity to the use of essential oils. </p><p>To determine the sample size, the significance level of alpha = 0.05 and the test power of 80% were considered. Interventions were considered effective when anxiety scores reduced in the intervention groups than the control group (d = 1.7). Based on similar studies, the standard deviation in test and control groups were 3 and 2.2, respectively. Finally, 34 samples were calculated; with assuming a loss of 20% of the samples, the required sample size was determined 40. </p><p>Finally, the study was conducted on 108 patients (36 patients in each group), and (36 controls). Four women who received pethidine, three due to lack of cooperation in putting their legs in bath, one due to fetal heart rate below 100, one suspected abruption, one due to lack of labor progression, and two without effective contraction who received oxytocin were excluded from the study. Sampling was random assignment. For sampling, the first three eligible ones were given a closed envelope that was inside the nominal groups. First, one of the three envelopes was returned. Second prize is one of the two remaining envelopes were returned. Moreover, the last one was back in the last pack. Sampling was performed in the first three patients, respectively.</p><disp-formula id="EQ1216"><mml:math id="MML1216"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>(</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>xm</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>)</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mi>(</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>)</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><p>Visual ruler to measure anxiety during labor (VASA) (Visual Analog Scale For anxiety) was used.

Consequently, most participants (31.6%) in the first group had grades 6 to 8 of anxiety and (41.7%) in the second group, they had anxiety between 4 to 6. The anxiety score after the first intervention was reduced more in the second group, but with progression of labor, anxiety is more, so anxiety scores during labor at the beginning of the transition phase in the second group were in the range of 6 to 8, but in the first group it was in the range of 4 to 6 and was reduced further compared to baseline score. This decrease was due to the use of rose oil, thus rose oil requires little time to start its effect. </p><p>Anxiety scores in transitional phase after the second intervention in the first group reached the lowest level possible, 0 to 2, but in the second group it remained in the range of 6 to 8. This difference may indicate that reuse of essential oils was more effective in transitional phase and anxiety scores were more reduced. Besides, hot footbath was effective to reduce anxiety and prevent further anxiety, but anxiety remains stable in the range of 6 to 8. It shows that warm footbath can reduce anxiety to a certain range, but one intervention is not enough. It could be the effect of the second intervention, which increased the anxiety. Anxiety in the control group remained the most in all phases in the range of 8-10.</p><p>Via inhaling nice smells, the olfactory receptors convey messages to the brain and affect memory, thought and emotion. Olfactory memory in response releases neurotransmitter. Enkephalin reduces pain. Endorphins reduce anxiety and consciousness is associated with increased release of noradrenalin (<xref rid="A14455R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Aromatherapy with rose oil and footbath can reduce anxiety by reducing sympathetic stimulation.</p><p>More investigations are needed to reach more accurate conclusions about the effectiveness of aromatherapy in childbirth. The week point of this study was its non-blindness. Blindness was not possible due to the nature of the intervention in this study.</p><p>Overall, both interventions were effective to reduce anxiety of mothers and caused them to feel safe, comfortable and more satisfied. This method is recommended as a complementary modality in supportive care as a low-risk, cheap and functional modality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research group would like to thank the Research Department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for financial support of the project.
