Significant improvement of pruritus, sleep and life quality was noted especially after 6 months. Also, frequency and intensity of disease exacerbations and the usage of topical corticosteroids was reduced.

A genetic predisposition is well documented. The disease severity can range from infrequent, localized skin affections at predeliction sites to acute exacerbation of the entire skin leading to erythrodermia requiring hospitalization. The patients suffer from significant reductions in their quality of life due to pruritus, sleeplessness and stigmatization <xref rid="pone.0020566-Boguniewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0020566-Werfel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The pathogenesis of AD is complex. Apart from genetic factors responsible for a predisposition, several alterations of the skin immune system (e.g. differences in the amount of anti-microbial peptides produced by keratinocytes, alterations in the phenotype and function of epidermal dendritic cells with the appearance of normally absent IDEC) and stromal cells (e.g. filaggrin mutation) are important <xref rid="pone.0020566-Boguniewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Acute exacerbation of disease is characterized by a dense infiltrate of the dermis with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells showing a Th2-phenotype. Under more chronic conditions, the Th2 predominance is shifted towards a Th1 immune response as shown in atopy patch test experiments <xref rid="pone.0020566-Boguniewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Therapy of AD is based on a regular treatment with basic emollients supplemented with intermittent immunosuppressive therapy of exacerbated skin disease. According to (inter)national guidelines, immunosuppression can be achieved either locally by application of corticosteroid- or calcineurin inhibitor-containing ointments or systemically (e.g. using cyclosporine A, reserved for severe AD) <xref rid="pone.0020566-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020566-Werfel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, UV irradiation (especially UVA1) has proven to be beneficial in those heavily affected patients in whom the above mentioned interval therapy with local immunosuppression is not sufficient for disease control. However, UV radiation has been shown to be carcinogenic and thus, UV phototherapy is usually not recommended as long-term treatment, and for young and immunosuppressed patients <xref rid="pone.0020566-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0020566-Werfel2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>More recently, it was suggested that blue light irradiation may represent a therapeutic alternative for long term control of AD. Krutmann <italic>et al.</italic> showed that blue light irradiation was found to induce a significant clinical improvement of atopic hand and foot eczema <xref rid="pone.0020566-Krutmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, anecdotal treatment of several patients with severe AD was reported to be helpful for long-term control of disease. Thus, in the present study we assessed the clinical efficacy and histopathological alterations induced by blue light treatment of patients with severe, chronic AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Prior to the initiation of the present observational study, the study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the State Rhineland-Palatinate (Ethik Komission, Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz), Germany.

Eosinophil counts were slightly elevated as compared to controls (9.2&#x000b1;1.2&#x00025;) and remained the same throughout the observation period. Basic ECP levels were well above normal (56&#x000b1;27 ng/ml). Interestingly, 15 days and after 3 months after irradiation therapy initiation, increased levels of ECP were detected of up to 78 ng/ml, which decreased to baseline by the sixth month. We also assessed the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF&#x003b1; and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) in the serum of AD patients. Serum levels of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1; and IL-10 were low and no significant changes observed. IL-4 and IL-5 were negative. Serum TARC was elevated in our AD patient collective at day 0 (1,286&#x000b1;142 ng/ml), but obvious alterations over time were not observed.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Histological findings</title><p>To assess blue light-mediated alterations in the specific skin inflammatory infiltrate of AD patients, we obtained skin biopsies from 19 patients on day 0, day 5 and day 15 post therapy initiation.</p><p>First, because mast cells (MC) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, MC numbers in lesional tissue were assessed in Giemsa-stained sections.

AD has been shown to be induced by (antigen-specific) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that in the acute phase resemble Th2 cells, whereas chronic AD is characterized by infiltrating Th1 cells. Interestingly, when comparing the number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in skin, unlike UV-mediated effects <xref rid="pone.0020566-Finlay1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we did not observe a decrease in the number of T cells infiltrating the skin.

A relative increase in the number of CD1a<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC was observed for both dermal DC as well as Langerhans cells (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07). Since the staining intensity of the LC for CD1a appeared increased as well (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020566-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we performed additional stainings for HLA-DR, expressed by APC as well as activated T cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020566-g006">Figure 6A</xref>&#x0002b;B). Both dermal DC and LC expressed more HLA-DR. Thus, in summary, unlike effects of UV, blue light therapy did not lead to a DC depletion from skin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Atopic dermatitis is a common disease with high socioeconomic impact. In the present study we assessed the efficacy and potential mechanism of action of blue light irradiation therapy of patients with severe, chronic AD. In line with a prior report about treatment of atopic hand- and foot eczema <xref rid="pone.0020566-Krutmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, both the clinical response and the patient assessments showed that full body blue light irradiation may serve as attractive treatment alternative for AD providing long term control of disease.</p><p>Interestingly, one of the first signs of a clinical response was a decrease in the pruritus as reported by the patients. The overall clinical response was determined as a &#x0223c;50&#x00025; improvement after 6 months as assessed by using the EASI <xref rid="pone.0020566-Hanifin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Other important parameters such as the frequency and intensity of disease exacerbation, topical corticosteroid use and the total quality of life were also improved. Interestingly, the majority of patients observed AD resolution as well as a reduction of their pruritus after 2&#x02013;3 cycles of treatment (10&#x02013;15 single irradiations), thus decisions about a continuation of treatment can be made early.</p><p>Comparisons with regard to the effectiveness of blue light irradiation as compared to e.g. UV-based treatment regimens are not appropriate. However, it appears that classical first-line treatment of acute AD with UVA1 leads to a more rapid improvement that does not last as long <xref rid="pone.0020566-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0020566-DerPetrossian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>: improvement based on reductions of the clinical response were &#x0223c;30&#x00025; after 1 week <xref rid="pone.0020566-Meduri1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, &#x0223c;67&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; after 3 weeks of cold-light UVA1 and medium-dose UVA1, respectively <xref rid="pone.0020566-vonKobyletzki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, &#x0223c;35&#x00025; after 3 weeks of medium-dose cold-light UVA1 <xref rid="pone.0020566-Polderman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and &#x0223c;32&#x00025; and 47&#x00025; after 2 and 4 weeks of bath PUVA compared to 24&#x00025; and 45&#x00025; after 2 and 4 weeks of UVB <xref rid="pone.0020566-DerPetrossian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The improvement observed in our patients who were selected based on their unresponsiveness to classical interval therapy with class II-III topical corticosteroids may thus be comparable to that of classically used UVA1 irradiation <xref rid="pone.0020566-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020566-Werfel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, improvement of long term disease control and not the ability to provide rapid, acute intervention for disease exacerbation may be the main feature of blue light therapy. The overall effectiveness of UV treatment on AD is well accepted. However, UV is one of the main risk factors for the development of epidermal or melanocytic skin tumors <xref rid="pone.0020566-Greinert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, the development of UV-free irradiations with proven therapeutic effect is beneficial.</p><p>All patients included in the present study were suffering from long-lasting AD with no response to standard interval treatment using topical class II-IV corticosteroid application. Thus, blue light treatment can be considered an &#x0201c;add on&#x0201d; therapy as compared to their prior treatment protocol. However, the contribution of the combinatory therapeutic approach to the overall efficacy of the treatment needs to be evaluated further.</p><p>Due to the non-interventional, observational nature of the present study, not all patients agreed to complete all questionnaires and came to follow up assessments. Because of the study design, patients were usually re-evaluated when they experienced a flare up just before they received another cycle of irradiation, so the assessments may in some cases underestimate the overall clinical response. In addition, since treatment cycles are offered only when disease worsening is observed, not all patients received the same amount of irradiation. To better estimate the degree of response in relation to established therapies such as other UV-light treatments, clinical trials with proper control groups need to be conducted.</p><p>Using skin biopsies and serological analyses, we have started to investigate the mechanism of action of blue light irradiation in AD. Similar to other treatment modalities, a visible effect of this treatment on serum parameters (i.e. total IgE, ECP, etc.) was not obvious <xref rid="pone.0020566-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020566-Werfel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As described previously, despite the observation that a certain Th1/Th2 ratio in the skin correlates with disease severity, serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were low and no significant changes observed. Serum TARC was elevated in our AD patient collective prior to the study as reported <xref rid="pone.0020566-Saeki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but alterations were not achieved by therapy.</p><p>The blue light-mediated alterations in the inflammatory infiltrate of the skin involved the absence of signs of lymphocyte or DC/LC apoptosis. Our findings are in line with a recent publication demonstrating that application of visible blue light did not cause DNA damage or early photo-ageing; the biological effects observed on normal skin were transient melanogenesis and cellular vacuolization without resulting apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0020566-Kleinpenning1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, the authors concluded that (short-term) utilization of visible blue light in dermatological practice may be safe <xref rid="pone.0020566-Kleinpenning1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our observations are in stark contrast to the well known effects of UV-light on skin inflammation, which include T cell apoptosis, and depletion of LC from skin <xref rid="pone.0020566-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020566-Grundmann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, UV-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulator T cells (Treg) are expanded by UV-exposed cutaneous LC <xref rid="pone.0020566-Loser1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Both the induction of apoptotic cell death, and the induction of Treg producing IL-10 results in UV-mediated local immunosuppression <xref rid="pone.0020566-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020566-Weichenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In aggregate, even though in retrospect the time points chosen for obtaining the biopsies may not have been optimal and futures studies should attempt to analyse skin responses also at later time points, the effects of blue light on skin inflammation appear to be mediated by a mechanism different from that of UV light. With regard to the molecular targets of blue light irradiation, oxidative stress is potentially relevant. In addition, the degree of DNA damage and/or immune modulatory mechanisms need to be analysed.</p><p>In summary, despite this highly selected patient collective with high disease activity and severity, our data strongly suggest that blue light irradiation may represent a suitable treatment option for AD providing long term control of disease. In addition to very few side effects, a good clinical outcome was observed together with a high patient satisfaction. Our data together with more information on a possible mechanism of action will have to be confirmed and extended in a larger patient cohort within a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work is part of the dissertations of Elise Langer and Martin Seemann.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0020566-Boguniewicz1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
