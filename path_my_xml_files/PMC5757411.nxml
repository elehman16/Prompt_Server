admissions and, for those admitted involuntarily, longer admissions. As advocated in the
UK Francis report, we investigated the hypothesis that improving staff training improves
patients&#x02019; views of ward care.</p></sec><sec id="sec_a2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Cluster randomised trial with stepped wedge design in 16 acute mental health wards
randomised (using the <italic>ralloc</italic> procedure in Stata) by an independent
statistician in three waves to staff training. A psychologist trained ward staff on
evidence-based group interventions and then supported their introduction to each ward.
The main outcome was blind self-report of perceptions of care (VOICE) before or up to 2
years after staff training between November 2008 and January 2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec_a3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 1108 inpatients took part (616 admitted involuntarily under the English
Mental Health Act). On average 51.6 staff training sessions were provided per ward.
Involuntary patient's perceptions of, and satisfaction with, mental health wards
improved after staff training (N582, standardised effect &#x02212;0&#x000b7;35, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;57 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;12,

further admission under a legal sanction (Csipke <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; van der Post <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) such as the English Mental Health Act (MHA).
Those subsequently readmitted also have poorer therapeutic relationships and service
engagement and their admissions tend to be longer by about 70 days and are therefore more
costly (Williams <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Given that engagement and therapeutic
relationships are important for all patient outcomes, improving the experience of inpatient
care is a key target for all, but particularly for those who do not accept inpatient
services and are admitted involuntarily under an MHA legal sanction. Long before the Francis
Report (Francis, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) highlighted grave
shortcomings in inpatient care, concerns had been raised about the poor quality of services
in mental health. The most recent report by the UK Care Quality Commission (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) painted a bleak picture of mental health inpatient
care, particularly the increasing numbers of people detained and compulsorily treated. This
cycle of poor perceptions of inpatient care and increasing numbers of people compulsorily
treated might be broken if we can find cost-effective ways to improve the inpatient
therapeutic environment, which then has an effect on patient perceptions.</p><p>Many patients and frontline staff themselves complain about the quality of psychiatric
inpatient care, often citing the concern that there is very little to do which results in
intense boredom (Mind, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, Ward Watch: Mind's
campaign to improve hospital conditions for mental health patients, Star Wards, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This is not a purely UK phenomenon as
professional organisations and patient advocacy groups internationally (e.g. Mental Health
Council of Australia, US National Alliance on Mental Illness) recommend that patients should
have access to 4&#x000a0;h/week of therapeutic activities in inpatient settings in addition to
one-to-one staff contact (Cresswell <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Our earlier cross-sectional study (Csipke
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) of patient perceptions of ward care found that
activity and one-to-one sessions with staff were associated with better perceptions of care.
Like others we also found, unsurprisingly, that satisfaction with care was poorer in those
who were compelled legally to accept inpatient care (Katsakou <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Smith <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; van der Post <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although there have been some successful
attempts at introducing activities (Hansen &#x00026; Slevin, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Dodds &#x00026; Bowles, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), nurses still report the primary reason for not spending time on therapeutic
activities or direct patient contact is the need to resolve crises, increasing
administration and their perception of a lack of skills necessary to implement
evidence-based activities (Ward &#x00026; Cowman, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Seed <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Our intervention consists of providing a supported staff training programme for
evidence-based therapeutic activities. We thought that this may redress the skill shortage,
build self-confidence in staff and encourage more staff contacts and activities. We
hypothesised that all these effects should benefit patients&#x02019; perceptions of the therapeutic
environment and that was also the view of our service user collaborators. The pathway from
intervention to impact is complex by including improvements in staff morale, changes in
activities, provision of opportunities for patients to attend as well as effects on patients
themselves. None of these effects are mutually exclusive. We therefore tested the simple
effect of whether staff training changes patient perceptions of the therapeutic environment.
Because patients who had been admitted under a legal section have much poorer perceptions of
care and poorer outcomes, we specifically hypothesised that the staff-training intervention
would have effects on the perceptions of this group.</p><p>The study aims were: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>To investigate patient perceptions of ward care following staff training and support

involuntarily admitted patients.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>To examine the impact of the programme on patients&#x02019; perceptions of the amount of care

of the intervention is randomised so wards randomised to receive staff training remained
in the intervention arm subsequently. All participants entered the dataset once only even
if they were readmitted during the study and so provided only one set of data in either
the pre- or post-intervention period. They were unaware of the condition to which they
were allocated, so all main outcomes were blind rated. Wards were sampled 3, 5 or 7 times
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Patients were eligible if they could
communicate in English, had been on the ward for a minimum of 7 days and could provide
informed consent. The only exclusion criterion was previous participation in the trial. We
endeavoured to recruit 50% of all eligible patients at the time of data collection. This
study was carried out in distinct geographic areas (&#x02018;Boroughs&#x02019;) and details are given in

trust clinical leads, ward managers and nursing staff directly involved with each ward,
eight activities were chosen, based on evidence of feasibility and acceptability to ward
staff, and where training input was relatively modest and usually available in the NHS.
Not all interventions could be provided on a single ward at the same time, so four were
chosen by the consultation team to be core training. The staff training sessions involve
different health care professionals and were provided when those staff were available.
Training offered to all wards: (i) Social Cognition and Interaction Training (Penn
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), (ii) CBT-based communications training for
nurses (co-facilitated by a service user educator) and (iii) computerised Cognitive
Remediation Therapy (to involve Occupational Therapists) (Reeder <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), (iv) Pharmacists were recruited to run
medication education groups (Kavanagh <italic>et al.</italic>

according to individual ward needs from: Hearing Voices Group (Ruddle <italic>et al.</italic>

Stigma Group (Knight <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The staff training intervention was
provided after randomisation and was both off site and in vivo. Following the training
workshops the trainer, a clinical psychologist, provided supervision during the
intervention period, which consisted of weekly visits initially but then reduced and
depended on the activity and the staff skills. Most supervision had been completed 6
months after the initial training workshop. Details of the staff training can be found in
online web Table 1 and training materials can be found on the study website (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.perceive.iop.kcl.ac.uk/">http://www.perceive.iop.kcl.ac.uk/</uri>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Researchers approached all eligible patients and participants gave written informed

over three time points as a minimum after baseline, i.e. a total of 720. As an
approximation, we treated the design as a standard cluster randomised trial with clusters
of size 30 (two wards of size 15 were randomised in pairs) with an estimated intraclass
correlation of 0.05 following a conservative approach using data from Adams <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).This sample size in a standard
cluster randomised design would have given approximately 90% power to detect a
standardised effect size of 0.5 (moderate), using double-sided significance tests with
<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05. (There was no additional clustering at the patient level as
the sample differed at each time point). Because of the stepped wedge design, the actual
number of wards and participants in the intervention and control groups varied according
to time point, so the above calculations are approximate, but were designed to be
conservative.</p><sec id="sec4-4-1"><title>Effects directly on patients</title><p>For all measures obtained by self-report it was a requirement that at least 80% of the

to corroborate the staff data, we analysed activities data collected in CITRINE using
similar analyses. The fixed effects model was used to take account of ward effects.
Standard errors were generated using bootstrapping with replacement due to the
non-normal data distribution and we tested for the effects of potential moderators, e.g.
PANSS scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4-2"><title>Intervention costs and changes in resource allocation costs</title><p>The training costs associated were estimated as the cost of employing a clinical
psychologist to lead the training and the opportunity cost of nurses and occupational
therapists attending training. In order to calculate cost per patient week, we assumed
that the longevity of the treatment was equal to the average follow-up time in the
trial. While the intervention did not alter the resources allocated to the wards, we
investigated how the composition and frequency of perceived staff contacts changed by
multiplying the service use information collected using CITRINE by the respective
salaries and used the total cost as a summary measure. Our regression analysis followed
the same format as the analysis of patient data, but to allow for skewness and kurtosis
we calculated bootstrapped standard errors.</p><p>All analyses were carried out using Stata versions 11 and 12.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-5"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>The study was designed with the help of service users who were also involved in the study

potential confounders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p>We endeavoured to achieve improved perceptions of inpatient care in a sustainable way using
a simple staff training programme for various evidence-based therapeutic activities. We
believe that this training could have a number of beneficial effects on staff morale and
confidence in their therapeutic skills that could well go beyond the delivery of any
particular activity. Although there was only tentative evidence of an overall effect, we
discovered a significant benefit for an important target group &#x02013; those admitted under legal
sanction. The wards we studied were representative of many serving urban and inner city
areas with varied background socioeconomic factors but similar patient diagnostic
characteristics and chronicity to those found in most mental health wards. We therefore have
no reason to assume that the effects of staff training would be much different in other
areas.</p><p>Our results were further validated by the significant positive effect on satisfaction,
again for those patients who were legally detained. We achieved these effects despite staff
training having only a modest impact on the day to day life of the wards. The extra costs of
implementing the intervention were modest, amounting to &#x000a3;10 per patient per week. Although
other costs were not increased at the ward level, there was a realignment following the
intervention with patients receiving care that cost &#x000a3;12/week more. Whether these extra costs
are justified or not depends on the value placed on improving patient perceptions among
those legally detained.</p><p>The impact on wards is not unexpected since the association between social interaction,
taking part in therapeutic activities and their impact on patient behaviour mirrors the
effects of changes to mental health institutions in the 1960s (Wing &#x00026; Brown, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>). Activities break up the monotony on wards (Walsh
&#x00026; Boyle, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and provide a forum for
patient interaction (Csipke <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Crucially they also distinguish a therapeutic
environment from one that is purely about incarceration. All our wards already had a weekly
activity schedule largely comprising activities such as cookery or bingo, that, while valued
(Star Wards, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), were not evidence based
therapeutic interventions advocated as best practice (e.g. Sainsbury Centre for Mental
Health, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Walsh &#x00026; Boyle, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; NICE, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) or likely to be perceived as such by patients. Our nurses were trained to
deliver a number of evidence-based activities, but we had no control over the number of
sessions that were run. Patient reported activities did increase with some groups replacing
existing non-evidence-based ones and the number of valued contacts and activities did
increase at little cost. In light of that, increasing the mean number of activities from 6
to 8 may be considered a success.</p><p>The most important impact is on patients themselves. Previous studies demonstrated
deterioration in inpatient care as viewed by patients (Wing &#x00026; Brown, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>) and this was noticeable in this study. It is
unclear why this has been the case, but there are links to shorter hospital stays,
compulsory admissions and increased disturbance (Laker <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Csipke <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Williams <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It is therefore gratifying that there was a
measurable, albeit subjective, benefit for those patients who were legally detained thus
bucking the general trend. Patients who agree to accept inpatient treatment already consider
the ward to be of therapeutic value so they are unlikely to view the modest impact on the
wards as a large improvement. Those who are legally detained are more critical of inpatient
services. Changing their views is very important as it may affect future interactions with
mental health services and perhaps even the potential to avert a future compulsory admission
(Laker <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Theodoridou <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Care Quality Commission, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; van
der Post <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Viewing the ward as more therapeutic may
also affect recovery, but this study was not designed to test this possibility.</p><p>An often repeated justification by ward staff for not running activities is that people are
too ill to take part. Symptom severity did not influence increased group attendance
suggesting that patients can benefit from the provision of increased activities even if they
have higher symptoms.</p><p>Ward staff were given choices about what they provided so that the intervention training
fitted their patient mix, their current activities and their skills set. Both these factors
ensured that the interventions were more valued, clinically useful and feasible for
long-term use.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We tested the impact of training in highly charged mental health services in two NHS trusts
situated in both poor and more affluent areas. The strengths of the study included measuring
the intervention effects through large-scale patient evaluation and involved more than 70%
of the eligible population. In addition, participant characteristics were tested as
potential individual patient confounders and controlled in the analyses. Finally, the
training provided was available in the NHS. However, we do not know if every patient would
benefit from the intervention as not everyone on the ward who was exposed to the
intervention consented or was eligible to take part. We do know that the benefits were not
affected by the severity of symptoms. So we do not know what proportion of patients on those
wards will benefit or the way to increase the likelihood of those benefits.</p><p>A further strength was to examine the longer term impact of these interventions when
implementation was under staff control as suggested in the MRC process evaluation model for
complex interventions (Theodoridou <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A limitation is that we analysed only the
intention-to-treat effects of providing an intervention (training staff) on the outcome
(change in patient perceptions of the ward). But there are likely to be more routes to
improved patient perceptions, including the effect of the activities themselves on a
patient's sense of wellbeing. We did not assess any single intervention, so we do not know
if some were more effective than others and we did not test the effects of individual
exposure. Rather we measured the effects of a simple package of training which provided
activity opportunities, but patients were not obliged to attend.</p><p>One of the most common complaints about inpatient services is the extreme boredom and lack
of therapeutic activities occurring on the wards (e.g. Wing &#x00026; Brown, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Walsh &#x00026; Boyle, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Theodoridou <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Care Quality Commission, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>;
Csipke <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Participation in activities was related to
more positive perceptions of the wards demonstrating that they can be a much valued
component of inpatient services regardless of illness severity. This belies the belief that
acutely ill people cannot take part in meaningful activities and supports the view that more
therapeutic activities could be of value and are appreciated.</p><p>In conclusion, we discovered that with only a relatively small amount of investment in
training for inpatient staff it was possible to measure improvements in the views of those
who were coerced into receiving inpatient care through involuntary admissions even some
considerable time after the intervention had been introduced. The effect of improved quality
of care has now been linked to patient views for the first time. There is no evidence as yet
that we had an effect on those voluntarily admitted, but it is possible that there are other
mediators or moderators of the relationship between the intervention and the outcome that
might explain this current lack of direct effects. The improvement for those involuntarily
admitted was produced with little effect on the costs of care. We speculate that other
potential gains following the improved patient perceptions may be better engagement with
mental health services in the involuntarily admitted group. Using data gathered in an
earlier study, if the better engagement results in only seven patients (95% CI 6&#x02013;8,
&#x0003c;1% of the current sample) agreeing to a voluntary rather than an involuntary
admission then the cost of the training programme would be covered (Moore <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) by the savings from shorter admissions. This
will be investigated in future analyses. This is the first reported significant method for
improving the inpatient experience since the UK Francis Report (Francis, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and shows that with some investment it is possible
to improve mental health patients&#x02019; views of their care &#x02013; particularly those who clearly have
not had a rosy view and therefore were coerced into receiving that care through legal
detention in hospital.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Professors Diana Rose, Tom Craig &#x00026; Til Wykes also acknowledge the financial support
