There were no significant differences between acceptance and control groups in both subjective depression and SCR activity during frustration.

Amongst various emotion regulation strategies, expressive suppression is defined as the conscious, effortful attempts to hide emotional responses and constrain emotion-expressive behaviors <xref rid="pone.0097420-Yeung1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For instance, when a person feels angry, he/she tries to dampen anger experience by hiding this emotion and pretending to be calm <xref rid="pone.0097420-Yeung1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A number of researches showed that suppression was associated with elevated levels of physiological arousal and negative affective consequences <xref rid="pone.0097420-Gross2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Wegner2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, studies on thought and pain suppression also suggested that suppression might be associated with a paradoxical persistence of the unwanted thought and pain <xref rid="pone.0097420-Wegner3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Cioffi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>By contrast, acceptance is an effortless, exposure-based strategy that is defined as "the aware embracing of emotional events and the active experiencing of their emotional consequences, without attempts to change the frequency, form or impacts of the emotional events <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Acceptance is considered an important component of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hayes2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the application of the acceptance strategy is associated with a line of positive outcomes, including lower levels of negative affect <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Kashdan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, decreased anxious or depressive symptoms <xref rid="pone.0097420-Kashdan2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Tull1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and better physical/social functioning <xref rid="pone.0097420-McCracken1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Recently, Shallcross showed that accepting negative emotions might protect individuals from experiencing negative affect and developing depressive symptoms <xref rid="pone.0097420-Shallcross1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Researchers have proposed acceptance and suppression as two ends of the experiential avoidance continuum, with higher levels of experiential avoidance reflecting higher emotional suppression, that is, less willingness to experience negative emotions <xref rid="pone.0097420-Kashdan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Boelen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Hayes4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Similarly, &#x0201c;high acceptance&#x0201d; is considered to be synonymous with &#x0201c;low experiential avoidance&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0097420-Kashdan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-BlockLerner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Driven by this theoretic construct, many studies compared suppression and acceptance strategies in the behavioral and physiological effects of emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>For example, Hayes and colleagues showed that participants who received an acceptance-oriented rationale prior to a cold-pressor task displayed greater pain tolerance than those who received suppression-oriented or placebo rationales <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hayes5" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Moreover, Eifert and Heffner <xref rid="pone.0097420-Eifert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> compared the effects of acceptance and suppression strategies on the avoidance of panic-relevant interoceptive stimulation, which was elicited by carbon dioxide enriched air. The results showed that the acceptance group reported less intense fear, fewer catastrophic thoughts and greater willingness to return for another experimental session than the suppression group <xref rid="pone.0097420-Eifert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Levitt and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-Levitt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> replicated this study with a sample of individuals diagnosed with pain disorder. They found similar effects of acceptance in this clinical sample, including decreased subjective distress and increased willingness to undergo another symptom provocation <xref rid="pone.0097420-Levitt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition, Campbell and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> investigated perceived acceptance and suppression of negative emotion in participants with anxiety and mood disorder in response to a distressing film. The results showed that high levels of suppression were associated with negative emotion during the film and post-film recovery period <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Campbell <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> also found that the acceptance group displayed less negative affect during a post-film recovery period. Furthermore, the suppression group showed increased heart rate, whereas the acceptance group displayed decreased heart rate in response to the film <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Recently, Hofmann and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>directly compared the behavioral and physiological indexes of regulation using expressive suppression, acceptance and cognitive reappraisal during an impromptu speech task. The results suggested that the suppression group showed a greater increase in heart rate from baseline than the acceptance and reappraisal group <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>These studies consistently observed that suppression was associated with negative outcomes, whereas acceptance was linked to beneficial consequences. However, most of these studies were conducted in European- American samples that are characterized by individualistic cultural values encouraging free emotional expressions <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. By contrast, East Asian cultures are characterized by collectivistic cultural norms, which encourage the suppression of emotional displays, in order to avoid hurting others and maintain relational harmony <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-DeLeersnyder1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In fact, a growing number of studies have indicated that the emotional consequence of suppression is cultural- specific: suppression is related to less negative emotional experience, better social interactions and more favorable physiological response in individuals with East Asian cultural values <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. For example, Butter and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> observed that greater suppression was associated with enhanced negative emotions, increased hostile behaviors or negative interpersonal perceptions in European Americans. By contrast, these adverse outcomes were reduced or reversed in Asian Americans who held Asian values <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, Mauss and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-Mauss1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> showed that emotional restraint led to smaller anger experience and reduced anger-expressive behaviors, as well as smaller cardiovascular activity during anger provocation among Asian Americans, but not among European Americans. Consistent with these findings, Soto <xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> observed that the relationship between suppression and health depended on cultural context. Specifically, suppression was associated with adverse psychological functioning for European Americans, but not for Chinese participants <xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Since many studies suggest that suppression is an adaptive and effective emotion regulation strategy in East Asian cultures, it seems unlikely that the suppression is less effective than acceptance in regulating negative emotions in Chinese. Instead, suppression might be as similarly effective as, or even more effective than, acceptance in regulating negative emotion in Chinese subjects.</p><p>A number of evidences suggest that individuals with sub-threshold depression had an increased risk of major depression and other adverse outcomes <xref rid="pone.0097420-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Though previous studies examined behavioral and physiological consequences of negative emotion regulation in multiple emotion categories, such as anxiety <xref rid="pone.0097420-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, anger <xref rid="pone.0097420-Szasz1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, sadness <xref rid="pone.0097420-Svaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> or composite negative emotion <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; few studies have investigated the regulation of situational depressive mood by comparing suppression and acceptance strategies. Thus, it is practically important to study the efficacy of regulating nonclinical state depression by acceptance and suppression.</p><p>Most previous studies used emotional pictures or film clips to induce negative emotion during emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Liverant1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. These pictures and films depicted emotionally salient scenarios, like surgical operations <xref rid="pone.0097420-Goldin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, persecutions <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, disasters and threats <xref rid="pone.0097420-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, to elicit prominent emotional reactions in observers through emotional perception or contagion <xref rid="pone.0097420-Baumgartner1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Britton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, the emotional event that evokes intense emotions often has close personal relevance in life settings. This is often the case, in our life experiences, that self-experienced bereavement induces much stronger sadness than the perception of bereavement scenarios. This argument was supported by a couple of studies which observed higher ventromedial prefrontal reactions to emotional pictures with personal relevance <xref rid="pone.0097420-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and greater anger perception from faces with direct gaze to observers <xref rid="pone.0097420-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Thus, to induce depressive emotion with high ecological validity, it is necessary to use a task that entails self-involvement during emotion induction.</p><p>Therefore, we adopted a frustrating arithmetic task, which required subjects to rapidly count the number of triangles embedded in complex graphics to induce depressive emotion. A feedback was provided about the performance in each trial, and the valence of the feedback was determined by a computer program that displayed negative feedback 18 out of 20 trials. Thus, this task constituted a frustrating situation, and many studies showed that the frustrating task with negative feedbacks was effective in inducing negative, depressive emotional state <xref rid="pone.0097420-Nummenmaa1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. For instance, Goodwin and Williams reported in an early study that experimental manipulations of success and failure induced depressive and negative affect <xref rid="pone.0097420-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In addition, it was reported that the negative feedback was associated with depressive affects, with enhanced depression symptoms predicting hypersensitivity to negative feedback <xref rid="pone.0097420-Santesso1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>In sum, using a frustrating arithmetic task, the objective of the present study was to examine the effects of suppression and acceptance on state depression responses to frustration in local Chinese subjects. The subjective emotion experience and physiological activity (SCR) were measured in three phases: the rest phase, the frustrating task phase, and the recovery phase. Skin conductance response has been deemed as excellent index of emotional arousal <xref rid="pone.0097420-Schlosberg1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Prior studies indicated that the SCR has advantage over other autonomic measures (e.g. heart rate) in reflecting emotional arousal, because SCR is under strict control of the sympathetic branch of the nervous system <xref rid="pone.0097420-Khalfa1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Moreover, SCRs had been accepted as reliable measures of autonomic expressions of emotions <xref rid="pone.0097420-Khalfa1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Because East Asian culture is associated with favorable outcomes during emotion-expressive suppression, we predicted that suppression might be as similarly effective as, or even more effective than, acceptance in regulating subjective experience of state depression and physiological arousal (SCR) in Chinese subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>2.1.

Specifically, suppression group showed no significant increase in depressive ratings from rest to task phases, but a significant decrease from task to recovery phases. By contrast, acceptance group showed a significant increase from rest to task phases, but no significant decrease from task to recovery phases. These findings were replicated by our analyses of the task-rest differences in depressive feelings and SCR activity, which demonstrated smaller rest-to-task increases in both indexes during suppression in comparison with the control groups. The efficacy of expressive suppression in regulating induced depression was also supported by our analyses of the rest-to-recovery differences in depressive experience (D3), which showed a better return to the pre-experiment baseline in the suppression group. By contrast, the acceptance group did not show any significant differences in all these measures compared to the control group. These results suggest that the suppression is more effective in regulating the subjective experience and physiological arousal (SCR) associated with induced depression in comparison with the acceptance strategy.</p><p>In the present study, we controlled the pre-experimental emotional state across the three groups, indicated by the similar emotion-related measures, such as State/Trait anxiety and depression in different groups. Considering that self-esteem was negatively correlated with depressive responses during stressful situations <xref rid="pone.0097420-Kreger1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, we also equated the levels of self-esteem across different groups. In addition, there were no significant group differences in the baseline affective ratings and SCR activities. This suggested that the three groups of subjects were similar in the pre-experimental emotional states. Furthermore, the three groups were similar in the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression and acceptance, ruling out the possibility that these groups had different emotion regulation styles independent of our experimental manipulations. Moreover, our manipulation checks showed that all subjects correctly understood and proficiently used the target strategy during practice trials, and all subjects successfully used the target strategy during the task phase. Therefore, the results should be specific to experimental manipulations of the different emotion regulation instructions.</p><p>How to explain the contrasting effects of suppression between Caucasian and Chinese samples? A most likely explanation is that the effect of suppression is culture-specific, as indicated by Butler and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In contrast to European-American cultures that encourage free emotional expressions, East Asian cultures are characterized by collectivistic cultural norms, which encourage the suppression of emotional displays, in order to avoid hurting others and maintain relational harmony <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-DeLeersnyder1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The previous studies have showed that culture was an important factor when evaluating the emotional consequences of emotion suppression and expression <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler3" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Consedine1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. In fact, a growing number of literatures have indicated that suppression is associated with less negative emotional experience, better social interactions and more favorable physiological response in individuals with East Asian cultural values <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. For instance, Butter and colleagues observed that greater suppression was associated with enhanced negative emotions, increased hostile behaviors or negative interpersonal perceptions in European Americans. By contrast, these adverse outcomes were reduced or reversed in Asian Americans who hold Asian values <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Similarly, there was evidence showing that emotional restraint decreased anger experience, anger-expressive behaviors, as well as cardiovascular activity during anger provocation among Asian Americans, but not among European Americans <xref rid="pone.0097420-Mauss1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. More recently, Soto <xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> observed that suppression was associated with adverse psychological functioning for European Americans, but not for Chinese participants <xref rid="pone.0097420-Soto2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, the suppression strategy produced positive outcomes on both subjective emotional experience and physiological activity (SCR) in the current sample of Chinese participants. However, though Chinese subjects are well known for collectivistic and relational cultural values <xref rid="pone.0097420-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-DeLeersnyder1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Butler3" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, we need to acknowledge that it was a weakness we did not overtly assess the cultural values of our subjects, which should have then reinforced this explanation.</p><p>The present study failed to find positive effects of acceptance on both subjective experience and physiological activity, regardless of whether the task phase or recovery phase was involved. Though many studies observed decreased negative emotion experiences or physiological activity after acceptance instruction <xref rid="pone.0097420-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Eifert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Levitt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, there was also evidence showing that acceptance instruction did not produce beneficial outcomes in immediate or long-term emotional measures after watching distressful videos <xref rid="pone.0097420-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, or recalling stressful experiences <xref rid="pone.0097420-Rood1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. A few studies suggested that the effects of emotion regulation strategies might depend on the intensity of the target emotion. For example, Shallcross showed that acceptance predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms after higher, but not lower life stress <xref rid="pone.0097420-Shallcross1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These results suggested that the beneficial effects of acceptance in reducing negative affect may be more noticeable at a higher level of emotion intensity <xref rid="pone.0097420-Shallcross1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In the present study, we just observed a medium level of depressive emotion induced by our frustration task. This possibly explains why we did not observe beneficial effects of acceptance during regulating depressive emotion. Thus, future studies need to vary the intensity of negative emotion and directly investigate if the regulation effect of acceptance depends on the intensity of target emotion.</p><p>One may question that subjects in the suppression group may not suppress emotion displays at late points of emotion generation, as postulated by the process model of emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0097420-Gross5" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, but instead subjects might have conducted "repression" continuously in the experiment. In the current study, we used a difficult arithmetic task combined with the feedback manipulation to induce depressive emotion. Specifically, 18 out of 20 trials were manipulated to be associated with negative feedback. Many studies have pointed out that the negative feedback about one's performance is effective in inducing negative, depressive emotional state <xref rid="pone.0097420-Nummenmaa1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Santesso1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. For instance, Goodwin and Williams reported that experimental manipulations of success and failure induced depressive and negative affect <xref rid="pone.0097420-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In addition, it was reported that the negative feedback was associated with depressive affects in both healthy and depressed individuals <xref rid="pone.0097420-Santesso1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097420-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Therefore, the presentation of negative feedbacks, which signals participants' failure in a give trial, should be the critical frustrating event that elicits depressive emotion. Our regulation instruction requires subjects to suppress emotional displays if the frustration happens. Thus, without the presentation of depression-evoking, frustrating event (negative feedback), there is no need for subjects to conduct a suppression process. Also, the triangle-counting task used in this study is rather difficult, to guarantee that subjects' were not highly confident with their answer and consequently, undoubtful about the feedback validity. Therefore, subjects need to focus on the triangle-counting task in the experiment, which implies that there were no enough cognitive resources diverted to other processes if they did not experience frustrating, depressive emotion. Based on these analyses, it was most likely that the suppression group conducted the expressive suppression after they experienced depressive emotion; rather than "repression" continuously through the experiment.</p><p>In sum, the present study suggested that, contrary to the conclusions drawn from western samples, the current study using Chinese samples observed that expressive suppression was associated with reduced depressive experiences and smaller physiological activity (SCR) to frustrations compared to the control group. By contrast, the acceptance instruction did not produce beneficial outcomes in these measures during the frustration.
