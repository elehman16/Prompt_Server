Brain stimulation techniques have been proposed to improve neural plasticity and help to restore motor performance in post-stroke patients. The present study compared the effects of bihemispheric motor cortex transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on PT and force steadiness during maximal and submaximal resistance exercise performed by post-stroke patients vs. healthy controls. A double-blind randomized crossover controlled trial (identification number: TCTR20151112001; URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/">http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/</ext-link>) was conducted involving nine healthy and 10 post-stroke hemiparetic individuals who received either tDCS (2 mA) or sham stimulus upon the motor cortex for 20 min. PT and force steadiness (reflected by the coefficient of variation (CV) of muscular torque) were assessed during unilateral knee extension and flexion at maximal and submaximal workloads (1 set of 3 repetitions at 100% PT and 2 sets of 10 repetitions at 50% PT, respectively). No significant change in PT was observed in post-stroke and healthy subjects. Force steadiness during knee extension (~25&#x02013;35%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and flexion (~22&#x02013;33%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) improved after tDCS compared to the sham condition in post-stroke patients, but improved only during knee extension (~13&#x02013;27%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in healthy controls. These results suggest that tDCS may improve force steadiness, but not PT in post-stroke hemiparetic patients, which might be relevant in the context of motor rehabilitation programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>performance</kwd><kwd>physical rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>strength</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>tDCS</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6013"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-stroke patients often exhibit motor sequels (Langhorne et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and hemiparesis (Prado-Medeiros et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) that are associated with increased variability in the application of force during motor tasks (Chow and Stokic, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This condition typically results in low force steadiness (Moritz et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and poor movement control (Kornatz et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) that can negatively impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living (Timmermans et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Patients affected by stroke show a relative imbalance in either transcallosal inhibition or inter-hemispheric cerebral excitability, with hypo-excitability of the affected motor cortex concomitant to hyper-excitability of the non-affected motor cortex (Murase et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Bolognini et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Strategies to help counteract these imbalances and improve neural plasticity should therefore be beneficial for those patients (Bolognini et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Simonetta-Moreau, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previous studies reported that improvements in neuronal plasticity and functional ability could be optimized by combining physical exercise and neurological therapy (Langhorne et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Billinger et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been considered as promising tools for restoring motor control and performance in post-stroke patients (Bolognini et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Recently, Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) demonstrated that a unilateral anodal tDCS over motor leg cortex slightly enhanced the maximal force production of the paretic leg. Even though there is controversial findings (O&#x02019;Shea et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), evidence indicates that bihemispheric motor cortex tDCS seems to be more effective than unilateral tDCS (i.e., anodal or cathodal tDCS) to increase motor-evoked potentials in upper and lower limb contralateral to the affected cortex, thereby improving neuroplasticity (Bolognini et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Cha et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and to decrease excitability in regions that inhibit those areas (Vines et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In addition, studies with post-stroke patients have evaluated the effects of tDCS using relatively restricted motor tasks, as isometric grip strength and hand function (Khedr et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Cha et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, the effects of tDCS on the performance of tasks demanding submaximal and maximal strength, and force steadiness during exercise involving larger muscle groups of the legs are yet to be determined. This would be useful, since the muscle strength of both lower limbs is related to activities of daily living.</p><p>Recent studies with healthy subjects failed to observe changes in motor performance in response to tDCS in both upper (Hendy and Kidgell, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and lower limbs extremities (Montenegro et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which may be due to a possible &#x0201c;ceiling effect&#x0201d; when motor neuronal excitability is already optimal. This may help to explain the mixed findings in regards to the effects of tDCS upon cortical excitability in healthy subjects vs. post-stroke patients (Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In brief, it is feasible to think that the effects of tDCS upon cortical excitability rely on the extent to which the cortical function is preserved (Byblow et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), but there is a lack of research investigating this possibility. Comparisons between post-stroke patients and healthy controls regarding the effects of tDCS upon strength performance and force steadiness during gross motor tasks would be useful to test this hypothesis. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tDCS applied to the affected motor cortex in post-stroke hemiparetic patients would increase the peak muscular torque (PT) and force steadiness during a gross motor task in comparison with healthy controls. We hypothesized that tDCS would be capable to increase PT and force steadiness in post-stroke patients, but not in healthy subjects with preserved cortical function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental Approach to the Problem</title><p>This randomized crossover study was designed to investigate the effects of tDCS applied in post-stroke hemiparetic patients, upon PT and force steadiness during a gross motor task in comparison with healthy controls. The experimental design of this study included three non-consecutive visits to the laboratory. On the first visit, participants underwent a familiarization protocol with the equipment and procedures to reduce the potential confounding influence of motor learning.</p><p>On the second and third visits, 20 min of either tDCS with 2 mA or sham condition were applied in randomized counter-balanced order, as defined by the Latin square. Immediately after receiving tDCS, maximal and submaximal isokinetic unilateral knee extension and flexion exercises were performed. A wash-out period of 48&#x02013;72 h between visits was applied to avoid tDCS carryover effects. Participants were seated in a moderately lit room with temperature and humidity ranging between 21&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C and 55&#x02013;70%, respectively. All measurements were taken between 9&#x02013;11 a.m. to avoid bias due to circadian variation.

One warm-up set of 15 repetitions with execution speed fixed at 120&#x000b0;&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was performed before exercise testing. Subsequently, one set of three maximal repetitions with 120 s intervals between the legs was performed to assess PT. The PT assessment was considered valid only when the coefficient of variation (CV) between repetitions was less than 15% (Eng et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The highest PT value within a given set was recorded as the final result.

Maximal and submaximal tests were interspersed with rest periods of 10&#x02013;20 min. The chair settings, range of motion, and speed of movement used in the maximal test protocol were maintained during submaximal exercise. The CV of muscular torque during the exercise was used as a marker of force steadiness. A screen showing reference lines corresponding to 50% (top line) and 25% (bottom line) of PT was fixed in front of the participants, to provide visual feedback during the exercise.

The main findings were: (i) Bihemispheric tDCS improved force steadiness in post-stroke hemiparetic patients during unilateral knee extension and flexion, but only during knee extension in healthy controls; and (ii) No change in PT during knee extension or flexion in stroke and healthy groups were detected after tDCS. Therefore, discrepancies in strength between legs and groups were not reduced by tDCS. In brief, tDCS was capable of improving force steadiness during submaximal knee extension and flexion exercise in post-stroke hemiparetic patients, but not the maximal strength reflected by PT during isokinetic exercise.</p><p>A decreased PT in paretic compared to non-paretic limb is common in patients after stroke (Eng et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), which has been acknowledged in those patients as the main factor interfering with voluntary force control in paretic-spastic muscles (Chang et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Evidently, this handicap has a negative impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living (Teixeira-Salmela et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Timmermans et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In the present study, the tDCS did not improve the maximal strength reflected by PT in the paretic limb of post-stroke patients. These data disagree with results from <italic>a prior</italic> study by Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), showing an increase of maximal isometric strength after tDCS during knee extension performed by subcortical post-stroke patients.</p><p>These mixed results could be partially explained by differences in experimental designs. Firstly, the tDCS electrode positioning presently applied was bihemispheric (i.e., cathode electrode upon the contralesional motor hemisphere to reduce inhibition of the ipsilesional hemisphere, and anode electrode upon the ipsilesional hemisphere to increase its excitability), while Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) applied an unilateral motor tDCS configuration (i.e., anode electrode upon the ipsilesional motor hemisphere and cathode electrode upon the contralateral supraorbital area). Furthermore, some studies (Jeffery et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) used the TMS-motor evoked potential technique to locate the motor &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; in leg muscle (i.e., vastus lateralis) before positioning tDCS electrodes over the subject&#x02019;s scalp; unfortunately, we were not able to do so. Although C3/C4 electrode montage is acknowledged as adequate for eliciting modulation in lower limbs (Legatt et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the low focality of tDCS stimulus induced by bihemispheric electrode montage to leg muscles may have attenuated the effects of tDCS on PT in both stroke and healthy groups. Secondly, Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) assessed the force production using maximal isometric knee extension performed for 3 s, while in the present study three dynamic repetitions involving both extension and flexion of the quadriceps were applied. It is well accepted that antagonist restraint (in our case, the action of hamstrings) increases with movement velocity in maximal voluntary concentric efforts, due to exaggerated flexor stretch reflexes in the paretic limb (Knutsson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Thus, an exercise task involving maximal voluntary concentric movements could result in unfavorable increasing of antagonist contraction, which in our study might have attenuated the effects of tDCS upon the strength of knee extensors (Watkins et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>).</p><p>A reduced force steadiness during submaximal motor tasks has been associated with motor impairment in post-stroke patients, due to lesions in connected areas within the ipsilesional hemisphere and lesions in interconnections with the contralesional hemisphere (Lodha et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Westlake and Nagarajan, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Even though non-paretic limbs might also exhibit decreased muscle power (Prado-Medeiros et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), a greater number of motor units seem to be recruited in paretic muscles to generate similar levels of force as in the non-paretic limb. Moreover, an increase of strength in the paretic limb seems to be correlated with a decrease in force variability (Chang et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our findings revealed that the post-stroke group improved their force steadiness during submaximal dynamic exercise in paretic and non-paretic limbs, after a single session of bihemispheric motor cortex tDCS. These data reinforce the findings of a previous study reporting greater improvements in ankle control, in response to anodal tDCS applied over the lesioned motor cortex during motor tasks (Madhavan et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These beneficial effects would be possible due to a reduction in the intact-to-affected transcallosal inhibition, as well as to an increase in motor plasticity obtained by stimulating the affected motor hemisphere, favoring a better interhemispheric balance and more harmonic recruitment of motor units (Bolognini et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Krishnan et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Even though additional research is warranted to confirm these findings, this is an interesting and a useful possibility in terms of motor rehabilitation.</p><p>Recent studies failed to detect improvements in motor performance following tDCS (Kan et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Montenegro et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which has been attributed to a possible &#x0201c;ceiling effect&#x0201d; in the preserved motor cortex. Our results support this premise&#x02014;considering that anode electrode was applied over the contralateral motor cortex, it was fairly expected that no difference in PT or force steadiness occurred in healthy controls. Furthermore, these results are consistent with previous studies reporting lower motor thresholds, higher motor-evoked potentials (De Gennaro et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and shorter silent periods (Priori et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) in the motor cortex controlling dominant <italic>vs.</italic> non-dominant limbs. It could be therefore speculated that bihemispheric tDCS with anode electrode positioned over the non-dominant motor cortex would be an efficient strategy to increase strength, as suggested by a previous trial comparing hand function after stimulating non-dominant and dominant motor cortices of healthy subjects (Boggio et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our results showed non-specific effects due to tDCS on left and right legs in both groups. The tDCS electrode montage presently adopted (bihemispheric or dual tDCS) might help to explain this finding. When bilateral tDCS is applied, the cathode electrode is expected to reduce the motor control performance of the contralateral limb, whereas an improvement should be observed in the limb stimulated by the anode electrode. However, the tDCS effects upon a highly complex dynamic system like motor circuits do not always take place within a linear and predicted pattern of causality&#x02014;adjustments and therefore unexpected outcomes might occur. In this sense, prior studies have observed decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity due to online bilateral primary motor tDCS, but also increased intracortical functional connectivity in areas placed below the anode electrode, concomitant to no effect in areas below the cathode electrode (Sehm et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence it is feasible to think that the presently applied electrode montage was capable to attenuate the inhibitory influence that the dominant cortex exerted upon the lesioned area (transcallosal inhibition), which might have contributed to improve the intracortical functional connectivity and therefore the motor control in both limbs.</p><p>Based on this rationale, it is fair to speculate that stroke patients exhibiting interhemispheric imbalance might benefit from stimulation using bilateral tDCS configuration. Concisely, the favorable effects of tDCS upon motor control would be related to an attenuation of the unbalance between cortical hemispheres (Nowak et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), by reducing the inhibitory projections from the contralesional hemisphere (usually hyper excited in those patients), while increasing neuronal excitability of the compromised hemisphere (Sehm et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This premise concurs, for instance, with the data from the study by Tahtis et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), demonstrating that gait performance improved after bilateral tDCS applied over cortical areas responsible for the control of lower limbs. Evidently, further research is warranted to confirm these possibilities.</p><p>Limitations of this study must be acknowledged. Firstly, specific cortical areas activated by tDCS were not controlled. Even though 10 min of 2 mA tDCS has been shown to increase leg corticospinal tract excitability for at least 60 min (Jeffery et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), the use of imaging techniques such as fMRI would be useful to ensure that targeted areas had been effectively stimulated. Secondly, the experimental groups were not age-matched (post-stroke patients aged 52 &#x000b1; 14 year <italic>vs.</italic> healthy controls 26 &#x000b1; 7 years), which has been suggested to influence the response to electric fields induced by motor cortex tDCS (Laakso et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, since the aging process seems to negatively affect the recruitment activation of brain areas during motor tasks (Manan et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the choice of healthy young individuals as controls is justified to ensure that tDCS effects upon motor performance were tested across groups really exhibiting opposite status in regards to motor cortex integrity (e.g., healthy <italic>vs.</italic> lesioned).</p><p>In conclusion, a single session of tDCS applied over the motor cortex was able to improve force steadiness, but not maximal dynamic strength during a gross motor task (knee extension and flexion) in post-stroke hemiparetic patients. These findings suggest that tDCS might be considered as a complementary strategy to traditional rehabilitation training, in order to improve motor control and mobility of hemiparetic patients affected by stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: RAM, AHO, PF.
