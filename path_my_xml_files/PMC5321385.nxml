The children enrolled were randomised to receive RUTF-C, RUTF-L or A-HPF. We provided foods, counselling and feeding support until recovery or 16&#x02005;weeks, whichever was earlier and measured outcomes weekly (treatment phase). We subsequently facilitated access to government nutrition services and measured outcomes once 16&#x02005;weeks later (sustenance phase). The primary outcome was recovery during treatment phase (weight-for-height &#x02265;&#x02212;2 SD and absence of oedema of feet).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recovery rates with RUTF-L, RUTF-C and A-HPF were 56.9%, 47.5% and 42.8%, respectively. The adjusted OR was 1.71 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.43; p=0.003) for RUTF-L and 1.28 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.82; p=0.164) for RUTF-C compared with A-HPF. Weight gain in the RUTF-L group was higher than in the A-HPF group (adjusted difference 0.90&#x02005;g/kg/day, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50; p=0.003). Time to recovery was shorter in both RUTF groups. Morbidity was high and similar across groups. At the end of the study, the proportion of children with weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) &#x0003e;&#x02212;2 was similar (adjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.95; p=0.464), higher for moderate malnutrition (WHZ&#x0003c;&#x02212;2 and &#x02265;&#x02212;3; adjusted OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.08; p=0.039), and lower for those with SAM (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85; p=0.005) in the RUTF-L when compared with the A-HPF group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This first randomised trial comparing options for home management of uncomplicated SAM confirms that RUTF-L is more efficacious than A-HPF at home.

Families seek medical care only when children with SAM have complications. They are reluctant to accept long hospital stay due to, for example, loss of wages and no arrangements at home to take care of other siblings. Perceptions that the disease is not severe enough to warrant long hospitalisation, the fear of hospitals, past experiences that were unpleasant and the cost of hospital care are also contributory factors .<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>Home-based management after initial hospitalisation was proposed for children with SAM as an effective strategy to increase coverage.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This was supported by the development of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Studies in Africa showed that, for home-based management of uncomplicated SAM, RUTF achieved recovery rates similar to those with hospital-based management.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>Since 2007, the WHO recommends RUTF for home-based management of uncomplicated SAM.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, acceptance of this recommendation has been limited in countries like India. An important reason for the reluctance is the lack of evidence from controlled trials of the efficacy of RUTF compared with other treatment options. Experts have also questioned the &#x02018;standardised diets&#x02019; used in studies. They argue that the comparison group should be given locally produced foods high in energy and proteins with adequate micronutrients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> In addition, there are questions in India about the use of commercially produced RUTF over locally produced &#x02018;analogous medical nutrition therapy&#x02019; or augmented home foods. Locally produced RUTF using indigenous foods may be less expensive and more sustainable if its efficacy could be proved.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Reviews, including the most recent Cochrane review (2013), recommend well-designed, adequately powered, pragmatic randomised trials to compare treatment options for home-based management of uncomplicated SAM.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A policy review in India reached a similar conclusion.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>We therefore conducted a randomised trial to compare the efficacy of centrally produced RUTF (RUTF-C) and locally prepared RUTF (RUTF-L) for home-based management of children with uncomplicated SAM on recovery rates compared with micronutrient-enriched (augmented) energy-dense home-prepared foods (A-HPF), the comparison group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>In this randomised trial, children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x02005;months with uncomplicated SAM were randomised into one of the three groups: RUTF-C, RUTF-L and A-HPF.</p><p>The primary outcome was recovery (defined as WHZ&#x02265;&#x02212;2 SD of the WHO standards and absence of oedema of feet) by 16&#x02005;weeks after enrolment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Secondary outcomes included weight gain, time to recovery, prevalence of diarrhoea, acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and fever, mortality and hospitalisations during the treatment phase (until recovery or 16&#x02005;weeks after enrolment, whichever was earlier). Another secondary outcome was the proportion of children with WHZ&#x02265;&#x02212;2 SD at the end of the sustenance phase (16&#x02005;weeks after completion of the treatment phase). The cost of the feeding regimens, the families' and health workers' perceptions about the regimens, and the factors that affect recovery (other secondary outcomes) will be published in separate manuscripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study sites</title><p>We conducted the study in three diverse geographical settings in India&#x02014;Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. The study populations were low-income households quite diverse, with a mix of rural and urban areas. The three sites also varied in the programmatic context. Enrolment began in October 2012 and follow-up was completed in April 2015.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study oversight</title><p>The study was approved by the Government of India and the state governments. Oversight was provided by the National Research Alliance for SAM established by the Indian Government. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) periodically reviewed the study and provided recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DSMB recommendations</title><p>In the original proposal, the period of treatment and measurement of the primary outcome were set at 8&#x02005;weeks. This choice was based on the findings of studies in Africa that showed that most children with SAM recovered within 8&#x02005;weeks of starting RUTF.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Based on a a priori decision, the DSMB reviewed the study after the initial 20 enrolments. They recommended that the intervention be given for a maximum of 16&#x02005;weeks, instead of the 8&#x02005;weeks described in the initial protocol. The justification was that although recovery rates by 8&#x02005;weeks were low, the intervention, if effective over a period of 16&#x02005;weeks, would still be of considerable public health interest.</p><p>Additional suggestions were recommended during a DSMB review conducted when about 40% children had been enrolled. These included increasing the sample size and strengthening the support for feeding as recovery rates among enrolled children were still low. In response, peer supporters who would help caregivers to feed their children were identified at all sites and the sample size was increased.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study involved two comparisons: between RUTF-C and A-HPF, and between RUTF-L and A-HPF. A-HPF was the comparison group. When we planned this study, published non-randomised studies conducted in Africa had shown 17&#x02013;23% difference in recovery between RUTF and a standard diet.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We therefore hypothesised a conservative 15% difference between the RUTF and the comparison group (A-HPF) for calculation of sample size. Assuming an 80% recovery in the intervention group and 65% in the comparison group (ie, a 15% difference) with 90% power and &#x003b1;=0.025, we required 231 children in each group. We increased it by 10% to account for loss of follow-up resulting in the original sample size estimate of 765. When the overall recovery rate was observed to be lower than assumed, the DSMB recommended an increase in sample size to at least 900 children to preserve the power to test the a priori hypothesis of 15% difference between the intervention and comparison groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Study procedures</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Identification of children with SAM</title><p>We conducted a door-to-door survey in the defined study populations to identify all children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x02005;months. After written informed consent from the caregiver, the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) was measured (Chasmors CTM03 tape; accuracy 1&#x02005;mm). Children with MUAC&#x0003c;130&#x02005;mm were brought to the study clinic. At the clinic, weight (Seca 385 digital weighing scale; accuracy 20&#x02005;g) and height/length (Seca 417 infantometer for length, Seca 213 stadiometer for height; accuracy 1&#x02005;mm) were measured, and oedema of feet checked.

Children with severe illness requiring hospitalisation, allergy to milk and haemoglobin &#x0003c;6&#x02005;g/dL, and who were unable to consume the test feed were considered to have complicated SAM and were taken to health facilities for hospital management. The remaining children with uncomplicated SAM, whose families were likely to remain in the study area over the next 4&#x02005;months, and whose parents gave written informed consent were enrolled. Children with a sibling previously enrolled in the study were excluded. MUAC, triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness (Holtain skinfold callipers; accuracy 0.2&#x02005;mm) of enrolled children, and weight and height of mothers were also measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Allocation and concealment</title><p>A WHO statistician, not otherwise involved with the study, prepared randomisation lists. Randomisation was stratified by site and age categories (6&#x02013;17 and 18&#x02013;59&#x02005;months) using block sizes of variable length (3, 6 or 9). Allocation into study groups was concealed using Serially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes (SNOSE) prepared by the WHO. The allocation ratio was 1:1:1 and the children were recruited in all three groups according to the randomisation list.

Information on intake of RUTF-L and RUTF-C was recorded; the amounts of ingredients used weekly were documented for the A-HPF group. For calculation of food consumption, the used packets (RUTF-C) or jars (RUTF-L) were collected from each home during the weekly visit throughout the treatment phase. The total calories consumed were calculated by multiplying the number of calories in a packet (500&#x02005;kcal for RUTF-C) and jar (1328&#x02005;kcal for RUTF-L) by the number of packets or jars consumed by the child. The calorie consumption in kcal/kg/day was calculated by dividing the total calories consumed by the number of days the child was available during the treatment phase and weight at enrolment. We did not collect consumption data for the comparison group given the greater difficulty in capturing valid information. The neighbourhood peer support workers recruited post-DSMB recommendations visited homes several times a day to help caregivers feed their children in all the three groups.

One of the reasons for the lower recovery rates may be that almost all children in our study had marasmus. In similar studies in Africa, the majority of children had kwashiorkor, and those with kwashiorkor had higher recovery rates compared with those with marasmus.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The prevalence of oedema in children with SAM in African studies ranged from 39% to 80% but was only 0.2% in our trial. The mean WHZ was also lower in our study compared with the African studies (detailed information in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file</xref>).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The evidence suggests that children with kwashiorkor tend to have higher weight-for-age than those with marasmus and may need to gain less weight to recover once they no longer have oedema. Diarrhoea impairs weight and height gain and thus leads to lower recovery rates.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Infection also causes malnutrition due to deterioration of immune function which increases susceptibility to infection and metabolic responses that impair nutritional status.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Further, around half the mothers of enrolled children were themselves malnourished; this may have resulted in less energetic efforts at feeding their malnourished children. Maternal underweight is one of the risk factors for childhood malnutrition and is closely associated with fetal, child and adolescent undernutrition.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>An additional explanation for the differences is that most African studies used height at enrolment to calculate WHZ during the follow-up period. We instead used subsequent height, measured concurrently with weights. In our study, height and weight were measured together every week during the follow-up period. Using height at enrolment increases the proportion of children who reach the cut-off for recovery.</p><p>The average weight gain in our trial was 3.5&#x02005;g/kg/day. This was considerably lower than 9.4&#x02005;g/kg/day observed in a study in Central India but closer to the observed in a community-based management of SAM project in Bihar that reported a weight gain of 4.9&#x02005;g/kg/day, possibly overestimated due to exclusion of defaulters (38%).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In another trial from North India, the recovery rate (defined as gaining 115% of baseline weight) was 46% and the weight gain was 3&#x02005;g/kg/day, both similar to our study.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Important lessons were gained from study implementation. The most valuable lesson was that in addition to the type of diet, extra support for feeding seems important in our setting for weight gain and recovery. Help from local experienced women seemed to improve food intake. It is likely that peer supporters, in addition to practical help, enhanced engagement and skills of the mother, resulting in children eating more.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>The finding that many children remain or slide back into moderate or severe malnutrition as early as within 16&#x02005;weeks after the end of treatment is important for programmes. It underscores the importance of adequately sustained nutrition support after RUTF treatment is stopped. While linkages between families and the government <italic>anganwadi</italic> centres that provide supplementary nutrition services were established, additional measures may be required to sustain the improvements from the treatment phase. These may include close monitoring, improved counselling, support to caregivers, provision of additional food supplements, including giving RUTF for a longer period, and prompt treatment of illnesses. A recent trial in moderately malnourished Malawian children found that those treated with supplementary foods for 12&#x02005;weeks had lower relapse rates and remained well nourished during the subsequent follow-up period of 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Such longer period of care is more likely to be feasible in settings where management of children with SAM is embedded within efforts to prevent malnutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>Our study was a multicentre randomised trial conducted in different regions of India covering diverse populations. The community-based identification of SAM contributed to greater generalisability. Rigorous supervision and control of intervention delivery ensured uninterrupted food supplies across all the groups. Sharing of ingredients for preparation of foods at home is unlikely to have significantly reduced the amount of food offered to the child with SAM because supplies were provided in excess of the child's consumption and in-depth interviews with caregivers revealed little evidence of sharing. The outcome measurement team was independent from the intervention delivery team and workers underwent periodic standardisation exercises to ensure quality of anthropometric data.</p><p>Our study results also make an additional contribution to the literature because in the past children with SAM have been treated for 8&#x02005;weeks. Continuing treatment for 16&#x02005;weeks provides added value in this context where recovery rates were lower than expected at 8&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>The study had some limitations. Around 25% of the children with MUAC&#x0003c;13&#x02005;cm did not come to the study clinic. This might have affected generalisability. This, however, should not have affected the internal validity as children were only randomised after the confirmation of measurements at the clinic. Blinding could have further reduced the risk of bias but this was not feasible as the three interventions had visibly different characteristics&#x02014;one was provided in packets, the other in jars and the third comprised of food ingredients. Based on findings from the initial months, counselling was intensified in all three groups through peer supporters. Therefore, children enrolled earlier received less intensive counselling and help than those enrolled later in the trial. The overall recovery rates we reported are therefore likely to be conservative. We lacked a reliable measure for consumption in the group given ingredients to prepare food at home (A-HPF) due to the complexity of obtaining valid quantitative recalls for the recipes actually used.</p><p>Over 40% of children did not recover after RUTF use for 16&#x02005;weeks. Since the therapeutic foods were discontinued as soon as the child met the definition of recovery, even a small deterioration in WHZ would mean that the child no longer met the definition for recovery by the time of the measurement 16&#x02005;weeks later.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications</title><p>Our study shows that home-based management of children with uncomplicated SAM is an effective and feasible option and that use of a RUTF-L results in higher recovery rates than feeding nutrient-dense and calorie-dense home foods. The gains observed during the initial 16&#x02005;weeks, however, decline after treatment. Other approaches need to be considered to improve long-term outcomes including prolonged use of a RUTF-L. Setting up local units for production of RUTF does not require huge investment in terms of equipment, infrastructure or personnel. The procedures for production are systematic and simple to replicate.</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of home-based management, additional or alternative approaches are needed for the relatively large proportion of children with uncomplicated SAM who do not recover after treatment for 16&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>Our findings indicate that rethinking about ways to combat the problem of severe malnutrition in children are required.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the contribution and support of families of participating children, the community members who served as peer supporters and others in the community who supported this work in other ways.
