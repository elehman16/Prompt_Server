The patients in the experimental group were treated with Quetiapine by taking it three times per day orally. The mean (sd) maintenance dose was 151.2(27.3) mg/d, and the treatment cycle was 6 weeks. Patients in the control group received Risperidone once per day orally with a mean (sd) maintenance dose being 2.3(0.9) mg/d, and the treatment cycle was 6 weeks as well. The PANSS scale was used to assess patients&#x02019; before and after treatment. The researchers also observed any adverse reactions in both treatment strategies and evaluated the effectiveness and safety of both treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean (sd) PANSS scale score of the experimental group after two weeks of treatment was 71.9 (10.2), which was clearly better than the mean (sd) score before treatment (82.6 [11.4]), and was significantly better than the control group&#x02019;s mean (sd) score after two weeks (76.5[12.8]). Also, the experimental group&#x02019;s scores after 4 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of treatment were significantly better than the control group. The experimental group&#x02019;s efficacy rate (94.7%) was higher than the control group&#x02019;s (90.4%); the cure rate of the experimental group (33.3%) was higher than that of the control group (24.7%), and the difference was statistically significant. The rates of adverse reactions in the experimental and control groups were 13.3% and 19.2% respectively, and they were significantly different from each other.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treating alcohol-induced mental disorder with Quetiapine is more effective than treating it with Risperidone. Quetiapine can improve patients&#x02019; symptoms quickly, and lower the chance of adverse reactions. It is effective and safe.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="zh"><sec><title>&#x080cc;&#x0666f;</title><p>&#x04e0e;&#x05229;&#x057f9;&#x0916e;&#x076f8;&#x06bd4;&#x0ff0c;&#x055b9;&#x0786b;&#x05e73;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x09152;&#x07cbe;&#x06240;&#x081f4;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x0969c;&#x0788d; &#x07684;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x053ca;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x06027;&#x05c1a;&#x04e0d;&#x0660e;&#x0786e;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x076ee;&#x06807;</title><p>&#x063a2;&#x08ba8;&#x055b9;&#x0786b;&#x05e73;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x09152;&#x07cbe;&#x06240;&#x081f4;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x0969c;&#x0788d;&#x07684;&#x04e34;&#x05e8a;&#x07597;&#x06548; &#x053ca;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x065b9;&#x06cd5;</title><p>&#x05c06;148 &#x04f8b;&#x09152;&#x07cbe;&#x06240;&#x081f4;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x0969c;&#x0788d;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x06309;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x065b9;&#x05f0f;&#x05206; &#x04e3a;&#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x07ec4;75 &#x04f8b;&#x0548c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;73 &#x04f8b;&#x0ff0c;&#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x07ec4;&#x07ed9;&#x04e88;&#x055b9;&#x0786b;&#x05e73;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x0ff0c; &#x06bcf;&#x065e5;&#x053e3;&#x0670d;3 &#x06b21;&#x0ff0c;&#x05e73;&#x05747;&#x07ef4;&#x06301;&#x05242;&#x091cf;&#x04e3a;151.2(27.3) mg/d&#x0ff0c;&#x06cbb; &#x07597;&#x05468;&#x0671f;&#x04e3a;6 &#x05468;&#x0ff1b;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x04e88;&#x04ee5;&#x05229;&#x057f9;&#x0916e;&#x053e3;&#x0670d;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x0ff0c;&#x06bcf;&#x05929;&#x053e3; &#x0670d;1 &#x06b21;&#x0ff0c;&#x05e73;&#x05747;&#x07ef4;&#x06301;&#x05242;&#x091cf;&#x04e3a;2.3(0.9) mg/d&#x0ff0c;&#x07ef4;&#x06301;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;6 &#x05468;&#x03002; &#x05206;&#x0522b;&#x04e8e;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x0524d;&#x03001;&#x0540e;&#x07528;PANSS &#x091cf;&#x08868;&#x08bc4;&#x05206;&#x0ff0c;&#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x09884;&#x0540e; &#x060c5;&#x051b5;&#x0ff0c;&#x05e76;&#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x04e24;&#x079cd;&#x07597;&#x06cd5;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x08fc7;&#x07a0b;&#x04e2d;&#x07684;&#x04e0d;&#x0826f;&#x053cd;&#x05e94;&#x0ff0c;&#x08bc4;&#x04ef7; &#x04e24;&#x079cd;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x065b9;&#x06cd5;&#x07684;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x0548c;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x06027;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;</title><p> &#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x07ec4;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;2 &#x05468;&#x0540e;PANSS &#x091cf;&#x08868;&#x08bc4;&#x05206;&#x04e3a; 71.9(10.2) &#x05206;&#x0ff0c;&#x08f83;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x0524d;(82.6 (11.4)) &#x05206;&#x0660e;&#x0663e;&#x0597d;&#x08f6c;&#x0ff0c;&#x04e14; &#x04f18;&#x04e8e;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x07684;76.5(12.8)&#x0ff1b;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;4 &#x05468;&#x03001;6 &#x05468;&#x0540e;&#x05404;&#x09879;&#x08bc4;&#x05206; &#x05747;&#x04f18;&#x04e8e;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff0c;&#x04e24;&#x07ec4;&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x05dee;&#x05f02;&#x06709;&#x07edf;&#x08ba1;&#x05b66;&#x0610f;&#x04e49;&#x0ff1b;&#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x07ec4; &#x06709;&#x06548;&#x07387;(94.7%) &#x04f18;&#x04e8e;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;(90.4%)&#x0ff1b;&#x075ca;&#x06108;&#x07387;(33.3%) &#x0660e; &#x0663e;&#x09ad8;&#x04e8e;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;(24.7%) &#x0ff0c;&#x04e24;&#x07ec4;&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x05dee;&#x05f02;&#x05177;&#x06709;&#x07edf;&#x08ba1;&#x05b66;&#x0610f; &#x04e49;&#x0ff1b;&#x089c2;&#x05bdf;&#x07ec4;&#x0548c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x051fa;&#x073b0;&#x04e0d;&#x0826f;&#x053cd;&#x05e94;&#x07684;&#x06982;&#x07387;&#x05206;&#x0522b;&#x04e3a; 13.3%, 19.2%&#x0ff0c;&#x04e24;&#x07ec4;&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x05dee;&#x05f02;&#x05177;&#x06709;&#x07edf;&#x08ba1;&#x05b66;&#x0610f;&#x04e49;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x07ed3;&#x08bba;</title><p>&#x055b9;&#x0786b;&#x05e73;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x09152;&#x07cbe;&#x06240;&#x081f4;&#x07cbe;&#x0795e;&#x0969c;&#x0788d;&#x07684;&#x06548;&#x0679c;&#x04f18;&#x04e8e;&#x05229;&#x057f9; &#x0916e;&#x0ff0c;&#x05176;&#x053ef;&#x05feb;&#x0901f;&#x06539;&#x05584;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x075c7;&#x072b6;&#x0ff0c;&#x04e14;&#x04e0d;&#x0826f;&#x053cd;&#x05e94;&#x053d1;&#x0751f;&#x07684;&#x098ce;&#x09669;&#x04f4e;&#x0ff0c; &#x0662f;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x07684;&#x03002;</p></sec></trans-abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>mental disorder</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>Quetiapine</kwd><kwd>effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Psychoactive substances are referred to as the kinds of chemical substances that can affect people&#x02019;s emotion, daily behavior, state of consciousness, and result in abusing substances.<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The symptoms of mental disorders caused by that mainly include hallucinations, delusions, emotional impulsiveness, paranoia and so on.<sup>[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Previous studies suggest that the prognosis of psychoactive substance-induced mental disorders is normally quite poor. For psychoactive substance-induced mental disorders, psychotic symptoms almost always remain and social functioning can be impaired if substance abuse is severe. Alcohol-induced mental disorder is a clinically common disorder induced by abusing psychoactive substances; taking medicine is the first choice of treating this kind of disorder, and large doses of B vitamins combining with small doses of antipsychotics are mostly used in clinical settings currently.<sup>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Several studies have shown that treating mental disorders induced by psychoactive substances with Quetiapine and Risperidone can achieve good effectiveness, and both drugs can control hallucinations and delusions effectively. However, little research has been done to compare these two drugs. The present study found that treating alcohol-induced mental disorder with Quetiapine is effective with a lower chance of adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

All participants were patients with alcohol-induced mental disorder who were admitted to our hospital from January 2012 to December 2014. In order to compare the differences between treating patients with Quetiapine and Risperidone, possible confounding factors needed to be eliminated. Therefore, the present study only recruited patients whose main medicine was Quetiapine or Risperidone. One hundred and seventy-nine patients who were below 60 were recruited initially, then 31 patients were excluded due to a variety of reasons (i.e. 6 patients were excluded during the treatment. 7 patients declined to participate in the randomized controlled study. 4 patients could not stop relevant medicines before the study. 4 patients failed to adhere to medication regiment. Four patients later withdrew consent. 2 patients had a history of abusing other substances. 2 patients were receiving psychological therapy. 2 patients dropped out.). 148 patients were randomly divided into two groups. There were 75 patients in the experimental group with an age range of 33 to 57. The mean (sd) age was 40.1 (6.3), and the mean (sd) years of abusing alcohol was 11.7 (7.1). The mean (sd) course of disease was 23.1 (6.5) months. The control group had 73 patients with an age range from 31 to 58. The mean (sd) age was 39.8 (6.0) years and the mean (sd) years of abusing alcohol was 12.1 (6.8). The mean (sd) course of disease was 22.7 (6.3) months. The ages and histories of abusing alcohol of both groups were not significantly different. This study design was approved by the ethics committee of the Chongqing San Xia Central Hospital. The participants and their family provided written consent to participate in this study.</p><p><bold>Inclusion criteria</bold>: (a)Patients met the criteria of psychoactive substance-induced mental disorder in Chinese classification and diagnostic criteria of mental disease, the third version (CCMD-3),<sup>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and there was exact evidence indicating the substance was alcohol; (b)The patients&#x02019; scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were equal to or above 60;<sup>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> (c) Patients&#x02019; physical examination and testing results were normal, and there was no relevant drug contraindications; (d) patients were between the ages of 18 and 60, (e) legal guardians provided written informed consent. <bold>Exclusion criteria</bold>: (a)The patients who had severe medical conditions and could not tolerate relevant drugs were excluded; (b)The patients who had a history of abusing other substances or were in lactation or pregnant were excluded; (c) patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other mental disorders were excluded; (d)patients who were allergic to Quetiapine or Risperidone were excluded; (e) patients whose legal guardians refused to have them participate were excluded; (f)patients who had to receive electrical stimulation therapies or psychological therapies or other therapies that might compromise the results of the present study were excluded.</p><p><bold>Drop-out criteria</bold>: (a) patients who became intolerant of the drugs or suffered from worse symptoms could drop out; (b) patients who refused to participate, lost contact or had other unexpected situations could drop out; (c) patients who did not take medicine according to the instructions could drop out.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>2.3 Medicine</title><p>Quetiapine, product name: Qi Wei, dose: 100mg, Hunan Dong Ting Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, China, approved number: H2000466.</p><p>Risperidone, product name: Wei Si Tong, dose: 1mg per tablet, Xian Yang Sen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, China, approved number: H20010309.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>2.4 Grouping and treatment</title><p>The present study is a 6-week randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study. One hundred and forty-eight patients were divided into the experimental group (i.e. receiving Quetiapine, 75 cases) and the control group (i.e. receiving Risperidone, 73 cases) with randomized number generated by a computer. In order to be clean, all patients stopped taking any relevant medicine a week before the study, and they also stopped drinking alcohol, smoking and using other substances that might have an effect on their prognoses. The patients in the experimental group took Quetiapine orally. In the first week of the treatment, the dose was increased gradually. In other words, on the first and second days, they took 25 mg three times per day, and then the dose was increased by 25 mg every two days. On the seventh day, the dose was 75 mg three times per day. In the second week of the treatment, the dose was adjusted within 100-300 mg every day, depending on patients&#x02019; symptoms and tolerance of the medicine, and the mean (sd) dose was 151.2 (27.3) mg. The course of treatment was 6 weeks. The patients in the control group took Risperidone orally, starting with 1 mg/d. The dose was increased to 4 mg/d gradually, and was adjusted according to the symptoms and tolerance of the medicine. The highest dose was 6 mg/d, and the mean (sd) dose was 2.3 (0.9) mg/d. The course of treatment was also 6 weeks. During the treatment course, all patients did not take other antipsychotics at the same time. For the ones who showed severe insomnia they were treated with Zolpidem. If the patients had tremor and delirium responses during the treatment, they were injected with 100 mg B<sub>1</sub> vitamin, 0.5 mg B<sub>12</sub> vitamin with the supportive treatment of 1 mg Clonazepam intravenous infusion and adding Potassium.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>2.5 Outcome measures and effectiveness</title><p>Two professional clinicians examined the same patients at the end of the second, fourth and sixth week, and scored them independently. Pearson product-moment correlation indicated that the consistency between two raters was good. Scores of PANSS indicated the effectiveness of the treatments on patients. The patients&#x02019; blood, urine, liver function, kidney function, blood sugar and ECG were examined regularly, and adverse reactions were documented during the treatment. Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale was employed to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse reactions, and the results were documented.<sup>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>The methods of rating effectiveness can be referred to the method adopted by Sun and colleagues,<sup>[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and the effectiveness is classified as cured, improved markedly, improved and ineffective.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec2-11"><title>4.1 Main findings</title><p>Alcohol-induced mental disorder is a clinically common mental disorder, and its morbidity is increasing. The present study has shown that compared to Risperidone, Quetiapine has better effectiveness on treating patients with this disorder. Quetiapine can lower patients&#x02019; scores on the positive symptoms scale, negative symptoms scale, psychopathology scale and the total scores within a short period of time, and improve patients&#x02019; clinical symptoms. The comparisons between these two groups were significantly different. After six weeks of treatment, the cure rate (33.3%) and the total effectiveness rate (94.7%) of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (24.7%, 90.4%), so the prognoses were satisfying. The rate of the adverse reactions caused by the Quetiapine treatment (13.3%) was lower than that of the control group (19.2%), and this difference was statistically significant. Moreover, the scores after the second week, the fourth week and the sixth week were lower than the baseline score, and the experimental group&#x02019;s PANSS scores were lower than those of the control group. The differences of all items between two groups were statistically significant.</p><p>Psychoactive substances can lead to the strengthening effect of the dopamine midbrain limbic system. Previous studies have shown that almost all psychoactive substances including alcohol, amphetamines, and opioid drugs can make the dopamine level outside the cells higher than the normal level. Boutros and colleagues have found that when the psychoactive substance-induced mental disorders last more than six weeks, the mental symptoms are no longer related to the severity of abusing substances simply, but probably related to the pathological changes inside the brain.<sup>[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Alcohol is a kind of neural characteristic friendly substance that can induce an anesthetic effect; consuming alcohol over the long term can lead to alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, alcohol poisoning and withdraw symptoms, these consequences could severely impair patients&#x02019; physical, mental and social functioning. <sup>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Currently, the main treatment for alcohol-induced mental disorder is medication, and atypical antipsychotic drugs can alleviate this kind of mental disorder effectively.<sup>[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Besides the mental disorder, alcohol also affects patients&#x02019; physical health, such as extrapyramidal system impairment and so forth; therefore, both treatment effectiveness and drugs&#x02019;safety should be considered.<sup>[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> If during the treatment, patients with alcohol-induced mental disorder show tremor, delirium and other symptoms that jeopardize their lives, we need to prevent them from dying with corresponding treatments.</p><p>Risperidone is a derivative of benzene, and it is a selective single amine antagonist;it is one of the antipsychotic drugs that are used commonly in China, and it has relatively good effectiveness for treating psychoactive substance-induced mental disorder.<sup>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> But Risperidone&#x02019;s blocking effect on D2 receptors is relatively strong, and it can lead to extrapyramidal system symptoms such as dysmyotonia, tremor, delirium, and relentlessness during treatment. Furthermore, Risperidone and its metabolism can block the D2 receptors on the hypothalamic-funnel pathway, which can lead to hyperprolactinemia.<sup>[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Patients may stop taking medication due to the adverse reactions listed above, which leads to poor treatment effectiveness and relapse. Quetiapine is a kind of atypical antipsychotic drug that has become popular recently, and it has interaction with plenty neurotransmitter receptors. It is the antagonist of multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the neural system. Previous studies have shown that it plays its role by blocking 5-HT and DA receptors, and this can improve patients&#x02019; positive symptoms effectively,<sup>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> which can help alleviate patients&#x02019; clinical symptoms. In the meantime, studies have also found that Quetiapine can stimulate dopamine&#x02019;s activity that is in a low excited state, therefore they suggest that it is effective on treating the unseen symptoms and cognition functioning impairment caused by alcohol.<sup>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Quetiapine&#x02019;s affinity to the 5-HT receptor is clearly higher than that to DA receptor, so it has less effect on other body parts while it is treating the mental disorder. Therefore, it has less side effects and a higher clinical adaptability, which extends its clinical application range.<sup>[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>4.2 Limitations</title><p>The present study is a control study with a single center and a relatively small sample size, and the treatment the participants received before they were admitted into the hospital was not considered. Therefore, in order to verify the findings of the present study, the sample size should be expanded and the study design should be stricter. In this study, we increased the dose gradually so that the impairments caused by the medication would be reduced. In the meantime, we also gave the patients a period of time to adjust to the drugs. We were able to evaluate the responses of patients with mental disorder to Quetiapine and Risperidone after six weeks of treatment, but we still need more time to explore the safety and the effectiveness of drugs and their effectiveness on preventing mental disorders from relapsing. During the treatment, clinicians evaluated the adverse reactions in every clinical interview, but no standardized assessment tools were used to quantify the severity of complications. Hence, some adverse reactions which were not very severe were overlooked.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>4.3 Implications</title><p>Even though the present study has a relatively small sample size and a short duration of observation, the clinical results of two groups of patients have still provided amble evidence that supports the following statement: the effect of Quetiapine on treating mental disorder induced by alcohol is better than that of Risperidone, and it can improve the symptoms quickly; moreover, the chance of causing adverse reactions is low, which suggests that it is safe.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Conflict of interest</bold></p><p>The authors declared no conflict of interest related to this manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Informed consent</bold></p><p>All participants and their legal guardians provided signed informed consent to participate this study.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval</bold></p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing San Xia Central Hospital Pinghu Branch.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>Bei Lv took the responsibility to write the article, and Haishui Duan was in charge of reviewing the content.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e42"><graphic xlink:href="sap-28-204-g003.gif" mime-subtype="tif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><p>Dr. Bei Lv graduated from Mudanjiang Medical School with a bachelor degree in July 2006.
