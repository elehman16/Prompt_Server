Patient&#x02019;s demands for esthetic restorations have caused a recent increase in the use of tooth colored restorative materials. To achieve clinical success with such restorations, good adhesion between restorative materials and tooth substrates is of crucial importance in order to ensure good marginal sealing, reinforcement of the tooth structure, and longer life of the restoration.</p><p>The adequate hybrid layer formation is believed to be essential to create a strong and durable bond between resin and dentin. It is very well understood that the density of dentinal tubules varies with dentinal depth and as well as the water content of dentin is lowest in superficial dentin and highest in deep dentin. This is probably because the amount of hypermineralized peritubular dentin increases at about the same rate as the amount of intertubular dentin decreases leaving average mineral content very similar, in superficial and deep dentin. The amount of collagen per unit volume of dentin decreases from superficial to deep dentin. This is probably due to the fact that deep dentin has larger tubules than superficial dentin and hence has less intertubular collagen than superficial dentin. The permeability of bonding substrates to monomers and the monomer diffusibility into the substrate are essential factors for the hybridization of resins in dental substrates. The permeability increases in an apical coronal direction and from superficial to deep dentin. While the permeability of inner radicular dentin is only 1:5 of the crown, this value descends to 1:20 in the outer radicular dentin. As of today no studies are available to indicate the effectiveness of new generation self-etching primers against superficial middle and deep dentin. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is a correlation between dentin depth permeability and bond strength of adhesive resins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Forty-eight freshly extracted human molar teeth, non-carious and without having cracks were collected.</p><p>All teeth were sectioned at various levels using a carborundum disc:</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Adhesion to acid-etched enamel was proposed by Buonocore in 1955. Long-lasting adhesion between enamel and resin has been proven by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and clinical researches for over five decades. However, bonding to dentin is far more challenging compared to enamel bonding of composite resin, which has a long track record. The enhanced bonding between resin and dentin was established by dentin hybridization. Basically, the hybrid layer formation creates the composite structure of resin, collagen and hydroxyapatite or the functionally graded material between the resin and the dentin. Dentin is a dynamic tissue. It represents a challenge as regards resin based adhesives while the bond strength of enamel has been studied extensively, bonding to dentin with the generation of bonding systems has Tagami <italic>et al</italic>. (1990)<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> attributed this either to differences in chemical composition or regional differences in wetness (dentin permeability). Thus there are several factors that may contribute to high coefficient of variation that is often reported in dentin shear bond strength studies.</p><p>Pashley <italic>et al</italic>. (1993)<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> studied the bond strengths to superficial, intermediate and deep dentin <italic>in vivo</italic> with four dentin bonding systems and demonstrated higher bond strengths in superficial dentin and progressively lower bond strengths in deep dentin.</p><p>Tao and Pashley (1988)<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> investigated shear bond strengths to dentin: effects of surface treatment, depth, and position. They demonstrated that there were significant differences in bond strengths at different depths of dentin after etching the surface but not if the smear layer was left undisturbed.</p><p>Tagami <italic>et al</italic>. (1990)<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> attempted to establish a relationship between dentin permeability and dentin depth and confirmed the results of the previous work on human dentin that permeability increases as dentin becomes thinner. This is possibly due to an increase in tubule diameter and increase in tubular dentin as dentin is thin toward the pulp chamber. The relationship between shear bond strengths of All Bond 2 system and self-etch primers against different levels of dentin depth provided interesting observations. There was a strong correlation between the All Bond 2 and self-etch primer group and dentin depth.</p><p>Suzuki and Finger (1988)<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> studied the efficacy of dentin bonding systems based on the site of dentin with reference to the observation of Causton that bond strengths to deep dentin were considerably lower than those to superficial dentin. This study has confirmed the observation of Causton that the efficacy of dentin adhesives depends on the dentin surface from superficial to deep dentin in the tooth tested. Different from etch and rinse adhesives, self-etch adhesives do not require a separate etching step as they contain acidic monomers that simultaneously condition and prime the dental substrate. Consequently, this approach has been claimed to be user-friendlier and less technique sensitive, thereby resulting in a reliable clinical performance though this appeared very product dependent. User friendlier because of shorter application time and less steps and less technique sensitive because no wet bonding but simple drying. Comparatively with the self-etch adhesives there is a lower incidence of post-operative sensitivity experienced by the patient. This should to a great extent be attributed to the less aggressive and thus more superficial interaction with the dentin leaving tubules largely obstructed with smear layer.</p><p>Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> observed that at enamel, an etch and rinse approach using phosphoric acid remains the choice of preference since it not only guarantees the most durable bond to enamel but also seals and thus protects the more vulnerable bond to dentin against degradation. The most recent research investigated to which extent this compromised enamel bonding obtained with mild self-etch adhesives could be attributed to enamel during cavity preparation. The lower bonding effectiveness of self-etch adhesives to enamel should be ascribed most likely in the first place to less potential for micro-mechanical interlocking but also to a lower chemical reactivity.</p><p>Triolo and Swift (1992)<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in their <italic>in vitro</italic> study tested the shear bond strengths of nine third generation dentin bonding systems and concluded that bond strengths are generally less to deep dentin than superficial and intermediate dentin.</p><p>Pegado <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> compared the effect of different bonding strategies on adhesion to deep and superficial dentin and concluded that bond strength obtained in superficial dentin was significantly higher than that in deep dentin for all adhesives tested. They further concluded that the bond strengths of dentin bonding agents at any depth is dependent on the area occupied by resin tags, the area of intertubular dentin that is infiltrated by the resin and the area of surface adhesion.</p><p>Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> recommended that for further optimization of the self-etch approach, synthesis of functional monomers tailored to exhibit good chemical bonding potential following a mild self-etch approach. The approach appears to guarantee the most durable bonding performance at dentin provided that it deals adequately with the debris smeared across the surface by the bur. Micromechanical interlocking is still the best strategy to bond to enamel. Selective phosphoric acid etching of enamel cavity margins is therefore today highly recommended followed by applying a self-etch procedure to both the earlier etched enamel and un-etched dentin. Such mild self-etch adhesives should contain functional monomers with a high chemical affinity to hydroxyapatite.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> investigation was conducted to determine the bond strength of superficial, intermediate and deep dentin with self-etching primers (Clearfil Liner Bond 2V and Xeno III) and fourth generation bonding system (All Bond 2) and single composite resin.
