They are usually frail and elderly, with more than 30% aged &#x02265; 85 years. In European series, hip fracture patients have a 30-day mortality of &#x0003e;10%, and a 1-year mortality of 25&#x02013;30%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] Despite the advances in surgical and anaesthetic techniques during the last 20 years there has been no decrease in mortality after surgical repair of hip fractures. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]</p><p>The discussion about cemented or non-cemented hemiarthroplasty is similar to the discussion about cemented or cementless prostheses in primary hip arthroplasty. With respect to the latter, conflicting data are presented by the Swedish and Norwegian arthroplasty registers. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] The general opinion is that cementless hip arthroplasties are more suitable for younger patients owing to the quality of their bone stock. In hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture surgery there are insufficient data from randomised trials to conclude on the superiority of either type of arthroplasty. Some authors found patients with cemented stems to have less pain and better mobility postoperatively than those with an non-cemented press fit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Mid-thigh pain is frequently reported in primary cementless total hip arthroplasties. However, the reported incidence varies tremendously; D'Lima et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in a control-matched study reported 34%~vs.~3%, while Gr&#x000fc;bl et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in a non-controlled series reported only 3% for cementless primary total hip arthroplasties.</p><p>In cemented hemiarthroplasties polymethylmethacrylate bone cement is applied at the time of surgery, forming a solid bond between the prosthesis and the femoral bone; on the contrary, in cementless prosthesis the bonding between prosthesis and femur is dependent upon bony in-growth. Potential advantages of cementing are a less post-operative mid thigh pain, as the prosthesis is firmly fixed within the femur, and a reduced long-term revision rate from loosening of the prosthesis. Major side effects of cement are cardiac arrhythmias and cardio-respiratory collapse, which occasionally occur on application. These potentially fatal complications are caused either by embolism from marrow contents forced into the circulation or by a direct toxic effect of the cement. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] Another major disadvantage of a cemented prosthesis is that revision arthroplasty will be more difficult.</p><p>The non-cemented hemiarthroplasty used in our study is the DB-10 (Biomet, Warsaw, USA), a straight collared stem designed to provide primary stability and to prevent migration. The primary stability of the stem, which has a narrow tip to guide the implant, is optimised by metaphyseal anchoring: intimate trabecular bone contact and optimised load transfer to the dynamic bone through to the posterolateral angle situated in the axis of the neck. Secondary stability (prevention of migration) is facilitated by optimizing bone in-growth surface through full hydroxyapatite coating on macro-structured titanium and grooves on A/P sides.</p><p>The cemented hemiarthroplasty used in our study is the M&#x000fc;ller Straight Stem prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, USA), developed with the advice of Professor M.E. M&#x000fc;ller. It has now been in use reliably for many years; Ried et al. found a 15-year survival of 94%. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] The fluted structure of the stem, with the two particularly marked longitudinal grooves AP in the stem axis, enables good cement adhesion. The small proximal collar serves to compress the cement, prevents the stem from sinking into the cement, and, together with the fine-blasted surface of the straight stem, achieves a stable anchorage of the implant.</p><p>Both prostheses have a unipolar head.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A single blinded randomised clinical multicentre trial will be conducted. Patients will be randomised to 2 groups of 100 in the operation theatre by a randomisation computer (IRIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, SDS Medical, The Netherlands). The treatment will be either a cemented hemiarthroplasty or a non-cemented hemiarthroplasty. If complications occur during the procedure, the surgeon can change the procedure to ensure best medical practice.</p><p>We acknowledge the possibility that the patients might be able to tell which prosthesis they have received due to seeing their X ray during the outpatient clinic visits.</p><p>All patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture who are admitted to one of the participating hospitals and meet the inclusion criteria are asked to join the study. In case of (mental) incompetence of the patient his/her legal representative is consulted to obtain informed consent.</p><p>The study design, procedures and informed consent are approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of South West Netherlands.</p><p>Trial number Netherlands Trial Registry NTR 1508, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl"/></p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study will be conducted at the Orthopaedic Departments of the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis Delft, Ziekenhuis Rijnstate Alysis Zorggroep Arnhem, Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Nijmegen and Elisabeth Ziekenhuis Tilburg.</p><p>Authors PP and AV will be responsible for the data and safety monitoring.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: patients aged = 70 years, with a displaced femoral neck fracture (Garden type III or IV) not older than 7~days are included.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: patients with a pathological fracture, a fracture older than 7 days or ASA-V classification are excluded.</p><p>Accrual is planned in the period from August 2008 to August 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients will be receive either a cemented hemiarthroplasty, type M&#x000fc;ller Straight Stem (Zimmer, Warsaw USA), or a non-cemented hemiarthroplasty, type DB-10 (Biomet, Warsaw USA). Every surgeon will use the same surgical approach for all implants &#x02013; either straight lateral or posterolateral. The approach of choice is up to the surgeon's preference, as Parker's Cochrane analysis has shown that insufficient evidence is available for superiority of either approach.

The first postoperative assessment will be in a clinical setting as the patient is still in the hospital. Assessments at 6, 12 and 52 weeks postoperatively will be made in the outpatient clinic, unless the patient is not able to visit the outpatient clinic; in that case questionnaires are mailed to the patient (possibly through contact with a relative) to obtain as much data as possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of sample size</title><sec><title>(a) Duration of surgery</title><p>It is expected that a cemented hemiarthroplasty on average will take 12 min longer than a non-cemented hemiarthroplasty.

Less than 24 seconds is considered good functioning and has hardly any chance to fall. 42 seconds is considered poor functioning with a considerable chance to fall. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] About 30% of the patients have a poor score at discharge. About 70% of all patients are admitted from their own homes or assisted living facilities. If non-inferiority is considered for TUG, a worsening of score from 30 to 42 is considered clinically relevant, with a SD of 10 sec., giving 16 patients a group. Corrected for the percentage admitted from home or assisted living facility (70%) and the drop out of 35% gives 34 patients a group</p><p>&#x02022; GARS: The GARS data for this group of patients are insufficient to make valid calculations of statistical power. While data for multiple sclerosis patients and healthy older patients are available, there are none for patients with a hip fracture. An estimate is made based on preliminary data from a prospective survey in progress. As soon as sufficient data from this survey are available a final power calculation for GARS will be done.</p><p>&#x02022; Mid thigh pain</p><p>Rather varying figures about mid-tight pain are reported in literature. D'Lima [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] reported 40 vs. 3% whereas v/d Wal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported 20 vs. 12% in non-tight proximal fit prosthesis.

A cemented hemiarthroplasty has been used in the majority of cases in most countries, but the non-cemented prosthesis is gaining popularity. Parker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] concluded that there is only limited evidence from randomised studies that cementing prosthesis in place may reduce the amount of post-operative pain and may lead to improved mobility. Furthermore no study has adequately addressed long-term outcome measures concerning this topic.</p><p>Cementing has potential physiologically adverse side effects. The major side effects cardiac arrhythmias and cardio-respiratory collapse, which occasionally occur upon application; these potentially fatal complications are caused either by embolism from marrow contents forced into the circulation or by a direct toxic effect of the cement. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] Transesophageal echocardiography could be used to monitor emboli during surgery, but logistics prevent this in our centres, as most patients are operated outside regular working hours. Nevertheless, Pitto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have already shown severe embolic events and intraoperative pulmonary impairment during fixation of the cemented femoral component in total hip arthroplasty, while fixation without cement clearly demonstrated a low risk of embolism. Clark et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found a transient but significant reduction in cardiac output and stroke volume for those receiving cement.</p><p>In non-cemented prostheses, bone quality is of importance; this is generally poor in elderly patients. LaPorte et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] stated two relative contraindications for non-cemented total hip prosthesis: interference with bone in-growth and inability to achieve a congruent fit; both of these preclude establishment of rigid initial stability.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to compare treatment for displaced femoral neck fracture by cemented versus non-cemented hemiarthroplasty. We hypothesise that, relative to cemented hemiarthroplasty, non-cemented hemiarthroplasty will result in at least the same technical-functional outcome and complication rate, with a shorter operation time. The results of this study will be presented as soon as they become available.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Author PP has received fundings of both Biomet and Zimmer.
