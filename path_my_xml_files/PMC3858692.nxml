With the approval of the institutional ethics committee and the written well-versed consent of the patients only those patients who, after a primary interview, expressed a need to voluntarily participate in the study. This was accordingly documented in our informed Consent Form, were included in the groups. 80 ASA physical statuses I, II patients of both genders, aged between 18-65 years who were scheduled for elective one level discectomy (the removal of a herniated disk to relieve pressure on a single nerve root) under spinal anesthesia enrolled in this prospective randomized clinical trial. Four patients were excluded from our study, two refused to participate, and one was addicted to opium and one was partially deaf. Patients were randomized with sealed envelope method and each envelope was randomly assigned from this set of envelops (number 1 to 80) to be either in case group one (video group) or control groups two (no audio and video and only head phone on their ears) group.</p><p>All the patients were fasting for 8 hours before surgery and meanwhile, they received one liter of Lactated Ringer's solution and no patient received premedication. Then all individuals were given Bupivacaine intrathecally in a volume of 3mL. Spinal anesthesia was performed in sitting position and using a 23 gauge Quincke needle with a midline approach at either L2/L3, L3/L4 or L4/L5 (determined by palpation of the bony landmarks) injection was done slowly (at least 10 seconds) with barbotages technique by one anesthesiologist. In the operating room, all of the patients had both of their legs wrapped with an elastic bandage to prevent hypotension and blood stasis. The surgical procedure was started as soon as an analgesic affects riches at level T10. Then the patients turned to prone position with a pillow under their head. Oxygen (2-3 L/min) was given via a nasal cannula. After turning back, the patient in prone position could watch a video clip and hear its sound with a handset free (DVD player with 10 inch LCD screen/LG DP-1400T). The patients could choose their favorite video clip among different cases. Subjects were monitored non-invasively for blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2) and electrocardiography evaluations (Datex Ohmeda/Finland) before insertion of needle, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 minute later and after arriving in the recovery and finally after releasing from recovery. In all patients, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and SPO2 were measured and recorded in the questionnaire chart. If nausea and vomiting occurred were treated by administration of 10mg metoclopramid. Other parameters including ephedrine and atropine injection, patient satisfaction (1-10, 10 was full satisfaction and 1 was the worst) and stress (1-10, 1 was no stress and 10 was the most stress can be experienced in their life) were recorded. All data and finding were statistically analyzed by SPSS-16 Software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 80 patients with LDH, 53 patients were male and 27 female.

On the other hand, many patients have tremendous phobia of spine anesthesia because they claim that one could hear the sounds of operating room and also see what is going on at their surroundings.</p><p>Meanwhile, the consciousness of the patients could be in some aspects troublesome, for example the patients may suffer from hearing the common dialogues between operating room crew including anesthesia and surgical stuffs, as well as incomprehensive sound of operating rooms such as anesthesia monitoring and surgical equipment's sounds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The problem of patients hearing had been the subjects of many clinical studies, with more or less advantageous successes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Although it is possible to mask the hearing ability of the patients by different techniques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] but they could still see what is happening in the operating room and this is the points of view that have not been included in other studies.</p><p>Although, in study of Maeyama <italic>et al</italic>. they used Bispectral index monitoring (BIS) and interview type psychology test, State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), to estimate music-therapy on reducing anxiety but still the vision of the patients wasn&#x02019;t considered in their conclusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] To reduce attention of the patients propofol sedation is helpful[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and meanwhile playing music or blocking noise can reduce BIS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It seems that sedation could decrease the attention of patients may be partially by reduction of their vision.</p><p>The sedative effects of music play were also evaluated by other studies with more or less beneficial effects by BIS during target-controlled infusion with administration of propofol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Although, the music itself or by masking the operating room noise could decrease the anxiety of patients or even reduce the dosage of intraoperative sedative requirements in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] We believe that by displaying video clip it is possible to not only reduce the attention of the patients but also to provide a favorable operating room ambiance for them.
