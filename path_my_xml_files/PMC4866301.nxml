Passive referral providing SC information to smokers is commonly used in SC studies. Little was known about active referral in the community setting. This study aims to motivate community smokers to quit by brief SC advice using a validated AWARD model (Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer and Do-it-again) that adjunct with active referral of smokers to various SC services in Hong Kong.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a single-blinded, parallel three-armed cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two treatment groups of (1) brief SC advice using the AWARD model, active referral to SC services plus a referral card and a health warning leaflet (active referral group) and (2) brief SC advice using AWARD model and health warning leaflet (brief advice group) and a control group receives general very brief advice with a self-help booklet. A total of 1291 smokers will be recruited from 66 clusters (recruitment sessions) with 22 will be allocated to each of the two intervention and one control groups. SC ambassadors will be trained for delivering the interventions and conducting telephone follow-up. The primary outcomes are self-reported 7-days point prevalence (PP) abstinence at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up. Intention-to-treat principle and multi-level regressions will be used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first RCT on assessing a model combining brief advice and active referral to SC services among community smokers.

Although the daily cigarette smoking prevalence in HK halved from 23.3&#x000a0;% in 1985 to 10.5&#x000a0;% in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], smoking and second-hand smoke accounted for 16&#x000a0;% of the overall number of deaths (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;43,397) in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Smoking cessation (SC) is highly cost-effective when compared to other health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The World Health Organization MPOWER policy package of &#x0201c;offer help to quit&#x0201d; means proactive SC services are needed to encourage smokers to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current clinical SC practice guidelines of 5As <italic>(</italic><bold><italic>A</italic></bold><italic>sk</italic>, <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><italic>ssess</italic>, <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><italic>dvise</italic>, <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><italic>ssist</italic> and <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><italic>rrange)</italic> also emphasizes assisting smokers to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Most of current SC services use the passive method to recruit smokers that rely on smokers&#x02019; self-initiation to seek help, such as calling the quit-line or attending the SC clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The impact (effect of SC multiple by the number of smokers covered) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] of the SC services is limited as only 16&#x000a0;% of smokers seek SC services worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is worth-noting that HK smokers&#x02019; awareness of the SC services has been reduced (70.3&#x000a0;% in 2012 vs. 59.1&#x000a0;% in 2015) and hence the prevalence of services usage among these smokers dropped as well (8.5&#x000a0;% vs. 5.0&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This suggests SC services promotion may be sufficient but further increase of usage needs innovative intervention. Thus, smokers should be introduced with, motivated to use and be proactively referred to the service to increase its impact.</p><p>Referral intervention includes passive and active methods. Passive referral involves asking or encouraging the smokers to use the SC services (e.g. quit-line or clinics) by providing information sheet of the service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Smokers have to contact the service providers by their own effort and often only a small promotion of smokers will do so. In contrast, active referral involves physicians or other healthcare professionals formally referring smokers (sending smokers&#x02019; information, mainly the contact method) to SC services via fax, mail or centralized computer system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which overcomes the barrier of self-initiation. Once the SC service providers receive smokers&#x02019; information, they would subsequently call the smokers for arranging further cessation interventions. The effect of active referral for SC may be larger than that of passive referral as most who were passively referred to SC services failed to call the quit-lines for assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Particularly, Borland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that fax referring smokers to an evidence-based quit-line service doubled the quit rate of the standard in-practice general practitioner management at 12-month follow-up (12.3&#x000a0;% vs 6.9&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Evidence on the effects of active referral on smoking abstinence and SC services use were scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Most of these studies were conducted in the clinical settings, which showed the feasibility of utilising centralized manpower and patients&#x02019; database for developing new models of SC services. However, it is less clear about the feasibility and effectiveness of active referral in the community setting, where accounts for the majority of the smokers who mostly do not actively seek SC services. Smokers in the community may be different to those who are attending the clinics regarding levels of addiction, quit attempts and intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Unlike clinical settings, lengthy interventions are less feasible in the community setting and community smokers have no prior rapport with the interventionists. Thus, a brief on-site intervention model is more feasible and subsequent intensive intervention can be referred to current SC services.</p><p>Based on the established SC guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we have refined the SC guideline and developed a brief validated SC intervention using AWARD model: <italic>Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer and Do-it-again</italic> for community smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Short advice lasting for 30&#x000a0;s to 10&#x000a0;min was found to be feasible in the community setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While most of the previous studies only focused on the quit-line referral (only one clinic referral study is identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]), there is limited knowledge on the effectiveness of referral to various SC services including quit-line, clinics and traditional acupuncture treatments. This RCT aims to motivate smokers to quit using brief intervention (AWARD) and actively refer smokers to major SC services in HK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of design</title><p>This is a single-blinded, parallel three-armed cluster RCT with 1291 smokers aged 18 or above will be recruited from the community (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Public open places with high flow of smokers will be identified and these mostly include outdoor places near large shopping malls or housing estates. Booths containing SC and recruitment messages will be set up onsite to attract smokers. Well-trained SC ambassadors will actively recruit the smokers who are near or attending the booths. The SC ambassadors are trained university students (mainly from the fields of nursing, public health, science and social sciences) and volunteers from the non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The SC ambassadors have to attend a two-day workshop in which they learnt the basic knowledge on smoking, tobacco control, SC services, skills on recruitment and intervention delivery. We will adopt &#x0201c;a-foot-in-the-door&#x0201d; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] by asking the smokers their interests on participating in the SC trial. Smokers who showed interests will be assessed for eligibility and informed consents will be sought. The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW15-332) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02539875).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cluster randomization</title><p>All participants recruited in a particular recruitment activity will be allocated to one of the 3 RCT groups.

The investigator will generate a list of random numbers in each block using Microsoft Excel. The list of random numbers will be assigned to a list of group assignment in which the first, second and third tertile will be as the active referral, brief advice and control groups respectively. A co-investigator who is not aware of allocation group will subsequently sort the random number in each block and that will be the group assignment sequence of the recruitment activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>The RCT is single-blinded that all outcome assessors are not aware of the group assignment of the subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample-size calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of self-reported 7-day PP quit rate at the 3-month follow-up. Based on the previous similar studies conducted in the community in Hong Kong, the 3-month quit rate for the control group was approximately 10.0&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. According to the RCT of active referral conducted by Borland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the rate ratio of quit rate for the intervention and control group was 1.92 (intervention group: 12.3&#x000a0;%, control group: 6.9&#x000a0;%). Therefore, the effect size for the intervention in this study is set conservatively at 1.60. The quit rate for the intervention group (a combination of active referral and brief advice groups) versus the control group is 16.0 and 10.0&#x000a0;% respectively. To detect a significant difference of quit rate between intervention and control groups with a power of 80 and 5&#x000a0;% significance level, we will need 284 subjects per group. Assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient as 0.005 and retention rate of 70&#x000a0;% at the 3-month follow-up, the total sample size taking into account in the intra-cluster correlation within each recruitment session and attrition is 1291.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Each RCT group consists of one or a combination of two/three of the following component as the intervention.

Unlike recruiting smokers in the clinical setting where smokers may be more motivated by the undesirable health condition, recruiting smokers in the community may be more difficult. Brief SC advice and referral provided by physicians and other healthcare professionals in the clinical setting has been found effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], our study leads to deliver SC advice and refer smokers to SC services by training the university students and volunteers from the NGOs, which is cheaper than health care professionals. This study is unique in several ways. We will refer smokers not only to the SC quit-lines but also to the SC clinics (Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine) upon smokers&#x02019; preference. Such strategy allows smokers to choose a service that they believe to be most useful and hence shall increase their adherence to the service. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention not solely by the abstinence rate, but also assessing smokers&#x02019; substantial use of referred service and their comments over the service.</p><p>If the intervention is proven feasible and effective in SC, it could ease the burden made by smoking on the medical system as the referral and SC advice are not necessarily to be done by healthcare professionals and hopefully result in less medical cost on diseases that are attributed to smoking.
