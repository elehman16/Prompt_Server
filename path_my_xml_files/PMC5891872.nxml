The Steinmann pin appears to be the most often used material, either on its own or in combination, while the Rush pin, Kirschner wire, Kuntscher pin, and interlocking pin have all been employed depending on their indication. Unthreaded intramedullary pins alone cannot provide adequate traction and rotational stability, as they are weak against rotational and shearing forces [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Stack pin application partially prevents these disadvantages by opposing the horizontal crossing and bending forces [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and it has been reported that combined plate-intramedullary pin application is successful in increasing axial and rotational &#x000ad;stability [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Intramedullary interlocking nailing is used to achieve rigid repair which can counteract all forces and are entirely load bearing until callus formation [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rotational stability can also be increased by cerclage wire, external fixation, interlocking pins, and trilam nails [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or using a C-clamp on the plate [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that stabilization of a Salter-Harris Type IV physeal fracture of the humeral condyle in a miniature pinscher was simplified by using Orthofix partially threaded Kirschner wire, with excellent clinical results. Partially threaded pins, having a negative profile ending create a weak point in the pin-thread junction, so if these pins are to be used, the junction must not be near the fracture line [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The pros and cons of various implants were taken into account and the innovation in terms of &#x0201c;end-threaded intramedullary positive profile screw ended self-tapping pin&#x0201d; (Admit pin) was conceived to minimize the complications of frequently used economic routine intramedullary pinning.</p><p>The aim of this study was to standardize the technique of application of end-threaded intramedullary pin for management of long bone fractures in canines and to evaluate the efficacy of end-threaded intramedullary pin in the management of long bone fractures in canines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approvals</title><p>The research design is purely an applied clinical study, therefore the ethical approval from Institutional animal ethics committee was not mandatory.

The distal end of the pin was designed with a positive profile self-tapping screw pointed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>) to allow for ease of entry into the cancellous bone whereas the proximal end is kept trocared so that there is no need of a pilot hole in proximal fragment of bone when used either in retrograde or normograde fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure-1</label><caption><p>End-threaded intramedullary pin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="VetWorld-11-181-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure-2</label><caption><p>End-threaded intramedullary positive profile screw ended self-tapping pins of different sizes used in the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="VetWorld-11-181-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical application phase</title><p>In the present study, 25 client-owned dogs of different breeds, sex, and age presented in the Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex of DGCN College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Palampur, with various long bone fractures were treated under two phases. The study was based on clinical cases, so there is no need of ethical approval as the cases were treated as per highest standard of the treatment at par with any national or international standards without harming or giving any unnecessary stress to the animals. All patients were subjected to clinical and radiological examinations preoperatively, those required mild sedation for pre-operative evaluation were administered acepromazine at 0.05 mg/kg B.Wt, I.M.; butorphanol tartrate at 0.2 mg/kg B.Wt, I.M. and atropine sulfate at 0.04 mg/kg B.Wt., S.C. The patient scheduled for surgery was given a standard protocol comprising injection butorphanol at 0.2 mg/kg B.Wt, I.V. and injection diazepam at 0.5 mg/kg B.Wt, I.V. followed by injection propofol (till effect, I.V.) and maintenance by isoflurane throughout the period of surgery. The diameter and length of the implant were determined by pre-operative radiographs, size and weight of the dog and intra-operative assessment. An open reduction with a lateral approach was the technique of choice for diaphyseal, epiphyseal, or metaphyseal femoral fracture repair; craniolateral approach was preferred for humeral fracture repair, and medial approach was preferred for tibial fracture repair.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Research design</title><p>In the first phase, 6 dogs were used for technique standardization.

Evaluation at 21<sup>st</sup> and 42<sup>nd</sup> day postoperatively revealed slight pin migration in Group-I, which resulted in disruption of callus site causing delayed union in one case and large callus formation in other two cases whereas no pin migration was observed in Group-II. Other observations in Group-I was reduced muscle girth and delayed healing time as compared to Group-II. Rotational forces were not resisted by the implant used in Group-I. On the other hand, the implant used in Group-II successfully resisted rotational forces as the threads were embedded in distal cancellous bone firmly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table-1</xref>). Partially threaded pins having a negative profile ending create a weak point in the pin-thread junction, so if these pins are to be used, the junction must not be near the fracture line. Positive profile pins do not have this problem because the threads are raised above the core diameter of the pin. Thus, there is no stress riser (weak point) at the thread non-thread interface and the implant appears very sturdy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table-1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table-1</label><caption><p>Comparison from available intramedullary implants.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Properties</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intramedullary implants</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Steinmann pin</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Available end-threaded pin</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pin designed for study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="VetWorld-11-181-g004.jpg"/></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="VetWorld-11-181-g005.jpg"/></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="VetWorld-11-181-g006.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Threads</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Absent</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative profile, Fine thread</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Selftapping, Positive profile, Coarse thread</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fitting into cancellous bone</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Loosely fitted as threads are absent</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grip - better than Steinmann pin but threads were not of sufficient size to engage the cancellous bone</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grip would be better than other implants as threads are of sufficient size to engage the cancellous bone tightly</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pin thread junction</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Absent, so no breakage of implant</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weak junction point, so pin breaks from the junction</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strong junction point, no breakage will be observed</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tip of pin</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trocar point</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trocar point</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Screw point</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In clinical application phase, 19 cases were studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table-2</xref>).

Five individual forces acting on long bones are usually recognized, i.e., compression, tension, shearing, bending, and torsion [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These supraphysiologic forces exceed the ultimate strength of the bone, resulting in bone failure, often in a predictable fashion. The fracture configuration and degree of soft tissue trauma are due to the direction and magnitude of the force that is applied to the bone. The goal of any fracture treatment is early ambulation and complete return to full function [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present study, late weight-bearing was observed in Group-I implanted with negative profile pin where an early weight-bearing, i.e., within 21-42 days was observed in cases implanted with positive profile pins. The dogs appeared to bear weight on their limbs 5-15 days after the operation and functional recovery was seen to increase gradually and full weight-bearing without any signs of clinical complication was seen to occur after day 20. Delayed union (&#x0003e;60 days) was observed in Group-I with large callus formation in two patients, and moderate callus formation in one patient whereas normal union with gap healing was observed in Group-II with moderate callus formation. Gap healing (primary bone healing) occurs under rigid fixation in areas in which small gaps are present. In such healing, direct ossification takes place after in-growth of blood vessels, and original structure of bone is later restored by secondary Haversian remodeling in the long axis of the bone [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A large amount of external callus indicates the need for additional support beyond normal contours of the bone. This presents a delay in osseous healing over what can be obtained by stable fixation [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The amount of callus is in reverse relation to degree of stability at fracture site except in young growing animal [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The instability at the fracture site results in the large callus to prevent this motion [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Pin migration was observed in all the animals of Group-I whereas pin migration was not observed at any stage in the animals of Group-II. Rotational forces were not resisted by the implant used in Group-I. On the other hand, the implant used in Group-II successfully resisted rotational forces as the threads were embedded in distal cancellous bone firmly.</p><p>The fully-threaded Steinmann pins provide adequate rotational stability and prevention of pin migration when applied in normograde fashion in fractures of the femur, humerus, and tibia of cat [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The compression of the fractured segment at the fracture line was evident as the positive profile pin was screwed in distal fragment ensuring near normal continuity of the bone length and contours. Partially threaded pins having a negative profile ending create a weak point in the pin-thread junction, so if these pins are to be used, the junction must not be near the fracture line [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Positive profile pins do not have this problem because of the threads is raised above the core diameter of the pin. Thus, there is no stress riser (weak point) at the thread non-thread interface [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and the implant appears very sturdy. In Group-I, to provide better stability to fractured fragments, the pin was snuggly fitted into medulla of the bone, covering maximum diameter thus obstructing medullary circulation to an extent which may be causing an increase in healing time. Fracture fixation alters the blood flow at the fracture site because the blood supply to the fracture hematoma, the bone cortex and the soft tissue is affected by the operative procedure used [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Whereas in Group-II, only threaded positive profile end of pin gets snuggly fitted into the spongy bone leaving the rest of medullary cavity (30-40%) unoccupied, thus allowing the medullary circulation to regenerate which may aiding in early healing [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hence, the end-threaded intramedullary positive profile screw ended self-tapping pin (Admit pin) used for fixation of long bone fractures in canines can resist pin migration, pin breakage and all loads acting on the bone. In addition, it can be easily used in field conditions in managing long bone fractures in canines, as compared to other orthopedic implants.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>AK conceived the innovation of design of the orthopedic implant and technical execution of the clinical research procedure.
