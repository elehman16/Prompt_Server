Based on the recommendation of the World Health Organization, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was adopted by the national malaria control programme (NMCP) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria since 2005. The two combinations adopted in the country as first-line regimen are artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate&#x02013;amodiaquine (ASAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Globally, several efficacy and effectiveness studies have demonstrated their high efficacy and safety for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>However, in most of these studies, drug intake was supervised by a study team and treatment was strictly administered in accordance with manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Yet, in poor resource settings with high malaria morbidity, strict adherence to these conditions is often not observed in real life settings. A recent study conducted in this study area has already shown a lowering of the cure rate of ACT in real life comparative to the other efficacy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, most of those studies were limited to children under five and the older populations are typically not involved. Despite the upheld notion that adults are immune-protected, behaviour towards the treatment, such as not completing treatment regiments, could be higher in adults and this could negatively influence treatment outcomes. Therefore, an assessment of treatment outcomes that would fully reflects the reality in the field has to involve all age groups in the population. Moreover, the best indicator for safety could be obtained from adults since children are challenged to make recalls on safety information. It is based on these compelling reasons that this study was carried out in order to assess the effectiveness and safety of the two recommended forms of ACT in Burkina Faso as they are used routinely in treating uncomplicated malaria in all age groups in the country.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was carried out from September 2010 to October 2012 at two primary health centers (Nanoro and Nazoanga) of Nanoro health district (NHD) in Burkina Faso. Nanoro is situated at about 85&#x000a0;km from Ouagadougou, the capital city of the country. It is classified as hyperendemic and malaria transmission is seasonal with a peak at rainy season that lasts usually from June&#x02013;July to October&#x02013;November [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The entomological inoculation rate is estimated at 50&#x02013;60 infective bites/person/year and the commonest vectors are <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> and <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> (A. Diabate, personal communication)<italic>. Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the most prevalent malaria parasite. The predominant ethnic group is Mossi, minorities are Gourounsi and Fulani. The majority of the population practice subsistence farming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants and inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients presenting at the two health facilities with symptoms or signs suggestive of malaria were reviewed by study nurses without any age distinction. The inclusion criteria were: (a) fever or history of fever within the previous 24&#x000a0;h, (b) mono infection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, (c) parasites density comprised between 2000 and 200,000 asexual forms per microlitre of blood, (d) haemoglobin &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;g/dL. Patients were excluded from the study if they presented (a) danger signs (unable to drink or breast-feed; vomiting more than twice in 24&#x000a0;h; recent history of convulsions; unconsciousness or unable to sit or stand), (b) severe malaria, (c) severe malnutrition (defined as weight for height &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;% of the median NCHS/WHO reference), (d) a documented history of adequate malaria treatment in the preceding 2&#x000a0;weeks, (e) any evidence of chronic disease or of a concurrent non-malarial febrile illness, (f) history of serious side effects with the study drugs, (g) a reported pregnancy for child bearing age women and patient or his parent/guardians unwillingness to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either AL (Coartem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis) or ASAQ (Winthrop, sanofi aventis). A computer-generated randomization list provided by the site quality assurance manager was used for treatment allocation. Treatment was administered according to the national algorithm for malaria cases management and was strictly adhered to. In ASAQ group, treatment was administered once daily, at the standard dose as follows: 4.5 to &#x0003c;9&#x000a0;kg, 1 tablet 25/67.5&#x000a0;mg; 9 to &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;kg, 1 tablet 50/135&#x000a0;mg; 18 to &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;kg, 1 tablet 100/270&#x000a0;mg; &#x02265;36&#x000a0;kg, 2 tablets 100/270&#x000a0;mg. In AL group, treatment was given twice daily according to the body weight as follows: 5&#x02013;14&#x000a0;kg, one tablet per dose; 15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;kg, two tablets per dose; 25&#x02013;34&#x000a0;kg, three tablets per dose and adult, four tablets per dose. Patients (adults) or their parents/guardians (children) were advised of the time and mode of administration for the 3&#x000a0;days treatment taken at home unobserved. Patients and or their parents/guardians were advised to administer AL with fat containing food and were asked to come back (with their child) for scheduled visits on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, or if the participant was sick between visits (unscheduled visit). At each visit a physical examination was performed. Blood sample was taken from the finger to prepare thick/thin film, photometric measurement of haemoglobin (HemoCue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 301<sup>+</sup>) and spotted onto filter paper (Whatman 3MM, Maidstone, UK) for later molecular analysis. For identification and reporting of AEs, patients were assessed at each visit according to a standardized checklist and the information was recorded on the case record form (CRF). A severity grading scale, based on the toxicity grading scales developed by the WHO was used to grade severity of all reported adverse events (AEs) and clinical examination findings. All AEs were catalogued based on their frequency, severity, and relationship with AL and ASAQ treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Microscopic examination</title><p>Blood smears were read in the field at each health facility by light microscopy after they have been stained with 3&#x000a0;% Giemsa for 30&#x000a0;min. Parasite density was determined by counting the number of asexual parasites per 200 white blood cells, and calculated per micro liter of blood by assuming the white blood cells at 8000/&#x000b5;L. A smear was declared negative when the examination of 100 thick-film fields did not reveal the presence of asexual parasites. Blood smears were examined by two readers and, in the case of discordant results, by a third reader. Discordant results were defined as a difference between the two readers in (a) <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, (b) positive and negative, (c) with parasite &#x0003e;400/&#x000b5;L; if the higher count divided by the lower count was &#x0003e;2, (d) with parasite &#x02264;400/&#x000b5;L; if the higher reading is &#x0003e;Log10 higher than the lower reading.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Parasite genotyping</title><p>Molecular analysis was performed at the Molecular Biology laboratory of Centre Muraz of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Dried blood spots from day 0 (pre-treatment) and from day of recurrent parasitaemia (post-treatment) during the 28&#x000a0;days follow-up were used for parasite genotyping. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> DNA was extracted from dried blood spots using QIamp DNA miniKit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s procedures and 80&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of DNA template was obtained. DNA was either used immediately for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for later analysis. A Nested PCR was used to analyse polymorphism in the merozoite surface protein <italic>msp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>msp</italic>-<italic>2</italic> genes to distinguish between recrudescence and new infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size and data analysis</title><p>Sample size was calculated by assuming the efficacy of each study treatment to be at least 90&#x000a0;%. Under this assumption a sample of 155 patients per arm will be able to show at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level with 90&#x000a0;% power, that the difference in efficacy between treatments is not more than 10&#x000a0;%. Allowing for a loss to follow-up around 10&#x000a0;%, the final sample size per arm was 170 patients/year and then, 340 patients per arm for the 2&#x000a0;years. Data were double entered by two independent data clerks and a verification program was used to correct errors by referring to the original CRF. The primary treatment outcomes were adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), early treatment failure (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF) and late parasitological failure (LPF). Total treatment failure (TTF) was determined as the sum of ETF, LCF and LPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients classified as treatment failures were given quinine (10&#x000a0;mg/kg orally three times a day for 7&#x000a0;days) and in case of severe malaria or danger signs parenteral quinine was administered. Treatment secondary outcome measures were the tolerability of the treatment that was assessed by the risk of occurrence of adverse events (AEs).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using STATA (IC), version 10.0 software. Differences between groups were assessed using the Chi square test for proportions and analysis of variances (ANOVA) for continuous normal distributed variables or the non-parametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis to compare continuous not normally distributed variables. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier product limit formula was used to estimate the risks of treatment failure and of new infections. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethics</title><p>This was part of a larger study entitled &#x02018;Pharmacovigilance for artemisinin-based combination treatments in Africa&#x02019; (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01232530). The study was conducted in accordance with the principle of good clinical practices (GCP). Before enrolment, each participant or parents/guardians signed informed consent form. In case of illiteracy, thumb-printed consent was obtained in the presence of unbiased witness.

Moreover, the assessment of the efficacy of the unsupervised therapy is of greatest interest in a context of home management of malaria by community medicines distributors. This study shows that the unsupervised cure rate after adjustment by day 28 is 77.8 and 84.1&#x000a0;%, respectively for AL and ASAQ, indicating a lowering of the cure rate when drug intake is not directly supervised. Similar findings have been observed in a study carried out on Gabonese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent study conducted in the same area has also shown a cure rate of 89.7&#x000a0;% for AL and 89.8&#x000a0;% for ASAQ after 42&#x000a0;days follow-up for the unsupervised malaria treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However when drug administration is directly supervised a cure rate of about 90&#x000a0;% has always been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. But as in this study drug intakes were not supervised and the assessment adherence was based on patient self-reporting on day 3, this lowering of the cure rate should be taken with caution. This constituted one of the limitations of our study because some studies have shown a difference in adherence rate obtained by the use of different methods and the assessment based on patients self-reporting seems not to be the most appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, compliance to the treatment and above all, the preferable administration of AL with fatty food that could not be respected in real field conditions could explain the lowering of the cure rate. Thus the unsupervised therapy with AL results in lower plasma levels of lumefantrine with an increased risk for early infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, vomiting was one of the commonest AEs observed in both AL and ASAQ treated patients. In the unsupervised condition it was difficult to obtain reliable information about time elapsed between drug intake and vomiting and this could affect the efficacy of the two drugs when it occurred a while after drugs intake. Moreover a recent ex vivo study conducted at the same area has shown a decrease in sensitivity of lumefantrine in the country and this could further explain this lowering of the cure rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition findings in a study carried out in Kenya indicated a decline in sensitivity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to ACT, in particular AL and dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is also known that some cases of artemisinin-resistance have been recorded in Asia, and a particular care for the wide spread use at community level should be taken for the preservation of the activity of these drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Of particular interest in this study was the involvement of patients of all age groups and this shows that the parasitological cure rate in patients over 5&#x000a0;years is higher than for children under 5&#x000a0;years of age. This is not surprising and could be explained by the additive effect of the partially acquired immunity in aged patients living in endemic area due to frequent expositions to mosquito bites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>This study also shows that by day 28, over 50&#x000a0;% of treated patients had recurrent parasitaemia, most of them were re-infected with new <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. The risk of being re-infected is higher in AL treated patients than those receiving ASAQ and this starts after day 14 in both two study arms. The phenomenon of recurrent parasitaemia would increase the cost of malaria treatment and control and hence the use of a long half-life medicine would be necessary in such context.</p><p>Both AL and ASAQ were well-tolerated, similar to many other studies with AEs mostly mild and not linked to the administrated treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A limitation to this study was the challenge of getting reliable safety recall information from young children who constituted an important part of the study population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a context where home management of malaria has been adopted as one of the main strategies for malaria control, the assessment of the effectiveness of unsupervised therapy is of fundamental importance. This study shows a lowering of the efficacy when drug intake is not directly supervised. The results reported here is worrying as both rates are lower than the critical threshold of 90&#x000a0;% required by the WHO to recommend the use of an anti-malarial drug in a treatment policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
