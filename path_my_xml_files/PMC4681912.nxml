functional activity and is known as a common cause of pain in the shoulder joint<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The frequency of occurrence of shoulder
subluxation varies from 16&#x02013;66%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
approximately 90% of patients who experience damage to the upper side of the nerve have
flaccid paralysis. This can lead to shoulder subluxation by pulling the surrounding
structures, such as the shoulder joint capsule and upper arm nerves due to the loss of
resistance to gravity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. While flaccid
paralysis can occur due to acute stroke, muscle tension and loose reflection can affect the
shoulder joint in acute stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Flaccid paralysis can gradually change into rigidity within days or a couple of weeks of
the onset of stroke, and the longer the period of flaccid paralysis, the lower the recovery
of functional activity. Rehabilitation treatments need to focus on protecting the damaged
side in the relaxation period, and when rigor begins, they should focus on suppressing the
rigidity. In addition, damaged arms should not be pulled because there is a loss of muscle
tensile force. Acute stroke patients in an intensive care unit may have sores caused by
sustained pressure and secondary complications, including joint construction and
modification by keeping only one position, which can lead to chronic deformities.
Rehabilitation treatments may take several months to complete, and successful rehabilitation
treatment also depends on a variety of stroke treatment processes; however, a number of
factors in addition to the healing process affect patients. Even sleeping posture can have a
significant impact on the outcome. Regardless of the treatment, if a patient performs an
abnormal type of movement, his or her spasticity will increase, and he or she will be
permanently affected. Therefore, rehabilitation treatment requires 24-hour management and
should be considered as a way of life<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If acute stroke patients are in a bed most of the time, the maintenance of proper posture
is very important, as well as participation in physical therapy, for the mimization of
problems in recovery. In addition, special efforts need to be made toward prevention of the
pain from paralyzed shoulder subluxation, as upper extremity dysfunction can cause much
trouble. Shoulder pain is a common complication among 84% of stroke patients, and this pain
is accompanied by hypobulia, changes in mood, decreases in exercise recovery, and a loss of
response to rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
many methods are in use to increase the effectiveness of treatments in reducing pain and
subluxation. One of these methods is the taping method, which has attracted much recent
interest. The taping method can restore the original function of the muscles by adjusting
the left and right muscles, as well as by intensifying muscle protection. Also taping along
the muscle can normalize the function of the muscles by adjusting the muscle fascia and
subluxation of the joint and prevents imbalances at the same time<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact on
patients&#x02019; shoulder joints of performing inelastic taping and bed physical therapy for acute
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The interventions were carried out on patients who agreed to participate in the experiment.
This study was approved by the institutional review board of Daegu University. The
experiment was conducted for eight weeks with an experimental group of 18 stroke patients
who received bed physical therapy and inelastic taping and a control group of 18 stroke
patients who received bed physical therapy.</p><p>Taping for the prevention of shoulder subluxation following neurophysiological treatment
concepts was applied to the experimental group after bed physical therapy in the intensive
care unit. Inelastic tape was used, and the Jig test and pain test were conducted once a
week after tape replacement every three days. The measurements were taken three times:
before and 4 and 8 weeks after the start of taping. The researchers who treated the patients
aimed to ensure stability of the shoulder joint by protecting the shoulder joint through
attaching the inelastic tape to the forward and back side of the supraspinatus, pectoralis,
and sternal pectoralis major intermediate sections after correcting shoulder
subluxation.</p><p>To maintain continuing education, patients and their families were provided with education
before the experiment, and the nurse was also asked to help with the tape. The treatment of
the experimental and control groups was designed to take place at different locations to
prevent external variable errors between subjects. The shoulder subluxation test method was
the Jig measuring method developed by Hayes and Sullivan, and an L-shaped ruler was used to
about a 21-cm extent. Finger measurements, radiation measurements, and the Jig test are used
as common measurement tools of shoulder subluxation; however, the Jig test was used to
obtain relatively objective and quantified results in this study.</p><p>For the Jig test, patients sat on a chair with their damaged arm stretched flaggingly, and
a 20&#x02005;cm line parallel to the line connecting the upper arm and acromion on the short side
was drawn. Next, a 20-cm line was drawn in the same way from the acromion after manual
therapy for the subluxation of the patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The degree of subluxation was measured before and after treatment and the difference was
obtained. The visual analog scale assessment of pain is superior to other subjective tests
because its sensitivity in accordance with the pain change is high. In addition, it is one
of the most commonly used methods, which is useful when collecting data. The visual analogue
scale was used as a measurement method of pain because its reliability is relatively high in
detecting short-term change<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The visual
analog scale is a way of assessing pain experienced by patients and it uses a linear scale.
Sriwatanakul stated that this is the most appropriate tool, among different types of
assessment tools, for evaluating the intensity of pain, especially in terms of validity and
reliability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the data obtained in the experiments are presented as the mean&#x000b1;standard
deviation (Mean&#x000b1;SD), and SPSS for Windows (version 20.0) was used to statistically analyze
the frequency and percentage, and to compare the general characteristics and medical
characteristics of the subjects. Repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation
coefficient analysis were used to analyze the effects of the interventions on the control
and experimental groups, using a statistical significance level of = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics and clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental<break/>(N=18)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control<break/>(N=18)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (55.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (61.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (44.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (38.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.1&#x000b1;10.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.3&#x000b1;10.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.</p><p>After 8 weeks of intervention, the degree of subluxation of the experimental group, which

causing the pain. There are many studies of patients with muscular skeletal disease, but
there is a lack of research about the effect of taping on the joints of stroke patients.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of decrease in shoulder subluxation on pain
of stroke patients and the correlation between changes in subluxation and pain.</p><p>Two measurement methods were used in this study. Pain was assessed using the visual analog
scale, and the Jig test, developed by Hayes and Sullivan, was used to measure the degree of
subluxation. Symptoms of shoulder pain and subluxation after stroke are common in the
rehabilitation period, and pain and subluxation occur largely within a period of six months
after the onset of stroke and can increase patient risk<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pain and subluxation result in restriction of participation in activities of daily living
and functional activities of the body. However, if patients receive good treatment and
management, they will be able to manage their activities better through reduction in the
degree of pain and subluxation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
study, the changes in pain and shoulder joint subluxation were investigated of acute stroke
patients who received inelastic taping, Our results show that shoulder subluxation in the
experimental group decreased from 31.2&#x000b1;3.2 before the intervention to 25.0&#x000b1;4.3 after four
weeks of the intervention, and to 21.0&#x000b1;4.8 after eight weeks of the intervention. The
control group showed a change from 31.06&#x000b1;3.589 before the intervention to 28.06&#x000b1;4.832 after
four weeks of the intervention, and to 25.7&#x000b1;5.0 after eight weeks of the intervention. This
means subluxation in the experimental group decreased more than in the control group.</p><p>In addition, shoulder pain in the experimental group decreased from 5.5&#x000b1;1.1 before the
intervention to 3.9&#x000b1;0.9 after four weeks of the intervention and to 3.2&#x000b1;0.8 after eight
weeks of the intervention. The control group showed a change from 5.1&#x000b1;0.7 before the
intervention to 4.7&#x000b1;1.4 after four weeks of the intervention and to 4.8&#x000b1;1.4 after eight
weeks of the intervention. This means pain in experimental group was more reduced than in
the control group. Reductions in subluxation and pain were significantly correlated at 4 and
8 weeks after the start of the intervention.</p><p>In anterior shoulder impingement syndrome it has been reported that scapular taping
increased the scapular stability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
another study, taping the joints injured by sprain of the acromio-clavicular joint protected
the muscles around the joints, decreasing muscle spasms, and facilitating the recovery of
muscular strength<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, proper
posture, proper support, and appropriate treatment were performed to prevent the shoulder
pain of hemiplegic patients. Overall, maintaining posture and functional electrical
stimulation using armchairs and taping are effective ways of preventing shoulder subluxation
in patients with acute stroke<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study show that inelastic shoulder taping is effective at reducing
shoulder subluxation and pain of acute stroke patients, and it is our opinion that it may
help the rehabilitation of acute stroke patients. Future studies should investigate whether
taping has a lasting effect over the long-term through follow-up, and involve greater
numbers of patients. As early physical therapy is important, continuous research involving
acute stroke patients conducted from the initial hospitalization is desirable. In
conclusion, the application of inelastic taping for acute stroke patients was confirmed to
be effective at reducing shoulder subluxationm, and pain and it was confirmed to be a good
physical therapy intervention based on its efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Linn</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Granat</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lees</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Prevention of shoulder subluxation after stroke with
