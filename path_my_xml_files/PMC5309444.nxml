Varieties of videolaryngoscopes are available in the market such as GlideScope<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Verathon Systems), C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), the Airway scope&#x000ae; (Pentax corporation, Japan), Mc Grath MAC (Covidien, Medtronics), and King Vision Videolaryngoscope (KVVL) (King Systems, Noblesville, IN, USA). With their unique blade design and a video camera or video chip positioned close to the tip of the laryngoscope blade, can provide better visualization of glottis with minimal or no the movement of cervical spine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There are mainly three types of VL; (a) with a standard Mc Intosh type of blade, (b) one with more curved/angulated blade, and (c) one with channel for endotracheal tube passage. Each design has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>The C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) is a portable videolaryngoscope, which has similar curvature as standard Mac Intosh (C blade) and a more angulated D blade. The King Vision Videolaryngoscope (KVVL) (King Systems, Noblesville, IN, USA) is one of the new indirect laryngoscope with channeled and nonchanneled blades. KVVL has a unique design, and high quality image can prove useful in cervical spine injury patients without movement of the neck. This study compared the C-MAC (both conventional and D blade) and KVVL in patients with proven/suspected cervical spine injury on cervical immobilization in terms of first attempt intubation success, laryngoscopic view, and time for intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval for the study was obtained form the Institute ethics committee (project no: JIP/IEC/2014/8/365 (CTRI/2015/06/005936); and all patients signed an informed written consent. The study included adults, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, with 1&#x02013;2 grade American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status and proven or suspected cervical spine injury. All were placed in cervical spine immobilization/rigid cervical collars, and scheduled for elective surgery to be performed under general anesthesia. A total of 135 patients were randomized into 3 groups (45 each): Group K (nonchanneled blade of King Vision), group C (conventional blade of C-MAC), and group D (D blade of C-MAC) was used for endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Pre-oxygenation with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3 min was done with rigid cervical collar in place. All the patients were induced with 2 &#x000b5;g/kg of Fentanyl, 2 mg/kg of Propofol, and muscle relaxation was achieved with 0.1 mg/kg of Vecuronium. Patients were ventilated with Isoflurane (2%) in oxygen using circle absorber system. Just before laryngoscopy, anterior part of the hard cervical collar was removed, and the spine immobilization was maintained using MILS by an assistant anesthesiologist. All the intubations were performed (as per the manufacturer recommendations) by an experienced anesthesiologist, who had done at least 30 intubations, with each device. All standard PVC-made endotracheal tube (ET tube) 8.0 was used for males and size 7.0 for females.

In these scenarios, where alignment of oropharyngeal and laryngeal axes is not possible, indirect laryngoscopes such as videolaryngoscopes play a vital role in providing optimal glottis view, without movement of cervical spine. Though C-MAC conventional blade and D blades have been used in simulated difficult airway scenarios with cervical immobilization,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] literature is sparse regarding use of KVVL in these circumstances. The primary aim of our study was to explore the utility of nonchanneled blade of KVVL, C-MAC conventional, and D blades for endotracheal intubation in patients with proven/suspected cervical spine injury.</p><p>The available literature for use of videolaryngoscope is in simulated difficult airway scenarios such as, hard collar or MILS maneuver in patients with normal airways or as a teaching/testing material on manikins.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our study involved all the patients with proven/suspected cervical spine injury with cervical spine immobilization. The presence of hard collar makes laryngoscopy difficult by restricted mouth opening.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, we used hard collar for bag and mask ventilation and the accepted MILS manoeuvre, with anterior part of hard cervical collar removed for indirect laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Optimal visualization of the glottis is important for the success of intubation with nil/restricted spine mobility. In our study, CL grade 1 visualization was obtained in 36 (80%), 32 (72%), 34 (76%) patients with conventional C-MAC, KVVL, and D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscope, respectively. A good grade of glottis visualization (CL grade 1 and 2) was obtained in all patients. In a manikin-based study with cervical immobilization by K&#x00131;l&#x00131;&#x000e7;aslan <italic>et al</italic>., good grade view (CL grade 1 and 2) was obtained by all the laryngoscopists.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similar views were obtained in another manikin-based study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>. using C-MAC and D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscopes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a study of Alvis <italic>et al</italic>. comparing KVVL with Mc Grath VL, CL grade1 was obtained in 93% of patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Our study results are consistent with these studies.</p><p>The CL grading system has numerous problems. The grades are ambigious between grade 1 and grade 2.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Hence, we used POGO score as an additional measure of glottis visualization.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, conventional C-MAC and KVVL provided better glottis visualization (82% vs. 84%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) as compared to D blade C-MAC VL (74%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].

This proximal placing of blade results in poor (more CL grades and poor POGO score) glottic visualization.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Success of intubation</title><p>Better visualization of the glottis does not necessarily imply improved first attempt success of endotracheal intubation using VL owing to unique curvature of the blades. We used styleted ET tube, preshaped to the blade of particular VL for better visualization of the tip of the ET tube. First attempt success was noted in 100% (45/45), 93.3% (42/45), 95.6% (43/45) of the patients using conventional blade C-MAC, KVVL, and D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscopes, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].

Because the tube was visualized passing through the glottis, we measured both the times; (a) time from scope insertion to tube passing the glottis and (b) time from scope insertion to appearance of first ETCO<sub>2</sub> tracing on the monitor. The mean intubation times were comparable in conventional C-MAC and KVVL (23 vs. 24 s) and KVVL and D blade C-MAC (24 vs. 26 s) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Intubation time was significantly faster with conventional C-MAC as compared to D blade C-MAC. This prolonged time is due to increased time taken for the insertion of D blade through the mouth owing to its increased curvature of the blade as compared to conventional blade C-MAC.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>., the time for intubation were 20 and 27 s using conventional blade and D blades of C-MAC in simulated difficult airways in manikin. Our results are comparable to the study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Alvis <italic>et al</italic>. studied Mc Grath and KVVL in adult patients noted higher intubation times with KVVL as compared to Mc Grath (38 vs. 17 s) in patients with predicted easy intubation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Our study results are superior due to all the laryngoscopies were performed by anesthesiologists having experience in handling videolaryngoscpes.</p><p>One of the prerequisites for the successful laryngoscopy and subsequent intubation in patients with cervical immobilization is ease of insertion of laryngoscope blade. We graded the ease of insertion of laryngoscope blade as 1 to 5 (1, very easy to 5, very difficult). The ease of insertion of conventional C-MAC was significantly better as compared to KVVL and D blade C-MAC VL [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The angulation of the blades of KVVL and D blade C-MAC is higher as compared to conventional blade. The KVVL blade was easier to insert as compared to D blade C-MAC VL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The factors which determine difficulty of intubation are number of attempts, number of operators, alternative technique used, glottis exposure, application of lifting force external pressure, and the vocal cord position. The intubation difficulty score[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] consist of these 7 parameters.
