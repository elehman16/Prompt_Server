The search for the most advanced means of surgical disinfection is ongoing. The methods reported in recent years include scrubbing with sterile water using a sterile culture brush to disinfect the skin and waterless rubbing using regular soap and fast-drying disinfectant; these methods are recommended by the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) <xref rid="pone.0065377-Boyce1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. During surgical maneuvers, such as skin incision and the approach to target organs, the indigenous bacteria, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, filamentous fungi, spore-forming bacteria, and viruses are all potentially pathogenic and can cause infections. During endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), an endoscope is inserted into the stomach through the mouth, which results in the inevitable exposure of the dissection site to oral bacteria, which may led to infection. However, no reports exist concerning gastric irrigation before ESD, as intraluminal treatment in the stomach is a semi-closed system where gastric acid is present. Therefore, the validity of irrigation with a saline solution in ESD has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>A frequent complication during and after ESD is perforation <xref rid="pone.0065377-Toyonaga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which can often be treated with conservative therapy by closing the perforation with a clip <xref rid="pone.0065377-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. If it is proven that gastric irrigation can reduce bacterial counts, it can then be expected that intra-abdominal infection might be more easily suppressed by gastric irrigation before procedure without using antibiotics, even when complications such as perforation occur. The present study was a prospective randomized controlled trial of the effects of gastric irrigation with 2 L of saline solution before ESD on gastric bacterial counts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065377.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065377.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>This prospective randomized study included 50 patients who were diagnosed with early gastric cancer at Kagawa University Hospital from June to November 2012.</p><p>We conducted a pilot study with 8 patients who underwent ESD for early gastric cancer after receiving approval from the institutional ethics committee. Among the 8 patients, 4 patients were irrigated with 2 L of saline solution before ESD techniques and 4 were not. We calculated the sample size from the pilot study.</p><p>An opaque envelope method was used to randomly divide the subjects into a clean group; in which irrigation was performed before ESD, and a regular group; in which irrigation was not performed. Each group contained 25 patients. All of the patients began a 30 mg daily dose of a proton-pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) on the day prior to ESD. The allocation flow chart for this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065377-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The randomization was achieved using sealed and numbered envelopes, as prepared previously by Dr. M. O. The randomization code was not broken until the study was completed. All of the investigators attended a study meeting before the study and received instructions about the methods for gastric irrigation, measuring the distilled water dispersion and the collection of gastric juice with a sterile culture tube. ESD was performed by 1 of 5 endoscopists. None of the endoscopists were informed about this study, but each endoscopist was informed on how to perform the irrigation and was blinded to the randomization process to avoid any bias. All bacterial cultures were performed by a bacteriologist (Dr. N. N.) who was blinded to the randomization process and did not know which patients received irrigation. At the end of the study, the data were analyzed by Dr. H. M. and Dr. K. R. in a blinded manner to avoid bias and prepared the manuscript.</p><fig id="pone-0065377-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0065377.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Allocation flow chart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065377.g001"/></fig><p>At the beginning of the ESD procedure, 20 mL of distilled water was dispersed onto the gastric wall, and 20 mL of gastric juice was collected in a sterile culture tube for evaluation as the pre-procedure bacterial culture (37&#x000b0;C, 48 hours). After that, in clean group, irrigation was performed throughout the stomach with 2 L of saline solution using a water jet attached to an endoscope (GIF Type Q260J, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). After completion of the ESD and removal of the resected tumor, 20 mL of distilled water was again dispersed onto the gastric wall, and 20 mL of gastric juice was collected in a sterile culture tube as the post-ESD culture. The sterile culture tube was passed through the working channel. We counted the number of times the endoscope was withdrawn and recorded the normal saline volume that was used to wash the stomach during ESD (except for irrigation). White blood cell (WBC) counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured on the day before ESD and on the days 1 and 2 post-ESD. The body temperature (BT) was checked on the day before ESD and on the days 1 and 2 post-ESD. The physical examination included an assessment of spontaneous abdominal pain using a 4-level visual analog scale (VAS): VAS-0 represented no spontaneous pain, 1 represented mild spontaneous pain, 2 represented moderate spontaneous pain, and 3 represented severe spontaneous pain. In addition, a chest X-ray was taken the day after ESD to check for aspiration pneumonia. The procedures described above were the same in both groups. The endoscopes were treated with high-level 2.4% glutaraldehyde disinfectant (Cidex, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Irvine, CA) and dried after every procedure.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>This prospective clinical study was conducted with pre-approval by the institutional ethics committee of Kagawa university hospital, Kagawa, Japan and was enrolled with the university hospital medical information network (UMIN) #000008691.

In the regular group, clinical evaluations on POD 1 revealed mild to moderate abdominal pain, and our analyses indicated that the increases in the WBC counts as well as BT were suppressed on POD 2. It is accepted that indigenous oral bacteria enter the stomach as a result of endoscope insertion, which may result in an increase in gastric bacteria and may cause a considerable risk of infection in the post-ESD artificial ulcer base.</p><p>When inserting a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, unchecked indigenous oral flora in the stomach may lead to fistula formation, infection and peritonitis, particularly after using the pull method. However, there are only a few reports of fistula, infection, or peritonitis complications using the push method <xref rid="pone.0065377-Akkersdijk1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>While indigenous oral bacteria may become pathogenic infectious agents during ESD, it appears that gastric bacteria alone are not intra-abdominal infection causing pathogens after ESD, even in cases where gastric irrigation is not performed. The activity of indigenous oral bacteria may also increase as a result of an increased gastric pH after PPI administration. Patients who undergo ESD commonly take PPIs. PPI administration has been recommended to reduce post-ESD hemorrhage <xref rid="pone.0065377-Sugimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Normal gastric juice is generally known to have a pH of 3 or less, and almost no bacteria are able to propagate in the normal stomach. However, in elderly patients, it has been reported that the administration of H<sub>2</sub>-blockers and PPIs results in a sufficient increase in the pH of gastric juice as gastric acid secretion declines due to advancing age, which allows indigenous oral bacteria to infect the stomach and propagate there. This is sometimes observed in patients with feeding tubes. The decreased gastric pH reduces gastric bacterial counts <xref rid="pone.0065377-Heyland1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and irrigation with saline solution during endoscopic dissection procedures may potentially reduce or negate contamination of the stomach with indigenous oral bacteria. This may mitigate the effects of bacterial propagation resulting from PPI administration to prevent post-ESD hemorrhage.</p><p>In animal models of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), it has been reported that indigenous oral bacteria may become pathogenic during NOTES and potentially cause intra-abdominal infection. One animal experiment indicated that inadequate disinfection was responsible for 9.6% of infectious complications <xref rid="pone.0065377-Kantsevoy1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A variety of methods for preventing infection following transgastric and transrectal NOTES have been tested in animal models involving preoperative disinfection from the oral cavity to the stomach, along with various methods for closing the affected areas. However, there are relatively few reports related solely to infection, and upto date, there have been no reports evaluating gastric irrigation before ESD in humans. When a perforation occurs during ESD, <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria shallow, Streptococcus haemolyticus</italic> and oral streptococci, can escape and cause pan-peritonitis.</p><p>In a recent animal study, gastric irrigation with a 10% povidone-iodine solution was performed following tubal ligation and cholecystectomy. Examinations performed 20 days following these procedures revealed no clear findings of intra-abdominal infection or abscess formation <xref rid="pone.0065377-Katsarelias1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Irrigation with 500 mL of saline solution and 200 mL of 5% povidone-iodine (Betadine) solution diluted with purified water has been reported to reduce bacterial counts in gastric juice cultures from 15 to 17&#x000d7;10<sup>3 </sup>CFU/mL to 0 to 3 CFU/mL, thereby suppressing post-NOTES adhesion and abscess formation <xref rid="pone.0065377-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In experiments using pigs, irrigation with 500 mL of saline solution has also been reported to significantly reduce bacterial counts in gastric juice culture during mesh placement for ventral hernia repair using a transgastric NOTES technique <xref rid="pone.0065377-Miedema1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065377-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although the validity of gastric irrigation with a povidone-iodine solution through a transgastric route in humans has been reported <xref rid="pone.0065377-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065377-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, however, there has been no research on the systemic signs of infection or any other type of infection.</p><p>The effects of gastric disinfection in humans with 5% or higher concentrations of iodine solution on perioperative gastric mucosa injury and the gastric mucosa post-operation are currently unknown. The risks and benefits of antisepsis must always be considered, and gastric irrigation with 2 L of saline solution can be regarded as a safe and valid option for gastric disinfection after the introduction of oral bacteria via endoscope insertion during ESD procedures.</p><p>Our study results indicate that pre-ESD gastric irrigation reduces bacterial counts and removes necrotic agents and foreign bodies effectively. Pre-ESD gastric irrigation may also allow an intra-abdominal infection to be more easily suppressed without antibiotics, even if complications such as perforation occur.</p><p>In conclusion, the prevention of infection during the ESD procedure or perforation complications is an important issue for its clinical application. This study finding using 50 patients gave an indication that it is feasible and effective to use pre-ESD gastric irrigation to suppress infection in humans and led to favorable clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0065377.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
