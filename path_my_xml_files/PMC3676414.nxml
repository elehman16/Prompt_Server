This study aimed to test the efficacy of 12 weeks of a partner-delivered home-based cupping massage, compared to the same period of progressive muscle relaxation in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. Patients were randomly assigned to self-directed cupping massage or progressive muscle relaxation. They were trained and asked to undertake the assigned treatment twice weekly for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measure was the current neck pain intensity (0&#x02013;100 mm visual analog scale; VAS) after 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included pain on motion, affective pain perception, functional disability, psychological distress, wellbeing, health-related quality of life, pressure pain thresholds and adverse events. Sixty one patients (54.1&#x000b1;12.7 years; 73.8%female) were randomized to cupping massage (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30) or progressive muscle relaxation (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31). After treatment, both groups showed significantly less pain compared to baseline however without significant group differences. Significant effects in favor of cupping massage were only found for wellbeing and pressure pain thresholds. In conclusion, cupping massage is no more effective than progressive muscle relaxation in reducing chronic non-specific neck pain. Both therapies can be easily used at home and can reduce pain to a minimal clinically relevant extent. Cupping massage may however be better than PMR in improving well-being and decreasing pressure pain sensitivity but more studies with larger samples and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01500330">NCT01500330</ext-link>

Neck pain is associated with both substantial work absenteeism <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cote1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and significant disability in daily life <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cote2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Most treatment options for chronic neck pain have proven only moderately effective to date <xref rid="pone.0065378-Hurwitz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065378-Peloso1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This is especially true for complementary therapies, which are being under-represented in many therapeutic guidelines. The sole exceptions to the latter are acupuncture and chiropractic, which are recommended in German guidelines for chronic neck pain alongside physiotherapy with acknowledged limitations <xref rid="pone.0065378-Deutsche1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Treatment guidelines also emphasize that patients should be encouraged to use therapies they can easily apply themselves; as long as they perceive them as effective. This might include the application of therapeutic heat (e.g. heat pads <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cramer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, balneotherapy) or the use of progressive muscle relaxation after Jacobson (PMR) <xref rid="pone.0065378-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, a technique used to teach patients to relax muscles through a two-step process. In PMR, patients start to deliberately contract muscles and hold the tension; secondly they release all tension and focus on the sensation of relaxation. Regular practice will then help patients to recognize tension and to voluntarily relax affected muscles. Other not specified therapies with reasonable cost-benefit ratio are also recommended <xref rid="pone.0065378-Deutsche1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Cupping therapy is an ancient medical treatment, which uses suction on the skin <xref rid="pone.0065378-Abele1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065378-Chirali1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Several techniques are used, from traditional cupping, where skin incisions are made to allow blood and other body fluids to escape, to dry cupping and cupping massage, where no such incisions are made. Cupping may be beneficial for many pain conditions <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; and recent pilot trials also have shown significant effects from cupping for patients with chronic non-specific neck pain <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cramer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065378-Lauche2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Cupping is thought to act mainly by increasing local blood circulation and relieving painful muscle tension <xref rid="pone.0065378-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In cupping massage (CM), the effects of cupping and massage are combined, with the cupping glasses being moved over the skin surface after negative pressure has been created <xref rid="pone.0065378-Abele1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Not only PMR, but also CM, is easily learned for use in patients&#x02019; own homes and rather inexpensive.

After baseline measurement patients were randomized to either a cupping massage or a progressive muscle relaxation group and introduced to their assigned intervention. Trial measurements were repeated post-intervention, 12 weeks after randomization. All measurements were conducted by an investigator blind to patients&#x02019; group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were recruited via a local newspaper advertisement, with a research assistant screening interested people by phone to assess their eligibility. People who met the trial inclusion criteria were invited to attend a trial assessment session two weeks later. In the meantime, they were asked to keep a daily pain diary; bringing this diary with them to the assessment session. During the latter, a study physician explored patients&#x02019; medical histories and drug usage; examined their physical health and neurological function. The physician also checked patients&#x02019; medical records that they provided, e.g. laboratory findings or x-rays. If patients met the trial inclusion criteria, and did not fulfill any exclusion criteria, they were given detailed written information about the study and their written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>Trial participants were required to be aged 18&#x02013;75 and to have experienced non-specific neck pain for at least the previous three months, for a minimum of five days a week. Their mean neck pain intensity was required to be 45 mm or more on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) <xref rid="pone.0065378-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, where 100 mm was described as &#x0201c;the worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;. Therefor the patients&#x02019; diaries were checked and the average pain intensity of the past 2 weeks was calculated.</p><p>The trial exclusion criteria included neck pain caused by trauma, disc protrusion, whiplash, congenital deformity of the spine, spinal stenosis, neoplasm, inflammatory rheumatic disease, or active oncologic disease, affective disorder, addiction and psychosis. In addition, patients who were pregnant or who had had invasive treatment of the spine within the previous four weeks, or spinal surgery within the previous year were excluded. Finally, patients using opiates and long-term corticosteroid medication (&#x0003e;10 mg Prednisolon or equivalent), those who had started a new treatment for neck pain within the previous six weeks, or were planning to start such treatment within the following twelve weeks were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one treatment group using a non-stratified block-randomization approach with randomly varying block lengths. The &#x0201c;ranuni&#x0201d; random number generator of the SAS/STAT &#x000ae; software (SAS Inc., Cary NC, US) was used to generate random numbers. Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing patients&#x02019; treatment assignments were prepared by a statistician who was not involved in conducting the study. Following each baseline assessment, the trial coordinator opened the next lowest numbered envelope to reveal patient&#x02019;s treatment assignment. During the active treatment phase, only the trial coordinator had contact with patients and knew of their group allocation. The trial coordinator was not involved in patients&#x02019; outcome assessments and the outcome assessor remained blind to patients&#x02019; group allocation throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Cupping Massage (CM) group</title><p>These participants, and a partner, relative or friend, as appropriate, attended a one-hour practical workshop to learn how to use cupping massage. The clinic regularly runs such sessions to teach patients and their partners cupping massage methods for home use. The workshop was led by an experienced teacher and two assistants and it began with an overview of the history, indications and contraindications of cupping massage, followed by its technique, risks and possible side effects. Cupping massage was then demonstrated by the teacher and a patient volunteer. Patients, and those accompanying them, then practiced the cupping massage technique, with staff members providing feedback and suggestions for improvement as needed. Patients practiced until they felt competent to use the cupping massage technique unaided. All patients were given a cupping glass (&#x000d8;3.5 cm, Karl Hecht GmbH, Sondheim/Rh&#x000f6;n, Germany), 200 ml of arnica massage oil (Weleda AG, Schw&#x000e4;bisch-Gm&#x000fc;nd, Germany) and detailed written information to take home. Patients were advised that they could attend a further &#x02018;refresher&#x02019; session, at any time during the trial, if they felt that they needed to. They were asked to contact the trial coordinator if they wished to attend such a session, but none did so. Patients were also asked to contact the trial coordinator if they experienced any adverse events. All patients were telephoned halfway through the study to promote compliance with the trial and its treatments. All patients further received an instruction sheet in German with a summary of treatment advices, see appendix 1.</p><p>Two treatment sessions per week of 10&#x02013;15 minutes&#x02019; duration each at comfortable intensity were recommended. Patients were advised that cupping massage might cause petechiae and ecchymosis for several days; necessitating awareness in social settings such as swimming pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) group</title><p>Progressive muscle relaxation is a systematic technique used to achieve a deep state of relaxation, developed by Edmund Jacobson <xref rid="pone.0065378-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is widely used by patients with chronic pain conditions; however previous research indicates that relaxation techniques might not be better than usual care for chronic neck pain <xref rid="pone.0065378-Gustavsson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065378-Viljanen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this trial, it was applied to prevent patients from dropping out of the trial due to loss of motivation, because otherwise they would have waited for 12 weeks without any intervention. It was also used as an attention control. Progressive muscle relaxation could also easily be learned and applied at home. Participants in this group attended a one hour session led by a psychologist experienced in delivering relaxation training. They were taught about the history of relaxation and the process of undertaking it. They then practiced a shortened version of the PMR technique. They went on to discuss issues related to this exercise and were given written information and a training CD. The CD, which contained short and long versions of the PMR technique, was designed by a large statutory German health insurance company to relieve muscle tension and improve general wellbeing <xref rid="pone.0065378-Techniker1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Patients were asked to practice relaxation at home twice a week for 20 minutes a session and to record their practice in a diary. At the end of the trial, they were also offered a cupping massage workshop, a cupping glass (&#x000d8;3.5 cm, Karl Hecht GmbH, Sondheim/Rh&#x000f6;n, Germany) and 200 ml of arnica massage oil (Weleda AG, Schw&#x000e4;bisch-Gm&#x000fc;nd, Germany), as incentives to complete the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was perceived pain, as recorded on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) <xref rid="pone.0065378-Tiplady1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> at week 12.

From 246 patients initially screened by telephone, 98 patients were seen by the study physician, of whom 84 were subsequently enrolled. The most common reasons for excluding patients were that they met one or more exclusion criteria, had scheduling problems and/or lost interest in the study. Of the 84 patients enrolled, 61 were randomized after baseline assessment. The 23 patients who withdrew at this stage had no study partner available, were no longer interested, had medical concerns, were not contactable after inclusion or withdrew without giving any reason. Seven of the 61 patients randomized were lost to follow-up; four in the intervention group (CM) and three in the control group (PMR). These patients did not attend for post-intervention assessment.

Although cupping massage and progressive muscle relaxation might provide such strategies, this is the first study to investigate these interventions&#x02019; effectiveness in a non-clinical setting.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial found 12 weeks&#x02019; home use of cupping massage was no more effective than progressive muscle relaxation in reducing participants&#x02019; pain and improving their functional impairment and quality of life. Differences were, however, found for some aspects of changes to their wellbeing and pressure pain sensitivity.</p><p>These results are mostly in line with past studies on cupping in chronic non-specific neck pain <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cramer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065378-Lauche2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> which found single traditional cupping <xref rid="pone.0065378-Lauche2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or five applications of different types of dry cupping <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cramer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065378-Schumann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> better than waiting-list controls; comparable with the observed effects in the present study. Because the effect in the progressive muscle relaxation group was almost as large as that in the cupping massage group, no significant group difference was found. Both of the changes found were within the range of clinical significance for the VAS <xref rid="pone.0065378-Dworkin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, however they are to be classified as minimal or little improvements only.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect sizes found within the cupping massage group, in the present study, compared closely to those found in past studies, despite major changes to the study design. While past studies&#x02019; treatments were delivered by professionals in clinical environments, the present study used home-based treatment. The present study also had a longer treatment interval (12 weeks) rather than the single treatment <xref rid="pone.0065378-Lauche2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or five treatments over two week patterns adopted elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0065378-Cramer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065378-Schumann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Potential modes of action of the cupping massage may involve increased local microcirculation; thought to reverse hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity is seen mainly as a consequence of peripheral sensitization <xref rid="pone.0065378-Treede1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and inflammation of local neural tissue <xref rid="pone.0065378-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> caused by an ischemia due to muscle spasm <xref rid="pone.0065378-Weerapong1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Increased pressure pain sensitivity is common in patients with chronic neck pain <xref rid="pone.0065378-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065378-LaTouche1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, appearing in such muscles as the levator scapulae, trapezius and semispinalis capitis <xref rid="pone.0065378-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065378-Madeleine1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The reduced hypersensitivity found at some areas might suggest that the microcirculation in patients&#x02019; neck areas was improved; however the results are too inconclusive to draw final conclusions.</p><p>Limitations of this study include different patients&#x02019; expectations of treatment effectiveness, which were entered as a covariate into the analyses, controlling for the influence of this variable.</p><p>A further limitation comes from patients&#x02019; high withdrawal rate prior to randomization that may have resulted in an underpowered study. Given the observed effects even the original sample size would not have been enough to detect differences in pain intensity. Furthermore, since most of the patients withdrew before randomization, the risk of a biased sample might also be very small.</p><p>Limitations may also arise from unknown differences between the partner-administered cupping massage treatment and relaxation exercises delivered solely by CD. A lack of a long-term follow-up and the impossibility of blinding patients and workshop providers to patients&#x02019; treatment allocations, are also possible sources of bias.</p><p>The study&#x02019;s strengths include the adaptation of existing trial designs to investigate cupping massage and muscle relaxation in a non-clinical setting; providing results that are easily applied to everyday life. Its other strength is its use of a randomized controlled design with blinded outcome assessors, which is, however, only relevant for physiological outcome measures. The inclusion of an active control group practicing a relaxation method recommended by German neck pain guidelines <xref rid="pone.0065378-Deutsche1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, as well as the between group comparability of patients&#x02019; compliance, medication use and concurrent treatments are also strengths of the study.</p><p>In conclusion, cupping massage is no more effective than progressive muscle in reducing chronic non-specific neck pain. Both therapies can be easily used at home and can reduce pain to a minimal clinically relevant extent.
