To meet
this demand, understanding the relationship between this variable and other variables is
critical for the formulation of action plans that promote the development of this
skill.</p><p>Concern with nursing leadership is crucial in intensive care units (ICUs) due to their
dynamic nature, which results from the severe condition of the admitted patients and
which requires nurses to provide highly complex care. Within this setting, nurses must
lead their staff to achieve the best outcomes, for which leadership skills are
essential. Thus, the relationship between that dynamic, interactive environment and
nursing leadership represents an appropriate subject of study. </p><p>The correlation between leadership and the work environment has been studied by several
authors at the institutional level but not specifically in the ICU setting. A total of
24 studies included in a systematic review<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>)</sup> showed that leadership styles focusing on people and relationships
contributed to improving the outcomes of the nursing workforce, the work environment,
and the productivity and effectiveness of health organizations. By contrast, the staff
satisfaction was lower in 10 studies in which leadership focused on tasks. </p><p>Transformational leadership increased the nurses' satisfaction in all institutional
areas, reduced burnout, and provided a favorable work environment<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Another study<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>)</sup> designed a test model in which the authentic leadership of managers was
combined with the nurses' perception regarding structural empowerment,
<italic>performance</italic>, and personal satisfaction. The sample consisted of 280
nurses who responded to instruments for data collection on each of the assessed
variables. Leadership had a significant and positive influence on all the investigated
attributes. </p><p>A study that investigated the role of organizational power and the leader's personal
influence in the creation of a high-quality professional practice environment for
nurses<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>)</sup> found a direct and positive relationship.</p><p>To summarize, leadership impacts the work environment. However, the measure in which the
environment might interfere with the development of leadership is still a gap that
deserves investigation, especially in intensive care units because no studies assessing
that relationship in this particular setting could be located. </p><p>Thus, the present study poses the following research question: Is there a relationship
between the ICU work environment and nursing leadership? The answer to this question
will help advance the knowledge on this subject and support nursing management,
modifying the development of that skill based on the results. In addition, the critical
nature of the ICU setting, the use of high technology, and the presence of
interdisciplinary staffs further stimulate this type of inquiry. Thus, the aim of the
present study is to investigate whether there is any relationship between the ICU work
environment and nursing leadership. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>The present correlational study involved a systematic investigation of the nature of the
relationship or association between variables<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The study was conducted at four ICUs in the southern area of S&#x000e3;o Paulo
County, SP, Brazil. Those ICUs were located at tertiary hospitals and provided general
intensive care to adults with clinical or surgical problems. Two ICUs belonged to
private institutions (A and B) and two to public teaching hospitals (C and D). The
reason for that choice was to compare public and private settings as well as for the
investigators' convenience. </p><p>ICUs at public and private institutions were selected based on the assumption that from
the macromanagement perspective, they exhibited differences. That is, the management of
the physical, material, and human resources, quality, and safety was different. This
assumption was based on the investigators' professional work experience in both
settings. </p><p>The study population consisted of registered nurses and nursing technicians with at
least six months of work experience in an ICU. This criterion was established to ensure
that the participants had the minimum experience in intensive care required for a sound
assessment. </p><p>The procedure for data collection started with the principal investigator's making
contact with the nurses to inform them of the aims of the study. Next, the nurses
randomly selected one of the nursing technicians on staff, who was also consulted, by
lottery. After agreeing to participate, all of the volunteers signed an informed consent
form. </p><p>The nurses were blind as to the nursing technicians they had selected, as the latter
were identified by numbers that were only known to the principal investigator. By
contrast, the nursing technicians were aware of the identity of the leader they had to
evaluate, as his or her name was included in the instrument for data collection.
Anonymity was ensured to avoid any influence that could interfere with the subjects'
responses. </p><p>An envelope containing the following three instruments for data collection was delivered
to the nurses: 1) characterization: comprising data on age, gender, time since
graduation, job at the institution and in the ICU, attendance of graduate courses, and
acquaintance with the topic of leadership. Those variables were selected based on the
investigators' experience and the intention to assess their relationship to leadership;
2) a validated Portuguese version of the <italic>Nursing Work Index Revised</italic>
(B-NWI-R)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup>; and 3) Grid &#x00026; Leadership in Nursing: ideal behavior<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The selected nursing technicians were given an envelope that contained the following: 1)
the aforementioned instrument for characterization; and 2) Grid &#x00026; Leadership in
Nursing: actual behavior<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup> to complete relative to the corresponding randomly-assigned nurse. </p><p>As a result, pairs were formed between a nurse and the nursing technician randomly
selected by him or her to evaluate the former's perception on ideal leadership behavior
and the assessment made by the latter on the actual performance of the nurse as his or
her immediate leader. </p><p>The participants responded to the instruments away from the work environment. A date was
scheduled to hand the questionnaire directly to the principal investigator. The
principal investigator did not hold a leadership position at any of the investigated
ICUs. </p><p>The characteristics of each instrument are described in the following. The
<italic>B-NWI-R</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<italic>)</italic> is based on the Nursing Work Index (NWI), which was drafted in 1989.
It consists of 65 items. The <italic>Nursing Work Index Revised</italic>
(NWI-R)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup> was formulated to make the NWI shorter and also to measure particular
characteristics of the work environment that are favorable to nursing professional
practice. </p><p>The NWI-R consists of 57 items, 15 of which were conceptually distributed across three
subscales: autonomy, control over the practice setting, and the nurse-physician
relationship. A total of 10 of these 15 items were clustered to form a fourth subscale:
organizational support<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Conceptually, the subscales are defined as follows<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>: autonomy (five items) and control (seven items) represent the freedom
nurses have to solve problems that affect the quality of nursing care; the
nurse-physician relationship (three items) concerns the professional respect needed for
effective communication regarding shared goals in patient care; organizational support
(10 items derived from the three aforementioned subscales) concerns the situations in
which the organization provides the necessary support for nursing professional practice. </p><p>The measurement scales are 4-point Likert scales; the lower the score, the greater the
presence of attributes favorable to professional nursing practice. The score of each
subscale is calculated based on the average scores of the responses given by subjects
and ranges from one to four<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because the NWI-R was translated and adapted for the Brazilian population<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and the subscales were validated (B-NWI-R)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, they were used in the present study.</p><p>
<italic>Grid &#x00026; Leadership in Nursing: ideal and actual behavior</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup> consists of two instruments based on the grid theory to assess the ideal
leadership behavior of nurses and the actual views of staff members in this regard. One
instrument is thus responded to by the staff leader, and the other by a staff member. As
both instruments are appropriate for the Brazilian setting and were subjected to
apparent and content validation<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, they are used in the present study.</p><p>The instrument consists of 25 statements with four answer options, attributed different
scores and categorized as follows: entirely desirable (four points), desirable (three
points), undesirable (two points), and entirely undesirable (one point)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Each statement concerns one style of leadership (1.1; 1.9; 5.5; 9.1; and
9.9)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The leadership style attributed the highest score represents how a nurse
exerts leadership as a function of his or her conception of ideal behavior and the view
of a member of his or her staff regarding the actual situation<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The data were collected from October 2012 to March 2013. The study was approved by the
research ethics committee (Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa - CEP) of the Federal University
of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo - UNIFESP) under protocol number
0839/10.</p><p>Before the onset of data collection and following the CEP approval, a pretest was
performed with a random sample comprising 13 nurses and 13 nursing technicians who did
not participate in the full study. No difficulty in the interpretation of the
questionnaires used was reported. </p><p>The data on characterization were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with a p-value equal to or lower than 0.05 was used to investigate
the correlation between the work environment and actual nursing leadership, which were
the variables of interest in the present study. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The response rate was 54.5%, i.e., 121 nurses and nursing technicians returned the
questionnaires. However, the sample consisted of 66 nurse-nurse technician pairs,
distributed as follows: ICU A = 34, ICU B = 3, ICU C = 16, and ICU D = 13.</p><p>Of the 66 nurses who were interviewed, 48 (72.7%) were female; their shift distribution
was as follows: morning, 15 (22.7%); morning and afternoon, 5 (7.6%); afternoon, 11
(16.7%); and night, 35 (53%). The morning and afternoon shift was included because the
work schedule at one of the institutions was 12x36 h during the day.</p><p>All of the nurses (100%) had been introduced to the subject of leadership during their
undergraduate studies; 29 (43.99%) had attended lectures, and 28 (42.4%) had been given
special training on the subject. A total of 60 nurses (90.9%) had attended specialized
courses, most of which were on intensive care, 28 (46%); 10 among the latter had
attended specialized courses in other fields. </p><p>Of the group of nursing technicians, 41 (62.1%) were female, worked the same shifts as
their superiors, and had been less exposed to the subject of leadership: 42 (63.6%) in a
technical course, 18 in lectures (27.3%), 16 (24.3%) in training sessions, and 7 (10.6%)
in other contexts, in addition to coursework for 11 (16.7%) who were studying nursing. </p><p>The technicians were slightly older (average age: 34.7 years old) than the nurses
(average age: 32.9 years old), and their time since graduation was longer (on average,
10 years). The length of work at the institution and ICU was longer among the nurses (on
average, 6 and 5.2 years, respectively) compared to the nursing technicians (on average,
5.1 and 4.8 years, respectively). The fact that 35 pairs (53%) worked the night shift is
deserving of particular attention. </p><p>The average scores on the B-NWI-R were similar among the four investigated ICUs (mean =
1.95; 95% CI: 1.85-2.05): ICU A, 1.88 (95% CI: 1.74-2.02); ICU B, 2.29 (95% CI:
1.87-2.71); ICU C, 1.90 (95% CI: 1.69-2.10); and ICU D, 2.10 (95% CI: 1.83-2.37).</p><p>The internal consistency of the B-NWI-R domains was assessed by means of Cronbach's
alpha, the values of which were: total B-NWI-R = 0.819; B-NWI-R autonomy = 0.645;
B-NWI-R control over practice setting = 0.732; B-NWI-R nurse-physician relationship =
0.702; and B-NWI-R organizational support = 0.748.</p><p>Among the population of 66 responding nurses, 65 (98.5%) rated leadership style 9.9 as
the ideal leadership style. However, when their actual leadership style was assessed by
the nursing technicians, the results were as follows: 9.9 was attributed to 42 nurses
(63.6%); 9.1 to eight (12.1%); 5.5 to 9 (13.6%); 1.9 to six (9.1%); and 1.1 to one
(1.5%). Thus, 42 (63.6%) leaders were assessed in a satisfactory manner (95% CI [50.8%;
74.8%]).</p><p>

</p><p>As the number of pairs was heterogeneous among the investigated ICUs and to test for
differences in the B-NWI-R scores and the actual leadership styles between the nurses at
the private (ICU A and B) and public (ICU C and D) hospitals, the corresponding ICUs
were pooled for comparison. </p><p>The average total score on the B-NWI-R was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.83-2.15) in the ICUs at the
private hospitals and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.78-2.05) in the ICUs at the public hospitals, p =
0.459. The correlation of those scores with the actual nursing leadership style
exhibited p = 0.437. </p><p>The average score for each B-NWI-R domain was analyzed relative to the actual leadership
style of the nurses at the public and private hospitals. The results were as follows:
autonomy, p = 0.629; control over practice setting, p = 0.676; nurse-physician
relationship, p = 0.001; and organizational support, p = 0.254. </p><p>The ANOVA showed that the effect of the interaction between hospital type and actual
nursing leadership style was significant only in the nurse-physician relationship domain
(p = 0.001), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>The scores on the B-NWI-R nurse-physician relationship domain relative to leadership
style 9.1 were lower at the public hospital ICUs. The scores on the B-NWI-R relative to
leadership style 1.9 were lower at the private hospital ICUs. Thus, the most
favorable<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> correlation between the leadership style in which the professional is most
involved (9.1)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and the mutual respect between nurses and doctors corresponded to the
public hospital ICUs. </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The interest in studies assessing the impact of the work environment on the outcomes of
care and management arose in the 1980s, when the American Academy of Nursing conducted a
nationwide study to establish which characteristics of the work environment favored
nursing professional practice. The institutions known as <italic>magnet</italic>
hospitals shared the following features: management, professional practice, and
professional development<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Those attributes are assessed by the NWI-R<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, which is the basis for B-NWI-R<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and which is anchored in the Nursing Professional Practice
Model<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The latter is defined as a system (structure, process, and values) that
lends support to nurses to control the care provided to patients and the setting in
which care is provided. </p><p>On those grounds, the results of the present study show that the work environment at the
investigated ICUs is favorable for daily nursing practice (mean = 1.95; 95% CI:
1.85-2.05), regardless of the hospital being analyzed. </p><p>One might thus infer that the ICU work environment is attractive for nursing
professionals. This claim is corroborated by a study conducted in South
Korea<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>)</sup> that investigated nurses' perceptions of the work conditions at the
hospital and the ICU simultaneously by means of the NWI-R subscales. The sample
consisted of 817 nurses from 39 ICUs at 15 hospitals. Based on the results of the
multiple regression analysis, the work environment at the investigated hospitals was
rated good, moderate, or poor as follows: good, two (13.4%); moderate, 10 (66.6%); and
poor, three (20%). The corresponding assessment of the ICUs was as follows: good, nine
(23.1%); moderate, 24 (61.5%); and poor, six (15.4%). </p><p>The average score of 17 rural ICUs in the state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (SP), Brazil<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, on the B-NWI-R was 2.13, which was higher than the score found in the
present study. Thus, the work environment at the four investigated ICUs was found to be
healthy. </p><p>However, no significant association was found between the average score on the B-NWI-R
and the actual nursing leadership styles (p = 0.852). The same held true for the scores
on the B-NWI-R subscales. </p><p>Thus, the work environment was not found to influence the nursing leadership styles in
the present study. However, only four of the B-NWI-R domains were validated for use in
Brazil<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Once validated, the remaining domains might allow for a broader assessment
of the work environment characteristics than the domains available at the present time. </p><p>When the ICUs at the public and private hospitals were analyzed separately, no
significant difference was found in relationship between the average B-NWI-R score and
the nurses' actual leadership styles (p = 0.437). Only the nurse-physician relationship
domain exhibited p = 0.001. It should be noted that the ICUs at the public hospitals
exhibited the most favorable correlation between the leadership styles in which the
professional is most involved, 9.1<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, and the nurse-physician relationship domain. This finding leads us to
reflect on how professional relationships occur, taking into consideration the fact that
as teaching hospitals, the public hospitals might have been more favored. Nevertheless,
experience in the ICU allows the inference that interdisciplinary interactions do occur
and that they are generally healthy, given the severity of the patients under staff
care. </p><p>Leadership has been associated with several variables, including patient satisfaction.
There is strong evidence<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>)</sup> of an association between positive leadership behaviors and increased
patient satisfaction and reduced adverse events<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In one study<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, 29% of job satisfaction, 22% of organizational commitment, and 9% of
productivity were explained by the use of leadership behavior. Those findings are in
accord with the results of three studies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<sup>)</sup> in which the variables of interest were job satisfaction, organizational
climate<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, and <italic>burnout</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Leadership was found to exert a positive, direct influence on those
indicators<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>Based on those findings and the fact that the work environment might attract and retain
excellent professionals, according to the Nursing Professional Practice
Model<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, it was hypothesized that such strong characteristics might influence
nursing leadership styles, given the lack of studies in the literature that seek to
answer this question. </p><p>The results of the present study show that the work environment is similar at the four
investigated ICUs. No relationship is found between the work environment and nursing
leadership in the assessed population. These findings give rise to several questions
that might be answered by future studies: Are ICUs different from other hospital areas?
Would the application of the entire NWI-R, following its validation for the Brazilian
context, allow for a better assessment of work environments and subsequent replication
of the method used in the present study? Would the inclusion of additional ICUs allow
for a more comprehensive analysis of this problem within the intensive care setting?
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The work environment was not associated with actual nursing leadership (p = 0.825), and
the same held true in the case of the B-NWI-R subscales. The public or private nature of
the hospitals where the investigated ICUs were located did not exhibit a direct
relationship with leadership (p = 0.437). Only the nurse-physician relationship domain
stood out, p = 0.001. </p><p>The present study had the following limitations: sample size and convenience sampling;
application of only four of the B-NWI-R domains; few studies that used the NWI-R in the
intensive care setting; and the fact that the leadership framework used dates from the
1990s. </p><p>Based on these results, nursing managers might conclude that nurses ought to develop
leadership skills and that the work environment does not exert influence on the study
population. Thus, nurses require individual development plans that include the types of
knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and deliverables needed to exert leadership.
Within this context, the role of Nursing Training Centers also stands out because they
are tasked with the training and development of leaders fit for work in the intensive
care setting, using the findings of the present study. </p><p>Because the work environment was not associated with nursing leadership in the
investigated ICUs, further scientific studies with larger samples might be conducted to
confirm this result and to identify other variables the may interfere with nursing
leadership in the intensive care setting. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn01" fn-type="supported-by"><label>1</label><p> Paper extracted from doctoral dissertation "Leadership of nurses in ICU and its
