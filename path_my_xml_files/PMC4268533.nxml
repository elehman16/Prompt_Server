The reported incidence of PONV in patients undergoing breast surgery with axillary dissection is about 60-80%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, there is a continued interest in methods to reduce the incidence and severity of PONV.</p><p>Patients report that avoidance of PONV is of greater concern than avoidance of postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Among high-risk patients, the incidence of PONV can be as frequent as 70-80%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Patients with PONV may develop medical complications, consume more resources, increased pain at the surgical site and delayed discharge from hospital.</p><p>There are a number of other contributing factors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These include patient related factors, surgical and post-operative condition. Patient related factors include increased body weight,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] female gender[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] history of motion sickness or previous PONV,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] perioperative opioid use[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and non-smoking status.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Current medical practice entails the use of a combination of antiemetic acting on multiple receptor sites to reduce the risk of PONV in high-risk pts. A recent meta-analysis on prevention of PONV[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggested that a combination of dexamethasone with the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists is likely to be the best antiemetic prophylactic regimen among the drugs currently available.</p><p>It has been postulated that antiemetic and antinauseant effect of ondansetron is exerted by blockade of serotonin induced depolarization of vagal afferent nerves. It may also involve 5-HT<sub>3</sub> binding sites in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and nucleus tractus solitarii in the brain stem. Emetogenic action of chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy as well as PONV may involve activation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in vagal afferents in the small intestine as well as central neurons in the area postrema near the fourth ventricles. These actions are effectively blocked by ondansetron. It has a half-life of 3 h.</p><p>Granisetron is a new 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist more selective than ondansetron. It is effective orally as well as intravenous (i.v.). It blocks the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors at both the central and the peripheral sites. It acts on the vagal efferent nerves of the gut and produces blockade of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. It has a half-life of 8-9 h.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, it has longer duration of action than ondansetron.</p><p>Dexamethasone is a 21 carbon compound having a cyclopentanoperhydro-phenanthrene (steroid) nucleus. It is very potent and highly selective long-acting glucocorticoid. It has a long half-life of 36-48 h after a single dose of 8 mg i.v. given before induction of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The precise mechanism of action is not well understood, but may be due to prostaglandin antagonism, serotonin inhibition in the gut and the release of endorphins that elevate mood and stimulate appetite.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It augment the efficacy of other primary antiemetic drugs like metoclopramide, ondansetron and granisetron. It also serves to reduce certain side effects of the primary antiemetics.</p><p>We designed this prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the efficacy of ondansetron, granisetron and combination of granisetron and dexamethasone to prevent PONV in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study protocol was approved by Instituitional Ethical Committee and informed consent was taken by every patient. Seventy-five female patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade 1 and 2 with carcinoma breast Stages 1-3 going for elective MRM with or without chemotherapy were included in the study. Patients with history of motion sickness and previous history of PONV, history of smoking, full stomach, gastroesophageal disease, pregnant and menstruating women and those who had taken antiemetic medication within 24 h were excluded from the study.</p><p>All the patients were kept fasting 6-8 h and premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg at night and in the morning of surgery. In the operation theater, i.v. line was started in the hand opposite to the side to be operated. Basic monitors in the form of electocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry were connected to the patient. Baseline pulse, BP and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. In a double-blind manner, patients were randomly divided into three groups (25 patients each), received either:</p><p>

</p><p>All drugs were delivered in equivalent volume in 5 ml syringe with a coded label. The anesthesiologist who anesthetized the patient and all involved nurses were unaware of the content of the syringe. The study drug was administered just before the induction of anesthesia. Pulse, BP and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded 5 min after administration of study drugs.</p><p>The anesthesia regimen and surgery were standardized for all patients. After preoxygenation, induction of anesthesia was done with injection- fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and injection thiopentone 5 mg/kg intravenously. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was maintained by nitrous oxide and oxygen (50:50). Anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane and supplemental doses of vecuronium (0.04 mg/kg) and fentanyl as and when required. Injection ketorolac 30 mg intravenously was given 15 min. prior to completion of surgery. At the end of surgical procedure, residual neuromuscular block was adequately reversed using i.v. glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) and neostigmine (2.5 mg). Patient was extubated after adequate respiration and head lift and shifted to post anesthesia care unit. Postoperative analgesia was provided with injection- tramadol 100 mg i.v. 6 hourly in drip and injection- ketorolac 30 mg i.v. if required. All the patients were observed for hemodynamics, nausea, retching and emetic episodes and any adverse events for 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-24 h of surgery. Pulse, BP and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded every 30 min during surgery and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h of surgery.</p><p>Severity of nausea and vomiting was assessed by visual analogue scoring as:[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>

</p><p>Patients who had two or more vomitings post-operatively received a rescue dose of injection-metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, hypotension, and extra-pyramidal effects were also noted.</p><p>Nausea is defined as a subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with an urge to vomit.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Retching is defined as the labored, spasmodic, rhythmic contraction of the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, chest wall and abdominal wall muscles without expulsion of gastric contents. Vomiting is defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] brought about by the powerful sustained contraction of the abdominal muscles, descent of the diaphragm and opening of gastric cardia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results were analyzed using SPSS version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Power analysis indicated that 25 patients are required per each group based on 85% incidence of PONV in MRM surgery if no prophylaxis given with an anticipated reduction in the incidence of emesis up to 25%, which was the therapeutic outcome for dexamethasone when given as a sole prophylactic agent. The alpha error was set at 0.05 and Type 2 error was set at 0.20. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA).

The occurrence of intractable vomiting can prolong the hospital stay[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and hence the economic implications also assume greater significance.</p><p>The strategies for the prevention of early and late PONV have changed considerably over the last decade, with the focus having moved from single drug therapy to combination antiemetic therapy, or balanced antiemesis. The first evidence that such combination therapy is of superior benefit came in year 1994.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Since this time several combinations have been tried, and many of them have proved to be more efficacious than single drug therapy.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] More recently, multimodal management strategies incorporating changes in anesthetic technique, aggressive fluid management and pain relief strategies have produced even better results.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Fujii <italic>et al</italic>. (1998): Undertook a study in Japanese females to evaluate the efficacy of granisetron-dexamethasone combination for prevention of PONV in patients undergoing general anesthesia for breast surgery. 135 ASA 1 patients aged between 40 and 65 years were assigned to receive placebo (saline), granisetron 40 mcg/kg i.v. or granisetron 40 mcg/kg + dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. immediately before the induction of anesthesia. A complete response during 0-3 h after anesthesia was 51%, 82% and 96% in patients who had received placebo, granisetron and G + D combination, respectively. The corresponding incidence during 3-24 h after anesthesia was 56%, 84% and 96%, respectively. It was concluded that prophylactic use G + D combination is more effective than granisetron alone for the prevention of PONV after breast surgery.</p><p>This study is in concordance with the above study. The study is performed in Indian females. We also compared the efficacy of granisetron and dexamethasone combination with granisetron or ondansetron for prevention of PONV in female patients undergoing breast surgery.</p><p>Episodes of nausea, retching, and vomiting were recorded for 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and 12-24 h, respectively of the postoperative period in all the three groups.</p><p>During 0-3h, 32% (8) patients had nausea in ondansetron group while no patients in G + D group. 28% (7) complained of retching in ondansetron group while none in granisetron and G + D group. 36% (9) had vomiting in Group O, 12% (3) in granisetron group but only 1% (4) in G + D group. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 which is statistically significant.</p><p>At 3-6 h, 24% (6) in ondansetron group and 8% (2) in granisetron group had nausea and retching. Episodes of vomiting were 20% (5) in ondansetron group and 16% (4) in granisetron group. None of the patients in group G + D complained of nausea, retching or vomiting during this time period. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 which is statistically significant.</p><p>During 6-9 h, 8% (2) in Group O and 4% (1) in Group G + D had nausea. Retching was seen in 12% (3) in Group O while none of the patients in Group G and G + D. 16% (4) had vomiting in Group O, 8% (2) in Group G while 4% (1) in Group G + D had vomiting. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 which is statistically significant.</p><p>At 9-12 h, all the three groups were comparable as 4% (1) had nausea in Group O and 4% (1) had vomiting in all the three groups.</p><p>During 12-24 h of the postoperative period, none of the patients had nausea and retching. But 12% (3) had vomiting in ondansetron group, 4% (1) in each granisetron and G + D group.</p><p>A complete response (no PONV and no need of rescue antiemetic) during 0-3 h after surgery was seen in 4%, 84% and 96% patients who had received ondansetron, granisetron and granisetron plus dexamethasone, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The corresponding incidence during 3-24 h was 70%, 88% and 96% in the respective groups. Requirement of rescue antiemetic was comparatively higher in ondansetron group rather than in granisetron and granisetron plus dexamethasone group.</p><p>Adverse effects such as headache, hypotension, dizziness, etc., were more common in ondansetron group as compared to granisetron and granisetron plus dexamethasone group.</p><p>Hence, we can say that the administration of granisetron and dexamethasone had significantly reduced the incidence of PONV as compared to ondansetron or granisetron alone in patients undergoing MRM.</p><p>Thomas R and Jones <italic>et al</italic>. (BJA 2001) conducted a prospective randomized comparative study of dexamethasone, ondansetron, and ondansetron + dexamethasone as prophylactic antiemetic therapy in patients undergoing day case gynecological surgery. They found that failure of prophylaxis during first 3 h after surgery was recorded in 22%, 28.3%, and 8.6%. The overall incidences for the 24 h postsurgery were 42.4%, 48.3%, and 34.5%, respectively.</p><p>Dipasi Bhattacharya and Arnab Banerjee (IJA 2003) conducted a double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial to compare the efficacy of ondansetron and granisetron for prevention of PONV after day care gynecological laparoscopy.</p><p>They found that incidences of emetic episodes were 20% in ondansetron group and 7% in granisetron group which is clinically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Hence, the results of our study are in concordance with the previous studies by different authors, with few differences, which are insignificant. Hence, granisetron and dexamethasone combination is quite effective in preventing and reducing PONV in MRM patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>On the basis of results obtained, it was concluded that Indian females who were undergoing MRM and had prophylactically received granisetron and dexamethasone combination were either free from nausea and emetic episodes or had lesser degree of PONV as compared to ondansetron or granisetron group alone.
