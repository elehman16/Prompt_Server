Four short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigated the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate in acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Paliperidone palmitate was also studied as a maintenance treatment to prevent or delay relapse in stable schizophrenia. In addition, paliperidone palmitate was compared to risperidone long-acting injection for noninferiority in three studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Paliperidone palmitate has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores in the four acute treatment studies. In the maintenance treatment studies, paliperidone palmitate was found to be more effective than placebo in preventing or delaying the time to first relapse in stable schizophrenia patients. In addition, paliperidone palmitate was shown to be noninferior to risperidone long-acting injection in two studies. It was shown to be reasonably well tolerated in all clinical trials. Acute treatment phase should be initiated with a dose of 234 mg on day one and 156 mg on day eight, followed by a recommended monthly maintenance dose of 39&#x02013;234 mg based on efficacy and tolerability results from the clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Providing an optimal long-term treatment can be challenging. Paliperidone palmitate can be used as an acute treatment even in outpatient setting, and it has shown to be well tolerated by patients. Also, it does not require overlapping oral antipsychotic supplementation while being initiated, and is dosed once per month.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>long-acting injection</kwd><kwd>paliperidone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics have been available for many years but, until recently, options available were limited to first-generation &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; antipsychotics. In the last decade, several formulations of the newer, second-generation &#x0201c;atypical&#x0201d; antipsychotics have become available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-6-533">Figure 1</xref>). The goal of this review is to discuss the pharmacotherapy and clinical pharmacology of LAI antipsychotic therapies with a focus on paliperidone palmitate, a newer second-generation antipsychotic formulated for LAI.</p></sec><sec><title>LAI antipsychotic formulations</title><p>LAI antipsychotics are useful maintenance treatment options in patients with schizophrenia. These therapies have been available since the 1960s when the first-generation antipsychotic agent, fluphenazine, was introduced as a long-acting enanthate formulation. The commonly used fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate long-acting agents soon followed. These agents are synthesized such that the parent drug is esterified to fatty acid chains that allow the formulation to be dissolved in sesame oil. Administration of the oily solution into deep muscle tissue as a &#x0201c;depot&#x0201d; injection results in a pool of medication that is subsequently hydrolyzed through an inflammatory response, which releases the drug into systemic circulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-6-533">1</xref> Other available first-generation depot agents include perphenazine, pimozide, and flupenthixol. However, only fluphenazine and haloperidol are available agents in the United States due to Food and Drug Administration restriction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-6-533">1</xref> Second-generation LAIs such as risperidone microspheres, olanzapine pamoate, and paliperidone palmitate have also been formulated to gradually release active drug into the plasma from deep-tissue intramuscular injections. Unlike the sesame seed oil formulations of their first-generation predecessors, alternative delivery systems have been developed that no longer need to rely on covalent esterification to a fatty acid moiety. The paliperidone LAI formulation is the palmitate salt ester of paliperidone (9-OH-risperidone), and uses a nanocrystal technology formulation. In the pharmaceutical arena, nanoparticles are defined as having a size between 1&#x02013;1000 nm. In this context, tiny drug crystals are created and dispersed in liquid media as an aqueous suspension (nanosuspensions).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-6-533">2</xref> Paliperidone palmitate is a mixture of paliperidone palmitate enantiomers &#x0201c;wet-milled&#x0201d; into nanoparticles, which have low water solubility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-6-533">3</xref> After intramuscular injection, the suspended palmitate salt conjugates are hydrolyzed to the active drug, which dissolves slowly into the systemic circulation. Due to the low solubility, slow dissolution occurs at the injection site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Paliperidone palmitate pharmacokinetics</title><p>The release of the drug into the systemic circulation begins as early as the first day of administration, and continues for up to 126 days. The apparent volume of distribution of paliperidone is 391 L based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. The plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-6-533">3</xref></p><p>After a single intramuscular dose, plasma concentrations of paliperidone rise to reach maximum plasma concentration at a median time to maximum concentration of 13 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref> Four metabolic pathways of paliperidone have been identified in vivo: (1) dealkylation, (2) hydroxylation, (3) dehydrogenation, and (4) benzisoxazole scission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-6-533">5</xref> In vitro studies in human liver microsomes revealed that paliperidone palmitate does not appreciably inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and is not significantly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CPY2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CPY3A5.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-6-533">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-6-533">5</xref> Paliperidone is predominantly excreted by the kidneys. According to paliperidone palmitate product labeling, 1 week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate- release <sup>14</sup>C-paliperidone, 59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively metabolized in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and 11% in feces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-6-533">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-6-533">6</xref> Therefore, it is not expected to precipitate clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs. The median half-life of paliperidone following a single intramuscular dose of paliperidone palmitate (39&#x02013;234 mg) is 25&#x02013;49 days.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of paliperidone palmitate may be influenced by factors such as injection site, injection volume, needle length, creatinine clearance, and body mass index (BMI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref> The most clinically relevant factor in this list is injection site. Two studies identified that deltoid muscle injections, compared to gluteal administration, resulted in higher initial median paliperidone plasma concentrations on day eight of treatment (after the second injection).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-6-533">7</xref> Intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle resulted in a maximum plasma concentration that was 28% greater than the same dose administered into the gluteus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref> Once at steady state, there appears to be little difference in plasma paliperidone concentration between the two injection sites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-6-533">7</xref> This is important for clinicians to recognize because this greater maximum plasma concentration from the deltoid facilitates a rapid time to steady-state plasma concentrations, which is why deltoid administration is recommended for the first two injections. After the first two injections, patients and providers have a choice between deltoid and gluteal injection sites. It is also important to note that this may be a time when patients are more likely to experience side effects associated with peak plasma concentrations and to communicate with patients and caregivers appropriately. This certainly may apply to other LAI agents and is a general issue associated with LAIs. These studies also noted that using a longer needle (1.5 inch versus 1 inch) improved the likelihood of delivering accurate injections and, furthermore, that accuracy appears to be better from the deltoid site as compared to the gluteal route where the &#x0201c;hypovascularity&#x0201d; of subcutaneous tissue may alter the release profile of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-6-533">7</xref></p><p>Reduced creatinine clearance is an indicator of renal dysfunction and therefore, is inversely correlated with the renal clearance of paliperidone. The results from pharmacokinetic analyses of oral paliperidone identified that the total clearance of the drug was reduced by 32% in those with mild renal impairment, 64% in those with moderate impairment, and 71% in those with severe impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-6-533">4</xref> When this information is translated to clinical application, creatinine clearance values &#x0003c; 80 mL/minute influence the dosing of the drug, as summarized in the &#x0201c;Dosing and Clinical Utilization&#x0201d; section below.</p><p>BMI is also related to pharmacokinetic parameters of paliperidone palmitate during the initial stages of treatment. Early in treatment, patients with higher baseline BMIs (&#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) exhibit approximately 1.5&#x02013;2-times lower median paliperidone plasma concentrations on day eight and day 36 than patients with normal baseline BMI (&#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who are administered 156 mg injections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-6-533">8</xref> However, the differences between higher and lower BMI groups do not appear to persist after repeated injections and may, therefore, not be of great clinical significance for longer-term treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Paliperidone palmitate pharmacodynamics</title><p>Paliperidone palmitate is a centrally acting dopamine-D2 (D<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist and a serotonin type-2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptor antagonist. It is also active as an antagonist at &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors and histamine type-H1 receptors. Paliperidone palmitate has little affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ppa-6-533">9</xref> Comparisons with other antipsychotics with long-acting formulations that are available in the United States are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-6-533">Table 1</xref>. Receptor binding profiles are often clinically helpful for clinicians when assessing the likelihood for specific side effects based on prior experiences with other agents. The first-generation haloperidol and fluphenazine antipsychotics are known for high D<sub>2</sub> affinity and lower histamine type-1/serotonin type-2C affinity, which is thought to be associated with a lower likelihood for weight gain than second-generation alternatives. Similarly, high D<sub>2</sub> affinity in the absence of significant 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> affinity is thought to be an underlying mechanism of a greater likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) for these first-generation agents as compared to second-generation options. Paliperidone has a similar receptor binding profile as risperidone, thus the choice between these two agents in a long-acting formulation may be more related to dosing logistics (once monthly for paliperidone versus every 2 weeks for risperidone) or insurance coverage/financial considerations.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical studies of paliperidone palmitate</title><p>The efficacy and safety of paliperidone palmitate in the acute treatment of schizophrenia has been assessed in one 9-week and three 13-week double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, fixed-dose studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-6-533">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-6-533">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-6-533">12</xref> Prevention of relapse in schizophrenia was assessed in two long-term maintenance studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-6-533">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-6-533">14</xref> Paliperidone palmitate has also been compared with risperidone LAI in three noninferiority studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ppa-6-533">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-6-533">17</xref></p><p>All clinical trials of paliperidone palmitate summarized herein used Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores as primary outcome variables with additional analyses of positive and negative subscale measures of this assessment. Secondary outcome measures in these studies included the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scale and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale, which measures the severity of functional deficits. Recurrence and relapse events were evaluated in the long-term maintenance studies using fairly standard a priori criteria for relapse or impending relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Acute treatment</title><p>Four (one 9-week and three 13-week) multicenter, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of paliperidone palmitate using doses ranging from 39&#x02013;234 mg in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The fixed doses of paliperidone palmitate in these studies were given on days one, eight, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on day 64 of the 13-week studies.

Patients participating in this study had a diagnosis of schizophrenia &#x02013; according to DSM-IV-TR criteria &#x02013; for at least 1 year, a PANSS total score of 70&#x02013;120 at screening (60&#x02013;120 inclusive on day one before the start of the study), and a BMI range of 15&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

Mean PANSS total scores showed significant improvement at endpoint for both paliperidone palmitate treatment groups. In the paliperidone palmitate 78 mg and 156 mg groups, the mean PANSS difference was &#x02212;5.2 and &#x02212;7.8, respectively. CGI-S scores also improved at endpoint where 50% of the placebo group had a rating of marked, severe, or extremely severe at endpoint versus 37% and 32% for the paliperidone palmitate 78 mg and 156 mg groups, respectively. Both paliperidone palmitate treatment doses were statistically superior to placebo in reducing CGI-S scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.004).</p><p>The third multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of paliperidone palmitate and placebo assessed efficacy, safety, and tolerability over a 13-week treatment period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-6-533">11</xref> Fixed doses of 39 mg, 78 mg, and 156 mg paliperidone palmitate versus placebo were administered as gluteal injections on days one and eight, and then every 4 weeks (days 36 and 64) in 518 adult patients. Patients participating in this study had similar eligibility as in prior studies, ie, meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia for at least 1 year. At enrollment, patients had a PANSS total score of 70&#x02013;120 with a BMI &#x0003e; 15.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Of the 518 randomized patients, only 263 (51%) patients completed the study. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-6-533">Table 2</xref>, all paliperidone palmitate dose groups showed significant improvement versus placebo in the primary efficacy measurement of PANSS.</p><p>Interestingly, a notable disparity was detected in the distribution of baseline BMI across participating countries, but not across treatment groups: 75% of United States patients were obese (BMI &#x0003c; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or overweight (BMI &#x0003c; 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to 42% of Romanian, 41% of Russian, 35% of Bulgarian, and 23% of South African participants.

Patients enrolled at sites outside the United States had greater improvements in PANSS total scores than those from sites in the United States. This finding indicated a trend towards differential treatment effect by BMI category. Based on pharmacokinetic data summarized earlier, this may have resulted in differences in plasma concentrations early in treatment.</p><p>The final efficacy and safety study of paliperidone palmitate was a 13-week investigation of 652 patients with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-6-533">12</xref> This was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, and placebo-controlled investigation where participants received paliperidone palmitate at 234 mg or placebo in the deltoid muscle on day one, with assigned fixed dose or placebo in the deltoid or gluteal muscle on day eight, and then once monthly. Patients participating in this study included patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia with total PANSS scores of 60&#x02013;120 at baseline. Patients with BMI &#x0003c; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded from this study. A total of 652 patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to each dose group of 39 mg, 156 mg, or 234 mg paliperidone palmitate or placebo. PANSS total score from baseline to endpoint improved significantly in all three dose groups versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.034). The mean PSP scores showed a dose-related improvement in the paliperidone palmitate treatment groups, which was significant in the 156 mg and 234 mg groups. Mean (SD) changes in PSP scores from baseline to endpoint were noted as follows: 2.9 (15.3) in the 39 mg group, 6.1 (13.6) in the 156 mg group, 8.3 (14.7) in the 234 mg group versus 1.7 (15.6) in the placebo group. A significant improvement in CGI-S scores was seen only in the paliperidone palmitate 156 mg and 234 mg groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.005).

The median time-to-relapse in the placebo group (50% of patients) was 163 days, and not estimable for paliperidone palmitate due to the small number of relapses observed (&#x0003c;25% of patients experienced a relapse). Relapse event rates were also significantly lower in the treatment group versus the placebo group (10% versus 34%, respectively). Of note, this study was terminated early by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee because of the robust findings identified in the interim efficacy results in favor of the paliperidone treatment group.</p><p>Patients from the above double-blind study who experienced a relapse remained relapse free until the double-blind study stopped early for efficacy, and those who completed the double-blind study were eligible for an open-label extension study of 52 weeks, which is the longest published study of paliperidone palmitate to date.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-6-533">14</xref> A total of 388 patients participated in this open-label extension and 288 patients (74%) completed the study. Patients received gluteal injections of paliperidone palmitate once every 4 weeks at a starting dose of 78 mg followed by 39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, or 156 mg flexible dosing. Improvements seen from baseline to endpoints were observed on PANSS, PSP scale, and CGI-S assessment. This study demonstrated improvements in PANSS total scores from baseline for patients treated with paliperidone palmitate (mean change &#x000b1; SD &#x02212;4.3 &#x000b1; 15.43).

Overall, 6% (n = 22) of patients discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy, and worsening of schizophrenia was reported by 6% of the patients. Of the 61% of patients (n = 235) who were continuously exposed to paliperidone palmitate from the start of the transition phase to the end of the open-label extension study, 70% had &#x0003e;1.5 years of continuous exposure and 33% had &#x0003e;2 years of continuous exposure. The most frequently used paliperidone palmitate dose was 156 mg.

Relapse occurred in 25% of patients in the paliperidone palmitate group and 18% of patients in the risperidone LAI group. The overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the paliperidone palmitate (76%) and risperidone LAI (79%) groups. In the efficacy comparison, paliperidone palmitate-treated participants demonstrated a less favorable response as compared to risperidone LAI; however, it is important to note that the doses of paliperidone palmitate used in this study may have been suboptimal or at least perhaps comparatively lower than risperidone LAI when conventional conversion estimates are applied.</p><p>The next comparative efficacy study was a 13-week international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose trial designed to assess noninferiority of paliperidone palmitate versus risperidone LAI in adult patients with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-6-533">16</xref> In this study, patients were randomized to receive either paliperidone palmitate or risperidone LAI. Patients received paliperidone 234 mg via deltoid intramuscular route on day one, 156 mg on day eight, and then once-monthly flexible doses. Risperidone LAI subjects received their first injection of 25 mg on day eight followed by a biweekly injection on days 22, 36, 50, 64, and 78. Risperidone LAI patients received 1&#x02013;6 mg/day oral risperidone on days 1&#x02013;28, whereas paliperidone palmitate patients received oral placebo. The mean (SD) PANSS total score change from baseline was similar in the two groups starting on day four: &#x02212;18.6 (15.45) in the paliperidone palmitate group and &#x02212;17.9 (14.24) in the risperidone LAI group. The primary and secondary efficacy findings of this study resulted in similar improvements in patients with acute schizophrenia. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (57.9% in the paliperidone palmitate group and 52.8% in the risperidone LAI group). The frequency of study drug discontinuation was low in both treatment groups (3% in the paliperidone palmitate group and 1.2% in the risperidone LAI group). Akathisia (both groups &#x0003c; 5%) and tremor (both groups &#x0003c; 3%) were the most commonly reported EPS-related adverse events, with no difference between the groups.

Risperidone LAI-treated patients received oral risperidone supplementation of 1&#x02013;6 mg/day at initiation, with risperidone LAI dose increases. The mean dose administered to individual patients throughout the study was 115.8 (range 87.5&#x02013;137.5) mEq (the mean dose of 115.8 mEq is equal to a dose of approximately 180 mg as measured by currently approved doses) for the paliperidone palmitate group and 29.8 mg (range 25&#x02013;37.5) for the risperidone LAI group.

In the four acute treatment studies, the paliperidone palmitate group (4%&#x02013;13%) gained &#x0003c;7% of their baseline bodyweight versus the placebo group (2%&#x02013;5%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-6-533">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-6-533">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-6-533">12</xref> The mean weight increase ranged from +0.4 kg to +1.9 kg on paliperidone palmitate versus &#x02212;0.3 to &#x02212;0.7 kg on placebo.

Many subjects at initial stabilization are switched from other antipsychotics that have weight gain that attenuates the degree of weight gain experienced during subsequent treatment as compared to that experienced by antipsychotic naive patients. Nonetheless, the weight gain estimates reported for paliperidone seem to place it in a low to moderate weight gain category relative to other commonly used antipsychotics, although direct comparison studies are needed to substantiate this categorization.</p></sec><sec><title>Prolactin levels</title><p>Paliperidone palmitate elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation in levels may persist during the maintenance phase due to D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-6-533">19</xref> Based on the pooled data from the four acute studies, elevated prolactin levels were common in the paliperidone palmitate treatment groups compared to the placebo groups and appeared to be dose-related.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-6-533">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-6-533">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-6-533">12</xref> Despite prolactin levels being elevated, side effects related to prolactin elevation were not commonly reported.

Conversions between oral paliperidone and paliperidone palmitate are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ppa-6-533">Table 3</xref>. The recommended initial regimen is a 234 mg injection on day one followed by 156 mg on day eight, each administered into the deltoid muscle. The reason for deltoid administration for the initiation dose is related to the pharmacokinetics of the release profile from this site early in treatment.

LAIs provide consistent drug delivery that is independent of a patient&#x02019;s ability or desire to take regularly scheduled oral medications. This minimizes the risk of a patient deliberately or inadvertently taking too much or too little medication and minimizes dosage deviations. In cases where patients fail to receive a scheduled injection, clinicians are able to immediately identify when interruptions in treatment begin. Similarly, in the context of symptom recurrence or exacerbation, examining a patient&#x02019;s LAI history can assist the clinician in ruling out nonadherence as a possible cause, thereby facilitating more informed decisions about subsequent therapeutic adjustments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ppa-6-533">21</xref></p><p>Many treatment providers mistakenly think that LAIs are undesirable to patients because of the need to get an injection or because of the stigma associated with an injection.

When LAIs are viewed as part of a treatment delivery program, as opposed to a direct pharmacologic intervention, they are often received as acceptable and desirable treatment options, even in patients who are receiving treatment during their &#x0201c;first episode.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ppa-6-533">22</xref></p><p>One of the most common challenges encountered in the management of patients with schizophrenia is nonadherence and the recognition and understanding of this phenomenon is important for clinicians as they strategize treatment plans and the potential role for LAI therapies. It is very common for patients to take their medications only intermittently or not at all. Poor and partial adherence to oral antipsychotics has been observed in 35% of patients as early as in the first 4&#x02013;6 weeks of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ppa-6-533">21</xref> The rate of nonadherence increases over time and within 2 years of hospital discharge, 75% of patients may be categorized as nonadherent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ppa-6-533">25</xref> Nonadherence is a multifactorial problem that may result from factors such as greater illness severity (ie, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits), poor patient and caregiver relationship or communication, substance abuse, medication-related side effects, and lack of insight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ppa-6-533">26</xref> Patients who lack insight into their illness are less likely to be engaged in treatment and are more likely to underestimate the benefits of medication and to discontinue prescribed therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ppa-6-533">27</xref> Inconsistency with medication exacerbates the multiple challenges that are already faced in the management of the patient with schizophrenia.

One advantage of the LAI formulation of paliperidone palmitate is that it can be used in an acute setting and it can simplify the medication regimen for patients and caregivers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ppa-6-533">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Patients with schizophrenia often do not conceptualize their symptoms in the same way as their treating clinician.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ppa-6-533">33</xref> Therefore, it is essential for clinicians to carefully assess and consider patient-focused perspectives such as insight into their illness, satisfaction with care, quality of life, and acceptability/understanding of the role of pharmacotherapy, including LAIs.

In general there appear to be many reports of the benefits of LAI antipsychotics, but also a number of studies showing no added benefit over oral medications.

However, there are only a few long-term trials assessing maintenance treatment thus far, and the dose-response relationships and strategies for converting from other treatments to paliperidone is an area for additional research. Efficacy appears to be similar to risperidone LAI and the overall tolerability profile seems to be in the mild to moderate range for most antipsychotic-associated side effects, with the exception of prolactin elevation which is very common for paliperidone.</p><p>Paliperidone palmitate offers several advantages relative to other available LAI antipsychotics: it can be used as an acute treatment in the outpatient setting, and it has been shown to be well tolerated by patients. Also, it does not require overlapping oral antipsychotic supplementation while it is being initiated, and it offers the convenience of once-monthly administration. The injection volume is small and it offers dosing flexibility. It also gives the patient an option to receive the injection via the deltoid or gluteal route.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-6-533">7</xref> However, one of the challenges of this LAI would be the uncertainties for achieving an optimal dosing regimen based on the clinical data available.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Dr Bishop is supported by grant K08MH083888.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ppa-6-533"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Shiyun Kim and Hugo Solari report no conflicts of interest in this work.
