The LV lead was placed in the venous system in the lateral or posterolateral vein preferably. The right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) leads were positioned at the RA appendage, and the RV apex. LV leads were connected to the corresponding CRT-D device.

In the QUAD group, optimization of LVPCs was performed for all patients at predischarge and for nonresponders at 3 months follow-up. No optimization of LVPC was performed in the CONV group at predischarge or during follow-up.

Our results showed that: choosing the LVPCs associated with the shortest biventricular paced QRS duration is feasible in CRT device programming; biventricular pacing using quadripolar leads with optimized LVPCs is superior to conventional bipolar leads based on 6-month echocardiographic and clinical outcomes; reselection a LVPS for nonresponders during follow-up is promising to further improve response to CRT.</p><p>Response to biventricular pacing may vary according to the site of LV pacing. Some studies demonstrated that the mid-ventricular and basal portions of the lateral LV wall were associated with the best response.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Other studies showed that pacing at sites of late LV electrical or mechanical delay is associated with better reverse remodeling response, quality of life, and clinical outcomes, regardless of lead position.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> However, for patients implanted with a conventional unipolar LV lead, the LV pacing site cannot be changed after implant. However, the quadripolar LV lead Quartet offers 10 different pacing configurations, with a wider possibility of CRT device reprogramming. Although it is well-recognized that changes in LVPCs can be associated with a lower pacing threshold or with avoidance of PNS.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, there is paucity on data about the potential benefit of the Quartet leads in terms of clinical and echocardiographic response to CRT.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Bencardino et al<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> recently found that selecting a better LVPC with quadripolar leads on the basis of QRS shortening was associated with an improvement of LVEF greater than that observed in patients receiving a bipolar LV lead. In our study, we found that at 3 months follow-up, LVESV reduction, LVEF increase, and NYHA functional class reduction relative to BASELINE favored the QUAD group, although it was not statistically significant. Our results, together with findings of previous studies, emphasized that choosing a LVPC with quadripolar leads on the basis of QRS shortening was feasible to improve response to CRT.</p><p>Previous studies focused on choosing the best LVPC at implant or predischarge to improve response to CRT. However, little attention was paid to optimize LVPC during follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the incremental clinical benefits by optimizing LVPS for nonresponders during follow-up. In our study, we reselected a LVPS for the 3-month nonresponders in the QUAD group and found that more nonresponders were converted into responders in the QUAD group (4/8, 50%) compared with that in the CONV group (2/9, 22%) at 6 months follow-up. Moreover, LVESV reduction and LVEF increase at 6 months relative to BASELINE favored the QUAD group in these 3-month nonresponders.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that characteristics of the LV pacing region strongly influence response to CRT, and delivering the LV lead to viable myocardium is a prerequisite for response to occur.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> The position of myocardial scar may influence the response to CRT because scars prevent progression of the activation wavefront and the synchronized engagement of viable tissue.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> One previous study found that without image guidance, the delivery of LV lead to a scarred myocardial region occurs in 13% of cases, with 75% of these patients failing to respond to CRT.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we hypothesize that reselecting a LVPS for the 3-month nonresponders may offer a chance to pace on the region of viable myocardium rather than the region of scar, thereby acquiring more fast and synchronized LV depolarization. Our following study will test this hypothesis by analyzing the distribution of scar on LV and the relationship with LV-pacing electrodes.</p><p>In our study, we used a &#x0201c;tailored approach&#x0201d; in the LVPC optimization in the QUAD group, in which the optimal LVPC for CRT was determined by the response status to CRT, the viable LVPC, and the shortest-paced QRS duration. We found that at 3-month follow-up, LVESV reduction, LVEF increase, and NYHA functional class reduction relative to BASELINE favored the QUAD group, but was not statistically significant. However, after optimization of LVPC for the nonresponders at 3 months, patients randomized to receive quadripolar leads had greater reduction in LVESV, improvement in LVEF, and reduction in NYHA class than patients randomized to receive conventional bipolar leads at 6 months follow-up. Considering the other parameters associated with response to CRT (ie, female sex, presence of LBBB, QRS duration, HF etiology, and position of LV leads) are comparable between the 2 groups, we think that the advantage of quadripolar leads over conventional bipolar leads come from repetitive LVPC optimization. Larger, multicenter studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to further clarify the effect of this &#x0201c;tailored approach&#x0201d; on CRT response.</p><p>Although LVPC optimization of bipolar LV lead might be possible and may improve CRT response in theory, there are several reasons we did not perform the LVPC optimization in the CONV group. First, we found that limited LVPCs could be selected for bipolar leads in clinical practice due to PNS or unsatisfied threshold. Second, we found in our practice that these unconventional pacing configurations were associated with a wider QRS in almost all the patients, which is consistent with the findings reported by Bencardino et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Finally, priority selection of conventional pacing configuration is an established practice for LVPC programming,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> and the purpose of this study was to compare the value of CRT with or without LVPC optimization.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations in this study must be considered. Firstly, this was a single-center study with relatively small sample size. However, significant differences were found in LVEF improvement and LVESV reduction, and NYHA functional class between the 2 groups. Secondly, 1 patient was lost during follow-up, although it may not affect our analysis. Thirdly, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic measurements can suffer from inter and intraobserver variability. To minimize this limitation, examinations were performed and analyzed by 1 blinded operator. In addition, we did not use other optimization programs (ie, V-V interval optimization) during the study period to avoid more confounders to our results. CRT response might be improved by V-V interval optimization in some nonresponders. Finally, the study included data from a single quadripolar lead design as the Quartet was the only commercially available quadripolar lead in China at the time data were collected. The results of this study may not be applicable to other quadripolar lead designs now in the market.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with conventional bipolar leads, CRT using quadripolar leads with repetitive optimized LVPCs resulted in an additional increase in LVEF, and reduction in LVESV and NYHA functional class at 6 months follow-up.
