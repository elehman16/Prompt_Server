However, current support systems in Australia are disjointed, inaccessible to all, poorly coordinated, and focus on dysfunction rather than ability. Support workers for people with dementia are in short supply, and there is little consistency in their roles. To address this large service gap and unmet need, we have developed an evidence-based optimized model of holistic support for people with dementia and their carers and families. This article describes the &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; model intervention.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>A stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted over 3&#x02009;years across three Australian states. One hundred participants with dementia and/or their carers/family members will be randomly selected from community health center client lists in each state to receive either the dementia &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; intervention (Group A) or routine care (Group B). Group A participants will have access to the intervention from year 1. Group B participants will continue to receive usual care and will not be denied information on dementia or dementia services in year 1. In year 2, Group B participants will have access to the intervention. A highly trained expert dementia support worker will provide the &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; intervention, which is a flexible, individually tailored, holistic support that is relationship-centered, focused on enablement as opposed to dysfunction, and facilitate participants&#x02019; continued engagement in their community and the workforce. Additionally, dementia education, information resources, advocacy, and practical support to navigate and access dementia services and health care will be provided. The mode of support will include face to face, telephone, and internet interaction on an &#x0201c;as needed basis&#x0201d; for 12&#x02009;months. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will improve the quality of life of people with dementia and the health and well-being of carers/family through facilitating the continuation and enhancement of regular daily activities. Secondary hypotheses will examine other health and service usage outcomes. The outputs will also include a health economic analysis to investigate the costs (and savings) of any associated reduction in unnecessary health services use and delay in accessing permanent residential aged care.</p></sec><sec id="ST3"><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12616000927426p.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>carer support</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>well-being</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>protocol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6612"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction: Background and Rationale</title><p>Models of support to assist people with dementia and their carers to adjust to living with memory loss, to navigate the health and aged care system, and to access services, information, and support have recently been implemented both in Australia and overseas. However, there has been little high level evaluation of these services prior to a recent project that evaluated the effectiveness of the support worker role through a systematic review of international literature of support workers and models of support workers operating across Australia (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This study was undertaken by members of the National Health and Medical Research Center (NHMRC) Cognitive Decline Partnership Center (CDPC) using a codesign approach involving consumers, industry partners, policy makers, and researchers to ensure a wide range of perspectives, including those of people with dementia, carer&#x02019;s, and those working in the aged care industry (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Findings from the CDPC project demonstrated that, although the dementia support worker role is highly valued, the current support system for people with dementia, their carers, and families is based on a biomedical model, is disjointed, poorly coordinated, and focuses on dysfunction and not on what people with dementia can still achieve. Additionally, no one service delivery model is accessible for people of all ages, diverse needs, or geographic locations. Our results also revealed insufficient numbers of support workers, support workers having high case loads that lead to them being time poor and experiencing burn out, and a lack of appropriate services available in the community to assist people with dementia and their families and carers to continue to undertake many of the regular activities of their daily life or actively engage in their community (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Differences in available services were also dependent on the location of the service, such as the state in which the service was located and whether it was in a rural or metropolitan area (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). To address these gaps in services and the unmet needs of people with dementia and their carers and families, we have used the results from a systematic review of international models of support workers, an evaluation of Australian key worker models, and the perspectives of people with dementia and their carers to develop an optimized evidence-based support model (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Our evidence-based optimized dementia support worker model &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; is underpinned by an overarching philosophy that incorporates the four key themes: relationship-centered, enablement, holistic, and accessible. It articulates three components necessary to address current shortcomings: the necessary organizational context in which dementia support workers are able to operate autonomously, the definition of the role and what activities a dementia support worker role undertakes, and the competencies that are required to carry out the role successfully (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>As no previous Australian studies have demonstrated, high level evidence of the efficacy of a consumer-directed dementia support worker model that focuses on enablement and meeting the individual needs of people with dementia and their carers/family members, we propose to test the efficacy of our optimized dementia support worker model by way of a cluster stepped wedge randomized controlled trial (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>This cluster stepped wedge randomized controlled trial will be the first Australian study to measure the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the dementia support worker model. It is anticipated that this trial will provide high quality evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a tailored, holistic, flexible, single service, and consistent approach to supporting people with dementia and their families and carers that promotes their well-being through the integration of services and health care, provision of emotional support, and enabling/encouraging them to remain actively engaged in the community.</p><sec id="S1-1"><title>Explanation for Choice of Comparators</title><p>The design was developed to combine the rigor of a cluster randomized trial with the pragmatic approach of the stepped wedge design to implement the intervention at all sites (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S1-2"><title>Objectives</title><p>To trial an optimized model, the &#x0201c;<italic>Support for life</italic>&#x0201d; program, based on the findings from the NHMRC CDPC evaluation that investigated the provision of support to people with dementia and their carers to address current shortcomings in support for people with dementia and their carers/families.</p><p>The &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; trial will be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team with extensive track records in all key areas of the project. This team combines expertise in dementia knowledge, translation knowledge, provision of support, and delivery of health services to people experiencing memory problems, cognitive impairment, or dementia; and research methods including randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The team will also have access to expert health economic, policy and research design through the CDPC enabling subunits, consumers and consumer representation through the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Australia Consumer Dementia Research Network (CDRN) and statistical advice from the RDNS Institute statistician.</p><p>The &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; program is a whole of family approach to support that will assist people with dementia, their carers, and families to identify services that meet their individual need and offer them greater control and choice to continue to live and engage in life as fully as possible. This will help ensure that these services/supports include opportunities for people with dementia to have full access to &#x0201c;life activities&#x0201d; such as employment and recreation. Support will also focus on providing family members and/or carers the ability to actively participate in society and not be disadvantaged by their caring role. Active participation may mean continuing to work, attend school, university, and receiving appropriate support in these environments. To adhere to the overarching relationship-centered, enablement, holistic, and accessible principles that underpin the &#x0201c;<italic>Support for Life</italic>&#x0201d; program, workers providing support to people with dementia and their carers/families will

Overall, there are 30 clusters participating, 10&#x02009;clusters in each state, and so the above figure shows the design that is replicated in each state. In each cluster, we aim to recruit 10 study participants having dementia or cognitive impairment, making the overall recruitment target at 300 participants. Data are collected from all participants during the seven data collection time points shown by a dashed-line in the above figure (i.e., at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24&#x02009;months). We expect an attrition rate of 20 percent; therefore, we expect approximately 240 participants with dementia or cognitive impairment and approximately 1,680 participant data points to be examined in this SWcRCT. Attrition is expected to occur at any time point, and the modeling will include all participant data; participant data may be complete (available from all seven time points) or incomplete (available from one to six time points). The intensive intervention phase is shown in dark blue. The post-intervention phase is shown in light-blue (this is the second year for the year 1 intervention group), where participants can still access the intervention, but the intervention will no longer be promoted at those clusters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpubh-04-00245-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><bold>Primary outcomes</bold> (baseline, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24&#x02009;months)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Person with dementia</italic>

Descriptive data on both groups will be reported including demographics, stratification variables, baseline measures, and number of times intervention was accessed. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the characteristics of all participants including carers and family members. Deterioration of the primary outcome measure in individuals due to increasing dementia severity/aging and occurring over the 2-year data collection period will be explored using multivariate analyses (including factors: intervention status, age, and gender). If the dementia severity/aging factor is found to be significant, it will be included in the main models described below.</p><p>A linear mixed effects model will be used to compare the intervention and usual care periods for continuous outcomes and generalized linear mixed effects model for binary outcomes. The model will include intervention status and time as fixed effects and cluster site and individuals as random effects. Where appropriate, cluster and individual factors strongly correlated with the outcome will also be included as fixed effects in the model. These may include the stratification variables, e.g., socioeconomic status of area. The estimated intervention effect will be reported as the mean outcome difference for continuous outcomes and odds ratio for binary outcomes between intervention and control periods, assuming a constant treatment effect over time. The estimated intervention effects will be reported with 95% CIs and <italic>p</italic>-values.

Every effort will be made to minimize missing outcome data at each wave, and reasons individuals are lost to follow-up will be recorded. A missing data analysis will seek to identify systematic patterns of missing data and identify instances where, despite the efforts of the research team, data may be missing not at random (MNAR). Whether or not data are identified as MNAR, for each primary outcome and other key variables with missing data, multiple imputation using multivariate regression with factors of age, gender, state, and time will produce 100 estimates for each missing item &#x02013; supporting optimal statistical estimation. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the missing data assumption made in the primary analysis. A detailed analysis plan will be developed for secondary and sensitivity analyses.</p><sec id="S5-4-1"><title>Qualitative Analysis</title><p>Interview transcripts and journal entries will be managed using QSR NVivo (Qualitative Solutions and Research, Melbourne, Victoria).

Health-care resource use will be costed for each participant using administrative data or data collected using the RUD instrument by multiplying use by appropriate unit costs sourced from government databases. These include Medicare for items such as GP and specialist visits, PBS for medications, and National Hospital Cost data reports for hospital and ED presentations. Community care will be costed using administrative data from the RDNS. Costs over 12&#x02009;months will be compared between groups using a generalized linear model, which is able to account for the non-normal distribution of cost data. Cost of carer time will be accounted for using a proxy good method (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) to recognize the value of unpaid caregiving duties. Costs will be reported by sector (health, community, and type of participant) in order to understand the implications of the intervention to different interest groups and sectors.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome for the economic analysis is the quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Utility values will be derived from the CES, and EQ-5D-5L will be used to construct QALYs over 12&#x02009;months using an area under the curve analysis. QALYs for both the carer and the participant will be combined for use in a cost&#x02013;utility analysis. Research is currently underway to develop an algorithm for estimating utility values from the QOL-AD (CI Comans), and if an algorithm is available, QALYs will also be estimated from this instrument and compared with the values obtained from the generic EQ-5D-5L instrument.</p><p>Cost and QALYs will be combined into an Incremental Cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The analysis will be over 12&#x02009;months to match the trial duration and will take a limited societal perspective in order to incorporate the costs and outcomes of the carers and participants as well as the health-care costs and outcomes. Uncertainty in the cost&#x02013;utility results will be estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and represented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Methods: Monitoring Fidelity of the Intervention/Adherence to the Protocol</title><p>An advisory and data monitoring committee (ADMC) will be established for the study and a protocol prepared to provide guidance to the study research team.
