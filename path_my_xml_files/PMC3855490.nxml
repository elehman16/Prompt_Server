The use of long-acting insulin analogues has been shown to reduce rates of hypoglycaemia, particularly at night and in individuals aiming for tight glycaemic control to minimise the risk of long-term complications. Despite this improvement, the annual prevalence of hypoglycaemia still remains between 30% and 40% in patients with type 1 diabetes. Nearly 50% of well-controlled individuals with longstanding type 1 diabetes experience at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode over 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Severe episodes of hypoglycaemia are less frequent in patients with diabetes who still have hypoglycaemia awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but these patients are still at significant risk of hypoglycaemia due to lack of adequate glucagon secretion and a reduced response of other counter-regulatory hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, with a longer duration of type 1 diabetes the risk for hypoglycaemia increases and hypoglycaemia awareness becomes reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the risk of severe hypoglycaemia is partly related to impaired release of counter-regulatory hormones, the main clinical cause is inappropriately high insulin levels at vulnerable time points. Insulin degludec (Des(B30)LysB29(&#x003b3;-Glu N&#x003b5;-hexadecandioyl) human insulin; IDeg) is a new ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue with an extended duration of action beyond 42&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], a flat insulin profile with once-daily dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and lower intrapatient variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Using IDeg, insulin-naive and insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes showed a significantly reduced risk of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; in patients with type 1 diabetes, a similar result regarding nocturnal hypoglycaemia was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. New insulin analogues with a very long action profile carry the potential risk of prolonged hypoglycaemia. This is particularly important in type 1 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is increased even further by poor hormonal counter-regulation and deteriorating hypoglycaemia awareness. Insulin analogues for type 1 diabetes therapy should thus be tested to ensure they are not associated with a further impairment of the remaining counter-regulation. To investigate the symptomatic, cognitive and counter-regulatory hormone response to hypoglycaemia induced by IDeg compared with that of an existing, clinically well-established, long-acting basal insulin, insulin glargine (A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin; IGlar), we performed a double-blind randomised crossover study in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="d30e362"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>We enrolled patients with type 1 diabetes between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years of age who were considered to still have hypoglycaemia awareness and were not suffering from any other comorbidities. Patients had a BMI between 18.0 and 28.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, an HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 6.7% (50&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and 10.0% (86&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and a total daily insulin dose below 1.2&#x000a0;U/kg (basal insulin &#x02265;0.2&#x000a0;U/kg). Key exclusion criteria were: prior IGlar therapy (within 3&#x000a0;months of screening); recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (more than one severe hypoglycaemic event during the last 12&#x000a0;months); hypoglycaemia unawareness (as judged by the medical investigator); pregnancy; impaired renal or hepatic function; impaired vision; and cardiac disease. All participants gave signed informed consent before participating in any trial activities. The trial was performed after approval by the local ethics committee and according to good clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="d30e379"><title>Trial design</title><p>This double-blind randomised crossover trial was designed to compare the development of symptomatic, cognitive and counter-regulatory hormone response to acute hypoglycaemia induced by IDeg or IGlar in adults with type 1 diabetes. Patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with subcutaneous injections of either IDeg (Tresiba, 100&#x000a0;U/ml 3&#x000a0;ml Penfill cartridges [Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark]) or IGlar (Lantus, 100&#x000a0;U/ml, 3&#x000a0;ml cartridges [Sanofi, Paris, France]) once daily for a run-in period of 5&#x000a0;days over two separate treatment periods, with a wash-out period of 13&#x02013;21&#x000a0;days between periods (during which usual insulin therapy was resumed). Patients were assigned the lowest available randomisation number from a set of blinded randomisation codes provided by the sponsor (Novo Nordisk).</p><p>A run-in period of 5&#x000a0;days was based on model calculations indicating that stable steady-state levels for both insulins were achieved within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days of once-daily dosing. Two days were added during which patients were at steady state, resulting in a total run-in period of 5&#x000a0;days. During the 5&#x000a0;day run-in period, each patient was asked to provide at least four plasma glucose (PG) measurements per day and to record any hypoglycaemic events. Patients were required to attend the clinic on each day for administration of the trial insulin. All injections were performed by a person not otherwise involved with the study to keep the double-blind character of the trial. Sequence allocation was carried out according to a computer-generated randomisation list. During the treatment periods, insulin aspart (B28Asp human insulin) (NovoRapid, 100&#x000a0;U/ml [Novo Nordisk]; available as a 3&#x000a0;ml FlexPen) was administered as bolus insulin. During the first 4&#x000a0;days of each treatment period, the basal insulin dose was set to 80% of the patients&#x02019; total daily basal insulin dose to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, and dose levels remained the same during both treatment periods. Insulin was administered s.c. in the thigh at approximately 20:00&#x000a0;hours on days 1&#x02013;4 in each treatment period. On day 5 the stepwise hypoglycaemic glucose clamp procedure was started. Patients were admitted to the clinic before 20:00&#x000a0;hours for an in-house stay of at least 50&#x000a0;h. At the discretion of the investigator, patients stayed at the clinic to ensure stabilisation of blood glucose values after completion of glucose clamp procedures.</p></sec><sec id="d30e386"><title>Stepwise hypoglycaemic glucose clamp procedure</title><p>We were able to initiate the hypoglycaemic glucose clamp procedure as planned in all patients as no patients had experienced any hypoglycaemic episodes (PG &#x02264;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l) during the previous 24&#x000a0;h. To achieve a PG target of 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/l (&#x000b1;30%) for the run-in period of 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h, patients received a variable intravenous glucose infusion (10%; Braun Infusomat FM; Melsungen, Germany) or human soluble insulin infusion (40&#x000a0;U Actrapid [100&#x000a0;U/ml] in 99.6&#x000a0;ml NaCl [154&#x000a0;mmol/l]) which was initiated at approximately 22:00&#x000a0;hours. To facilitate hypoglycaemia induction, a three-times-higher basal insulin dose was administered at midnight (range of timing &#x000b1;3&#x000a0;min), replacing the regular basal insulin dose given at 20:00&#x000a0;hours (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After the midnight dosing, insulin infusion was stopped when glucose levels had dropped by approximately 0.3&#x000a0;mmol/l (5&#x000a0;mg/dl). At 30&#x000a0;min prior to hypoglycaemia induction (in the morning), PG was maintained at 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/l but with a deviation of only &#x000b1;10%. Patients remained fasting in a supine or semi-supine position throughout the hypoglycaemic glucose clamp procedure, except when cognitive function tests were performed. Glucose infusion was stopped to induce hypoglycaemia. PG was allowed to decrease to target levels of 3.5 and 2.5&#x000a0;mmol/l (nadir) in a stepwise fashion. Variable glucose infusion was resumed at each step to maintain PG at the target level for fixed periods of 30 and 15&#x000a0;min, respectively. Controlled recovery from hypoglycaemia was initiated after the nadir period. Glucose was infused at a fixed rate of 5.5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> until PG reached the recovery target of 3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l.

No clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG or safety laboratory variables from screening to follow-up were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to examine how the ultra-long-acting basal insulin IDeg (estimated duration of action &#x0003e;42&#x000a0;h) affects the hypoglycaemic response during development of, and recovery from, hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. The results indicate that there are no marked differences in hypoglycaemic response or hypoglycaemic awareness induced by IDeg compared with the long-acting basal insulin IGlar. Similar effects on hypoglycaemic symptom and cognitive function scores during hypoglycaemia induction, PG nadir and recovery from hypoglycaemia were observed with both insulins. One interesting observation was a modest effect in enhancing some of the counter-regulatory hormone responses around the glucose nadir with IDeg, and a lower glucose infusion rate during recovery with IDeg compared with IGlar; however, this had no obvious effect on the HSS or cognitive function.</p><p>The main strengths of this trial relative to other hypoglycaemic experimental designs include the extensive measurement of symptomatic, cognitive and counter-regulatory hormonal responses and the double-blind crossover design, which eliminates potential investigator and patient bias as well as inter-patient variability. Given that IDeg has a duration of action &#x0003e;42&#x000a0;h, we considered it important to characterise how recovery from hypoglycaemia induced by IDeg develops with respect to the increase in PG and the persistence of symptoms and effects on cognitive function in advance of the introduction of IDeg into clinical practice. Finally, we included people with type 1 diabetes, rather than healthy patients, to ensure the pharmacodynamic response was not confounded by endogenous insulin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, intrapatient variability is likely to be lower in type 1 diabetes because of the lack of substantial endogenous insulin production. Though we recognise that a degree of hypoglycaemia unawareness is inevitable in a study population with an average diabetes duration of 21&#x000a0;years and is a study limitation, our main goal was to assess the counter-regulation in a clinically relevant type 1 diabetes population. Results, particularly from HSS, indicate sufficient hypoglycaemia awareness in all participating patients. Patients with severe hypoglycaemia unawareness were excluded from the study altogether.</p><p>We used a stepwise hypoglycaemic clamp technique using s.c. delivery in an attempt to achieve highly standardised study conditions to compare physiological and counter-regulatory responses with IDeg and IGlar. Although experimental hypoglycaemic studies involving other basal insulins have generally used a model incorporating i.v. delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we considered s.c. administration more appropriate. This approach is more clinically relevant, particularly as the mode of protraction for both IDeg and IGlar is activated by s.c. administration. We attempted to standardise trial conditions by administering IDeg and IGlar at midnight, approximately 7&#x000a0;h prior to inducing hypoglycaemia. A dose three times higher than the patient&#x02019;s regular insulin dose was administered on day 5 to try to achieve an appropriately low glucose target. The design was based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of existing data for both insulins. Thus, we set out to control for differing glycaemia, and to achieve comparability despite the use of two insulins with different action profiles. The delay in initiating hypoglycaemia (by maintaining patients in a euglycaemic clamp) until 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h after administration of trial insulin was designed to control for differences in depth and duration of hypoglycaemia, and to control for the fall in glucose towards the hypoglycaemic plateau. However, variable glucose infusion rates during the clamp procedure tended to be lower with IDeg than IGlar, particularly at baseline (7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h post dosing) and during the recovery phase. Therefore, we cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the relation between the observed differences in counter-regulatory hormone responses and in particular the rate of glucose recovery.</p><p>While the intensity of the hypoglycaemic response is multifactorial, important determinants are probably prior glycaemic experience, absolute PG level and the rate of PG decline. The comparable self-measured PG profiles and number of hypoglycaemic episodes suggest that glucose control was similar for IDeg and IGlar during the 5&#x000a0;days leading up to the hypoglycaemic clamp experiment. Moreover, in this trial, mean PG was similar with IDeg and IGlar throughout the hypoglycaemic clamp procedure. The rate of decline during hypoglycaemic induction was identical for both insulins once PG fell below 4.5&#x000a0;mmol/l, suggesting that the hypoglycaemic stimulus was comparable during clamp procedures. This is an important criterion for comparing the response between the two insulins.</p><p>We observed moderate differences in counter-regulatory hormone responses (as measured by the rate of increase, AUC and hormone level at PG nadir) during the development of hypoglycaemia for three of the five counter-regulatory hormones (adrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol) when induced with IDeg compared with IGlar; however, the underlying mechanism for the observed differences could not be identified in this study. As glucagon responses to hypoglycaemia are attenuated by both type 1 diabetes and hyperinsulinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it is not surprising that no differences in glucagon response were observed. Elevated cortisol levels have been associated with autonomic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] but more recent studies could not confirm this finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Enhanced counter-regulatory hormone response might contribute to a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, an important limiting factor in achieving good glycaemic control with intensified insulin therapy.</p><p>Although basal insulins such as IGlar are associated with a reduction in severe and nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], this appears to be due to improvements in insulin kinetics rather than to differences in glucose counter-regulation. Comparable physiological responses to induced hypoglycaemia have been shown for IGlar and human insulin in a stepped hypoglycaemic clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and clinical trials have shown comparable glycaemic control with IDeg and IGlar when treated to target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, results from the large-scale confirmatory clinical trials provide promising evidence of a lower risk of hypoglycaemia with IDeg compared with IGlar, particularly at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this trial provides reassuring data regarding the response to hypoglycaemia association with IDeg. IDeg and IGlar elicit comparable symptomatic and cognitive responses to induced hypoglycaemia, and recovery from hypoglycaemia remains similar. Furthermore, our trial suggests that IDeg may elicit a more pronounced endocrine response to hypoglycaemia than IGlar, albeit modest. Whether this translates into a clinically relevant difference cannot be answered by our trial. Adequately powered randomised multicentre studies in clinical settings are needed to establish the relevance of the effects of this new insulin on hypoglycaemia awareness, glucose counter-regulation and particularly rates of severe hypoglycaemia among individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CLIA</term><def><p>Chemiluminescent immunoassay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSS</term><def><p>Hypoglycaemic symptom score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDeg</term><def><p>Insulin degludec</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGlar</term><def><p>Insulin glargine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PG</term><def><p>Plasma glucose</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the investigators, trial staff and participants for their participation.
