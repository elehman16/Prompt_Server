Increasing evidence indicates that green tea extracts as well as their main component, the polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has multiple health benefits, such as the anti-stress, anticancer and antioxidants effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particularly, a recent investigation found that higher consumption of green tea led to a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, a preclinical study demonstrated that green tea exerted antidepressant-like effects in a mouse behavioral models of depression, and the mechanism may involve inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These findings suggested that there might be a link between green tea consumption and the depressive symptoms. However, the underlying mechanism mediating in the treatment of green tea for depression in the clinic is poorly investigated.</p><p>Anhedonia is a core characteristic usually seen in depressed patients and is widely used to evaluate the treatment outcome of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Impairment of reward learning is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders in humans including depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Anhedonia is also linked with reduced pleasure, altered motivation and disturbed reward learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additionally, the reduced reward function was associated with the persistence of anhedonia in depressed subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We hypothesize that chronic treatment with green tea would improve the reward learning compared with control subjects.</p><p>The monetary incentive delay (MID) task is usually used to assess the effort-related aspects of central reward processing for investigations of the relationship between depressive behavior and impairments in reward learning in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that green tea might play a critical role in modulation of reward learning and contribute to the phenotype of depressive symptom. The major goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of green tea on reward learning and clinical outcome of depression after 5&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Shandong University (No. 1031). Before enrolment, participants underwent thorough screening, including a medical history interview, physical examination, typical tea consumption patterns, and clinical laboratory tests (including ECG and blood chemistry). The exclusion criteria were current or past history of psychotic disorders, a history of substance abuse or dependence, a history of neurological illness (sleeping disorder, epilepsy) or history of severe heart failure, abnormal ECG or other laboratory findings, and daily intake of tea more than three cups. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) were used to assess the depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The participants were randomly divided into either green tea or placebo treatment group using random numbers when enrolled. The subjects were asked to take one package containing 400 mg of either green tea or cellulose three times each day for 5weeks. The placebo given to the control group comprised pure microcrystalline cellulose. It has been indicated from clinical pharmacokinetic and animal toxicological reports that consumption of green tea concentrated extracts on an empty stomach is more likely to lead to adverse effects than consumption in the fed state. Therefore, the package of green tea powder was dissolved in hot water and was taken 30min after each meal (three times per day) in the current investigation. The main chemical components of green tea are polyphenols (up to 20% and more of the dry weight) and caffeine (2-5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

On incentive trials, participants could win or avoid losing money by pressing the button during target presentation. When the target was pushed in a rewarding trial, participants earned 1 Yuan. Subjects were informed that they would receive one-third of the money they won during the MID in each session after completion of the study. Twelve practice trials were used to determine the shortest reaction time to a target of the subjects. The presentation time of the target was regulated according to the practice data to ascertain an equal feedback response and a similar total monetary reward for all subjects. The reaction time (ms) to reward and no-reward stimuli were recorded by the computer during each trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>The written informed consent was sent to the participants before the study.

The green tea powder and the placebo (pure microcrystalline cellulose) were packed at the weight of 400 mg of each package. The green tea powder or placebo was dissolved in hot water and was taken 30 min after each meal (three times per day) for consecutive five weeks.

A previous study a mouse behavioral model showed that green tea exerts antidepressant-like effects, and the underlying mechanism may involve inhibition of the HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Psychological stress activated HPA which resulted in the increasing release of glucocorticoids. It was also found that EGCG also could ameliorate the cognitive impairments induced by psychological stress possibly related with the declining glucocorticoids levels and the increasing contents of catecholamines and 5-HT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Whether the increased reward-learning activity induced by chronic green tea administration is due to the regulation on neuroendocrinology systems, such as HPA function, requires future investigation.</p><p>Regular dietary intake of green tea can maintain a stable concentration in the body and may have valuable effects on health. However, drinking a beverage containing green tea extract too much can lead to hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The hepatotoxicity is probably due to EGCG or its metabolites which, under particular conditions related to the patient's metabolism, can induce oxidative stress in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Therefore, the toxicity should be taken into consideration in the condition of high oral consumption of green tea polyphenols. Additionally, the baseline amount of tea consumed in participants was screened before enrolment, and the participants whose daily intake of tea was more than three cups were excluded from the study. In the current study, the difference of baseline amount of tea in two groups was not significant. Therefore, the data in this experiment cannot be explained by an under measurement of effect.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that chronic treatment of green tea increased reward learning compared with placebo in monetary incentive delay task and reduced total scores in Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Reward-learning deficits contributed to the anhedonic symptoms and the treatment outcome of depression. The current findings suggest that reduced reward learning might associate with the presence of depression. The regulatory role of green tea on the reward learning raised the potential for development of new treatments for depression by selecting complementary options.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>MID: Monetary incentive delay; MADRS: Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale; HRSD-17: 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ZQY and LAW designed research, performed the statistical analysis and wrote the draft.
