The most important consequences of SSIs are prolonged hospitalization, an increased risk of surgical reintervention and an increase in mortality. Perioperative intravenously administered antibiotic prophylaxis is the standard of care to reduce the risk of SSIs. In the last few decades, preoperative orally administered antibiotics have been suggested as additional prophylaxis to further reduce the risk of infection, but are currently not part of routine practice in most hospitals. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a preoperative orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis (Pre-OP) in addition to intravenously administered perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of deep SSIs and/or mortality after elective colorectal surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">The PreCaution trial is designed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will be carried out in The Netherlands. Adult patients who are scheduled for elective colorectal surgery are eligible to participate. In total, 966 patients will be randomized to receive the study medication. This will either be Pre-OP, a solution that consists of tobramycin and colistin sulphate, or a placebo solution. The study medication will be administered four times daily during the 3&#x000a0;days prior to surgery. Perioperative intravenously administered antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered to all patients in accordance with national infection control guidelines. The primary endpoint of the study is the cumulative incidence of deep SSIs and/or mortality within 30&#x000a0;days after surgery. Secondary endpoints include both infectious and non-infectious complications of colorectal surgery, and will be evaluated 30&#x000a0;days and/or 6&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">To date, conclusive evidence on the added value of preoperative orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery is lacking.

SSIs are associated with extended hospitalization and are an important source of readmissions and surgical reintervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Relative to other surgical procedures, the incidence of SSIs is highest after colorectal resections, affecting up to 15% of all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite extensive efforts that have been made in improving infection control practice, the incidence of SSIs after colorectal surgery remains unaffectedly high, whereas the incidence appears to have declined in other surgical specialties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This persisting infection rate highlights the need to explore novel measures to reduce SSIs after colorectal procedures.</p><p id="Par21">To establish new infection prevention measures, it is important to understand the pathogenesis of SSIs. The development of these infections is preceded by microbial contamination of the surgical site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The colon and rectum are densely colonized by microorganisms which explains the high postoperative infection rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as the finding that the microorganisms that are most frequently isolated from colorectal SSIs are also the colonizing species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">An important measure to reduce the risk of postoperative infections is to intravenously administer perioperative prophylactic antibiotics that cover these species, conforming to the national infection control guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For colorectal surgery, orally administered antibiotics can be applied in addition to the intravenously administered prophylaxis. This prophylaxis contains non-absorbable antibiotics, such as neomycin combined with erythromycin or metronidazole, that are administered 1 to 2&#x000a0;days prior to the surgical procedure. The non-absorbable nature of these antibiotics implies almost complete absence of systemic uptake after oral intake. The antibiotics, therefore, only exert local activity in the gastrointestinal tract with low risks of side effects. The rationale of combining systemic and oral prophylaxis is that orally administered antibiotics reduce the colonic bacterial contamination levels directly at the surgical site, whereas systemic antibiotics are used as a safeguard by establishing effective antibiotic concentrations in the soft tissues to minimize the risk of infection and to prevent perioperative endotoxinemia. Despite the beneficial effects of the addition of orally to intravenously administered prophylaxis in preventing infections in individual studies, the oral administration of antibiotics is currently not recommended in international infection control guidelines because of large variability in the antibiotic regimens tested and the limited availability of high-quality studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The oral administration of antibiotics to reduce the colonic bacterial load became popular as surgical prophylaxis for colorectal surgery in the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At that time it was believed that orally administered antibiotics would only be effective when the colon was simultaneously cleansed of its contents. Therefore, mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), a technique that involves the administration of osmotic substances to induce voiding of the intestinal contents, was introduced and combined with the preoperative oral administration of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] This combination became standard of care in colorectal surgery. Since then, several studies have questioned the necessity and safety of MBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent meta-analyses have concluded that the use of MBP prior to colorectal surgery could be safely omitted, as MBP alone had no overall beneficial effect on postoperative complications and caused substantial discomfort for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, MBP has been associated with an increase in inflammatory processes, or with spillage of liquid bowel contents when bowel preparation was performed inadequately resulting in an increase in postoperative infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, MBP is no longer recommended in the international guidelines for colorectal surgery. The practice of MBP was also abandoned as the pre-surgical admission period has continuously decreased, precluding these preoperative preparations. The oral administration of antibiotics in an uncleansed colon was thought to be ineffective, resulting in the simultaneous disappearance of oral bowel cleansing and orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A recent Dutch single-center,&#x000a0;randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) provided new insights into the use of orally administered antibiotics as a surgical prophylaxis prior to gastrointestinal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Instead of using the common regimens for orally administered prophylaxis consisting of tablets, the efficacy of a combination of non-absorbable antibiotics in a suspension was investigated. This suspension contained tobramycin, colistin and amphotericin B and is also used in selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), an infection control measure implemented on intensive care units (ICUs). This study reported a 36% reduction of the incidence of infectious complications and anastomotic leakage in patients receiving the preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the study included patients who underwent all types of gastrointestinal procedures (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;294). Colorectal procedures were analyzed as a subgroup, resulting in limited statistical power. Furthermore, MBP was frequently administered to patients undergoing colorectal procedures. Nevertheless, the results of this study are promising and encourage further research to confirm the benefit of using orally administered prophylaxis.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, the high incidence of SSIs after colorectal surgery and its associated morbidity and mortality justifies the evaluation of new preventive approaches. Preoperative orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis, in addition to standard perioperative intravenously administered prophylaxis, may reduce the incidence of SSIs after colorectal surgery. However, data on its efficacy without the concurrent practice of MBP are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is, therefore, warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study hypothesis and objectives</title><p id="Par26">The objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of preoperative orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis (Pre-OP) in addition to perioperative intravenously administered antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of deep SSIs and/or mortality after elective colorectal surgery.

The study diary will be used to document the intake of study medication and to report potential side effects due to the study medication. Patients will take the study medication according to the instructions during the 3&#x000a0;days prior to surgery. The bottles with remainders of study medication will be collected at hospital admission and will be weighted to estimate treatment adherence.

The remainders of study medication will be weighted to estimate the compliance. To enhance the compliance, patients are informed about the bitter taste of the treatment and are advised to take the study medication together with other drinks to mask the taste. Another strategy that will be applied to enhance retention of patients is to call the patients on the two postoperative follow-up moments to remind them about the rectal swab requirement and the questionnaire that will be send to their home address.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Microbiological methods</title><p id="Par42">Clinical cultures will be performed and processed in the local microbiology laboratory of the participating centers according to the routine laboratory procedures.

All patients who were randomized to receive study medication and who underwent colorectal surgery will be included in this analysis. The difference in the primary outcome between Pre-OP and placebo will be estimated with a Z-test for proportions or by logistic regression, correcting for the stratification variable (study site). Multivariable logistic regression will be used and measured confounders will be fitted in the model as covariates. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the chi-square test, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, logistic regression, time-to-event analysis, <italic>t</italic> test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, when appropriate.

The Z-statistic for the standardized treatment effect will be computed and compared with the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming type of boundaries for both efficacy and futility. Recruitment will stop if the Z statistic is larger than the efficacy boundary. The futility boundaries are non-binding and thus suggestive.

In addition, external monitoring will be performed by the independent monitors. During the monitoring visit, data entry will be verified on a random sample of the included patients by assessment of the source documents (e.g., electronic patient files, questionnaires or diaries). In the case of discrepancies or missing data, queries will be added to the questions that need revision or additional information.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par51">Pre-OP consists of non-absorbable antibiotics. When taken orally, there is virtually no uptake of antibiotic components in the bloodstream. It is, therefore, expected that the occurrence of systemic side effects is negligible. More importantly, there is extensive experience with non-absorbable antibiotics applied as SDD on ICUs and severe and acute side effects that could apply to the current study have not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For this reason, we decided to refrain from an obligatory observation period after intake of the first dose of the study medication and patients can, therefore, take the medication at home. Nevertheless, patients will receive information about severe side effects of this study medication and are instructed to seek medical advice when they might suffer from severe acute side effects. The unblinding protocol can be freely assessed via our website, when deemed necessary. Late side effects, such as the development of antibiotic resistance, have not been described either [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, the occurrence of side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance will be monitored as secondary endpoints of this study.</p><p id="Par52">All adverse events will be reported to the principle investigator. Serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse reactions (SARs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the sponsor within 24&#x000a0;h after notification of the event. For the SAEs, we decided to only report life-threatening infections with colistin- or tobramycin-resistant bacteria or <italic>C. difficile</italic> colitis within 24&#x000a0;h. Postoperative complications that are known to occur after colorectal surgery and are not directly related to the study medication will be reported to the ethical board in periodic line-listings and not within the 24-h time window.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data Safety and Monitoring Board</title><p id="Par53">A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) is established to guard patient safety during the trial. The DSMB consists of four independent experts who will have an active role during the entire study period. The board will issue recommendations to continue or stop the study, based on the unblinded results of the interim analysis and on the list of SAEs, SARs and SUSARs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">Undergoing surgery is associated with an increased risk of surgical site infections, but also mortality. To overcome the issue of mortality being a competing risk with the development of deep SSIs, our primary outcome of interest, we decided to use a composite endpoint for our primary outcome. Thirty-day all-cause mortality and deep SSIs will also be analyzed separately as secondary endpoints.</p><p id="Par55">The rationale behind our intervention is to decontaminate the digestive tract prior to surgery, where we hypothesize that by lowering the bacterial load in the colon and rectum during the surgical procedure, the risk of postoperative infections is reduced. In a previous study, a suspension of colistin sulphate, tobramycin and amphotericin B was used to reduce anastomotic leakage and postoperative infectious complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This suspension is identical to the suspension that is used as an antibiotic prophylaxis on Dutch ICUs, often referred to as SDD). In contrast with SDD, the solution that will be used in our study does not contain an antifungal component (amphotericin B or nystatin). Fungi are rarely identified as the causative pathogens of SSIs after surgical procedures on the lower gastrointestinal tract and it was, therefore, decided to omit the antifungal component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Another difference between our study and the trial by Roos et al. is the timing of the treatment. In the previous trial, the intervention started 2&#x000a0;days prior to surgery and was continued during the postoperative period until normal bowel movements were observed. In our study, the intervention will only be given preoperatively and is discontinued on the night before the surgical procedure. We hypothesize that the majority of SSIs is caused by intraoperative rather than postoperative contamination of the surgical site and that the greatest reduction in SSIs will, therefore, be achieved by ensuring that the colonic bacterial load is at its lowermost at the time the surgical procedure takes place. The prophylaxis in our study is, therefore, restricted to the preoperative period. We also hypothesize that the treatment period of 3&#x000a0;days will be sufficient since we expect that the decontamination will least for several days. In our opinion, continuation of the prophylaxis in the postoperative period is not necessary as this could adversely increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistance or opportunistic infections.</p><p id="Par56">To date, there is no consensus on the use of preoperative orally administered antibiotic prophylaxis prior to colorectal surgery in addition to perioperative intravenously administered antibiotic prophylaxis and without concurrent use of MBP. This impedes the formulation of clear-cut recommendations on its use in current infection control guidelines. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter study aims to determine the efficacy of Pre-OP in addition to perioperative intravenously administered antimicrobial prophylaxis on the development of SSIs and other infectious and non-infectious complications. The proposed study design offers an optimal approach to adequately minimize bias and generate generalizable results in order to guide important evidence-based recommendations regarding infection control measures in colorectal surgery (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par57">The trial received ethical approval in September 2016.
