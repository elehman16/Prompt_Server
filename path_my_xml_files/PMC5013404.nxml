The Healthlines study was a multicentre, parallel two-arm and individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention for primary care patients. The intervention was intended to promote behaviour change, optimisation of medication, improved coordination of care and improved medication adherence in patients with a high risk of developing CVD. Development of the intervention,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the protocol for the trial<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the main results of the trial have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telehealth in general,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and for the management of patients with elevated CVD risk,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> is mixed. In this paper, we report the results of an economic evaluation conducted alongside the Healthlines RCT. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the telehealth service from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective for primary care patients with elevated CVD risk. A companion paper<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> complements the within-trial evaluation presented in this paper with simulation modelling of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention over the remaining lifetime of trial participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RCT setting and participants</title><p>Participants aged between 40 and 74 on the date of invitation were recruited from 42 general practices in or near Bristol, Sheffield and Southampton.

NIHR Journals Library&#x02014;Programme Grants for Applied Research, Under review) was used to develop the de novo, theory-driven, web and phone-based telehealth service received by participants in the intervention arm. The core feature of the Healthlines Service consisted of scripted telephone support and responsive advice delivered by NHS Direct Health Information Advisors (HIAs). The scripts used in the telephone encounters, based on a successful US intervention,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> focused on goal setting, stimulus control and problem solving to address modifiable risk factors for CVD. These encounters were responsive to need, and participants could, for example, request calls with supervisors, and could ask to be directed to sources of information relevant to the management of their condition. Participants were eligible to receive up to 13 scheduled telephone encounters delivered approximately every 4&#x02005;weeks over the course of the 12&#x02005;months of trial follow-up. The intervention was in addition to usual care.</p><p>Participants with systolic blood pressure &#x02265;140&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and without atrial fibrillation were offered a home blood pressure monitor.

largely due to the cost of the intervention. The societal value of lost production was slightly higher per patient in the control arm, but not significantly so. The comparison is affected by the low numbers of participants reporting employment at either 6 or 12&#x02005;months (25.2%), and the number of employed participants reporting no impact (95.1%) of CVD risk factors on their employment. Participants randomised to usual care reported higher mean per patient private healthcare costs than in the intervention arm in available cases, but lower out-of-pocket expenditure than intervention participants.</p><p>These costs were associated with a marginal increase in the proportion of responders (defined in the published trial protocol as the maintenance or reduction of 10-year cardiovascular risk estimated on the basis of the QRISK2 score after 12&#x02005;months) in the intervention arm, with improvements in EQ-5D-5L utility at the end of 12&#x02005;months of follow-up, and with a small QALY improvement.</p><p>There was a marginal increase in response to treatment (as defined above) in the treatment arm. The intervention was also associated with reductions in blood pressure (mean difference in systolic pressure &#x02212;2.7&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg; 95% CI &#x02212;4.7 to &#x02212;0.6) and in weight (&#x02212;1.0&#x02005;kg; 95% CI &#x02212;1.8 to &#x02212;0.3). Improvements in diet, physical activity, medication to care and satisfaction with treatment for participants randomised to the intervention arm were also observed.

Trial participants in the control arm received usual care. Participants were followed up for 12&#x02005;months. Resource use data were collected at 6 and 12&#x02005;months, and information on health-related quality of life was measured using responses to the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Using a health system perspective, we compared healthcare costs to QALYs in the base case cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>The between-arm difference in QALYs is modest. This small improvement in QALYs in the intervention arm may reflect the indirect impact of engaging with and being supported by the HIAs. For example, intervention participants reported greater medication adherence, better access to support and satisfaction with treatment than did control participants (C Salisbury, A O'Cathain, C Thomas, <italic>et al.</italic> Under review). Intervention participants reported small improvements in blood pressure and BMI, but not with respect to smoking or cholesterol (C Salisbury, A O'Cathain, C Thomas, <italic>et al.</italic> Under review). The balance of these impacts&#x02014;on the sense of being supported, greater satisfaction with treatment and some improvements in &#x02018;hard&#x02019; health indicators such as weight&#x02014;may have contributed to EQ-5D-5L responses that favoured the intervention.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths</title><p>The Healthlines trial was one of the largest RCTs designed to evaluate a telehealth-based complex intervention for the management of CVD risk. The intervention was based on a programme of work (C Salisbury, A O'Cathain, C Thomas, <italic>et al.</italic> Under review) intended to establish the acceptability of telehealth to patients with chronic conditions, and to support the development of an evidence-based, responsive telehealth service for evaluation in the context of a pragmatic trial design. This economic evaluation contributes to the small body of evidence concerned with the cost-effectiveness of telehealth for patients with long-term conditions.</p><p>The economic evaluation was conducted alongside the trial, and prospectively collected detailed patient-level data. The analysis was conducted in line with best practice guidance.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The amount of missing data in the cost and quality of life variables necessary to conduct inferential cost-effectiveness analysis was similar in each arm. Imputed and complete case cost-effectiveness results were similar.</p><p>Adherence to the intervention was relatively strong, with a median of 10 out of 13 scheduled encounters received. This suggests that patients randomised to the intervention were willing to engage with the Healthlines Service.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>The economic evaluation did not seek to measure the scalability of the intervention to larger (eg, national) patient groups, although the intervention was specifically designed to be easily scaled-up. It is conceivable that scale economies (eg, training more HIAs at the same cost) and other savings (eg, through very large bulk purchases of blood pressure monitors) could be realised to reduce overall intervention cost. There was no evidence from the trial that substantial efficiencies could have been secured but were left unexploited. A related limitation is that the recruitment rate of the trial was relatively low.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This will affect the generalisability of the findings, although it is unclear whether low reluctance is due to lack of interest in telehealth or unwillingness to participate in research.</p><p>The 12-month follow-up period of the trial means that questions concerning long-term outcomes cannot be answered definitively, and nor can the issue of whether time-limited (eg, for 12&#x02005;months) or ongoing (eg, until QRISK2 score was reduced to some target level) telehealth support would be most cost-effective. The intervention may affect the health of participants beyond the end of follow-up for at least two reasons: any improvements in habits and self-management are maintained, and the reduced QRISK2 scores in the intervention during trial follow-up will (slightly) reduce the likelihood of future CVD events occurring. A companion paper<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> describes the results of a simulation intended to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a lifetime perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Other literature</title><p>Incremental costs per patient in the intervention arm were &#x000a3;138. There was a small QALY difference between arms of 0.012. We note that Bergmo's<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> review of QALY gains in telehealth interventions found that 17 included studies reported small, positive effects on quality of life. This is consistent with the results reported here. Overall, the intervention is likely to be cost-effective at conventional NHS cost-effectiveness thresholds.</p><p>Comparison of the findings of this economic evaluation with other literature is complicated by differences between studies in technologies assessed, the types of condition analysed, study design and patient population. Evidence for the cost-effectiveness of telehealth in general is mixed,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;39</xref> and has been described as being of low quality in some cases.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref></p><p>A notable example of cost-effectiveness analysis within an English NHS context of telehealth for long-term conditions was evaluation of the &#x02018;Whole Systems Demonstrator&#x02019; (WSD) project.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Patients with a long-term condition (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes) received either telehealth (n=845) or usual care (n=728) for 12&#x02005;months following cluster randomisation of practices in three study sites.</p><p>The WSD intervention comprised the use of a broad class of telehealth and telemonitoring equipment, which differed by study site. Participants were asked to take readings using this equipment at the same time each day up to 5&#x02005;days per week. Specialist nurses monitored and responded to information from patients.</p><p>The adjusted estimated QALY gain after 12&#x02005;months in the WSD study was 0.012 in favour of the intervention, the same mean difference reported here for Healthlines, despite the differences in technology, patient characteristics and study design. NHS and social care costs were substantially higher than in Healthlines, with WSD intervention arm costs &#x000a3;1110 higher than in the control arm. The costs of the intervention itself were estimated to be substantially higher than in Healthlines (&#x000a3;1847 average annual cost for those with equipment and reporting costs at 12-month follow-up in WSD, compared with &#x000a3;129 in Healthlines), although other costs were lower in the intervention arm. The estimated WSD ICER was &#x000a3;92&#x02005;000.</p><p>This high-level comparison between the cost-effectiveness results of the Healthlines trial and from the WSD trial indicate the sensitivity of the cost-effectiveness results to the type and costs of technology evaluated. Despite the same mean QALY difference, the WSD evaluation suggested that substantial changes in intervention cost would be necessary before the service could be considered as a cost-effective means of managing patients with long-term conditions. In contrast to the WSD, the Healthlines intervention was designed to support self-management of chronic diseases at low cost, using readily available low-cost technology such as accessible websites, and telephone support from staff without clinical training.</p><p>These considerations are relevant to future study design in this area. Continuing evolution in technology and technology cost is likely to influence both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Healthlines RCT provided weak evidence of a modest effect on 10-year CVD risk of the telehealth intervention on the primary binary outcome of response to treatment.
