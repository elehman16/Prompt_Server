Consecutive patients with portal hypertension referred between January 1998 and December 2007 to any of the seven participating hospitals for endoscopic band ligation were considered.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, a concomitant disease with reduced life expectancy, previous treatment to prevent bleeding with a portosystemic shunt or with EBL, bleeding from isolated gastric or ectopic varices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Baseline evaluation and general management</title><p>A full clinical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, laboratory tests and ultrasonography were performed. Propranolol was initiated. The dose was increased stepwise, every two&#x02013;three days, up to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 160 mg/day.</p><p>The first elective session was carried out within a mean of 12 days from the indication. Then EBL sessions were scheduled at an average of every 14 days until variceal eradication (disappearance of varices or being too small to be sucked in the banding device). EBL sessions were initially performed using single-band device with or without overtube; then with multiband ligation devices (SpeedBand, Boston Scientific, or Six Shooter Multi-Band ligator, Cook Medical) when they became commercially available; application of the bands was started at the gastro-esophageal junction and progressed upward in a helical way for approximately 5&#x02013;8 cm. Procedures were performed under local sedation with xylocain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Follow-up</title><p>After eradication, an endoscopic control was performed at one, three, six months and then yearly to monitor variceal recurrence, which was defined as the reappearance of varices, which could be ligated. Variceal recurrences were treated with repeat EBL. All patients underwent clinical reassessment every six months or more often if needed. Median follow-up was 32 months (range 2 &#x02013; 212 months).</p><p>Untoward events considered to be related to treatment under study and requiring active therapy or prolonged hospitalization were recorded. Side effects were considered severe if the health or safety of the patient was endangered (i.e. pneumonia, sepsis, bacterial peritonitis or bleeding from esophageal ulcers). Minor symptoms or events, which were not considered worthy of treatment or investigation by the attending physician, were also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>End points</title><p>The main endpoint of the study was bleeding from any source (first bleeding for primary prophylaxis and recurrent bleeding for secondary prophylaxis). Secondary endpoints were the number of banding sessions, the time to eradication (calculated from the first banding session), the incidence of variceal recurrence, variceal rebleeding, complications and mortality (overall and mortality related to bleeding).</p><p>All patients were instructed to come to hospital whenever they experienced melena or hematemesis. If bleeding was confirmed, an emergency endoscopy was performed. The diagnosis of variceal bleeding was done when varices were actively bleeding or had stigmata of recent bleeding and/or if fresh blood was observed in the stomach and varices were the only potential source of bleeding. Bleeding was considered to be EBL-related when endoscopy disclosed bleeding from an ulcer secondary to previous ligation. The rebleeding episode was treated primarily by means of vasoactive drugs (somatostatin) and endoscopic treatment, preferably with EBL.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Six hundred and three patients were included in the study.

This combination is the therapy of choice currently recommended for acute variceal. The use of variceal ligation instead of sclerotherapy as emergency endoscopic therapy for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding significantly improves the efficacy and safety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] EBL controlled bleeding in 97% of our patients whereas therapeutic success was 90% in the study of Villanueva <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Non-selective beta-blockers are the recommended first line therapy for the primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in patients with varices at high risk for bleeding. Beta-blockers reduce the two-year incidence of first bleeding in these patients by 40%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] However, beta-blockers are not suitable for all patients: contraindications may be present in 5&#x02013;20% of potential candidates, and 9&#x02013;33% may develop side effects that lead to discontinuation of the treatment in 3&#x02013;27% of cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] The optimal strategy to manage these patients is to treat with EBL, which achieve protection from variceal bleeding comparable to that of good responders to beta-blockers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] In this indication, the first bleeding rate was 10.2% comparable with that of other studies (8.9% in the study of Dell&#x02019;Era <italic>et al</italic>.).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>]</p><p>After an episode of acute esophageal variceal bleeding, patients are at high risk for recurrent bleeding and death.

However, it is associated with a rate of recurrent bleeding of up to 50% and with local and systemic complications such as fever, pain, pulmonary infections, and esophageal ulceration, stricture, and perforation. Some of these complications may be fatal. Endoscopic variceal ligation is a purely mechanical method of obliterating varices that was introduced to preclude the undesirable effects of sclerotherapy. Several studies have shown that, as compared with sclerotherapy, variceal ligation is safer, requires fewer sessions to obliterate varices, significantly reduces the rate of recurrent bleeding, and improves the probability of survival.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>Accordingly, endoscopic ligation is currently the preferred endoscopic treatment for preventing recurrent variceal bleeding. The efficacy of variceal ligation, as found in our study, is consistent with the higher ranges previously reported in randomized trials of this treatment. A relatively wide variation in rates of recurrent bleeding has been observed with ligation (10 to 50%, 13.3% in our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] This variation may be due, at least in part, to technical differences among studies, such as variations in the interval between sessions or in the number of bands placed during each session. Moreover, in multi-site band ligation-treated patients, eradication of varices seems to be achieved with fewer sessions of treatment than in those treated with conventional band ligation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] Whether these or other technical differences can affect the outcome has not been adequately investigated. Other possible confounding factors, such as the time since the initial bleeding episode, alcohol use or non-use, and the treatment used to stop the bleeding, may also affect the results of treatment. Among different trials, there may be differences in the randomization process or in the characteristics of the population treated, such as the cause or the severity of hypertension, or in the definition of end points such as recurrent bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] Our study had few exclusion criteria; a high proportion of the patients had advanced liver disease. A combination of non-selective beta-blockers and EBL may be the best alternative.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>]</p><p>It has also been suggested that, as with sclerotherapy, variceal ligation may worsen the severity of portal hypertensive gastropathie. We found that this condition rarely worsened or developed in patients treated with ligation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In our population, endoscopic variceal ligation is a safe and effective technical approach. Moreover, the current study shows that using EBL as emergency endoscopic therapy added to vasoactive drugs is associated with a high rate of hemostasis. Variceal ligation is also effective and safe when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated for the prevention of first variceal bleeding. Concerning the secondary prophylaxis, combined therapy with propranolol seems to be more effective than endoscopic ligation for the prevention of recurrent
