<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Objective</bold>: This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of lurasidone in patients with acute schizophrenia with prominent positive symptoms.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> Patient-level data were pooled from 5 similarly designed, multiregional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week studies of fixed-dose lurasidone (40, 80, 120, or 160&#x02009;mg/d) in adult patients with acute schizophrenia. Patients with prominent positive symptoms were defined as those with baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score &#x0003e; negative subscale score. Treatment response was defined as &#x02265;30% decrease from baseline in PANSS total score at week 6 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]).</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> This analysis included 919 patients with and 613 patients without prominent positive symptoms. Based on change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score (mixed-model repeated-measures analysis), effect sizes for lurasidone 40, 80, 120, and 160&#x02009;mg/d were 0.51, 0.65, 0.44, and 1.09, respectively, for patients with prominent positive symptoms (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 0.29, 0.46, 0.55, and 0.67, respectively, for patients without prominent positive symptoms (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for 40&#x02009;mg/d; all other <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In patients with prominent positive symptoms, treatment response at week 6 LOCF was observed in 29.3% of patients in the placebo group and 48.3%, 46.6%, 43.2%, and 64.4% of patients in the lurasidone 40, 80, 120, and 160&#x02009;mg/d groups, respectively (with associated number needed to treat [NNT] of 6, 6, 8, and 3, respectively). In patients without prominent positive symptoms, treatment response at week 6 LOCF was observed in 35.7% of patients in the placebo group and 50.0%, 52.1%, 54.5%, and 60.4% of patients in the lurasidone 40, 80, 120, and 160&#x02009;mg/d groups, respectively (NNT of 7, 7, 6, and 5, respectively).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this analysis of patients with schizophrenia, lurasidone therapy was associated with larger effect sizes in patients with versus without prominent positive symptoms.</p><p>Support: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p>
