Sixty-seven Chinese male IHH patients were recruited from the Departments of Endocrinology in eight tertiary hospitals and randomly allocated into the sequential uFSH/hCG group (Group A, <italic>n</italic> = 34) or the sequential uFSH plus zinc supplementation group (Group B, <italic>n</italic> = 33). In Group A, patients received sequential uFSH (75 U, three times a week every other 3 months) and hCG (2000 U, twice a week) treatments. In Group B, patients received oral zinc supplementation (40 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in addition to the sequential uFSH/hCG treatment given to patients in Group A. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a sperm concentration &#x02265;1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during the 18 months. The comparison of efficacy between Groups A and B was analyzed. Nineteen of 34 (55.9%) patients receiving sequential uFSH/hCG and 20 of 33 (60.6%) patients receiving sequential uFSH/hCG plus zinc supplementation achieved sperm concentrations &#x02265;1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> by intention to treat analyses. No differences between Group A and Group B were observed as far as the efficacy of inducing spermatogenesis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69). We concluded that the sequential uFSH/hCG plus zinc supplementation regimen had a similar efficacy to the sequential uFSH/hCG treatment alone. The additional improvement of 40 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> oral zinc supplementation on spermatogenesis and masculinization in male IHH patients is very subtle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gonadotropin</kwd><kwd>isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</kwd><kwd>masculinization</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>zinc supplementation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Congenital isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation and infertility due to isolated defects in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release or action.

Both clinical and animal studies show that zinc is essential to spermatogenesis.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the present study, we found that zinc supplementation did not further improve spermatogenesis in combination with the standard uFSH/hCG regimen given to IHH patients.</p><p>We cannot exclude that zinc might have a weak effect on spermatogenesis, which could not be detected in our current study. Azoospermia in IHH patients is mainly the result of GnRH and LH/FSH deficiency; without administration of LH/FSH preparations, the induction of spermatogenesis is almost impossible. Thus, the drastic recovery of spermatogenesis due to gonadotropin treatment for both groups may have resulted in a ceiling effect that masked any subtle difference caused by additional zinc treatment.</p><p>At the same time, other sperm parameters or testosterone synthesis showed no statistical differences between the two groups. In general, the effects of zinc on sperm motility remain controversial. Some studies found that high serum zinc could enhance sperm motility while others reported that it suppressed sperm progressive motility.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In our study, the median motile sperm percentages (Grade A, B, and C) were 44.7% in Group A and 36.1% in Group B, and no obvious enhanced or suppressed effect of zinc on sperm motility could be observed. It had been reported that zinc is helpful in testosterone synthesis. Zinc deficiency was associated with hypogonadism and dysplasia of secondary sex characteristics in humans.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this study, the serum testosterone concentrations and subsequent secondary sex characteristic development (e.g., penis length, testicular volume, pubic hair stage, and genital tanner stage) were markedly improved in both groups. However, no statistical differences were observed between Groups A and B.</p><p>The sequential use of uFSH plus zinc supplementation had a trend for an earlier induction of spermatogenesis. However, neither the median time to induce spermatogenesis nor the median time of achieving the primary outcome showed a statistical difference between the two groups after therapy was initiated. The impregnate condition was recorded in 14.7% (5/34) patients in the sequential uFSH treatment group and 12.1% (4/33) patients in the sequential uFSH plus zinc supplementation group 6 months after the end of the trial. Most patients (80%) in our study were not yet married during this study.</p><p>One factor to take into consideration could be the absence of zinc deficiency in the patients in these two groups; serum zinc concentrations at baseline or simple dietary surveys did not suggest that they had decreased zinc levels. Although the patients in Group B took additional zinc supplements, there was no statistical difference in serum zinc concentrations between the groups, which also had been observed in previous studies.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The lower limit of normal fasting serum zinc has been set as 0.7&#x02013;0.75 mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In this study, the serum zinc concentrations in Groups A and B were above the normal lower limit. The adult human body contains 1&#x02013;3 g of zinc, and only about 0.1% of it is replenished daily in agreement with zinc's biological half-life of about 280 days.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The body can regulate zinc excretion and absorption to maintain zinc homeostasis. Additional zinc intake was not associated with improved semen quality in healthy men.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Therefore, it is possible that zinc in the IHH patients in Group B may have been promptly excreted rather than accumulated in the body.</p><p>Another factor to take into consideration that might account for the lack of differences may be that the doses used were inadequate. To avoid toxicity or gastrointestinal side effects, we followed the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which sets the upper limit of selective zinc intake at 45 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and a dose of &#x0003c;45 mg was a commonly used dose.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, in a previous study, infertile men were given a much higher dose of 500 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of zinc sulfate (201 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of zinc) alone, and a marked improvement was observed in sperm count and progressive motility.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It is possible that the dosage we used was too low to induce detectable effects; a higher safe dose can be attempted in the future study.</p><p>Moreover, a possible caveat should be noted that records of zinc administration were kept by self-report. Each patient in Group B received a card to record the administration of zinc. More than half of the patients in Group B complained about the bad taste of the zinc preparation. While records showed all of the IHH patients had taken more than 90% of the zinc gluconate, there is a possibility that some patients did not disclose that they missed or skipped a significant number of zinc doses. Different preparations and patterns of zinc administration that are easily accepted by patients should be studied in the future.</p><p>We overestimated the efficacy of zinc supplementation in the trial design by choosing a superiority margin of 25%, according to the efficacy range (46%&#x02013;89%) reported in previous studies.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis showed that the improvement in the primary outcome was only 4.7% (55.9% <italic>vs</italic> 60.6%) for ITT and 2.4% (65.5% <italic>vs</italic> 67.9%) for PP analysis. A <italic>post hoc</italic> power analysis shows that 3456 patients are required to detect existing differences (4.7% for ITT) at 80% power. IHH is such a rare disease (1/8000&#x02013;10 000 in males) that this large sample size is not able to be achieved. Thus, this is a preliminary study to explore the effectiveness of oral zinc supplementation on spermatogenesis in male IHH patients and provides some evidence for clinicians who are concerned with this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results indicate that sequential use of uFSH/hCG plus zinc supplementation regimen has a similar efficacy to the sequential use of uFSH/hCG alone.
