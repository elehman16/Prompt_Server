Oxytocin can enhance trust in others, and may promote the extent to which a hypnotized person complies with the suggestion of a hypnotist. This double-blind placebo study administered oxytocin or placebo to high hypnotizable participants (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28), who were then administered hypnotic suggestions for socially unorthodox behaviors, including swearing during the experiment, singing out loud, and dancing in response to a posthypnotic cue. Participants who received oxytocin were significantly more likely to swear and dance than those who received the placebo. This finding may be interpreted in terms of oxytocin increasing social compliance in response as a function of (a) increased trust in the hypnotist, (b) reduced social anxiety, or (c) enhanced sensitivity to cues to respond to experimental expectations. These results point to the potential role of oxytocin in social persuasion.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant.

A hypnotized person may experience for suggested events, rigidity of body parts, or anesthesia in response to painful stimuli. Accordingly, hypnosis has intrigued researchers since populated by Freud <xref rid="pone.0060711-Breuer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and Janet <xref rid="pone.0060711-Janet1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> over 100 years ago. Hypnotizability (i.e., one's capacity to respond to hypnotic suggestion) is normally distributed in the population, with approximately 15% being low hypnotizable, 70% being medium hypnotizable, and 15% being high hypnotizable <xref rid="pone.0060711-Woody1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Further, one's capacity for hypnotic responding is very stable across time, with evidence that it remains consistent over 25 years (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71) <xref rid="pone.0060711-Piccione1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>It has traditionally been argued that hypnotized people will not respond to hypnotic suggestions that are contrary to behaviors they would ordinarily engage in <xref rid="pone.0060711-Orne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Prompted by cases of people allegedly performing criminal acts during hypnotic suggestion <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bogousslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, earlier research studied the capacity of hypnosis to prompt an individual to engage in antisocial or undesirable behavior. Although some earlier work suggested that hypnotized people would engage in undesirable or dangerous acts <xref rid="pone.0060711-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, subsequent studies suggested that these effects could be attributed to social compliance factors that were independent of hypnosis <xref rid="pone.0060711-Orne2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The current study renews this line of investigation with a novel approach. There is much evidence that hypnotic responding is influenced by the nature of the relationship with the hypnotist, insofar as hypnotic responding is determined by hypnotized participants being motivated by contextual factors to comply with hypnotic suggestions <xref rid="pone.0060711-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Consistent with this proposal, hypnotic response is enhanced by increasing participant's motivation <xref rid="pone.0060711-Lynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and that hypnotic response is moderated by manipulating rapport with the hypnotist <xref rid="pone.0060711-Sheehan2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>One potential means to enhance responding during hypnosis is to enhance rapport via direct manipulation of oxytocin. Oxytocin has been shown to influence bonding and social affiliation by acting as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. Specifically, administering oxytocin enhances a range of social behaviors in animals <xref rid="pone.0060711-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, including maternal nurturing behaviors <xref rid="pone.0060711-Burbach1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, pair-bonding <xref rid="pone.0060711-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, while antagonists of oxytocin impair bonding <xref rid="pone.0060711-Insel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Similarly in humans, oxytocin administration has been shown to enhance trust and prosocial behaviour <xref rid="pone.0060711-Kosfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, less amygdala recruitment to social cues <xref rid="pone.0060711-Kirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, detection of affective states in others <xref rid="pone.0060711-Domes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, attention to people's eyes <xref rid="pone.0060711-Guastella1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and encoding of positive social memories. Other evidence has accumulated that points to oxytocin playing a more nuanced role than simply enhancing prosocial tendencies. There is evidence that oxytocin facilitates envy <xref rid="pone.0060711-ShamayTsoory1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, ethno-centric prejudice <xref rid="pone.0060711-DeDreu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, limits trust when information about social partners is unavailable <xref rid="pone.0060711-Declerck1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, enhances responsivity to aversive social stimuli <xref rid="pone.0060711-Striepens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and boosts mistrust in those with histories of poor attachments <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bartz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Further, it has been shown that the influence of oxytocin is dependent on contextual cues, such that oxytocin administration prompts men in monogamous relationships to maintain distance from attractive women but this effect was not observed in single men <xref rid="pone.0060711-Scheele1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Following this evidence, it has been suggested that oxytocin may facilitate attention to social cues and the subsequent behavioral response may be modulated by contextual and attitudinal factors <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bartz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>There is evidence that hypnotic response can be increased in low hypnotizable participants by administration of oxytocin relative to placebo <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This finding could be attributed to several potential mechanisms. Oxytocin could enhance hypnotic response by reducing anxiety about engaging in hypnotic behavior. Oxytocin has been shown to reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bartz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Alternately, on the basis that oxytocin enhances attention to social cues, and under positive conditions prosocial behavior, oxytocin administration may enhance the trust that an individual has in the hypnotist, thereby leading to greater hypnotist response. Accordingly, we hypothesized that oxytocin administration may enhance engagement in socially unorthodox behaviors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Hypnotizability was initially assessed on two occasions prior to the current experiment to ensure that we recruited highly hypnotizable participants. We initially screened 850 university students for hypnotizability levels via a group-administered hynotizability test: the Harvard Group Hypnotizability Scale: Form A <xref rid="pone.0060711-Shor1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This test comprises a hypnotic induction followed by 12 suggestions (4 motor, 4 challenge, and 4 cognitive suggestions). We employed a 10-item adaption of the self-scored HGSHS:Form A comprising eyes closing, extended arm falling, difficulty lifting arm, difficulty separating interlocked fingers, extended arm difficult to bend, difficulty shaking head &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;, difficulty opening closed eyes, swatting at a hallucinated fly, touching ankle in response to posthypnotic cue, and amnesia for events in hypnosis (a shortened version was employed to comply with time constraints). Participants were then re-assessed on a 10-item version of the individually-administered experimenter-scored Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (SHSS-C) <xref rid="pone.0060711-Weitzenhoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The SHSS-C is a more rigorous measure of hypnotic susceptibility because (a) it is individually administered, and (b) has a greater proportion of difficult cognitive hypnotic items that require alterations in cognitive experience rather than motor responses. We employed a 10-item adaption of this scale that comprised motor (moving hands apart), challenge (difficulty bending extended arm, difficulty lifting arm), and cognitive (swatting a hallucinated mosquito, hallucinating a taste, dream, age regression to school, anosmia to ammonia, hallucinating a voice, and posthypnotic amnesia). Only participants who scored in the range 7&#x02013;10 on the SHSS:C were recruited for the study. We selected 28 high hypnotizable participants who scored 7&#x02013;10 (M&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.42, SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.14) on the HGSHS:Form A, and 7&#x02013;10 (M&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.51, SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.15) on the SHSS:C. We restricted the sample to males because of potential adverse effects of oxytocin administration on pregnancy. We also excluded individuals with reported allergies to preservatives contained in the nasal spray (viz., E216, E218, and chlorobutanol hemihydrate).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedure</title><p>This project was approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee. Following written informed consent, participants were administered a brief medical examination to ensure that there were no contraindications for oxytocin administration (no participants were excluded). Participants abstained from alcohol and caffeine on the day of oxytocin administration, and food and drink (except water) 2 hours before the oxytocin administration. Participants initially rated levels of anxiety and trust about the hypnosis session on 7-point Likert scales (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>none</italic>, 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>extremely</italic>). Participants then self-administered an intranasal spray of 24 IU oxytocin (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) or placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13) that involved four puffs of 3IU in each nostril. Placebo spray involved the same ingredients with the exception of oxytocin (i.e., sorbitol, glycerol, benzyl alcohol, and distilled water). A double-blind methodology was adopted and codes were not released by the chemist until the final experimental session was complete. Forty-five minutes after intranasal administration, participants again rated their anxiety and trust.</p><p>Participants were then administered a hypnotic induction comparable to the hypnotic induction used in the SHSS:C. Participants were then administered a number of filler hypnotic items. Participants were then given the suggestion to describe their activities last weekend and during this they would &#x0201c;<italic>feel the urge to swear</italic>&#x0201d;. Participants were then given more two more filler items, and then listened to background music with the instruction to &#x0201c;<italic>feel an urge to sing out loud</italic>&#x0201d;. Prior to cancelling hypnosis, participants were given a posthypnotic suggestion to &#x0201c;<italic>feel the urge to get up from your chair and dance</italic>&#x0201d; when they heard the hypnotist say the phrase, &#x0201c;<italic>Let's take a break</italic>&#x0201d;; this suggestion was combined with a suggestion for posthypnotic amnesia in which they were told that they would not remember why they felt the urge to dance. Hypnosis was then terminated, and an interview was conducted during which the posthypnotic cue was given, then cancelled, and the session terminated.</p><p>Two independent raters, in addition to the experimenter, were all blind to the oxytocin/placebo conditions subsequently rated from video recordings the extent to which each item was passed (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>none</italic>, 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>extremely</italic>). There was very strong reliability between ratings for the singing (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71&#x02013;.88, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001), swearing (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.98&#x02013;.99, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001), and dancing (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.86&#x02013;.93, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001) responses.

It is possible that this behavior was facilitated because oxytocin led to reduced anxiety about the social situation which in turn led to a lower threshold for engaging in potentially socially embarrassing behavior; this interpretation accords with evidence that oxytocin decreases anxiety in socially stressful situations <xref rid="pone.0060711-Heinrichs1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Alternately, participants receiving oxytocin trusted the hypnotist more than those receiving placebo, thereby having greater motivation to participate in these behaviors. Third, recent evidence suggests that oxytocin increases sensitivity to social cues generally <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bartz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bartz3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There is much evidence that perceived social expectations of the experimental setting are highly influential in hypnotic response <xref rid="pone.0060711-Spanos1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and oxytocin may facilitate sensitivity to these cues.</p><p>The finding that oxytocin did not result in altered self-reports of anxiety or trust relative to placebo counters, to some extent, the interpretations that the effects of oxytocin may be attributed to increases in trust or decreases in anxiety. Oxytocin does have anxiolytic effects <xref rid="pone.0060711-Ring1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060711-UvnasMoberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> via dampening of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity <xref rid="pone.0060711-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and has been shown to reduce social anxiety in experimental settings <xref rid="pone.0060711-Heinrichs1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Nonetheless, this pattern was not observed in the current study. This may reflect the absence of an effect of oxytocin on anxiety or trust, the possibility that the effect of oxytocin was not perceived by participants, or that participants perceived a demand characteristic to not report differences in ratings over time.</p><p>Earlier studies have reported marginal increases in suggestibility following administration of LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin <xref rid="pone.0060711-Sjoberg1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The effect of most of these drugs has been interpreted in terms of these drugs reducing reality testing, and therefore allowing greater responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions. In contrast, oxytocin does not alter consciousness and hence the observed effect of oxytocin on increasing response to the unorthodox behaviors needs to be explained by a mechanism distinct from reduced reality testing.</p><p>We recognize that suggesting to participants that they dance, sing, and swear in an experimental setting may not represent antisocial or undesirable behaviors. There is much evidence to suggest that hypnotized participants reframe the suggested experiences in ways that allow them to construe them as acceptable within the constraints of the experimental framework <xref rid="pone.0060711-Sheehan2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060711-Bryant2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Oxytocin may have facilitated sufficient rapport in the experimental setting to permit acceptance of these behaviors as acceptable in light of the experimental demands. More rigorous study would require the participant to engage in explicitly antisocial behaviour, as much as one can ethically permit in research, and also to test this outside the perceived realm of the experimental context.</p><p>We note several limitations. To avoid potential complications with undetected pregnancies we excluded female participants, and so we do not know if these findings are applicable to females. We also tested all participants within a hypnotic context, which leaves open the question concerning oxytocin increasing the capacity to influence people to engage in unorthodox behavior outside hypnosis. It is important to note that many studies have replicated hypnotic responsivity studies by heightening the motivation of participants and suggesting that they comply with suggested experiences <xref rid="pone.0060711-deGroot1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060711-Gfeller1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The current design does not allow us to delineate between the effects of oxytocin on persuasion in hypnotic and nonhypnotic contexts. An intriguing avenue for future research is to determine the extent to which people may engage in behaviors that they would otherwise not participate in if persuaded under the influence of oxytocin.</p><p>These findings suggest that, despite earlier reports that hypnosis will not lead to behaviors normally unacceptable to the participant, oxytocin can facilitate this behavior. One previous study has found that oxytocin does not increase gullibility insofar as participants do not increase trust if the other person is not trusted <xref rid="pone.0060711-Mikolajczak1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Given the evidence that most hypnotic behaviors can be achieved outside hypnosis if the appropriate context is established <xref rid="pone.0060711-Lynn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, there is a need to determine the extent, and associated mechanisms, to which oxytocin may enhance social persuasion generally.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0060711-Breuer1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Breuer J, Freud S (1955) Studies on hysteria (1893&#x02013;1895) In: Strachey J, editor.
