The technical and initial clinical success of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of iliac artery stenosis exceeds 90&#x000a0;% in the literature; in addition, the technical success rate of recanalization of obstructive long lesions of iliac artery is 80&#x02013;85&#x000a0;% with or without additional fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>As new types of stents and technical developments have been introduced, more extensive and multifocal iliac lesions have been treated with endovascular procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Low morbidity and mortality as well as up to 90&#x000a0;% technical success rate guarantee the endovascular-first approach and the patency rates with stenting of iliac arteries compare favorably with those of surgical revascularization. In experienced centers, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) type D lesions might be also primarily treated percutaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In endovascular repair for iliac lesions, unlike the infrapopliteal revascularization strategy, routine stent placement with a PTA strategy has been generally accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It was seen in a study of 250 patients undergoing either PTA alone or PTA with provisional stenting that the provisional stenting arm was associated with more than a 2.5-fold reduction (10 vs 4&#x000a0;%) in immediate failures, although long-term results in the two groups were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of iliac artery intervention studies, the risk of long-term failure was reduced by 39&#x000a0;% after stent placement compared with PTA and the technical success rate was higher after stent placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A study comparing angioplasty alone with angioplasty plus stenting for complex iliac artery disease showed that cumulative primary patency rates were 78&#x000a0;% at 1&#x000a0;year, with a secondary patency rate more than 80&#x000a0;% at 32&#x000a0;months, with reduction in long-term failure of 39&#x000a0;% when stents were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this analysis, stenting improved the 4-year primary patency rates by approximately 10&#x000a0;% for both patients treated for claudication or critical ischemia, and patients treated for iliac stenosis and occlusions.</p><p>Stents for iliac artery disease are classified as self-expandable and balloon-expandable according to the mechanics of stent deployment, and as nitinol, stainless steel and others according to stent material. Currently, the choice of balloon- versus self-expandable stent is determined mainly by operator preference. Self-expanding stents are usually made of nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium, and stainless steel. Nitinol alloys are most commonly known for their super-elasticity and thermal shape memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Generally, self-expanding stents have greater elasticity, allowing them to regain their shape after the compression force reduces. Another advantage of self-expanding stents is their higher trackability, meaning they are easier to maneuver through tortuous vessels or pass the aortic bifurcation from the contralateral approach. Balloon-expandable stents are usually made of stainless steel. Balloon-expandable stents are characterized by much greater radial strength compared to self-expanding stents. The main advantages of balloon-expandable stents are the higher radial stiffness and more accurate placement - avoiding geographic miss, which is especially important in aortoiliac bifurcation lesions. Balloon-expandable stents generally have higher radio-opacity, which facilitates accurate placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, balloon-expandable stents are generally considered more appropriate in rigid and straight lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>There are some indirect comparative studies that compared balloon-expandable with self-expandable stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and one direct study that compared self-expandable with balloon-expandable stents in a human ex vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The outcome of two different self-expanding stents (nitinol versus stainless steel) for the treatment of iliac artery lesions was indirectly compared in a multicenter prospective randomized trial. In the CRISP-US trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the 9-month composite end-point rate was equivalent for the SMART stent versus the Wallstent (6.9 vs. 5.9&#x000a0;%), with low rates of restenosis (3.5 vs. 2.7&#x000a0;%), death (2.0 vs. 0.0&#x000a0;%), and revascularization (2.0 vs. 4.0&#x000a0;%) in both groups. Primary patency at 12&#x000a0;months was 94.7 and 91.1&#x000a0;% with the SMART stent and Wallstent, respectively. The MELODIE study demonstrated that The Express LD balloon-expandable stents were indirectly similar to the Palmatz balloon- expandable stent for primary patency (92.1&#x000a0;% at 6&#x000a0;months and 87.8&#x000a0;% at 2&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Grenacher et al. reported that self-expanding stents presented considerably lower radial expansion force and lower degree of precision than balloon-expandable stents in a human cadaver bifurcation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, there is no randomized comparative study that compares primary patency rates of the two different types of stent (self-expandable versus balloon-expandable) in patients with iliac artery disease.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we will compare primary patency rates of self-expandable stents and balloon-expandable stents in real-world clinical practice. In addition, we would like to ascertain whether there are differences in safety, including the incidence of geographic miss rate and stent fracture rate, between both stent groups in steno-occlusive lesions, especially for aortoiliac bifurcation lesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives, hypothesis, and design</title><p>The primary purpose of our study is to compare primary patency between self-expandable nitinol stents and balloon-expandable cobalt-chromium stents in real-world clinical practice (COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; versus SCUBA&#x02122;, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in stenotic or occlusive iliac arterial lesions. The secondary purpose is to ascertain whether there is a difference in safety, including the incidence of geographic miss rate and stent fracture rate between both groups in patients undergoing stent implantation in iliac lesions.

Aspirin and clopidogrel will be administered at least 12&#x000a0;hours before the procedure. Prior to the intervention, 70 to 100 units/kg of unfractionated heparin will be administered. Endovascular interventions will be carried out percutaneously, by placing a 6&#x02013;8Fr sheath at the femoral artery via an antegrade approach or a contralateral crossover technique. In selected cases, a retrograde approach (from the distal superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery, or pedal arteries) and/or brachial approach will be allowed. Diagnostic angiography will be performed in two different views at least 30 to 45&#x000b0; apart to evaluate the structure of the target lesion. Femoropopliteal and tibial arteries will be visually checked for the presence of distal lesions. To document the precise location of the lesion and the site of the intervention, we will recommend the use of a ruler. In cases of total occlusion, both intraluminal and subintimal methods of recanalization will be allowed. During the procedure, the use of other special devices will be allowed; for example reentry devices OUTBACK&#x02122; catheters (Cordis Corp., Miami Lakes, FL, USA) and Offroad catheters (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), chronic total occlusion (CTO) devices Frontrunner (Cordis Corp., Miami Lakes, FL, USA) and Truepath (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), and atherectomy devices such as SilverHawk&#x02122; and TurboHawk&#x02122; (Covidien, Plymouth, MN, USA). After the successful passage of the guidewire, predilation of the target lesion with an optimally sized balloon will be performed prior to stent implantation. Recommended minimal balloon dilation time is 120&#x000a0;seconds. Then, if there is a residual pressure gradient of &#x02265;10&#x000a0;mmHg, residual stenosis of &#x02265;30&#x000a0;%, or flow-limiting dissection, the balloon angioplasty results will be considered as suboptimal results. Subsequently, web-based randomization for stent selection will be performed. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups, the balloon-expandable or self-expandable stent group, according to the stent deployment method. Random allocation of the patients will be performed via a web-based computerized program separately managed at the Cardiovascular Intervention Research Institute (CIRI), Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner according to two different stents (SCUBA&#x02122; versus COMPLETE-SE&#x02122;). The stents will be implanted to extend 10&#x000a0;mm proximally and distally from the margins of the target lesion with luminal narrowing of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;%. A proper stent size will be selected after review of the baseline angiography results. If the stent is randomized to the COMPLETE-SE&#x02122;, a stent with a diameter 1 to 2&#x000a0;mm larger than that of the true vessel lumen will be selected. However, if the stent is randomized to the SCUBA&#x02122; stent, a stent of equal size to the reference vessel diameter will be selected to prevent iliac artery injury. Spot stenting or full lesion coverage will be decided at the physician&#x02019;s discretion. When multiple stents are required, the margins of the stents should be overlapped by at least 10&#x000a0;mm. Adjuvant postdilation after the stenting will be performed strictly within the stented segment, with up to 10&#x000a0;% oversizing of the postdilation balloon.</p><p>The self-expandable COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stent has three distinct crown configurations, and an alternating connection pattern minimizes crown-to-crown interaction and provides optimal flexibility, foreshortening, and lesion coverage for each stent size. The triaxial deployment design includes an inner shaft, a retractable sheath, and a stabilizing sheath, which reduces friction and allows the retractable sheath to move back freely. This decreases the amount of force required to deploy the stent, making deployment easy and accurate. Diameter and length of self-expandable COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stents are 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 150&#x000a0;mm, respectively. Balloon-expandable SCUBA stents are composed of thin cobalt-chromium struts, unlike other stainless steel stents, and have a closed-cell design for tight scaffolding and appropriate radial strength in iliac lesions. Diameter and length of balloon-expandable SCUBA&#x02122; stents are 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm and 20, 30, 40, and 60&#x000a0;mm, respectively. The entire stent size (the COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; and SCUBA&#x02122; stent) is now 6-Fr sheath compatible. We will use either a 0.035&#x0201d; or 0.018&#x0201d; wire system and implant either a SCUBA&#x02122; or COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stent. All ipsilateral femoropopliteal arterial lesions should be treated with angioplasty and/or stenting concomitantly and residual stenosis should be less than 50&#x000a0;%. Treatment of tibioperoneal lesions is recommended only in cases of CLI. There should exist at least one patent (&#x0003c;50&#x000a0;% stenosis) tibioperoneal run-off vessel with good antegrade flow. A final angiography will be performed after the intervention in both groups, with the use of the same angles and magnifications used at the baseline angiograms. Simultaneously, reference vessel diameter (RVD), minimal luminal diameter (MLD), percent diameter stenosis, and acute gain should be measured. The RVD will be obtained from averaging 5-mm segments proximal and distal to the lesion. Technical success will be defined as successful access, deployment of the stent, and less than 30&#x000a0;% diameter residual stenosis after the revascularization. For postprocedural medication, aspirin 100&#x000a0;mg and clopidogrel 75&#x000a0;mg will be administered once daily for at least 12&#x000a0;months. Cilostazol would be permitted as the third antiplatelet at the physician&#x02019;s discretion. After enrollment and index procedure, clinical follow-up will be planned at 1, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months to evaluate clinical outcomes and ankle-brachial index (ABI) score. In addition, a follow-up catheter angiography, CT angiography, or duplex ultrasound will be recommended to all patients at 12&#x000a0;months, according to local clinical practice. The investigators will be urged to follow up on patients, either by office visits or by telephone contacts, as necessary. Patient adherence to the study drug and side effects will be checked and monitored at every outpatient visit. The decision of drug discontinuation will be discussed and checked at the physician&#x02019;s recommendation.</p><p>Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The principal investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study in the event of protocol violations, administrative reasons, or other reasons, e.g., the participant is no longer being treated at a hospital included in the study. It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary end point of this study is the patency rate (stenosis of at least 50&#x000a0;% of the luminal diameter) on catheter or CT angiography or &#x0003c;2.5 of peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR; peak systolic velocity within the area of stenosis divided by peak systolic velocity in a normal adjacent proximal artery segment) in the treated segment at 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention.</p><p>The secondary end points are as follows: (1) geographic miss rate (mild, moderate, severe); geographic miss refers to stent deployment to any area of the vessel that was intended to be treated with the stent but was not covered, or protrusion due to stent jumping, and/or elongation. Geographic miss rate is classified as 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mm (mild), 15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mm (moderate), &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;mm (severe), or additional stent deployment over the stent deployment area that was not covered, or protrusion from the intended stent deployment area; (2) incidence of stent fracture; (3) limb salvage rate free of above-the-ankle amputation; (4) sustained clinical improvement rate at 12-month follow-up; (5) repeated target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate; (6) repeated target extremity revascularization (TER) rate; (7) total reocclusion rate; (8) comparison of angiographic variables including late loss and binary restenosis rate; (9) ABI at 12&#x000a0;months; (10) the rate of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, repeat percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and stroke at 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The detailed definitions are summarized in the <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Although patency definitions varied across trials, 1-year patency rates in aortoiliac lesions were approximately 90&#x000a0;% on average from previous studies including CRISP-US and MELODIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the case of the SCUBA&#x02122; stent, the 9-month patency rate for the SCUBA&#x02122; stent was 99.2&#x000a0;% in the ACTIVE study - a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study that defines the midterm efficacy of a next-generation cobalt-chromium iliac stent for the treatment of de novo and restenotic lesions in iliac arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a different definition - a ratio of &#x0003c;2.4 between the duplex peak systolic velocity in the treated vessel segment and the reference systolic velocity - was used, unlike the more common definition. There are limited data on the 1-year primary patency rate of the SCUBA&#x02122; stent. Based on the MELODIE trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the European multicenter iliac stent trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the 1-year primary patency of the SCUBA&#x02122; stent was estimated to be 88&#x000a0;%, and the COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stent was estimated to be 94.7&#x000a0;% in the CRISP-US trial. Therefore, the self-expandable COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stent group will be the control group, and the balloon-expandable SCUBA&#x02122; stent group will be the experimental group.</p><p>Patency rate will be defined as absence of occlusion and absence of &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% stenosis in the treated segment by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) or if invasive angiography is not performed, PSVR &#x02264;2.5 when evaluated with duplex ultrasound. On the basis of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we hypothesize that the expected patency rate after stent deployment at 1&#x000a0;year would be 90&#x000a0;% for the self-expandable stent group, and 88&#x000a0;% for the balloon-expandable stent group, respectively. The predetermined noninferiority margin &#x003b4; is a 10&#x000a0;% difference between treatment groups. There was clinical consensus that this noninferiority margin would be acceptable if safety is maintained and patients are treated more easily, regardless of stent classification. The power analysis is based on a noninferiority principle. The statistical significance level is 2.5&#x000a0;% at one side, the power of the test is set as 80&#x000a0;%, and the randomization ratio is set as 1:1. The test for proportion and the chi-square method will be used. Using standard sample size formula, it was calculated that 120 patients per group are needed for a total of 288 patients, after accounting for a 20&#x000a0;% dropout rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The IBM SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) statistics program will be used for all analysis. Categorical variables will be expressed as delivery rate when comparing baseline features between the SCUBA&#x02122; and COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stent groups and for categorical variables, comparisons between groups will use the chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation, and for continuous variables, comparisons between groups will use the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. The primary and secondary end points will be analyzed using both intention-to-treat analysis (all subjects assigned to a treatment group) and per protocol analysis (only subjects who completed the treatment protocol). Noninferiority will be considered proven if conclusions drawn from the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses are consistent. Balloon-expandable stent patency will be judged as noninferior to that of the self-expandable stent when the lower limit of the 95&#x000a0;% CI of the difference between the proportions of patent patients at 1&#x000a0;year in both groups is higher than -&#x003b4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;10&#x000a0;% At the end of the 12&#x000a0;months, cumulative restenosis rates will be calculated. For a secondary end point, we will summarize with descriptive statistics and compare between treatment groups using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test, chi-square test, or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Also, clinical outcomes such as revascularization of the target vessel, death, major cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction, and limb salvage rates will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and a comparison of the groups will be performed using the log-rank test. A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. In order to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence, defined as restenosis or total occlusion, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed.

In performing endovascular repair for iliac artery lesion, different strategies and types of stents are needed, as described above. There is no general consensus on which stents, balloon-expandable or self-expandable stents are the most appropriate for specific lesion of the iliac artery.</p><p>The factors associated with patency after stent implantation in iliac lesion have been known to be various: patient characteristics, lesion characteristics, and so on. Recently, various self-expandable nitinol stents have been manufactured with improved radial force, reduced stent deformity or fracture, and convenient deployment systems. Currently, self-expandable nitinol stents have been the most widely used.</p><p>The next-generation balloon-expandable stent has been developed. The first Assurant&#x000ae; balloon-expandable stent system (Medtronic, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) made from a cobalt-chromium alloy is to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of narrowed iliac arteries. The mechanical properties of the cobalt-chromium alloy allow the device to have thinner struts and a low profile, which provide increased flexibility while maintaining radial strength and fluoroscopic visibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the ACTIVE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the balloon-expandable Assurant&#x000ae; cobalt-chromium iliac stent demonstrated primary patency at 9&#x000a0;months of 99.2&#x000a0;%, device and lesion success were each 97.5&#x000a0;% (155/159), and the procedural success was 96.7&#x000a0;%.</p><p>In real-world clinical practice, physicians tend to deploy self-expanding stents in the mid-iliac area due to severe angulation and tortuosity for fear of iliac artery injury including extravasation, dissection, or rupture following high-pressure balloon inflation with longer balloon-expandable stents. It will be of interest to see the safety rate of balloon-expandable stents in the tortuous mid-iliac artery.</p><p>However, because of the possibility of &#x02018;geographic miss&#x02019;- by stent elongation or jumping during stent deployment - which may cause stent fracture, in-stent restenosis, and contralateral artery flow limitation, the balloon-expandable stent has been recommended for accurate stent deployment, especially in bifurcation lesion, including common iliac artery ostium. It will also be important to compare the geographic miss rate between the balloon-expandable SCUBA stents and self-expandable COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; stents in iliac artery lesion, especially aortoiliac bifurcation lesion.</p><p>One of the significant limitations to previous studies is that they were nonrandomized studies of relatively small sample size, indirect comparisons, or expert opinions. To date, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial for direct comparison of efficacy and safety between self-expandable stents and balloon-expandable stents has not been done.</p><p>This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety between self-expandable COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; versus balloon-expandable SCUBA&#x02122; stents in patients undergoing stent implantation in iliac artery lesions and will provide a rationale for which choice of stent will be optimal in iliac steno-occlusive disease, particularly with regard to accurate lesion location.</p><p>In conclusion, we still do not know whether there is a difference in primary patency, incidence of geographic miss, and stent fracture between self-expandable nitinol stents and balloon-expandable cobalt-chromium stents (COMPLETE-SE&#x02122; versus SCUBA&#x02122;) in stenotic or occlusive iliac arterial lesion. We hope to address these issues in the SENS-ILIAC trial where we have enrolled a large unselected population of patients treated with stent implantation for significant iliac arterial disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is ongoing and is recruiting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABI, ankle-brachial index; CEAC, Clinical Event Adjudication Committee; CIRI, Cardiovascular Intervention Research Institute; CLI, critical limb ischemia; CT, computed tomography; CTO, chronic total occlusion; DSMB, Data and Safety Monitoring Board; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; Hct, hematocrit; Hgb, hemoglobin; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular event; MLD, minimal luminal diameter; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; PSVR, peak systolic velocity ratio; PTA, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; QCA, quantitative coronary angiography; RVD, reference vessel diameter; SFA, superficial femoral artery; TASC, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus; TER, target extremity revascularization; TLR, target lesion revascularization</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>1.
