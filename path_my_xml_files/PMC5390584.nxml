Belonging to the group of opportunistic infections, it often affects individuals with various debilitating diseases. Fluconazole and clotrimazole are two of the commonly used anti-fungal agents for the treatment of oral candidiasis. Hence, we planned this study to evaluate the effectiveness of fluconazole and clotrimazole in the treatment of patients suffering from candidiasis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 180 participants were enrolled in the present study. All the patients of candidiasis were divided broadly into two study groups. Group I included patients who were treated with fluconazole mouthrinse whereas group II included patients who were treated with clotrimazole mouth paint. Grading of patient discomfort was done as noted from readings given by the patients. Specimen was collection by a swab from the lesional area of the oral cavity from the patients and were incubated in Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium and assessed. All the patients were treated with medication as give to their respective groups. Patients were recalled as assessed. All the readings were recorded and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>For group I patients, the fungal eradication was 89.5%, whereas for group II patients, the fungal eradication was 86.7%. No significant results were obtained while comparing the mycological eradiation in patients of the two study groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Approximately similar effectiveness in terms of treatment was noted with fluconazole and clotrimazole in treating patients with candidiasis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>K<sc>eywords</sc></title><kwd><italic>Candidiasis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>clotrimazole</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>fluconazole</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>ntroduction</sc></title><p><italic>Candida</italic> genus, in particular <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, is the one of the common cause of yeast-associated oral infections.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There occurrence has been widely described in the literature. Over the last four to five decades, the frequency and incidence of occurrence of candidiasis has significantly increased. The main reason that might attribute for such an increase in its incidence might be the increase in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other immuno-compromising states and diseases. It also occurs more frequently among elderly individuals.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>More than 150 different species of asporogenous &#x0201c;yeast-like&#x0201d; fungi comprises <italic>Candida</italic> genus. The distribution of all the members of this genus is ubiquitous and consists of inhabitation of soil as saprophytes, aquatic environment, and even colonization of various animal reservoirs. At 37&#x000b0;C, the growth of most of <italic>Candida</italic> spices is prohibited, and therefore, human colonization is not associated with it under normal conditions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Within humans, several species persist as commensal microorganism and can act as potential opportunistic pathogen in compromised body status. With respect to the treatment of these oral fungal infections, the most common line of treatment is the removal of the etiologic factor along with suitable anti-fungal therapy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Few of the routinely employed anti-fungal agents include fluconazole and clotrimazole. There is a paucity of data regarding the comparative evaluation of the abovementioned anti-fungal agents in the treatment of oral candidiasis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, we planned this study to evaluate the effectiveness of fluconazole and clotrimazole in the treatment of patients suffering from candidiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>The present study was conducted in the department of oral medicine and radiology of the dental institute and included assessment of 180 participants with chief problem of oral candidiasis from 2010 to 2015. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethical committee and written consent was obtained after explaining in detail the entire research protocol. Complete physical examination of the patients was done before starting the treatment therapy of the patients. Recording of the time duration of the candidiasis was done along with other personal details of the patients. Exclusion criteria for the present study included:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pregnant patients,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who underwent any kind of anti-fungal therapy in the past 1 month,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who were on barbiturates or anticoagulants in the past 1 month,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with any known drug allergy,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with alcohol history,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with history of any psychiatric disorder.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All the patients were broadly divided into two study groups. Group I included patients who were under treatment with fluconazole therapy whereas group II included patients who were on clotrimazole therapy. Based on the clinical history, visual examination of the lesion area and presence of clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis of the candidiasis was made. Both the signs and symptoms of candidiasis were graded by patients into the following categories based on the severity of the lesion and individual perception:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mild,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moderate, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Symptoms&#x02019; severity was categorized on the basis patient's response to discomfort whereas sign's severity was categorized on the basis of extent of lesion. Mild referred to cases which involved localized involvement to one or two oral sites, moderate referred to localized involvement of more than two oral sites, whereas severe cases involved generalized oral candidiasis. Microbiological culture assessment was done to confirm the diagnosis of oral candidiasis. Swab was taken from the lesion area of the patients and was transferred to the microbiological laboratory in the transport medium for culturing. They were incubated in Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium for assessment of culture growth characteristics. All the samples were incubated in the culture medium at 37&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 days. Counting of the yeast colonies was done 48 hours after incubation.</p><p>In group I patients, preparation of fluconazole suspension was done and were given to all the patients in the form of prepared moth rinse. Patients were instructed to use the suspension mouth rinse three times a day. In group II patient, suspension of clotrimazole was given in the form of moth paint and patients were instructed to use it thrice daily. Recalling of the patients was done after 2 weeks of continuation of the treatment therapy and was examined thoroughly for the presence of clinical signs and symptoms; microbial growth was assessed by culturing swab specimens as done earlier before the starting of the treatment. All the results were analyzed by PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc. Chi-square test and student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the assessment of level of significance. <italic>P</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant.

First group consisted of 70 patients and included those patients who received intravaginal tablet whereas the other group included 72 patients and consisted of participants who were given single dose oral fluconazole. They observed that, at the time of follow-up, during the second visit of the patients, approximately 85% and 81% of the patients of the group receiving fluconazole were cured clinically and mycologically, respectively. Similarly in the other study group, approximately 83% and 70% of the study group patients were cured clinically and mycologically, respectively.

They randomly analyzed 34 infants and were randomly subjected to either nystatin oral suspension four times a day for 10 days or fluconazole suspension 3 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 7 days. They observed that among the patients treated with nystatin, the clinical curing rate was 32%, while in the other group, a success rate of 100% was observed.
