However, the focus has been predominantly on performance aspects, meaning less is known about the effect of CHO supplementation on perceptual responses. Studies which do consider such measures, tend to evaluate the relationship using the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scale to determine whether CHO ingestion can influence &#x02018;what&#x02019; a person feels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The general consensus is that RPE can be attenuated, a phenomenon explained by higher blood glucose levels which permits faster rates of CHO oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In order to gain a broader understanding of individuals&#x02019; subjective experiences during exercise, both the feeling scale (FS) and felt arousal scale (FAS) can also be employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite being easily administered during exercise, the use of these tools is a novel area of research, especially where CHO ingestion is concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These scales provide single item measures of affect which can supplement findings related to perceived exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The FS gauges individuals&#x02019; affective valence, specifically &#x02018;how&#x02019; a person feels i.e., pleasure or displeasure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Backhouse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported higher FS ratings following CHO ingestion during prolonged cycling demonstrating participants &#x02018;felt better&#x02019; in comparison to the placebo ingestion trial, even in the very early stages of the exercise bout. The FAS allows quantification of participants&#x02019; perceived level of arousal/activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Backhouse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] also found participants to be more activated in the final 30&#x000a0;min of prolonged, high intensity exercise following CHO ingestion. The profile of mood states (POMS) is a common mood evaluation test, providing composite mood scores as well as various subscale scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Numerous studies have found that CHO ingestion reduced moods such as tension and fatigue, in comparison to ingesting a placebo solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>CHO ingestion before and during exercise is proposed to aid in sustaining optimal functioning of the central nervous system, improving perceptual responses as a result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Duckworth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] suggest that CHO ingestion prevents the development of a hypoglycaemic state via the maintenance of blood glucose levels. This, in effect, ensures necessary areas of the brain such as the motor cortex remain sufficiently activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, the onset of fatigue is delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If hypoglycaemia does develop, this is reported to increase perceived fatigue and lethargy, reduce arousal and undesirably affect mood indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The performance improvements ensuing CHO ingestion can also be explained by the maintenance of blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], in addition to increased CHO oxidation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and sparing of muscle glycogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that these possible mechanisms apply only to prolonged exercise, such as cycling at a moderate intensity in excess of 2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CHO ingestion during exercise of a shorter duration (&#x02264;60&#x000a0;min) at a higher intensity has also been shown to improve performance, but for different reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Blood glucose reportedly does not decrease and glycogen depletion is not considered to limit exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Carter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] provided evidence to support this notion by testing the effects of intravenous glucose infusion on 1-h cycle time-trial performance. Despite CHO being readily available for oxidation, performance was no different from saline infusion, suggesting that maintaining blood glucose is not imperative for performance in such events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a result, alternative hypotheses were proposed concerning central as opposed to metabolic mechanisms.</p><p>Carter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] repeated their previous study, adjusting the methodology to involve participants rinsing the CHO solution in their mouths and then expelling it, a technique now recognised as CHO mouth rinsing. Performance improvements were considerably greater when rinsing with CHO compared to placebo, and were equivalent to improvements previously witnessed with CHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A comparison of both techniques indicated that CHO mouth rinsing may be superior to CHO ingestion where time-trial performance enhancement is concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This has been attributed to the activation of oral receptors, stimulating brain centres involved in reward and motivation, ultimately increasing central drive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Researchers have proposed that this phenomenon, also known as the central mechanism hypothesis, may also impact perceptual responses; however evidence to support such claims is limited.</p><p>Not all studies show improvements in performance following CHO mouth rinsing. Beelen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported no performance benefits from CHO mouth rinsing when participants were in a fed state. They suggested that, from an evolutionary perspective, it would make more sense for small amounts of CHO in the mouth to be more ergogenic, and affect reward centres in the brain, when glycogen levels were already reduced. However, no studies have examined the effect of CHO mouth rinsing in a fasted state on mood and affect during exercise. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether perceived exertion, affect, activation and mood is influenced by mouth rinsing or ingesting CHO solutions during high-intensity cycling exercise when muscle and liver glycogen stores were compromised. We hypothesised that CHO ingestion and CHO mouth rinse will provide similar perceptual and mood responses during exercise, with both being superior to placebo ingestion and/or rinse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was part of a larger investigation examining the effects of CHO ingestion and CHO mouth rinsing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the perceptual and mood data will be presented here.

As expected RPE and FAS increased whereas FS decreased from the start to the end of exercise but there were no differences between trials. The composite POMS score was not influenced by mouth rinsing or ingestion. However, there was an interaction effect for the &#x02018;vigour&#x02019; subscale with higher ratings over time in CHOI relative to the other three trials.</p><p>The progressive increase in RPE witnessed in the present study is common in exercise performance trials. Researchers have made a direct link between RPE and performance, suggesting that by attenuating a rise in RPE, performance can be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Reducing participants&#x02019; perception of exertion when exercising at a given intensity may result in a compensatory increase in exercise intensity, permitting performance improvements otherwise unattainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. RPE values between the four trials in the present study did not appear to differ, however an increase in power output was evident in the trial involving CHOI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Specifically, although there were no differences in performance time between trials (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21), power output was higher in CHOI (231&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33 W) relative to other trials (221&#x02013;224 W; main effect of treatment, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Furthermore, power output decreased throughout the time trial (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) but there was no interaction of treatment x time (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41). This suggests that the ingestion of glucose may have facilitated the ergogenic effect, without the concomitant rise in perceived exertion expected. Chong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] came to a similar conclusion when comparing the combined effect of ingesting and mouth rinsing with either CHO or placebo solutions. Despite peak power output being higher in the glucose trial, RPE did not differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>This poses the question regarding whether glucose ingestion can facilitate an improvement in peak power output, without causing a concomitant rise in RPE. An attempt to explain such a phenomenon was made by Gant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] who found that corticomotor output to muscles could be aided by glucose ingestion, whether the muscles were fatigued or not. Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] attribute this outcome to the activation of reward areas of the brain via stimulation of CHO receptors in the mouth. Such brain areas, specifically the insula/frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex and striatum, are proposed to be involved with lowering perceived exertion during exercise by supressing fatigue signals sent from the muscles to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While this commonly reported theory seems plausible, it does not provide a justification for why an increase in power output was not witnessed in the CHOR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Gant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] suggest that subsequent increases in force production following CHO ingestion could be attributed to peripheral factors such as the rise in blood glucose, as opposed to central factors involving the primary motor cortex. It is likely that performance improvements witnessed as a result of CHOI are due to the higher oxidation rate, prompted by initially reduced glycogen stores. Commencing experiments with a glycogen reducing exercise was decided based on an initial review of similar literature. Beelen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that CHO mouth rinsing had no ergogenic effect when participants underwent trials in the fed state. In order to determine whether mouth rinsing may have a stronger impact in a CHO-depleted state, participants&#x02019; liver and muscle glycogen was diminished through an exercise protocol and an overnight fast the day prior to experimental trials. Despite this, the ergogenic properties of CHOI prevailed over that of mouth rinsing, leading to enhanced vigour, as measured using the POMS questionnaire.</p><p>Considering the purported impact of CHO mouth rinsing on areas of the brain associated with reward and pleasure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] there is little research examining perceptual responses and mood during exercise. Our study is the first to specifically examine perceptual and mood responses following ingestion and rinsing with both CHO and placebo solutions. Rollo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that mouth rinsing with CHO significantly increased FS ratings (higher pleasurable feelings) immediately prior to the 30-min run in comparison to rinsing with a placebo solution. However, this variance did not remain once the exercise had commenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; this finding is contrary to that of the present study whereby no differences were observed at any stage of the trial between either mouth rinse solutions. Backhouse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported heightened levels of pleasure following CHO ingestion during a longer exercise bout consisting of 120&#x000a0;min cycling. It appeared to attenuate the decline in pleasure ratings which occurred following placebo ingestion, a discovery attributable to higher blood glucose and a reduction in plasma cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is contrary to findings of the present study, in which no apparent differences between ingesting or rinsing a CHO solution were apparent.</p><p>A multidimensional approach to perceptual responses during exercise can be achieved simultaneously assessing FS and FAS results using what has been described as the &#x02018;circumplex model&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In isolation, FS and FAS results may provide insufficient evidence to confidently conclude the effectiveness of a technique, however the combination provides a more in-depth insight into an individual&#x02019;s subjective experience. Backhouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] applied the circumplex model to CHO ingestion, however the application to studies involving CHO mouth rinsing has previously not been explored. A comparison of the circumplex models populated for both the CHO mouth rinsing and CHO ingestion trials from the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) provided insufficient evidence to conclude the superiority of one treatment over the other. Pre- and post-trial values were similarly positioned, as were the measured time points in-between. However, comparing CHOR and CHOI to their placebo counterparts revealed noticeable shifts in post-trial value quadrant positions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Trials involving CHO, regardless of whether this was rinsed or ingested, resulted in post-trial values nearer the &#x02018;high-activation, pleasure&#x02019; quadrant, whereas the placebo trials resulted in end values situated in the &#x02018;high-activation, displeasure&#x02019; quadrant. This suggests that CHO administration via either ingestion or mouth rinsing may prove beneficial where energy, vigour, revitalisation and excitement are concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the data is not overly clear therefore the application of the circumplex model to similar future studies would be highly recommended.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Circumplex model of affect using felt arousal scale (FAS; y-axis) and feeling scale (FS; x-axis) ratings. <bold>a</bold> PLAI &#x02013; placebo ingestion trial; <bold>b</bold> PLAR &#x02013; placebo mouth rinse trial; <bold>c</bold> CHOI &#x02013; carbohydrate ingestion trial; <bold>d</bold> CHOR &#x02013; carbohydrate mouth rinse trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12970_2016_161_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p><p>Phillips et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] did not ascertain a link between CHO mouth rinsing and sensations of arousal. However they propose that the impact on perceptual measures may be reflected in other central adaptations or alternatively may be due to the fact that the FAS was not sensitive enough. Nevertheless, results from the present study suggest that there were very few alterations to any perceptual measures as a result of the mouth rinsing intervention. Rollo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] also failed to observe a change in arousal following CHO mouth rinsing. In contrast, others have shown significant improvements in perceived activation when CHO was ingested during prolonged exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Such a finding is attributed to the arrival of energy in the form of carbohydrate following exposure to CHO in the mouth, meaning solely rinsing the mouth may subconsciously deceive participants when feedback is sent to the brain that no fuel has arrived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The discrepancy between research by Backhouse et al. and that of our study may be explained by significant differences in protocol, with the 1&#x000a0;h cycling time trial of the present study being of a much shorter duration than the 1.5&#x02013;2 h of cycling completed in both previous studies.</p><p>It is also worth noting the relevance of plasma glucose values when discussing perceptual responses. In the present study, despite plasma glucose being significantly higher in the CHOI trials, minimal differences appeared to exist when comparing the subjective experiences of participants between this and the CHOR trials. However, it poses the question of whether the higher work output which CHO ingestion permitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], actually negated the possibility of participants&#x02019; simultaneously feeling better and more aroused. Such a notion can only be confirmed by adjusting the protocol of a future study, keeping exercise intensity constant to ensure the individuals subjective experience is not confounded by other outcomes.</p><p>This is the first study to use the POMS to gauge the effects of CHO mouth rinsing and ingestion in the fasted state meaning direct comparisons to other work is not possible. The suggestion that CHO mouth rinsing can stimulate pleasure and reward centres in the brain implies that mood may be enhanced accordingly. The anticipated effect of CHOR enhancing mood to a greater extent due to the prolonged period for oral receptor activation was not witnessed. This suggests that the speculated areas of the brain involved in this mechanism may in fact not be associated with mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Despite this observation, the application of the composite POMS score to the present study may in fact not be overly applicable given the context. The composite score considers a variety of mood states, some of which have less relevance where exercise is concerned, for example depression and anxiety. Therefore, the analysis of certain subscales may provide particularly valuable insight. CHOI facilitated the maintenance of &#x02018;vigour&#x02019; subscale values from pre to post-exercise (and a trend for reduced &#x02018;fatigue&#x02019; ratings), preventing the decline witnessed in all other trials. Winnick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] propose that the decline in vigour ratings among other trials may be linked to the accumulation of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain by its precursor, tryptophan, ultimately triggered by higher blood free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and consequential tryptophan transport to the brain. 5-HT is reported as having dopamine-inhibitory effects, a consequence which appears to be prevented by CHOI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, without measuring 5-HT and tryptophan levels such explanations can only be regarded as speculation.</p><p>Although the combined application of RPE, FS, FAS and POMS enables an all-encompassing evaluation of perceptual measures, future studies in this area would benefit from increasing participant numbers due to the sensitivity of these measures. A further limitation was the inability to blind subjects to which protocol was taking place due to the nature of this experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Mouth rinsing with CHO did not influence participants&#x02019; perceived exertion, pleasure or perceived activation before, during or after a 1&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;cycle time trial relative to placebo. However, the ingestion of CHO did facilitate increases in plasma glucose and performance improvements as measured by power output. The improvement in power output evident when participants ingested a CHO solution suggests that consumption may aid in preventing the concomitant rise in perceived exertion generally seen when a greater amount of work is completed. Similarly, overall mood assessed via the POMS questionnaire did not appear to be influenced by either mouth rinsing or ingestion of CHO when compared to placebo. Interestingly, CHO ingestion did seem to prevent the typical decline in vigour ratings from pre to post-exercise seen in the remaining three trials. A link has been proposed between this finding and dopamine inhibitory effects; however more research is warranted to confirm or refute this suggestion. It is possible that in extreme CHO-reduced conditions, such as those faced by the participants in the present study, potential activation of cranial pathways by mouth rinsing is not enough to offset the necessity for plasma glucose levels to be maintained.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Simone Ackermann, Sarah Jansen, Wendy Jessup and Laura Kingsley-Smith for help with data collection, Simon Bennett for technical support, Leiyan Wang for statistical analysis assistance and the participants for providing their time and effort to complete this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received for this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Please contact author for data requests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CM, MJYY and AA carried out the data collection.
