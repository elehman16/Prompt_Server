Furthermore, children with severe malarial anemia had a mortality rate of 8.6%, compared with 3.6% in children with severe anemia due to other causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Malarial anemia is well known as a major complication of symptomatic parasitemia. Less well known is that it is also significantly associated with low-density asymptomatic parasitemia in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

However, little is known about the effect of community-level treatment of asymptomatic carriers on Hb levels. Reducing malaria transmission within a population through the systematic screening and treatment of asymptomatic persons could potentially improve Hb levels.</p><p>This cluster-randomized trial of 18 villages in Sapon&#x000e9;, Burkina Faso, investigated whether systematic screening and treatment of asymptomatic carriers of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (AL) during three community screening campaigns (Campaigns 1&#x02013;3) could reduce the burden of malaria and whether this intervention, in addition to the routine treatment of symptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> carriers with AL, could improve Hb levels and reduce the prevalence of anemia. Primary outcomes were the number of microscopy-confirmed cases of symptomatic malaria with a parasite density &#x0003e;5,000/&#x003bc;l per person-year in infants and children &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years of age and the change in Hb level from Day 1 to Day 28 of Campaign 1 in asymptomatic carriers &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months of age, between the intervention and control arm. Results from the first primary outcome showed that systematic screening with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and treatment of asymptomatic carriers did not reduce clinical malaria incidence in the subsequent transmission season. The number of symptomatic malaria episodes at 12&#x000a0;months (microscopy-confirmed symptomatic malaria episodes including fever and a parasite density &#x0003e;5,000/&#x003bc;l) per person-year in infants and children aged &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years was 1.69 (SD&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.436) in the intervention arm vs. 1.60 (SD&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.526) in the control arm (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.3482).

However, more research is needed to understand if this is a direct effect of AL therapy. While it is known that AL has a consistently high efficacy and safety in the treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], some factors in this study, such as the concurrent treatment of all symptomatic cases in both arms, and the use of LLINs, may have contributed to the improved Hb levels. It should be noted that these short-term improvements in Hb levels did correlate with the reduction in carriage of asexual forms and gametocytes seen in these asymptomatic carriers after 28&#x000a0;days of AL therapy (there was a significant reduction in asymptomatic and gametocyte carriage from baseline to the assessment at the beginning of Campaigns 2 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Only 0.2% of patients in the intervention arm and none in control arm required hematinic treatment (for Hb &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;g/dl on Day 1 of Campaign 1), making it unlikely that this intervention influenced the overall Hb changes.</p><p>While the interventions in the study resulted in a significantly greater increase in Hb in asymptomatic carriers aged &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months over 28&#x000a0;days in the intervention arm than in the control arm, this improvement was not of a sufficient magnitude to be considered clinically meaningful. This was probably because the mean baseline Hb level in both arms was within the normal range (intervention: 11.81&#x000a0;g/dl; control 11.86&#x000a0;g/dl), making a large increase in Hb unlikely. However, over these 28&#x000a0;days, it is encouraging that (a) a significantly larger proportion of asymptomatic carriers aged &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months up to &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years in the intervention arm raised their Hb levels by &#x02265;2.0&#x000a0;g/dl than in the control arm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and (b) the proportion of these asymptomatic carriers with anemia in the intervention arm decreased substantially more than that in the control arm (31.1% vs. 4.7%; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that while the reduction in anemia in asymptomatic carriers was sustained in the intervention arm over 12&#x000a0;months, anemia was also reduced in the control arm over this period. This suggests a possible study effect owing to the availability of AL for all confirmed cases of symptomatic malaria and the provision of an LLIN to every participant in the study. A recent study, which examined the coverage of malaria control interventions in Burkina Faso, reported that 59% of households in the study population owned an insecticide-treated bednet (ITN) and only 34% of children under 5&#x000a0;years of age with a reported malaria case were treated with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible that receipt of an LLIN by every study participant increased the use of ITNs in both study arms. A Cochrane Review of the impact of medicated bednets concluded that sleeping under one improved Hb level in children by 1.7% packed cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, the high level of general medical attention and easy availability of a high-quality ACT to treat confirmed malaria cases throughout the duration of the study may have contributed to a reduction in parasite levels in both arms as compared with baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>While the impact of improved Hb levels on quality of life is not known, it has previously been shown that asymptomatic infection can also affect cognitive performance, and that treatment of asymptomatic malaria improves children&#x02019;s cognitive ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has also been shown, through fixed effects estimates, that asymptomatic malaria and the presence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasites have a direct, causal correlation with educational achievement and cognitive performance in primary school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Further research is needed to understand the potential benefit on quality of life of improving Hb levels through treatment of asymptomatic carriers with AL. This is particularly pertinent as asymptomatic carriers tend not to seek treatment yet may benefit from AL therapy.</p><p>Hb levels in the community (all subjects) increased over 12&#x000a0;months, with no significant difference between the intervention and control arms in mean levels or distribution, and median and 25th percentile Hb levels remained above the defined limit for anemia at all times in both arms. Again, the treatment of all symptomatic cases, and the widespread use of LLINs in both arms, could make it difficult to identify any direct benefit on Hb levels due to the treatment of asymptomatic carriers in the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that systematic screening and treatment of asymptomatic carriers of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with AL at the community level may improve Hb levels and reduce the prevalence of anemia in asymptomatic children over the short term. Further research is needed to establish whether these Hb improvements are linked directly to the treatment of asymptomatic carriers with AL and to quantify the clinical significance of any treatment-related Hb improvements. No longer-term (12&#x000a0;months) Hb improvements in asymptomatic carriers, or at a community level, were noted, although these outcomes were possibly influenced by confounding factors, such as the treatment of all confirmed cases of symptomatic malaria with AL and the provision of an LLIN to every participant in the study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01256658.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Graeme Baldwin from PreScript Communications provided editorial support sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG.
