with depression. [Subjects] Twenty-four patients who were diagnosed with depression were
randomly selected and divided into two groups, an experimental group which performed
Nordic walking, and a control group, which performed normal walking. [Methods] Both groups
practiced their respective walking exercise for 50 minutes per day, three times a week for
eight weeks. To compare the effects of the intervention, psychological factors using the
Beck depression inventory and sleep quality was assessed using the Korean version
Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Skeletal muscle mass, fat free mass, body mass index, body
fat percentage, and basal metabolism were estimated three times by a body composition
analyzer, before the intervention, four weeks after the intervention, and eight weeks
after the intervention. [Results] There was a significant difference in depression with a
main effect of time in both groups. There was also a significant difference in sleep in
over time and interaction. The differences over time between the two groups were
significant for depression, sleep, and skeletal muscle mass. [Conclusion] The results
suggests that Nordic walking has a positive effect on depression and sleeping disorders of
the elderly, suggesting that Nordic walking based exercise programs should be developed
for the elderly who suffer from depression or a sleeping disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Nordic walking</kwd><kwd>Sleep</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Elderly people experience rapid physical aging and deterioration of physical function as
they get older<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Depression in senescence,
in particular, is known to not only decrease life satisfaction, but to also increase the
potential mortality rate due to increased occurrence rate of physical disease and greater
risk of suicide, if not properly treated<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In looking at the literature on elderly people&#x02019;s depression, depression shown throughout
the senescence is closely related to the stress. Here, the stress due to old age is the
direct cause of depression<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is,
stress coming from physical disease, death of a spouse, worsening financial situation,
isolation from family and society, emigration, etc. can cause specific symptoms of
depression<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, aged people frequently complain about health problems due to diminished sleep
quality, despite unchanged length of sleeping time<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Worsening sleep quality is a very common problem among aged people,
and it is aggravated by aging. The change in the sleeping pattern is a normal phenomenon
that takes place with aging, but an altered sleeping pattern sometimes linked to sleep
disturbance. As a result, about 14&#x02013;42% of elderly people complain of sleep disturbance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sleep disturbance causes physical, social, and psychological weakness among elderly people,
affecting their daily life causing decrease in activity, feelings of impotence, a sense of
alienation, depression, and feelings of loss. Sleep disturbance can be a risk factor as well
as a predisposing factor for elderly people, that triggering fatigue, anxiety, and
depression. Sustained sleep disturbance of elderly people sometime actually connected to the
development of depression in the elderly<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the stress that is one of the causes of sleep disturbance, and some empirical
studies of elderly people argue that stress of elderly people tends to increase in the
elderly as they have relatively less response to interventions, mediating strategies or
competency compared to other age groups. It is known that the magnitude of impact from this
kind of stress differs according to cognitive function of each individual<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As the most effective means of preventing elderly people&#x02019;s psychological problems caused by
aging, such as depression, life stress, and lowered self-esteem, physical activity and
aerobic exercise of mid-level intensity have received attention<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regular aerobic exercise has many advantages for the
maintenance or reinforcement of physical strength as it provides the body with proper
stimulus. Among various aerobic exercises, walking exercise is effective at burning fat and
improving cardiopulmonary function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
it poses little risk of injury because has minor impacts on the joints. Hence, it is often
recommended as an effective exercise for the obese. Moreover, walking, which is a rhythmic
and dynamic aerobic exercise of sufficient intensity, does not only provides a practical way
of promoting health and improving cardiopulmonary function, but also known to be very
effective at burning fat. Accordingly, many people practice walking these days. Moreover,
diverse types of walking have been recently introduced. Nordic walking is one of them.
Nordic walking moves all the muscles in the upper body during walking, including the arms,
shoulders, chest, back, etc., in addition to lower body exercise. It also consumes
approximately 30&#x02013;70% more energy than general walking. Moreover, it puts less pressure on
the knee and joints and has a relatively low risk of injury since poles are held by both
hands. As it has been reported to be an exercise suitable for the old and infirm, the number
of people participating in Nordic walking is increasing<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, as Nordic walking does not require high technique and it
is also inexpensive, making participation easy for everybody. The use of poles activates
muscles in the upper body and regular practice increases the walking speed and stride.
Nordic walking has been reported to be effective at enhancing the cardiopulmonary functions
of healthy individuals<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study that compared walking with Nordic walking reported that Nordic walking is more
effective at reducing body fat, weight, and body fat percentage, as it increases use of
adipose tissues, than to general walking<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that for preventing incidents rate
following functional deterioration of aged persons, it is necessary to consider the factors
such as brisk walking, gender, BMI, depression, and age<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As such, since Nordic walking consumes more energy efficiently than general walking for the
same time spent, should be able to satisfy the diverse needs of busy modern people. Even
though there are a number of recent studies that have examined the effects of physical
symptoms of Nordic exercise, the studies that have investigated its impact on depression and
sleep disturbance are comparatively rare as of now.</p><p>Hence, this study analyzed the impacts on Nordic walking and general walking on
psychological and physical health aspects through an 8-week training program, to determine
whether or not Nordic walking is a healthy exercise that can ameliorate elderly people&#x02019;s
depression and sleep disturbance. A secondary objective was to provide ordinary people with
walking difficulties with information about enjoying aerobic exercise from the aspect of
mental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Elderly people who were diagnosed with depression at Center G located in Metropolitan City
G in Korea were selected as research subjects. All the subjects provided their informed
consent before participating in this study, which was approved by the Dong Shin University
Faculty of Health Sciences Human Ethics Committee. Prior to their experiment participation
in this study, the subjects listened to an explanation about the purpose, method, and
procedure of the experiment, after which they provided their consent to participation. A
total of 24 subjects with depression accompanied by sleep disturbance were evenly divided
into the Nordic walking group and general walking group by random assignment. The inclusion
criteria for participation in this study were: those of depression with Beck depression
inventory (BDI) score over 18; those with sleep disturbance with Pittsburgh sleep quality
index (PSQI) score over 5; the ability to perform on regular exercise without of the nervous
system or the circulatory on system; and sufficient cognitive ability to be able to learn
the basic techniques required for walking, to Nordic walking and actually perform them. The
subjects had a (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) age of 75.20&#x000b1;6.25&#x02005;year, a height of
161.04&#x000b1;9.36&#x02005;cm, and weighed 60.70&#x000b1;11.09&#x02005;kg for weight.</p><p>The exercise program for the two groups followed the sequence of cooling, main exercise,
and cooling-down. During warming-up, stretching of muscles related to walking exercise was
performed for ten times in three sets for each muscle. The cardiovascular endurance of each
individual was measured using a wireless heart rate monitor to determine the target heart
rate, and the subject followed the exercise program aiming at the target heart rate<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intervention lasted a total of eight
weeks, during which the exercise was performed three times a week at the same time of the
day. The 50-minute exercise consisted of 10 minutes of warming-up, 30 minutes of main
exercise, and 10 minutes of cooling. The exercise intensity was set at 40% of what during
the early phase of weeks 1&#x02013;4, 60% during weeks 5&#x02013;6, and 75% during weeks 7&#x02013;8. This exercise
program was applied to the Nordic walking group and general walking group followed the same
exercise program.</p><p>The specific exercise rules of Nordic walking were as follows. First, the poles were held
up maintained at about 70% of height (at the height of navel when of standing straight) and
stride length was kept at about 100&#x02005;cm. Second, the subject held the poles lightly as if
holding an egg, and subject completely unfolded the palm that held the pole and stretches
the heel uprightly when pole passed the hip. Third, the subjects kept the upper body
straight without swinging it with the poles&#x02019; movements<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Depression was evaluated using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which can be tested in a
short time at relatively low cost. BDI also has the advantage of a simple testing and
scoring method, a relatively high reliability, validity, and sensitivity. BDI consists of a
total of 21 questions, each of which has four responses indicating intensity of feeling, and
that the participants can choose the best one describes themselves. Those with scores
between 0&#x02013;17 were defined as having no depression, and those with scores over 18 were
defined as having depression. The validity and reliability of each item in this study, had
Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; values between 0.81&#x02013;0.089<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sleep disturbance was evaluated using the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI-K) which consists of items evaluating subjective sleep quality, sleep latency,
sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication,
and daytime dysfunction. This is a useful test for assessing sleep quality and each item is
assessed using a score from 0&#x02013;3, making the total scores of the seven items 0&#x02013;21. Those with
score equal to or higher than 5 were defined as having sleep disturbance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Body, height was measured using an extensimeter, and body composition was measured by a
body composition analyzer (Inbody 230, Biospace, Korea) measures bioelectrical impedance
after the shoes, socks, and accessories have been removed. The measurements were performed
with subjects standing upright with their feet properly covering the electrodes on the
measuring stage, with their apart, and their hands holding the handle containing electrodes.
Using this measuring device, skeletal muscle mass (kg), total weight without fat (kg), BMI
(kg/m<sup>2</sup>), body fat percentage (%), and basal metabolic rate (kcal) were
measured.</p><p>The mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) of the measured data in this study were calculated
using SPSS ver 18.0. For Windows. One-way repeated measures ANOVA determine the significance
of changes between the groups with the measurement time, and one-way ANOVA was performed to
determine within-group time differences. Tukey&#x02019;s test was used as the post-hoc test. The
independent t-test was used to test the significance of between-group differences at each
measurement time. A significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05 was used in all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The effects of the exercise program on the elderly with depression are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Depression and sleep disturbance scores of the Nordic walking and general walking

consumption, and pole support for the spine, knee, and upper body<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although Nordic walking is not popular in Korea, it has
significant potential as an effective physical activity. Moreover, it is reported that
participation in Nordic walking group and programs is relatively high, compared to general
walking<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study that compared treadmill walking between a general walking group and a
Nordic walking group that Nordic walking had a positive impact on walking disturbances<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fundamental and physiological
difference between Nordic walking and general walking is that Nordic walking makes use of
the upper body muscles and stimulates circulation due to the characteristic of the
exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined how Nordic walking and general walking affect depression, sleep
quality, and body composition among elderly people with depression. Depression showed,
significant changes with time and a between-group difference was found between Nordic
walking and general walking groups. The results regarding the changes in depression are
consistent with previous studies that have examined the impact of regular walking exercise
on metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk, and depression severity among elderly diabetes
patients<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is conjectured that
elderly people who do not perform regular exercise have a higher likelihood of developing
depression than those who regularly exercise. Also, the elderly people who do regular
exercise show better depression scores than those who do not regularly exercise. This
suggests that regular Nordic walking exercise would be more effective than general
walking.</p><p>In a previous study of depression, it was argued that cognitive therapy, physical therapy,
and functional exercise elicited significant improvements in a rehabilitation program for
depression patients with stroke<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
our belief that Nordic exercise should be included in the rehabilitation program, as a new
exercise method for treating the depression of patients with stroke.</p><p>Sleep disturbance showed significant changes with time and between-group differences. In
the literature on the impact of Nordic walking on sleep disturbance, one study reported that
six weeks of aerobic exercise elicited significant improvements in pain, sleep quality and
physical function of fibromyalgia syndrome patients with sleep disturbance<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, consistent with the present study&#x02019;s
results.</p><p>This implies that regular exercise can ameliorate depression and sleep disturbance that
accompanying chronic diseases such as diabetes and nephritis. There are a variety of
biological and psychological hypotheses regarding the positive effects of participation in
regular exercise on psychological conditions, for example: the thermogenic hypothesis,
endorphin hypothesis, distraction hypothesis, and mastery hypothesis. However, these
hypotheses do not consistently predict the psychological effects of exercise, and there is
currently no fully verified hypothesis regarding this point. Hence, continuous verification
efforts will be necessary<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Nevertheless, as was shown by this study, an exercise program of 8 weeks of Nordic walking
can provide psychological stability indicating the possibility of Nordic walking as an
alternative exercise in the treatment of elderly people&#x02019;s depression and sleep
disturbance.</p><p>Skeletal muscle mass showed a main effect of time and interaction between the Nordic
walking group and general walking group. We attribute this to the pole use in Nordic
walking, in which the upper body moves freely, and moving the poles has a positive effect on
skeletal muscle mass, suggesting of Nordic walking is more effective than other physical
activities.</p><p>In this study, variables of total weight without fat, BMI, body fat percentage, and basal
metabolic rate showed main effects of time and group interaction. Fat-free mass showed
numerical changes due to Nordic walking, but the differences were not significant. It is our
opinion that a significant effect would be obtained if the exercise were prolonged period.
Similarly, the absence of significant differences in BMI, body fat percentage, and basal
metabolic rate in the Nordic walking group can be attributed to the relatively short
exercise period and an uncontrolled diet. Amount of exercise, qualitative factors, and the
absence of a control group are additional reasons for the lack of significant results. In
order to address the issue of the absence of a control group, the short exercise period, and
relatively weak exercise intensity, future studies should include a control group to
thoroughly conduct comparative analyses on diverse quantitative and qualitative factors.
Moreover, there were individual variations in pole lengths and weights. Considering that
this could be an important factor in determining the effects of the exercise, future studies
should also address this issue. In summary, Nordic walking for eight weeks ameliorated
depression and sleep disturbance of the elderly subjects with depression, indicating that
Nordic walking is an exercise that is effective for treating sleep disturbance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Baltes</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: The Berlin Aging Study.
