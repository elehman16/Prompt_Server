However, observed weight loss is less than that predicted from quantified glycosuria, suggesting a compensatory increase in energy intake or a decrease in energy expenditure. Studies using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) have suggested most body weight change is due to loss of adipose tissue, but organ-specific changes in fat content (eg, liver, skeletal muscle) have not been determined. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we aim to study the compensatory changes in energy intake, eating behaviour and energy expenditure accompanying use of the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin. Additionally, we aim to quantify changes in fat distribution using MRI, in liver fat using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and in central nervous system (CNS) responses to food images using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This outpatient study will evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin (10&#x02005;mg), compared with placebo, on food intake and energy expenditure at 7&#x02005;days and 12&#x02005;weeks. 52 patients with T2DM will be randomised to dapagliflozin or placebo for short-term and long-term trial interventions in a within participants, crossover design. The primary outcome is the difference in energy intake during a test meal between dapagliflozin and placebo. Intake data are collected automatically using a customised programme operating a universal eating monitor (UEM). Secondary outcomes include (1) measures of appetite regulation including rate of eating, satiety quotient, appetite ratings (between and within meals), changes in CNS responses to food images measured using BOLD-fMRI, (2) measures of energy expenditure and (3) changes in body composition including changes in liver fat and abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study has been approved by the North West Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee (14/NW/0340) and is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14818531">ISRCTN14818531</ext-link>.

It is a major global public health challenge; the prevalence is expected to rise to 592 million by 2035.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A range of pharmacological therapies to complement lifestyle interventions with diet and exercise are available including biguanides, sulphonylureas, thiazolidenediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, as well as insulin. These therapies are usually unable to alter the natural progression of T2DM. Obesity is a major risk factor for T2DM, yet some treatments, particularly sulphonylureas, thiazolidenediones and insulin, may cause weight gain. Hence therapeutic agents that are weight neutral or associated with weight loss may be preferable. Inhibition of renal tubular reabsorption of glucose to induce glycosuria is effective in animal models<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and has led to the development of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for clinical use.</p><p>SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin have been shown to cause significant reductions in glycaemia in patients with T2DM, comparable with those produced by other oral agents.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> In contrast to existing oral agents, treatment results in weight loss in all groups studied to date, including treatment-naive patients and those where SGLT2 inhibitors were added to other oral agents, insulin alone or a combination of oral agents with insulin. SGLT2 inhibition results in a net loss of &#x0223c;75&#x02005;g glucose per day, equivalent to an energy loss of &#x0223c;300&#x02005;kcal/day (1200&#x02005;kJ/day), and also a diuresis (&#x0223c;400&#x02005;mL/day), resulting in a modest intravascular volume depletion (evidenced by a rise in haematocrit). The predicted weight loss over 24&#x02005;weeks treatment with dapagliflozin (assuming no compensatory changes in either food intake or energy expenditure and no diuresis) based on the calculated caloric loss would be &#x0223c;7&#x02005;kg. However, clinical data so far suggest that the observed total weight loss with dapagliflozin 10&#x02005;mg dose is 2.5&#x02013;3.2&#x02005;kg (1.7&#x02013;2.0&#x02005;kg placebo-subtracted), that is, an actual (placebo-subtracted) energy deficit of &#x0223c;320&#x02005;kJ/day, which is substantially less than the measured urinary energy losses.</p><p>This suggests that with chronic treatment there are compensatory mechanisms that attenuate weight loss.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These could include either an increase in food intake, driven by hunger (weakened satiety) and increased responsiveness to food cues (reward driven wanting), or a reduction in energy expenditure. As in human T2DM, rats with dietary-induced obesity lose weight when treated with dapagliflozin (&#x0223c;4%), but this is offset by a 30% compensatory increase in energy intake.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, pair-feeding matched to vehicle-treated animals leads to greater weight loss of &#x0223c;13%. In SGLT2 knockout mice, food intake was greater during the dark cycle than controls; physical activity also increased, energy expenditure was higher and respiratory quotient (RQ) fell, consistent with a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Human studies also demonstrate a shift from glucose to fat metabolism.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Overall these data are consistent with the observations in humans and suggest that some compensatory increase in food intake occurs that limits the weight loss in dapagliflozin treatment; the metabolic changes also suggest that fuel usage may shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Considering the associated weight loss, improved glycaemia and preference for fat metabolism, we believe that liver fat may also be reduced, an effect observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>This study is designed to examine the behavioural and biological mechanisms underlying the changes in energy balance that occur with treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, to evaluate changes in body composition and also to help answer important physiological questions regarding adaptive responses to a state of negative energy balance mediated by promoting glycosuria.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin, 10&#x02005;mg daily, compared with placebo, when added to up to two other oral glucose-lowering medications, on energy intake at a test meal after 12&#x02005;weeks of oral administration of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To evaluate the changes in the following outcome measures with dapagliflozin, 10&#x02005;mg daily, after 7&#x02005;days and at 12&#x02005;weeks, compared with placebo, when added to up to two other oral glucose-lowering medications on:

Fifty-two participants with T2DM will be recruited: aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years, with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x0003c;11% (97&#x02005;mmol/mol) and either HbA1c &#x02265;6.5% (48&#x02005;mmol/mol) in patients who are not on sulphonylureas (eg, gliclazide, glimepiride), or HbA1c &#x02265;7.0% (53&#x02005;mmol/mol) in patients who are on sulphonylureas. Each participant will visit the study centre on 12 occasions: first, to undertake routine screening tests. If identified as eligible, subsequent visits involve consuming a test meal at baseline or following placebo or dapagliflozin 10&#x02005;mg, respectively, and to undertake MR measurements. All patients will receive 7&#x02005;days of dapagliflozin or placebo followed by 12&#x02005;weeks of each treatment. Each participant will serve as their own control with the crossover between drug and placebo at short-term and long-term. The 7-day cross-over measurements will determine the short-term effects of energy loss on food intake and energy expenditure (at this stage, it is unlikely that significant weight loss would have occurred), while the long-term crossover at 12&#x02005;weeks investigates the compensatory changes at dynamic stages of weight loss.

This system is similar to the UEM and allows continuous recording of food intake throughout a meal as well as custom programming for presentation of digital VASs pre-meal and post-meal, and at set intervals during the meal (every 150&#x02005;g). Using this technology not only offers accurate collection of cumulative intake data, but also records data on subjective within meal measures of satiation. The assessment of within meal measures of satiation provides a behavioural correlate of satiety processes during a meal.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Thus, the mechanisms by which potential increases in intake occur can be characterised; for example, intake may be increased due to weakened within meal satiation/delayed development of satiety. Eating rate during the meal can also be assessed using SIPM, as well as meal duration, satiety quotient and ratings of palatability, providing essential information about drug effects on the microstructure of eating. Pen and paper VAS measures of appetite (hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective consumption, satisfaction, thirst and nausea) fluctuations throughout the day will also be collected allowing analysis of drug effects on satiety between meals. Taken together these data fully characterise drug effects on appetite and eating behaviour. All intake, appetite and eating behaviour measurements are taken at baseline, 7&#x02005;days, 14&#x02005;days, 14&#x02005;weeks and 26&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4h1b"><title>Indirect calorimetry</title><p>Energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and RQ will be measured by indirect calorimetry data using a ventilated hood system and derived using the Weir equation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

The first 5&#x02005;min of each measurement will be discarded to allow for complete acclimatisation to the hood and the recumbent position, so that participants will have reclined for 10&#x02005;min prior to any measurements being recorded for analysis. Urinary nitrogen excretion will be estimated by collecting all urine produced over the eight-hour period of observation in the laboratory and multiplying by a factor of 3 to approximate 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion. Urine glucose excretion will also be measured over the same time period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4h2"><title>Imaging visits (visits 0, 2, 4, 8, 12)</title><p>Participants will be asked to attend the MRI unit on a separate day to the test meal; baseline measurements will be taken after screening and no more than 1&#x02005;week before baseline test meal; other visits should take place within 1&#x02005;week before or after the relevant test meal (for the week 24 visit this should be in the week preceding the final study visit/meal).</p><sec id="s4h2a"><title>Neural response to food cues (fMRI)</title><p>BOLD response to food images is assessed using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Participants view sets of images of high calorie (hedonic) foods, low calorie (non-hedonic) foods and non-food control objects, in a fasted state, then again 1 and 3&#x02005;hours after consuming a fixed load breakfast. This is conducted to understand drug effects on the central mechanisms underpinning eating behaviour. The brain areas of interest are defined as hypothalamus, lingular gyrus, posterior insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, pre-central gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Activation in areas of the brain involved in regulatory/homeostatic control of appetite (insula/hypothalamus) can be assessed on and off drug, in different states of satiety and over time. Furthermore, this design allows for observation of drug-related changes to reward neurocircuitry in response to hedonic versus non-hedonic food images. Neural pathways associated with reward-related behaviour and motivation to consume interact with homeostatic brain regions to control appetite and energy balance, thus fMRI data can provide a neurophysiological correlate of drug effects on food reward and homeostatic hunger.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These measurements will be made at baseline, and at 5 or 6&#x02005;days, 12 or 13&#x02005;days and at 13&#x02013;14 and 25&#x02013;26&#x02005;weeks (before the test meal evaluations).

Investigators will report SAEs, serious adverse reactions (SARs) and sudden unexpected adverse reactions (SUSARs) to LCTU within 24&#x02005;hours of the local site becoming aware of the event. LCTU will notify the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and main REC of all SUSARs occurring during the study: fatal and life-threatening SUSARs within 7&#x02005;days of notification and non-life-threatening SUSARs within 15&#x02005;days. All adverse events will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator responsible for the care of the participant deems the event to be chronic or the patient to be stable.</p></sec><sec id="s4h5"><title>Trial monitoring and oversight committees</title><p>The study will be overseen by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).

Categorical variables will be summarised as frequencies and percentages. All point estimates will be considered to be statistically significant at the 5% level (two-sided) and will be presented with accompanying 95% CIs. No adjustment will be made for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4i2"><title>Analysis</title><p>Primary and secondary outcome variables will be analysed using a covariance pattern linear mixed model (or other mixed model); the treatment effect will be adjusted for sex as a main effect (since it is a stratification factor), prerandomisation baseline values and the effect of period where relevant. An interaction test will be used to assess the treatment by period interaction (which may be indicative of a carry-over effect) and results interpreted cautiously if this is found to be significant at the 10% significance level. Although a common analysis strategy under such circumstances is to undertake a between-group treatment comparison using only the results from period 1, we follow the advice of Senn<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in avoiding doing so because of the inflation in the type I error rate when conducting such a comparison conditional on the interaction test being statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4i3"><title>Rate of eating and satiety quotient</title><p>Cumulative intake data will initially be analysed for between-condition differences at each time point (every minute). These Dunnett's t-tests will be corrected conservatively for multiple comparisons (p&#x0003c;0.001). A standard technique for the examination of individual cumulative intake curves, relying on the visual judgement of deceleration by raters blinded to condition, will be used.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This assessment will be quantified by raters calculating the coefficient of the start and end of individual cumulative intake curves to confirm their initial assessment. Curves whose coefficients are not lower at the end of the meal than at the start are classified as non-decelerating. The between-participant difference will be tested using a within participants &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (McNemar test).</p></sec><sec id="s4i4"><title>fMRI analysis</title><p>MR images will be imported into the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12) for processing, followed by statistical analysis to test for significant regional BOLD response changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4i5"><title>Safety analysis</title><p>Information relating to adverse events (including events relating to hypoglycaemia and urinary and genital tract infections) will be tabulated and summarised descriptively.
