However, the role of this substrate during repeated exercise after limited recovery is less clear, with ongoing debate regarding how recovery processes can best be supported via nutritional intervention. The aim of this project is to examine the causes of fatigue during repeated exercise bouts via manipulation of glycogen availability through nutritional intervention, thus simultaneously informing aspects of the optimal feeding strategy for recovery from prolonged exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The project involves two phases with each involving two treatment arms administered in a repeated measures design. For each treatment, participants will be required to exercise to the point of volitional exhaustion on a motorised treadmill at 70% of previously determined maximal oxygen uptake, before a four hour recovery period in which participants will be prescribed solutions providing 1.2 grams of sucrose per kilogram of body mass per hour of recovery (g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>) relative to either a lower rate of sucrose ingestion (that is, 0.3&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>. h<sup>-1</sup>; Phase I) or a moderate dose (that is, 0.8&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>) rendered isocaloric via the addition of 0.4&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> whey protein hydrolysate (Phase II); the latter administered in a double blind manner as part of a randomised and counterbalanced design. Muscle biopsies will be sampled at the beginning and end of recovery for determination of muscle glycogen resynthesis rates, with further biopsies taken following a second bout of exhaustive exercise to determine differences in substrate availability relative to the initial sample taken following the first exercise bout.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Phase I will inform whether a dose&#x02013;response relationship exists between carbohydrate ingestion rate and muscle glycogen availability and/or the subsequent capacity for physical exercise. Phase II will determine whether such effects are dependent on glycogen availability <italic>per se</italic> or energy intake, potentially via protein mediated mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN87937960">ISRCTN87937960</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd><kwd>Carbohydrate</kwd><kwd>Protein</kwd><kwd>Performance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is well established that during prolonged moderate to high intensity exercise, carbohydrate is primarily utilised to support energy metabolism due to its efficiency and expeditious availability to support the energetic requirements of such activities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In humans, the majority of endogenous carbohydrate is stored as glycogen in the muscle and liver
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] with the capacity to sustain muscle contractions at the aforementioned exercise intensities being highly dependent on the availability of this glycogen at these sites
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The physiological mechanisms responsible for these observations appear to involve several inter-related factors including: maintenance of euglycaemia and an attenuation of central nervous system fatigue; glycogen sparing; and reduced exercise-induced strain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recovery following exercise is mainly determined by the time required to replenish the depleted glycogen stores and ingesting sufficient carbohydrate (6 to 10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body mass per day) is necessary to restore both glycogen depots and the capacity for repeated physical exertion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, when periods of recovery are limited (&#x02264;8&#x000a0;hours), such as various training and competition scenarios, neither of the aforementioned processes can be entirely restored
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This underpins the importance of identifying nutritional strategies to maximise recovery and restoration of exercise capacity in concurrence with manifestations of fatigue during a repeated exercise bout. To date, nutritional research concerning recovery from exercise has been based on the assumption that similar fatigue mechanisms will operate during repeated exercise within hours of an initial bout, so has understandably focused on strategies to accelerate muscle glycogen resynthesis. While much is now known about the amount, type and timing of nutrient intake that can facilitate muscle glycogen storage and/or the capacity for repeated physical exertion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], little evidence exists to demonstrate a link between these variables.</p><p>When examining these variables independently, it appears that muscle glycogen resytnhesis is augmented during recovery as opposed to a placebo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and a dose&#x02013;response relationship exists between carbohydrate intake and muscle glycogen resynthesis until reaching a threshold of 1.2 grams per kilogram of body mass per hour of recovery (g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to the amount of carbohydrate provided, muscle glycogen storage is primarily influenced by the energy content irrespective of the macronutrient composition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Consequently, the glycogenic properties of carbohydrate may be related to the increased energy content or mediated metabolic responses (hyperinsulinaemia) rather than the presence of carbohydrate fraction <italic>per se</italic>. Therefore, several studies were implemented to explore the efficacy of mixed macronutrient ingestion during recovery and repeated exercise, particularly carbohydrate-protein supplementation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The culmination of the results suggests that increasing the amount of carbohydrate is sufficient to maximise glycogen resynthesis rates and restore endurance capacity more completely
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although some indicate a distinct advantage of protein co-ingestion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Further investigation is required, particularly during running-based exercise, to elucidate the efficacy of protein co-ingestion on restoration of muscle glycogen during limited recovery and the potential ergogenic effects upon subsequent endurance capacity.</p><p>Based on the above information, increasing carbohydrate intake during short-term recovery can accelerate muscle glycogen resynthesis. Nevertheless, endurance capacity may not concurrently improve
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Only one investigation reported an enhanced capacity for repeated exercise following limited recovery in response to higher carbohydrate intake
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Few investigations have been conducted to examine the role of muscle glycogen during a subsequent exercise bout
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and none examined muscle glycogen degradation during a repeated exhaustive exercise bout. In accordance, glycogen availability may not play a fundamental role in contrast to an initial exercise bout whereby fatigue is intimately associated with glycogen depletion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Different fatigue mechanisms may take place, and muscle glycogen metabolism during a subsequent exhaustive exercise bout following short-term recovery remains to be examined.</p><sec><title>Trial objectives</title><p>This research trial will investigate the relationships between carbohydrate intake, muscle glycogen metabolism and exercise capacity during a repeated bout of physical exercise. It will explore whether the effect of carbohydrate ingestion is causal between muscle glycogen availability and/or endurance capacity, and if this relationship is linked to the carbohydrate fraction <italic>per se</italic> or simply to an energy intake surplus. Thus, a replacement of a fraction of the carbohydrate with a different macronutrient (whey protein hydrolysate) matched in energy content will be examined to assess if whey protein hydrolysate co-ingestion provides a distinct benefit over carbohydrates alone in relation to muscle glycogen storage and/or the capacity for subsequent exercise. Specifically, we aim to accomplish the following objectives: (i) to examine whether a dose&#x02013;response relationship exists between rates of carbohydrate (sucrose) ingestion and muscle glycogen availability following short-term recovery and/or the capacity for subsequent exercise; and (ii) to explore the potential protein-mediated effects upon muscle glycogen resynthesis and/or the capacity for a subsequent exercise bout with the ingestion of whey protein hydrolysate.</p><p>The use of the disaccharide sucrose was chosen on the basis of its potential positive contribution to liver and/or muscle glycogen resynthesis by virtue of equimolar amounts of glucose and fructose. Following exhaustive exercise, sucrose and glucose ingestion seem to elicit similar muscle glycogen resynthesis rates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, resting intravenous
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and oral ingestion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] studies indicate that fructose preferentially stores liver glycogen relative to glucose, while glucose infusion favours muscle glycogen resynthesis. Given the importance of both liver and muscle glycogen replenishment during short-term recovery and subsequent endurance capacity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], sucrose was deemed a preferable source of carbohydrate to undergo predominant hepatic metabolism (that is, fructose) to optimise liver glycogen resynthesis alongside a glucose source to maximise muscle glycogen storage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>An important factor determining the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis is insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the muscle cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A proposed mechanism for the potential benefit of protein co-ingestion in enhancing the rate of glycogen storage is the synergistic effect of this substrate on insulin secretion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has been recently demonstrated that plasma insulin response increases to a greater extent in whey than in casein protein in its intact form
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The ingestion of a protein hydrolysate accelerates digestion and absorption compared with its intact protein, resulting in a more rapid increase in circulating insulin concentrations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This was further confirmed by the finding of greater insulinotropic properties when whey protein hydrolysate was ingested as opposed to whey protein in humans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Concerning glycogen storage, the ingestion of whey protein has been shown to stimulate this process more rapidly both in liver and skeletal muscle tissues than when casein was ingested
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, it appears that ingesting whey protein hydrolysate with carbohydrate augments glycogen resynthesis to a greater extent than when carbohydrate is co-ingested with intact whey protein, casein or intact branched-chain amino acids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Taken together, these results indicate that a hydrolysed whey protein fraction may have a profound role in stimulating insulin secretion and concomitant muscle glycogen storage, and thus forming the basis for the inclusion of this protein fraction in the current study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The methods described here stem from a wider project titled &#x02018;Macronutrient ingestion, Muscle glycogen and Post-Exercise Recovery&#x02019;. Both trial phases described herein have been approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South West 3 Research Ethics Committee (REC) with an allocated reference number: 09/H0101/82. The project was subsequently registered as a clinical controlled trial (ISRCTN 87937960).</p><p>Phase I of testing will address objective (i) by way of a non-randomised repeated measures design. The chosen trial design for Phase I is based on the premise that a lower rate of sucrose ingestion will mediate sub-optimal recovery, thus resulting in impairment in exercise capacity relative to a higher rate of sucrose intake, as has been previously reported in a similar investigation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It was, therefore, assumed that participants would run longer when the higher sucrose treatment was administered. Accordingly, a non-randomised design would allow not only an investigation of the metabolic environment at the point of fatigue during the low versus high sucrose treatments, but also at the time point in the high sucrose treatment coincident with the onset of fatigue during low sucrose treatment. Indeed, previous studies have adopted a similar approach to investigate mechanisms through which carbohydrate supplementation enhances the capacity for both cycling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and running
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] modes of exercise. In addition, participants will be fully familiarised with a trial (see experimental protocol) that will be identical to the main procedures and, therefore, diminishing any order effects. This will consequently improve the reliability of the performance measure that would enable the detection of small but worthwhile intervention effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The second phase (Phase II) of testing will address objective (ii) by adopting a randomised double-blind cross-over experimental design.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Ethical considerations and safety</title><p>The individuals who agree to participate following the briefing will be provided with an informed consent form, indicating their full understanding of the study and their protected rights for confidentiality and withdrawal from the study without giving a reason. Thereafter, a compulsory medical health questionnaire will be completed by each participant to ensure the absence of any physical, haematologic, metabolic or any other health conditions deemed to pose a risk to the participant or bias towards the investigation. If any of the factors above were present, the volunteer would be deemed unfit to participate in the study and would consequently be excluded from taking part. Further health questionnaires and profile of mood state (POMS) questionnaire will be completed before each trial to ensure that participants are fit and able to take part in testing and to establish similar physical and mental engagements throughout the trials.</p><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>The global design of the trial includes comparisons of two nutritional interventions during each distinct phase of testing. A minimum of two weeks wash-out period will be allowed between each main trial to avoid any carry-over effects. The independent variable will be the precise nutritional intervention applied during the short-term recovery period. This involves the provision of 0.3&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> and 1.2&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> of carbohydrate in the form of sucrose solutions in Phase I of testing and a 1.2&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> sucrose versus an 0.8&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> sucrose&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.4&#x000a0;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> whey protein hydrolysate in Phase II of the project. All treatments will be provided in equal volumes (10&#x000a0;ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>) and will be matched in sodium and potassium composition. The test beverages will also be matched in flavour (vanilla extract). Sample analyses of both treatments underwent screening by an independent institution (HFL Sport Science, LGC Ltd., Teddington, Middlesex, UK) to confirm the absence of any contaminants such as banned anabolic steroids and stimulants including noradrenaline, Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

Although it has been argued that time-trial (TT) is more relevant than TTE as performance measure, these theories are based on the assumption that the primary outcome variable is a reflection of what occurs during actual sporting performance. These assumptions are generally founded on two factors: (1) there are no real-world sporting events that are the equivalent of TTE, which require an individual to run until the point of exhaustion; and (2) TTE appears to be less reliable than TT in relation to a valid simulation that resembles actual performance in a given sport
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. While applied sports science studies mimic &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; sporting events and provide a useful tool in assessing performance in a sports context, this naturally constrains them to the rules and regulations of a given sport that may be changed or refined periodically.</p><p>If we wish to interpret the value of performance measures in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; events, TTE may arguably be more prevalent and have a more important bearing in the broader scale. In terms of prevalence, there are clearly more recreational exercisers than athletes, who may present a case that maintaining their running or cycling endurance capacities to be able to engage with other exercisers at the same intensity and for the duration of the activity (such as running outdoors with friends or maintaining the capacity to complete a 90&#x000a0;minute football match) is paramount. Furthermore, many athletes undertake exercise scenarios similar to TTE tests. For example, pace is often set by the fastest athlete with the majority of athletes attempting to sustain this pace for as long as possible before reducing their pace and consequently falling behind the group/athlete. With regard to importance, endurance capabilities defined as &#x02018;the ability of a muscle group to sustain external forces for long periods of time&#x02019; are considered an integral component in improving the occupational tasks of military personnel
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This underscores the importance of endurance capacity over performance time in this population whereby completing a march as a unit is the goal and not performance at maximal individual capabilities of a set task, which could separate individuals and pose risks for those personnel. Certainly, scientific investigations that measure constants in nature (that is, establishing the mechanisms of fatigue) should not be overlooked.</p><p>It should also be recognised that TTE measures vary widely in the literature and the actual reliability will depend on the protocol, individual and laboratory environment and, critically, familiarisation should not be viewed as a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; view. Given the importance of familiarisation, it is acknowledged that TT carry greater reliability from the outset, particularly if using relevant athletes and repetitive familiarisation with TTE is to be avoided. However, we have demonstrated in our current project sufficient reliability (CV&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.5%, based on TTE during the first run to exhaustion between trials) when participants are familiarised and attempts are made to help them gauge their level of fatigue (that is, use of our three-strikes run-walk-run approach to achieve a metabolic end point). Taken together, TTE measures in endurance-trained athletes who are familiarised with the protocol are adequate to elicit reliable and sensitive measures.</p><p>The view that TT is a better representation of human performance is of course a valid one, if the sole reason for a performance measure is to produce an outcome measure that can be directly extrapolated to a real-world event. Nonetheless, it should be appreciated that a large number of scientific investigations involve mechanistic variables of human performance and its limitations, be it physiological, metabolic or neuromuscular among others. Fatigue is a complex phenomenon with several contributing factors, such that fatigue may occur simultaneously in several loci in the human body with the relative underlying mechanisms likely to overlap and interact
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is imperative, therefore, that to investigate this intricate behaviour, means of inducing volitional fatigue through TTE performance measures are important to be included in a controlled environment to establish mechanistic causes of performance limitations and the possible mediating influences of certain nutritional interventions in delaying the onset of fatigue in humans. Accordingly, given that the aims of the current project are mechanistic in nature provides a foundation for the adopted TTE outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The chosen target population for the research trial will be healthy non-smoking recreationally active men and women who include endurance training in the form of running as a central component (&#x02265;2&#x000a0;hours/week) of their training regime. The chosen age range for participation will be 18 to 48&#x000a0;years old. The research trial aims to recruit sixteen participants (eight in each phase of testing) from the University of Bath campus and surrounding sporting clubs by way of public advertisement and personal communication. These individuals will all be trained (as evidenced both by their self-reported training volume and also measures of maximal oxygen uptake during preliminary testing). Upon volunteering, the participants will be initially briefed in writing followed by a verbal explanation of the protocol and the pre-requisites set for satisfactory inclusion on their first visit to the laboratories to ensure their full understanding before the investigation. The target population sample will be free from any condition that either poses undue personal risk or introduces bias into the experiment (as determined by each participant&#x02019;s responses to baseline health screening). In relation to eumenorrheic female participants, all measurements will be conducted at least three and at most ten days after the onset of menses (that is, the follicular phase) to ensure low levels of circulating female hormones and, therefore, minimise any measurement errors associated with the menstrual cycle. Each participant will be required to attend the Physiology Research Laboratory at the University of Bath on four occasions. These include: (i) a preliminary visit; (ii) a familiarisation visit; and (iii) two main trials completed on separate days.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Control measures</title><sec><title>Standardisation of lifestyle</title><p>Over the 48&#x000a0;hours prior to the familiarisation trial, a weighed dietary record will be completed for the analysis of macronutrient composition and total daily energy intake. The same diet will then be replicated prior to any laboratory visit involving the main procedures. Participants will be required to abstain from alcohol consumption for 24&#x000a0;hours before any trial, while caffeine abstinence will be started at 17:00 on the day preceding any trial. The latter aims mainly to avoid any unnecessary side effects that may negatively influence performance as a result of adverse withdrawal from caffeine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Approximately 12&#x000a0;hours before the familiarisation session and, subsequently, before the experimental trials, a standardised meal will be provided for each participant. This is aimed at minimising any within-subject variability in the nutritional status of each participant that is known to influence metabolism and exercise performance and, ultimately, may influence the outcomes of the study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Participants will be required to complete an activity log in conjunction with their dietary control procedures discussed in the experimental protocol.

In Phase I and during the low sucrose treatment arm, a muscle biopsy sample will be taken at the point of volitional exhaustion following the first exercise bout to identify muscle glycogen depletion levels before the short-term recovery period. Indeed, given that participants had consumed replicate diets 48&#x000a0;hours prior to each main trial and the provision of a standerdised final meal (see standardisation of lifestyle section), and were required to run to volitional exhaustion suggests that muscle glycogen levels are expected to be similar between any of the first exhaustive exercise bouts during the main trials. Based on previously reported data that applied a similar dietary and activity standardisation in addition to comparable exercise protocol procedures, it was shown that muscle glycogen depletion levels were unlikely to vary between trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Hereafter, a biopsy sample will not be required at this time point during the high sucrose trial. Further support of this is gained through the initial run times to exhaustion obtained from participants tested thus far in Phase I, indicating comparable times to exhaustion (data not shown) and, thus, endorsing the notion that intra-individual pre- and post-exercise muscle glycogen contents were at comparable levels between the trials. The remaining two biopsy samples in the low sucrose treatment will be obtained at the end of recovery and at the point of fatigue during the subsequent run. During the high sucrose treatment, the three muscle tissue samples will be obtained at the end of the recovery period, the time corresponding to fatigue during the low sucrose treatment and at the point of volitional exhaustion during the subsequent run.</p><p>It is difficult to ascertain the condition under which muscle glycogen storage and/or endurance capacity may be enhanced in Phase II of the trial. Therefore, three biopsies will be obtained at identical time points between the treatment arms to assess relative glycogen resynthesis rates during recovery and their degradation rates during the subsequent exercise bout. To achieve the aforementioned aims, the biopsy time points will be: following the first exhaustive run, at the end of the four hour recovery period and upon cessation of the subsequent run to exhaustion.</p><p>A needle biopsy technique

To account for any mood disturbances during any experiments, a POMS questionnaire will be completed by each participant prior to commencing any of the trials. This questionnaire has been shown to be a viable tool to detect any mood fluctuations in an exercise setting that may have an influence on performance

It was, therefore, deemed appropriate to base sample size estimates on secondary, less reliable, outcome measures. In this case, exercise capacity exhibits the highest between subject variability and our previous work that contributes directly to the rationale for this study observed a difference between the high sucrose and moderate sucrose plus whey protein supplements under investigation here of 7.5&#x000a0;minutes, with a standard deviation of differences of 5&#x000a0;minutes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Based upon these data, it can be estimated that a sample size of seven would be appropriate even to provide a 90% power to detect such effects on these more variable secondary outcomes using a two tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>A paired <italic>t</italic>-test will be used to compare between treatments for the primary and secondary outcomes of the study (that is, glycogen resynthesis/degradation and run times to exhaustion). A two-way linear mixed model with repeated measures (beverage &#x000d7; time) will be employed to analyse the repeated experimental conditions. Mauchly&#x02019;s test will be used for sphericity. Where asphericity is assumed, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction will be used for epsilon &#x0003c;0.75 and Huynh-Feldt will be adopted for less severe asphericity. Where significant F values are found a Bonferroni step-wise correction will be employed to determine the location of the variance

Simple summary statistics will be used to inform interesting questions related to certain metabolites (for example, plasma glucose) following each feeding strategy and during the subsequent exhaustive bout.

Although a dose&#x02013;response has been independently observed in muscle glycogen restoration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and subsequent endurance capacity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] following an initial exercise bout, no study has directly examined the associated links between these variables in a single cohort of participants. The aim of Phase I of the trial is to examine these effects.</p><p>Furthermore, the mechanism(s) for the potential improvements in the restoration of exercise capacity with protein co-ingestion, in addition to establishing the likely cause(s) of fatigue during a subsequent bout, remain to be elucidated. Noticeably, further studies that mimic human locomotion (that is, running-based studies) investigating the area of post-exercise short-term recovery nutrition need to be conducted. Interestingly, an improvement in subsequent endurance capacity with protein feeding was shown, irrespective of the fact that the glycogen levels were similar to an isocaloric supplement
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Albeit in that study, independent groups were used to assess glycogen resynthesis rates and endurance capacity. To our knowledge, no study concurrently explored the aforementioned factors. Therefore, the effects of nutrient intake/composition upon limited recovery and the capacity for repeated exercise requires further investigation. The current project aims to contribute in further understanding of the mechanisms of fatigue and the potential role of muscle glycogen during a subsequent exercise bout following short-term recovery and to establish any mediating effects of different nutrient amounts and/or compositions to enhance recovery of human endurance capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Data collection from Phase I is close to completion.
