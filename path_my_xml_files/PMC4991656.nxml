Existing educational websites with evidence-based medical information provided in a non-judgmental manner have received favorable responses from reproductive-aged men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION</title><p>This three-armed (one intervention and two control groups), randomized controlled trial was conducted using online social research panels (SRPs) in Japan in January 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS</title><p>A total of 1455 participants (726 men and 729 women) between 20 and 39 years of age who hoped to have (more) children in the future were block-randomized and exposed to one of three information brochures: fertility education (intervention group), intake of folic acid during pregnancy (control group 1) or governmental financial support for pregnancy and childbirth (control group 2). Fertility knowledge was measured with the Japanese version of the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS-J). Knowledge, child-number and child-timing desires, subjective anxiety (i.e. whether participants felt anxiety [primary outcome]), and scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were assessed immediately after exposure. Non-inferiority comparisons were performed on subjective anxiety with non-inferiority declared if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for risk difference did not exceed a margin of 0.15. This test for non-inferiority was only performed for subjective anxiety; all the other variables were tests of superiority.</p></sec><sec><title>MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE</title><p>Posttest scores on the CFKS-J (mean, SD) were higher in the intervention group than that of the control groups: intervention versus Control 1 and versus Control 2: 52.8 (28.8) versus 40.9 (26.2) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) versus 45.1 (27.1) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) among men and 64.6 (26.0) versus 50.8 (26.9) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) versus 53.0 (26.4) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) among women.</p><p>The percentage of participants who felt subjective anxiety after exposure to the intervention brochure was significantly higher than that of the control groups: intervention versus Control 1 and versus Control 2: 32.6 versus 17.8% (risk difference [RD] = 0.149, 95% CI: 0.073&#x02013;0.225) versus 14.5% (RD = 0.182, 95% CI: 0.108&#x02013;0.256) among men, and 50.2 versus 26.3% (RD = 0.239, 95% CI: 0.155&#x02013;0.322) versus 14.0% (RD = 0.362, 95% CI: 0.286&#x02013;0.439) among women. Non-inferiority of the intervention was inconclusive (i.e. the CI included 0.15) among men whereas inferiority was declared among women. The incidence of anxiety was higher in the intervention group than that of the control groups especially among men aged 30 and older and among women aged 25 and older. No difference existed in childbearing desires between groups after exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION</title><p>The possibility of selection bias associated with the use of SRPs (higher socioeconomic status and education) and volunteer bias toward those more interested in fertility may limit the generalizability of these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</title><p>In addition to education targeting a younger generation, psychological approaches are needed to alleviate possible anxiety caused by fertility information.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)</title><p>This study was funded by National Center for Child Health and Development, Seiiku Medical Study Grant (24-6), the Daiwa Foundation Small Grants and Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (26-1591).

Especially in developed countries, substantial decline in fertility and the growing trend to delay childbearing are serious concerns (<xref rid="DEW133C20" ref-type="bibr">ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C37" ref-type="bibr">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2014</xref>). In Japan, where this study was conducted, the total fertility rate is among the lowest (1.43 in 2013), and the parental age at first birth has now reached more than 30 years of age (30.4 and 32.5 years for women and men, respectively, in 2013) (<xref rid="DEW133C33" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2013</xref>). Although delayed childbearing is a consequence of a multifactorial decision-making process related to career, education, relationships, partner's desire, financial security, health etc. (<xref rid="DEW133C11" ref-type="bibr">Cooke <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref><xref rid="DEW133C12" ref-type="bibr">, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C32" ref-type="bibr">Mills <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C40" ref-type="bibr">Roberts <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), research suggests that a lack of accurate fertility information might explain sub-optimal fertility behavior (<xref rid="DEW133C6" ref-type="bibr">Bunting and Boivin, 2010</xref>). Many people overestimate the duration of the reproductive lifespan and the likelihood of conceiving (<xref rid="DEW133C29" ref-type="bibr">Lampic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C5" ref-type="bibr">Bretherick <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C1" ref-type="bibr">Ali <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C17" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C38" ref-type="bibr">Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C7" ref-type="bibr">Bunting <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C30" ref-type="bibr">Lundsberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C31" ref-type="bibr">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), which sometimes results in unintended childlessness (<xref rid="DEW133C3" ref-type="bibr">Benzies <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C21" ref-type="bibr">Friese <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C11" ref-type="bibr">Cooke <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In this context, educational initiatives have been undertaken in many countries (<xref rid="DEW133C18" ref-type="bibr">De Cock, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C15" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C24" ref-type="bibr">Hammarberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the timing of childbearing can be perceived as dependent on factors outside one's control (e.g. timing of promotion, partner's willingness) (<xref rid="DEW133C12" ref-type="bibr">Cooke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). According to the risk perception model, risk behavior perceived to be under the control of others is also perceived to be less modifiable (<xref rid="DEW133C13" ref-type="bibr">Covello <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In such contexts, a fertility education campaigns could cause people to experience concern if they perceive that the behavior (childbearing efforts) is not entirely within their control to change. Indeed, recent fertility campaigns have met with public disapproval in the USA (<xref rid="DEW133C42" ref-type="bibr">Soules, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C39" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds, 2009</xref>) and the UK (<xref rid="DEW133C22" ref-type="bibr">Gray, 2013</xref>) because they appeared to force a specific childbearing deadline on women who were not yet ready to conceive. A similar campaign suggested by the Japanese Government in 2013 sparked much public debate about the need to educate people (<xref rid="DEW133C25" ref-type="bibr">Hongo, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C31" ref-type="bibr">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, several initiatives (<xref rid="DEW133C18" ref-type="bibr">De Cock, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C15" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C24" ref-type="bibr">Hammarberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) that presented participants with evidence-based medical information and emphasized informed decision-making in non-judgmental attitudes received favorable responses (<xref rid="DEW133C14" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2012</xref>). Specifically, previous studies showed that exposure to online educational material regarding fertility, improved fertility awareness and changed knowledge about the timing of childbearing (<xref rid="DEW133C47" ref-type="bibr">Wojcieszek and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2015</xref>). Despite a growing interest and recognition in the need for fertility education among health professionals, the effect of such information on knowledge and especially psychological reactions is still poorly understood among reproductive-aged men and women. In addition, there is a lack of information about factors that covary with such anxiety and that could provide important background to tailor and promote effective and acceptable education.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of fertility information on knowledge, desires and anxiety. Participants were randomized to receive the intervention, which comprised evidence-based medical information about male and female fertility (intervention), or to one of two information control groups that received the typical health and government support information issued regarding pregnancy and childbirth. It was hypothesized that the intervention group would show increased fertility knowledge and sooner timing of next birth compared with the control groups but given positive public reaction to existing educational websites (<xref rid="DEW133C18" ref-type="bibr">De Cock, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C15" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C24" ref-type="bibr">Hammarberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) the fertility information was not expected to increase anxiety compared with the control information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a three-armed (one intervention and two control groups), randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in January 2015.

These findings negate our prediction especially among women, and revealed that fertility information, even when neutral and evidence-based, induced anxiety among the reproductive-aged population. This is the first quantitative study to evaluate the psychological change of people exposed to fertility information.</p><p>A strength of our study was the randomized controlled study design with a large sample size. Although there was a disproportion of some baseline characteristics between groups, these were negligible in light of the randomized study design and multiple comparisons. Even when we adjusted for whether participants had fathered a child among male participants and whether participants were university educated among female participants using logistic regression model or analysis of covariance, the results were not markedly different. In addition, the large sample size allowed analyses by age group to identify for whom fertility education could be more anxiety provoking. It was found that women in their mid-20s and men in their early 30s felt anxiety after exposure to fertility information despite still being younger than the average parental age at first birth in Japan. Furthermore, the chance of reacting with anxiety seemed to increase linearly with older age.</p><p>Another strength was the use of validated scales, the CFKS and the STAI. The use of a pre and posttesting phase also enabled assessment of baseline equivalence on knowledge before the information was provided. The pretest knowledge score was similar to that in our previous survey (&#x0223c;50% correct score, <xref rid="DEW133C31" ref-type="bibr">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The significantly higher score on the STAI-S (acute state) in the intervention groups and the similar scores on the STAI-T (a personality trait) between the study groups demonstrate the robustness of our main results.</p><p>The present study was intended to assess the non-inferiority of subjective anxiety after exposure to fertility information compared with that of the control groups. The risk difference of subjective anxiety was found to exceed the non-inferiority margin among women, showing the inferiority of the fertility information group relative to controls. Although the result regarding non-inferiority was inconclusive among men, possibly because the predetermined non-inferiority margin was wide, it was shown that the incidence of subjective anxiety after exposure to fertility information was significantly higher than that of the control groups among both men and women, which was consistent with the results on the STAI. These results indicate that provision of fertility education has benefits but also costs, and these should be considered in education interventions.</p><p>Regarding the effects of information brochures on knowledge, our findings are consistent with those of previous studies. It is possible to improve fertility knowledge with low cost information brochures. <xref rid="DEW133C47" ref-type="bibr">Wojcieszek and Thompson (2013)</xref> reported that male and female university students had better fertility knowledge after reading an educational brochure presented online. <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert (2015)</xref> also showed currently childless men and women were more aware of fertility immediately after the intervention, although the improvement was not maintained 6 months later. In the present study, we replicated those findings: participants in the intervention group had significantly better knowledge immediately after exposure.</p><p>The results on childbearing desires (child-number, child-timing) were inconsistent with past research showing that fertility information produced a decrease in desired or ideal age for childbearing (<xref rid="DEW133C47" ref-type="bibr">Wojcieszek and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2015</xref>). In the present study, no apparent difference was found in the posttest on child-timing desires between the study groups. One possible reason was the higher age of participants (the mean age in years in present study: 30.6) compared with those in the previous studies (19.05 years old in <xref rid="DEW133C47" ref-type="bibr">Wojcieszek and Thompson, 2013</xref>; 28 years old in <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2015</xref>). In general, people tend to postpone parenthood as they age (<xref rid="DEW133C45" ref-type="bibr">Virtala <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) or as they have difficulty finding a partner or balancing their educations, careers and other factors (<xref rid="DEW133C12" ref-type="bibr">Cooke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C38" ref-type="bibr">Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Our participants might have experienced such struggles and accommodated their priorities more so than the above studies (<xref rid="DEW133C47" ref-type="bibr">Wojcieszek and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2015</xref>). Another reason was the high proportion of participants that answered &#x02018;I don't know.&#x02019; Longitudinal assessments would show the real effects of knowledge and potential changes in attitude of those who prevaricated over their family planning. An alternative explanation is that the fertility education provided in the present study did not sufficiently target child-number and child-timing desires to make an impact on these outcomes. For example, information in <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert (2015)</xref> has 10 sections over multiple pages and thousands of words concerned with when is the right time to have children whereas the present fertility education focused brochure had a simple message about declining fertility according to age and risk factors for reduced fertility. In addition, it is hard to know whether the participants read the brochure or did so in sufficient depth to absorb the contents even though they were asked to read the entire brochure carefully. The results indicate that educators must ensure that the fertility education provided aligns with the outcomes they would want to change.</p><p>Fertility educational initiatives have increased across developed countries over the past few years (<xref rid="DEW133C18" ref-type="bibr">De Cock, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C15" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C24" ref-type="bibr">Hammarberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) and are increasingly widespread (<xref rid="DEW133C9" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C49" ref-type="bibr">Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, 2015</xref>). However, the main targets are the reproductive-aged generation and the introduction of fertility issues to school education is just beginning (<xref rid="DEW133C4" ref-type="bibr">Boivin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C19" ref-type="bibr">Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, 2013</xref>). In view of our findings, educational interventions should target a younger generation than currently intended. Our results showed that young women in their mid-20s were much more likely to report anxiety when confronted with fertility-related information, suggesting that fertility could be an area of worry for them. If fertility information were provided as part of educational initiatives, and provided in a more safe and helpful way, then people would be better able to manage such information when exposed in the community or health services.</p><p>Development of communication strategies that relieves the anxiety of reproductive-aged people is also important because there was an overall effect of fertility education on anxiety. In light of the close relations between fertility knowledge and personal relevance of childbearing (<xref rid="DEW133C7" ref-type="bibr">Bunting <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C16" ref-type="bibr">Daniluk and Koert, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C31" ref-type="bibr">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), making accurate information accessible to an older generation nearing or at the stage of wanting children, and who may experience fertility issues is necessary. However, given the fact that people generally fail to process information effectively and efficiently when they are in a state of high concern (<xref rid="DEW133C13" ref-type="bibr">Covello <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), addition of psychological approaches, such as introducing decision-making strategies or providing information about counseling, would be required more than in other health education (<xref rid="DEW133C46" ref-type="bibr">Webb <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) in which most factors could be perceived to depend more on one's decisions (e.g. smoking cessation or dietary behavior).</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the use of SRPs could have caused selection bias associated with higher education (<xref rid="DEW133C23" ref-type="bibr">Haagen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C44" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and more interest in childbearing. Second, the outcomes were measured only once, immediately after reading the brochures. Anxiety we measured might be a short-term effect that may reduce with the passage of time. As a future direction, measurements of changes over time should be explored. Finally, responses to fertility information might differ in Western countries. This study was conducted in Japan where referring to fertility has been a taboo for a long time and the level of knowledge is quite low (<xref rid="DEW133C31" ref-type="bibr">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) as reported in other Asian countries (<xref rid="DEW133C2" ref-type="bibr">Asia Pacific Initiative on Reproduction, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW133C10" ref-type="bibr">Chan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) compared with non-Asian countries (<xref rid="DEW133C7" ref-type="bibr">Bunting <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Assessment of cultural relevance to perceptions of fertility information would be an area of future research.</p><p>In conclusion, it is possible to increase fertility knowledge using an inexpensive fertility education brochure. However, such initiatives could increase anxiety, especially among women of reproductive-age. Early education and fertility awareness campaigns that took account of psychological impacts of fertility education could result in a positive reception and enhanced the educational effects.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Authors' roles</title><p>E.M. and F.N. contributed to the conception and design of the study, the acquisition of data and the analysis and interpretation of data.
