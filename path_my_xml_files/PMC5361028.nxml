wave therapy on the pain and function of patients with degenerative knee arthritis.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients with degenerative knee arthritis were divided into
a conservative physical therapy group (n=10) and an extracorporeal shock wave therapy
group (n=10). Both groups received general conservative physical therapy, and the
extracorporeal shock wave therapy was additionally treated with extracorporeal shock wave
therapy after receiving conservative physical therapy. Both groups were treated three
times a week over a four-week period. The visual analogue scale was used to evaluate pain
in the knee joints of the subjects, and the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Osteoarthritis Index was used to evaluate the function of the subjects.
[Results] The comparison of the visual analogue scale and Korean Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores within each group before and after the
treatment showed statistically significant declines in scores in both the conservative
physical therapy group and extracorporeal shock wave therapy group. A group comparison
after the treatment showed statistically significant differences in these scores in the
extracorporeal shock wave therapy group and the conservative physical therapy group.
[Conclusion] extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be a useful nonsurgical intervention
for reducing the pain of patients with degenerative knee arthritis and improving these
patients&#x02019; function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Degenerative knee arthritis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In recent years, improvements in the social and economic environment have led to increases
in the average life expectancy, and the resulting increases in the elderly population have
resulted in an aging society<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. While most
elderly people are suffering from one or more chronic disease, such as diabetes, high blood
pressure, and arthritis, chronic degenerative arthritis is a disease with a high incidence
compared to other musculoskeletal diseases. Around 80% of individuals aged 55 or older
develop this disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it affects
women more frequently than men<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the disease frequently intrudes into the knee joints, which bear a lot of
weight<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Degenerative arthritis is
characterized by pain and functional disorders, and it limits movements commonly used in
daily life, such as standing up from a chair, standing comfortably, walking, and descending
stairs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treatments for degenerative arthritis include medication, exercise therapy, physical
therapy, and surgery. Among the treatments that focus on reducing pain and improving
function, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has recently drawn great attention<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. ESWT has been performed in Germany as a
treatment for musculoskeletal diseases in various fields since the early 1990s after it was
used to decompose kidney and bile duct stones in 1976<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The therapeutic principles of ESWT are based on the micro-trauma
theory and the cognitive decline theory. The former holds that healing lesion tissues is
facilitated by repeatedly stimulating lesion areas with ESWT, thereby creating temporary
micro-traumas around lesion areas that induce the creation of new blood vessels, which
increases blood supply. Extracorporeal shock waves can spread into tissues around painful
regions, thereby increasing mitochondrial oxidation and the photochemistry effect that
facilitates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, resulting in expansion of blood vessels
and lymphatic vessels. This will reduce pain due to the rapid removal of exudate and
re-absorption of the unnecessary liquids that are accumulated in the human body by
facilitating blood circulation and increases in metabolism<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>ESWT improves their function by stimulating or reactivating the healing process of
connective tissues, including tendons and bones<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since Heller &#x00026; Niethard<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> first presented a study on ESWT on lateral epicondylitis, Rompe et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported success rates that varied
from 58 to 85%. Thus, ESWT has been suggested as a safe and effective method for treating
patients with lateral epicondylitis. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to
examine its effects on degenerative arthritis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
identify the effects of ESWT on the pain and function of patients with degenerative knee
arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 20 patients aged 55&#x02013;70 who had been diagnosed with degenerative knee
arthritis based on clinical findings and the Kellgren &#x00026; Lawrence Grade 2 level results
of examinations using medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, among outpatients who had
visited S Orthopedic Hospital in Daegu.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were those with cardiovascular or neurological diseases, those with
other diseases that disturb activities, those with rheumatic diseases, and those who had
received knee surgery. The subjects in the ESWT group (ESWTG, n=10) were 64.2 &#x000b1; 4.1&#x02005;years
old, 157.2 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;cm in height, and weighed 57.2 &#x000b1; 11.3&#x02005;kg, and the subjects in the
conservative physical therapy group (CPTG, n=10) were 67.2 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;years old, 158.4 &#x000b1; 8.0&#x02005;cm
in height, and weighed 62.7 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;kg. Ethical approval for the study was granted by U1
University&#x02019;s institutional review board. All subjects read and signed consent forms in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Both groups received general conservative physical therapy consisting of the application of
a heat pack (20&#x02005;min), interference current therapy (15&#x02005;min), and ultrasound (5&#x02005;min). The
ESWTG was also treated using a magnetic-based ESWT device (HNT MED, Korea) after receiving
conservative physical therapy. Shock waves with a frequency of 4&#x02005;Hz were applied to the
medial and lateral condyles 1,000 times using a focus-type head. The shock wave probe was
held stationary on a trigger point around the knee or at the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral
borders of the target knee, while avoiding direct placement on the peroneal nerve or
vessel<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The target region for the
therapy was determined using a physical examination so that the intensity of energy would be
controlled according to the level of pain that the patients could bear so that the energy of
the shock waves would be precisely delivered to the target region.</p><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain in the knee joints of the
subjects, and the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
(K-WOMAC) was used to evaluate the function of the knee joints. For both groups, the VAS and
K-WOMAC scores were measured using the same method both before and after four weeks of the
experiment. In terms of statistical analysis, a paired t-test was performed to examine the
changes within each group, and an independent t-test was performed to compare the variables
between the two groups. SPSS/PC Ver. 13.0 was used for statistical processing, and the
statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The comparison of the VAS and K-WOMAC scores within each group before and after the

patients&#x02019; pain and improving their function. Wang et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported extracorporeal shock waves were effective in preventing
and treating knee arthritis in rats with knee arthritis. Chen et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a comparative study in which ESWT and ultrasound
therapy were applied to patients with knee arthritis for eight weeks, and they reported that
the group in which ESWT was applied showed reduction in pain, Lequesne index scores and
increasing in the range of motion. The present study also showed statistically significant
declines in the VAS and K-WOMAC scores of the ESWTG. This result may be because shock waves
are a sort of sound waves that can be transmitted through soft tissues without loss of
energy, and their fine and repetitive stimulations are effective for reducing pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, stimulations caused by shock
waves form new muscular fibers by facilitating the secretion of substances that generate
blood vessels around an affected region. These new muscular fibers increase blood flow
around a lesion and induce the reformation of blood vessels, which eventually stimulates and
reactivates the healing process of the tendons and the tissues around them, thereby
stabilizing the tissues<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The secretion
of substances induces lymphangiogenesis through upregulation of expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Prevalence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis in elderly
