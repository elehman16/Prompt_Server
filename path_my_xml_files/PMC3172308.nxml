All subjects randomly received either pea protein solutions (250 mg/kg bodyweight in 0.4 ml/kg bodyweight of water) or placebo (0.4 ml/kg bodyweight of water), either orally or intraduodenally via a naso-duodenal tube.

These hormones are known to be involved in the modulation of appetite sensations. CCK is produced by I-cells in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, and is secreted in response to luminal food compounds, especially lipids and proteins <xref rid="pone.0024878-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. GLP-1 and PYY are produced primarily by the L-cells in the more distal small intestine and colon. Ingested nutrients stimulate CCK-, GLP-1-, and PYY secretion indirectly by neurohumoral mechanisms, e.g. feedback mechanisms of hormones from a more distal part of the small intestine, as well as by direct sensing mechanisms at the intestinal mucosa <xref rid="pone.0024878-Maljaars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Savastano1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Previously, it was demonstrated that the plasma levels of GLP-1 were elevated in obese rats, compared to lean rats <xref rid="pone.0024878-Parnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Others found that levels of ghrelin and obestatin were decreased in obese children, compared to lean children <xref rid="pone.0024878-Balagopal1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Also, PYY levels are lower in obese subjects compared to lean subjects <xref rid="pone.0024878-Batterham1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These data indicate that there are significant differences between lean and obese subjects with respect to hormone release, and that the gut may respond different to ingested nutrients in obese subjects, compared to lean subjects.</p><p>Among all properties of food, the total energy content and the macronutrient composition appears to be one of the major determinants of the control of food intake. Recent literature points to the effect of dietary protein in reducing food intake by improving satiety sensations <xref rid="pone.0024878-Saris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Tome1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It seems that proteins have the highest satiating effect when compared to carbohydrates and in particular fats in humans and rats <xref rid="pone.0024878-WesterterpPlantenga1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, although the nature of the protein can influence its satiating effects. In most cases, high-protein meals increase feelings of satiety and decrease subsequent energy intake compared with high-carbohydrate or high-fat meals <xref rid="pone.0024878-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>From previous work it is well known that proteins have the ability to affect food intake and appetite in several species, including humans <xref rid="pone.0024878-Saris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Diepvens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Liddle1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Luhovyy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A variety of physiological mechanisms activated by protein ingestion may act in concert to exert their satiating effect. One of the physiological processes through which proteins appear to induce satiety is by stimulating satiety hormone secretion <xref rid="pone.0024878-Blom1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, little is known about the satiating properties of proteins originating from different sources.</p><p>In previous studies we showed that proteins and especially codfish, egg, pea, and wheat exert strong effects on satiety hormone release in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting. Remarkably, the hydrolysates showed weaker effects with respect to hormone release, than the intact protein <xref rid="pone.0024878-Geraedts1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We also demonstrated that these intact proteins exert different effects on satiety hormone release in human duodenal tissue. Exposing intestinal tissue to intact pea and wheat protein induced an increase in the release of both CCK and GLP-1, whereas al the other tested proteins did not affect the hormone release <xref rid="pone.0024878-Geraedts2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>It was shown previously in rats that intraduodenal infusion of dietary protein resulted in increased plasma levels of CCK compared to intragastric infusion <xref rid="pone.0024878-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We hypothesize that 1) intraduodenal infusion of intact dietary proteins in humans will induce stronger effects on satiety hormone release and satiation, when compared to orally ingested dietary proteins, and that 2) there are differences in hormone secretion between lean and obese subjects. To investigate this, the effects of different administration routes of pea protein on plasma satiety hormone levels, feelings of hunger and satiety, and food intake were investigated in both lean and obese subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Satiety and well-being scores</title><p>All fasting scores did not differ between treatments for both lean and obese subjects.

This effect was not seen when the protein was given orally to the same subjects. Also, intraduodenal infusion of protein resulted in stronger effects on CCK release in obese subjects than in lean subjects, whereas effects on GLP-1 and PYY release were comparable in both groups.</p><p>Digestion of proteins takes place in different stages. The initial phase of protein digestion and absorption occurs in the stomach, followed by protein digestion in the small intestine. Until now, it was commonly accepted that proteins that are more rapidly absorbed in the body (also called fast proteins) appear to have a larger effect on satiety than slow proteins, which coagulate in the stomach and induce lower levels of amino acids in the bloodstream <xref rid="pone.0024878-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In humans, it has been demonstrated that whey, a fast protein, was more satiating and induced stronger postprandial hormone release than casein, a slow protein <xref rid="pone.0024878-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It could also be possible that the &#x02018;fast&#x02019; proteins are not digested well in the stomach, leaving more intact protein to enter the duodenum, which in turn might result in higher satiation. However, no literature is available on the levels of intact proteins that reach the duodenum.</p><p>In the present study, the effects of pea protein on food intake were studied. This protein contains large amounts of arginine, asparagine, and glutamine, and is digested by approximately 93&#x00025; in the stomach <xref rid="pone.0024878-Eggum1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The study of Diepvens et al showed that pea protein hydrolysates had a more pronounced effect on PYY release and feelings of hunger, compared to whey and whole milk proteins <xref rid="pone.0024878-Diepvens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, in a recent study from our group we demonstrated that intact pea proteins were more potent in stimulating hormone release from enteroendocrine cells, than protein hydrolysates and specific peptides (accepted in Molecular Food and Nutrition research, 2010). In another study, we demonstrated that intact pea and wheat protein stimulated CCK and GLP-1 release from human duodenal tissue to a greater extent than egg and codfish protein and negative control <xref rid="pone.0024878-Geraedts3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Unlike other common protein sources such as milk, soy, or wheat proteins, pea protein has a very low allergenic potential, which makes this protein more suitable for dietary interventions than wheat protein.</p><p>The present study shows that intact pea protein is more satiating than its digested products. However, we do not know whether the subjects compensated the decreased portion size with an increased portion size during the next meal. Also, the amount of protein given is relatively high. Subjects received 250 mg per kg of bodyweight, which is comparable with a fourth of the daily total protein intake (approximately 1 gram per kg of body weight per day <xref rid="pone.0024878-Voedingscentrum1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>). It has previously been demonstrated that this amount of protein affects satiety <xref rid="pone.0024878-Veldhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and therefore, this amount was also used in the present study. However, future studies should be designed to identify the lowest effective dose of this protein. Also, options for delivering intact proteins to the duodenum will have to be investigated. There are some studies describing coatings for enteric delivery, such as pH-triggered (micro)coatings, pressure-sensitive coatings, or time-release coatings <xref rid="pone.0024878-Bodmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Dhaliwal1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Mustata1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For duodenal delivery of a large amount of protein, a pH-sensitive coating seems suitable. It should be noted that, under physiological circumstances, little intact protein will reach the duodenum. Administering large amounts of intact protein to the duodenum might result in decreased feelings of well-being. Here we demonstrated that these amounts of protein did not affect feelings of nausea, stomach ache, diarrhoea and other factors of well-being. As was demonstrated in the past, undigested lipids infused more distal in the ileum caused similar effects <xref rid="pone.0024878-Maljaars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This phenomenon called &#x02018;ileal brake&#x02019; could also be active in the present situation of undigested protein proximal in the small intestinal tract. The exact mechanisms are still not fully explained as in the lipid infusion studies as in our intact protein infusions not all gut hormones respond similar in relation to satiety response. Other local neurohumoral factors could be involved.</p><p>There are indications that obese subjects are less sensitive for satiety signals compared to lean subjects. In rats it was shown that the minimal effective dose of satiety hormones was 3&#x02013;4 times greater in obese than in lean rats <xref rid="pone.0024878-StrickerKrongrad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Lieverse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Here we demonstrated that after the same protein load, CCK levels in obese subjects were higher when compared to lean subjects, whereas GLP-1 and PYY levels did not differ between both groups. This would indicate that there is an impaired balance between protein load sensitivity and release of CCK in obese subjects. Even though the CCK levels were higher, both lean and obese subjects decreased food intake following protein ingestion to the same extent. This suggests that obese subjects are less sensitive to the satiety signals. Although there are no indications that age might have an influence on the present results, we should take into consideration, that even though not significant, there is a trend that there is a age difference between lean and obese subjects used in the present study. We should also take into consideration that perhaps obese subjects are also more sensitive to external cues that influence the amount of food eaten <xref rid="pone.0024878-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Hence, the laboratory setting may have influenced eating behaviour in the obese subjects to a larger extent than the lean. However, there were no significant differences between lean and obese subjects in relation with the appetite ratings. VAS are often used to measure subjective appetite sensations and the validity and reproducibility has been shown in several studies <xref rid="pone.0024878-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024878-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Both groups showed the same changes over time, which may also explain why both groups consumed the same amount of food.</p><p>In conclusion, food intake was decreased after intraduodenal protein administration in both lean and obese subjects, in contrast to food intake after oral ingestion of the protein. Although there were no differences in appetite ratings between both groups, we observed elevated levels of CCK in obese subjects, and GLP-1 and PYY were elevated in both groups. This suggests that by preventing gastric pea protein degradation may be an effective dietary strategy in the prevention and treatment of obesity. However, more studies will have to be performed to identify the lowest effective dose of the protein, and whether (micro)encapsulated proteins show the same effects on food intake. Also, long-term intervention studies will have to be performed to demonstrate the effects of intraduodenal pea protein administration on weight loss and weight maintenance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty male subjects participated in this study.

All subjects received a standardized evening meal (9 g protein, 39,5 g carbohydrates, 16 g fat per meal) on the day prior to the test day to standardize macronutrient intake. On each occasion, subjects arrived after fasting overnight. The nasoduodenal catheter and an intravenous blood sampling catheter were placed during each test day, and a fasting blood sample was taken. Subjects then completed an appetite and well-being questionnaire. The test-drink (for composition see &#x02018;dietary protocol&#x02019;) was consumed at time 0. During oral consumption of the test drink, subjects were instructed to consume the drink within 5 minutes. During intraduodenal infusion of the drink, the fluid was infused for 30 minutes, at a rate depending on the volume of the test-drink, which was based on total body weight of the volunteer. Subsequent blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min, respectively. An appetite questionnaire was completed 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively. A well-being questionnaire was completed 0, 5, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively. After 120 min, the nasoduodenal catheter and the intravenous catheter were removed, and subjects were offered an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal approximately 10 minutes after the removal of the catheter.

The drinks were uniformly flavored with 5 g cream vanilla flavor (Quest International, Naarden, The Netherlands) per liter beverage to mask the taste of the pea protein.
