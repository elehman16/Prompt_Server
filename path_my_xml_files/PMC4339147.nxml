Apart from headache, it is
the most common pain experienced by humans. Approximately 80% of people in the entire
population experience low back pain at least once during their lives. This pain is one of
the factors that greatly affect the quality of life of patients because it leads to
socioeconomic problems associated with increases in the costs of treatment, together with
problems in daily living activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Simple low back pain can often be prevented by forming the habit of sitting with a proper
posture and avoiding maintaining a sitting posture for prolonged periods. However, many
types of low back pain are treated with therapeutic methods that are as diverse as the
causes of low back pain. In most cases, therapeutic methods such as bed rest, assistive
devices, traction treatment, hyperthermia, electric stimulation, and manual therapy are the
first choice treatments<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. When these fail,
invasive therapeutic methods such as selective nerve root blocks and epidural injections are
used, and surgery is performed if no response to the other treatments is seen, or if the
condition of the disease is serious<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, new conservative treatments have been adopted, including extracorporeal shock wave
therapy (ESWT)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>ESWT is a therapeutic method that applies shock waves to lesions from the outside of the
body to promote revascularization and to stimulate or reactivate the curing process of
connective tissues including tendons and bones, thereby relieving pain and improving
function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. ESWT can be used for pain
relief as well as for muscle strength improvement through appropriate motor stimulation of
muscles and tendons by the shock waves<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Currently, ESWT is administered for musculoskeletal system diseases, but studies of the
effects of ESWT on chronic low back pain are rare, and few studies have examined its effects
on pain, disability, and depression. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain, disability, and depression of chronic low back
pain patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 30 patients (male: 9, female: 21) who had been diagnosed as
having chronic low back pain by specialists in orthopedics, who had low back pain that had
persisted for at least three months, and who had visited S Orthopedics Hospital located in
Daegu, Korea. The subjects were divided into a conservative physical therapy group (CPTG;
n=15; mean age 46.0&#x000b1;8.9&#x02005;years, mean height 163.7&#x000b1;9.1&#x02005;cm, and mean weight 61.9&#x000b1;14.3&#x02005;kg) and
an extracorporeal shock wave therapy group (ESWTG; n=15; mean age 49.7&#x000b1;8.3&#x02005;years, mean
height 161.3&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;cm, and mean weight 62.2&#x000b1;9.3&#x02005;kg). Ethical approval for the study was
granted by the Youngdong University Institutional Review Board. The study subjects had not
received any surgery to the lumbar vertebrae region; had no vertebral compression fractures,
spinal tumors, or intervertebral disc infections; were free of inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatism; and had no heart disease or structural abnormalities. The intention of this
study and the experimental procedures were sufficiently explained to the study subjects and
their voluntary agreement to participation was obtained before conducting the
experiment.</p><p>A VITERA (Comed, Korea) was used to conduct extracorporeal shock wave therapy for ESWTG.
Each patient assumed a prone position, and1,000 shock waves (7 times per sec) were applied
at 2.5&#x02005;Hz at low energy flux densities of 0.01&#x02013;0.16&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> using a 17&#x02005;mm head.
The treatment was conducted at the quadratus lumborum muscle and the sacroiliac joint, where
the patients complained of pain. CPTG was treated with hyperthermia using hot packs (20
minutes), ultrasound (5 minutes), and electrotherapy using TENS (15 minutes). All subjects
were treated two times per week for six weeks.</p><p>Pain was evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Disability was evaluated using the
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). This scale has 10 items which are scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;5
points based on functional performance, with higher scores indicating more severe
disabilities. In this study, nine items were assessed, excepting the item for sex life
considering subjects without spouses. Each of the nine items has six choice alternatives.
The scores measured for individual items were summed and the results were divided by the
maximum score of 45 points. The resulting values were converted into percentages. Depression
was assessed using the Beck depression index (BDI) developed by Beck et al<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This index consists of 21 items. Scores
from 0&#x02013;9 indicate conditions free of depression, from 10&#x02013;15 indicate slightly depressed
conditions, from 16&#x02013;23 indicate quite depressed conditions, and from 24&#x02013;63 indicate
seriously depressed conditions.</p><p>For statistical processing, the degrees of the chronic low back pain patients&#x02019; pain,
disability, and depression were examined using the paired sample t-test to analyze
intra-group differences and the independent sample t-test for analysis of intergroup
differences. SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used for statistical processing and the significance
level, &#x003b1;, was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Intra-group comparisons revealed significant decreases in VAS, ODI, and BDI scores of ESWTG

not to respond to conservative therapy in many cases, which has prompted a search for other
therapeutic methods.</p><p>Rompe et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when one-off
wave therapy was implemented for patients with calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, 60% of
the patients recovered to their normal states and 72% of the patients recovered to the
extent that they felt only intermittent discomfort as assessed by the Constant and Murley
scale. Lee SB<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when ESWT was
applied to patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow joint, the patients&#x02019; pain was
relieved, their simple elbow test scores improved significantly, and 83% of the patients
showed satisfactory outcomes. Cho et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow joint were treated with
ESWT, the patients&#x02019; pain significantly decreased and their muscle strength increased
significantly. Na JY<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> found that when ESWT
was administered to chronic low back pain patients, the patients&#x02019; pain significantly
decreased. In addition, some researchers have suggested that ESWT is an effective and
non-invasive new therapeutic method for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis of the elbow
joint that does not respond to conservative therapy. Lee et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when ESWT was implemented for chronic low
back pain patients, exercise programs used together with extracorporeal shock wave therapy
relieved pain and improved dynamic balance ability to a greater extent than was seen with a
combination of exercise programs and conservative physical therapy.</p><p>The intra-group comparisons in the present study revealed that there were significant
decreases in the VAS, ODI, and VAS scores of ESWTG and CPTG at the end of the intervention.
The intergroup comparison revealed that these decreases were larger in ESWTG than in the
CPTG. Rompe et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that minute
and repetitive stimuli applied through shock wave therapy were effective at relieving pain.
Hammer et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> recognized that breaking
calculi and gallstones with extracorporeal shock waves increases the blood flow rate and
rate of revascularization, and used this effect to stimulate and activate the curing
processes of tendons, surrounding tissues, and bones to remove and stabilize inflammations
in the tendons and ligaments, which resulted in pain relief.</p><p>The results of the present study also indicate that decreases in VAS scores were occurring
through mechanisms described by presented in previous studies. In addition, ESWT appeared to
relieve chronic low back pain, thereby improving the patients&#x02019; physical functions and
consequently their ability to perform daily living activities, leading to significant
decreases in low back pain disability indexes. Holmes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that the limitations or disability in patients&#x02019; daily living
would cause psychosocial problems that would further impair the quality of their lives.
Depression is closely related to physical disability and chronic pain in chronic disease
patients, and it is an important element that interferes with pain relief by delaying
recovery or aggravating diseases<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the present study, ESWT relieved pain and reduced disability indexes, thereby improving the
patients&#x02019; physical functions and ability to perform daily living activities, which in turn
had positive effects on the patients&#x02019; psychological, emotional, and cognitive states,
decreasing the degree of their depression. Decreased pain in chronic low back pain patients
is a more influential factor than disability and depression. But we regard research is
necessary to elucidate other factors.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the number of chronic low back pain patient
subjects was limited, so the results cannot be generalized. Second, the lumbar lesion sites
were limited and the subjects&#x02019; daily lives could not be completely controlled. Third, no
previous studies have measured the effects of ESWT on depression, so our present results
could not be compared with those of other studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group>: Effect of manual adjustment and gym-ball exercise on sEMG, cobb&#x02019;s angle,
