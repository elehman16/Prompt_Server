The second question, &#x0201c;How did your doctor tell you to take this medication?&#x0201d; was used to describe the antibiotic schedule, duration, and instructions for use. Most of the counseling session was dedicated to this question in order to explain the importance of adhering to the antibiotic schedule and duration prescribed by their doctor and to explain the instructions described on the auxiliary labels for correct use of the antibiotic. The third question, &#x0201c;What did your doctor tell you to expect about your medication?&#x0201d; was used to describe any side effects that should be expected while taking their antibiotic.</p><p>Five to seven days after medication pickup, a follow-up phone-call was conducted by a study investigator to collect data on the subject&#x02019;s short-term recall of medication instructions. At least three telephone attempts were made for each subject and, if possible, a message was left requesting that the subject return the phone-call. Three failed attempts without any call-back were considered a failure.</p><p>The study investigator responsible for conducting the follow-up phone-call was a licensed pharmacist who was trained to administer the questionnaire and blinded to whether the subject received counseling. Since a standardized psychometrically validated questionnaire to measure the endpoints in this study did not exist, a scripted questionnaire was developed based on a literature search for consistency. All data during the follow-up interview were collected on the follow-up questionnaire form.

The secondary outcome measures were captured on the follow-up questionnaire form as verbatim answers.</p><p>For adherence to schedule and duration, subjects were asked when they started taking their prescription, whether they had or had not completed their prescription, and reasons for continuing or stopping their prescription. If subjects were still taking their prescription, they were later asked to retrieve their prescription bottles and count the number of remaining tablets/capsules. The remaining tablets/capsules indicated by the subject was later compared with the expected number of remaining tablets/capsules by calculating the antibiotic schedule and time the subject started their prescription. If they had already completed their prescription, they were asked to recall when they completed their prescription. The date and time in which the subject completed their medication was also compared with the expected date of medication completion. Subjects were asked how often and at what times they took their prescription versus how often and at what times they were supposed to take their prescription. Subjects were specifically asked whether they had missed any doses, and if so, how many times had they missed a dose.</p><p>All verbatim responses were later provided to a reviewing committee consisting of three registered pharmacists. This committee was only involved in determining adherence based on the answers provided on the questionnaire form and was blinded to randomization assignment to reduce potential bias. Members were trained to review the verbatim responses provided by each subject and then rate whether the subject was adherent with their prescription schedule and duration. The first two committee members independently provided their assessments.

The recall of auxiliary labeling information for this study sample was 77%. This high level of recall would require an increased sample size to see the absolute difference that this study was powered to detect. There were only two recall errors in the intervention compared to seven in the control group. While not statistically significant, this represents a 78% reduction in recall errors for patients counseled on auxiliary labeling information compared to those who did not receive medication counseling. In addition, the number of nonadherent patients identified in this study was higher for patients who did not receive counseling compared to patients who received counseling (p = NS).</p><p>While not always directly correlated, the unanticipated high recall rate observed in this study may have been due to the high education levels of the patients enrolled in this study and a corresponding high level of health literacy. Other explanations include the possibility of familiarity with auxiliary label content for antibiotics or a high degree of medical sophistication among the patients in this study. The health literacy level and degree of medical sophistication were not directly evaluated in this study. The possibility of other factors, such as friends or neighbors with medical knowledge, was also not explored.</p><p>Focused counseling on dietary restrictions appeared to be the most critical auxiliary labeling information for patient medication counseling based on the subjects&#x02019; rate of recall. These auxiliary labels were answered incorrectly more often than other labels, especially in the arm that received no counseling, which is likely due to patient&#x02019;s not understanding the dietary restrictions associated with antibiotics.</p><p>In contrast to the dietary restriction labels, auxiliary labels used to stress the importance of adherence to antibiotic schedule and duration, such as Label 1 did not appear to be effective. This auxiliary label was affixed to every subject&#x02019;s medication bottle and was answered correctly by every retained subject during the follow-up interview. Despite the ability to correctly recall this auxiliary label, 30% of subjects in both intervention arms were still nonadherent to their antibiotic medication. This finding shows that correctly recalling medication information for these types of labels does not translate to improved patient adherence.</p><p>Despite having patients perform pill counts to assess compliance, the study was limited by the patient-reported methodology when assessing medication adherence since these pill counts were self-reported and not all of the patients performed the requested pill counts due to completion of therapy or the unavailability of the medication bottle at the time of the follow-up interview.</p><p>Issues with generalizability were a concern since the study was conducted in a small suburban region near Baltimore, Maryland, and the subject population consisted of primarily African American females with a high level of education. Subjects were aware that they were enrolled into a counseling study and that there would be a follow-up interview with a pharmacist, which could result in a Hawthorne effect. Additionally, improvement in the content and format of auxiliary labels using patient feedback could also result in improved recall and adherence of medication information.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312113490420" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The data related to adherence yielded interesting results about the association between recall of auxiliary labels and whether recall impacts adherence. Further investigation is needed to derive definitive results in these two areas, perhaps in a larger, adequately powered study using a more definitive methodology to assess medication adherence. A larger study that enrolls patients with lower levels of health literacy may also be of interest since these patients may have more marked responses to patient counseling with an emphasis on auxiliary label information since it is less likely that they understand and can apply written medication information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section17-2050312113490420"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The recall of general auxiliary labeling information was high (77%) for patients who did and did not receive counseling on general auxiliary labeling information. However, the nonstatistical findings from this study suggest that medication counseling with an emphasis on auxiliary label information may lead to improved patient recall and medication adherence for antibiotic treatment regimens. The medication information that was most commonly misunderstood by patients who did not receive counseling on auxiliary labels was related to dietary restrictions required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes. Additional adequately powered studies are required to confirm the preliminary findings from this study and to determine whether these findings correspond to an improvement in medication adherence. Additional research focusing on counseling interventions related to medication dietary restrictions is also recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Richard Gorman, MD; Mary Roth McClurg, PharmD; Paras Patel, RPh; Jeen Min, RPh; and Hamet Toure, PharmD, MPh.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2050312113490420"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
