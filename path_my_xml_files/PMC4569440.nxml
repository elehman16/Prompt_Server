Though insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of this poor glycemic control, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear.</p><p>Metformin is a biguanide, which acts principally by increasing insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose output [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Randomized controlled trials with metformin in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) reported a decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there have been conflicting reports from studies in adolescents with T1D [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The main drawback of these studies was the small sample size and lack of reporting on long term benefit and safety of adjunctive therapy in many of them [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>To address this question, we conducted a 12-month clinical trial consisting of a 3-month run-in-phase and a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional period to determine the role of adjunctive metformin therapy on glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. We hypothesized that adjunctive metformin therapy would improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. The study&#x02019;s objective was to compare the effect of adjunctive metformin vs. placebo on glycemic control, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and hypoglycemia in overweight/obese youth with T1D receiving multiple daily injections of insulin.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>The study contract was approved by the Novo Nordisk Inc., on September 16<sup>th</sup> 2010.

Randomization protocol was 1:1 (metformin: placebo) and was blocked for every 10 subjects.</p><p>Randomization-Allocation concealment: Double-blinded treatments were allocated using sequentially-numbered drug containers. Concealed treatment allocation was made by IDS, which secured blinding codes during the trial. IDS maintained a sealed copy of the randomization sequence at the investigation site in case of need for emergency unblinding.</p><p>Randomization-Implementation: The IDS established the randomization sequence. The trial endocrinologists enrolled patients to the study. A pharmacist, unconnected with the study, assigned participants to the groups.</p><p>Blinding: Patients and investigators were blinded to the identity of the study medication and placebo. IDS maintained blinding information throughout the study duration. At study conclusion, the randomization code was decrypted in a two-step procedure as follows: first step: treatment A or B; second step: A = metformin and B = placebo. All statistical analyses were performed after the second step of unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive metformin therapy compared to placebo during a 9-mo treatment period in overweight/obese youth with T1D and poor glycemic control.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome: Comparison of the baseline-adjusted differences in HbA1c between the metformin and placebo groups during the trial.</p><p>Secondary outcomes: Pre-specified secondary outcomes included additional parameters that are associated with glycemic control such as total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, TDD of short-acting insulin, TDD of long-acting insulin, fasting plasma glucose, and hypoglycemia assessed at baseline and every 3 months till study completion.

We based this calculation on the level of HbA1c, because it required the smallest effect difference for a biologically meaningful comparison. We used a confidence level of 95% (Z <sub>(1-&#x003b1;/2)</sub> = 1.96 for a two-tailed test) and a statistical power of 80% (Z <sub>(1-&#x003b2;)</sub> = 0.84). Our assumptions were that the use of metformin would reduce average HbA1c values over time by 0.75%, and that the standard deviation for these estimates would be &#x000b1;1.25. We also assumed a within subject correlation of 0.500. Our calculated group sizes of 29 individuals for each arm of the trial yielded an actual power of 81.1%.</p><p>Subject characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Group-specific comparisons of anthropometric and biochemical parameters were performed at baseline using paired <italic>t</italic> tests or its non-parametric equivalent where indicated. Where doubts arose about the Normality of our variables, we carried out the above analyses on log-transformed values. Independent proportions (e.g., race, gender) were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Differences in treatment effects between the randomized groups were evaluated by comparison of the three study time points (+3mo, +6mo, +9mo), for each of the outcomes of interest: HbA1c values, fasting blood glucose, total daily dose of insulin, and fractional daily dose of short- and long-acting insulin. Using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure, individual two-way mixed ANOVA models were fitted for each of our outcomes of interest, with treatment type (metformin or placebo) as the fixed effect and baseline values as covariates.</p><p>We had three missing HbA1c measurements in our dataset. Rather than allowing case deletion, which would have further reduced our power, we imputed the missing values by averaging the HbA1c measurements immediately before and after the missing datapoints. For this, we assumed these data were missing completely at random, and considered that our very small fraction of missing values (0.03%) would not introduce bias. The correlation structure used was first order autoregressive structure with homogenous variance (ARI). Analyses were based on the intent-to-treat principle and were performed using SPSS v.22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec022"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>

This study differed from our trial in that the investigators enrolled only female subjects; used only 850 mg of metformin daily in the treatment arm; and recruited both normal-weight and overweight/obese subjects. They neither evaluated changes in fasting glucose levels nor employed a standardized insulin treatment protocol to ensure uniformity of glycemic control in both the placebo and metformin groups. They also did not investigate the changes in the doses of fast-acting- and long acting insulins in both groups. Another trial, a 6-month RCT of adjunctive metformin in 74 youth with T1D concluded that metformin therapy reduces insulin dose requirements in T1D but not HbA1c value[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].This study, though adequately powered, was limited by its relatively short duration.</p><p>In contrast, some studies in youth have reported significant reduction in HbA1c in those who received adjunctive metformin therapy [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These studies were, however, limited by their short duration of 3 months[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], open label design and very small sample size of 9 subjects [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 10 subjects[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, the two RCTs that reported reductions in HbA1c [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] did not categorically recruit overweight/obese children and adolescents with T1D, and did not employ a titration regimen to ensure uniformity of insulin dosing and glycemic control.</p><p>Taken together, despite the lack of consensus on the efficacy of adjunctive metformin on HbA1c in T1D, our study suggests that prolonged treatment with adjunctive metformin could result in a clinically significant[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reduction in HbA1c in overweight/obese children and adolescents with T1D.</p><p>The elevated mean HbA1c values in our study are similar to the findings from a recent national report on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1D which showed higher mean HbA1c level [8.4 &#x000b1; 1.4% for whites, 9.6 &#x000b1; 1.9% for blacks, and 8.7 &#x000b1; 1.6% for Hispanics] than the recently recommended HbA1c target of &#x0003c;7.5% by the American Diabetes Association[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, our finding of suboptimal glycemic control despite increasing insulin dose in the placebo group is consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which reported that the average of HbA1c values in adolescents with T1D was 1% higher than in adults in both the conventional and intensive treatment groups, despite receiving more insulin; and attempts to increase insulin doses led to weight gain and worsening of glycemic control. The proposed mechanism for this deterioration in glycemic control was termed insulin resistance of puberty, which is believed to be driven by the significantly elevated levels of anti-insulin hormones namely growth hormone and sex steroids, during the period of active pubertal maturation.</p><p>Apart from IR of puberty, other factors may have contributed to the failure to achieve optimal glycemia in this cohort. Differences in subjects&#x02019; adherence to insulin therapy may have led to poor glycemic outcome. Equally, some patients could have adjusted their insulin doses to maintain glycemic targets that were substantially higher than those directed by the investigators. It could also be due to a combination of these two factors.</p><p>The significant reduction in insulin requirement in our metformin cohort is consistent with improved insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lack of a significant change in ISF in the metformin group suggests that the mechanism for this reduction in insulin requirement was principally by increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and consequent reduction in hepatic glucose production [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, though the lack of a statistically-significant reduction in HbA1c suggests that insulin resistance may not be the sole mechanism for poor glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D, our small sample size may have introduced type 2 statistical errors that prevented the detection of significant differences in HbA1c between the groups.</p><p>Several socio-demographic and therapeutic factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parental education, parental involvement in diabetes management, family dynamics, and whether a patient receives care from an endocrinologist[<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have been associated with poor glycemic control in youth [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These variables were considered in our analysis as all of our subjects received their care from pediatric endocrinologists, had parental involvement in their diabetes care, were of low to medium socio-economic status, and mostly of white or Hispanic ethnic groups.</p><p>This RCT has a number of limitations that should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. The small sample size is a major limitation and this could have limited our ability to detect significant differences in the outcome parameters. Such type 2 errors might indicate that we had insufficient power to reject the null hypothesis despite the fact that this hypothesis is false. This is particularly important in interpreting the results that were nearly significant such as the change in the TDD of long-acting insulin in which the metformin group had a consistently lower requirement for long-acting insulin throughout the trial compared to the placebo group (p = 0.221). It is possible that a significant difference could have been detected with an adequate sample size.</p><p>Secondly, though the significantly reduced insulin requirement in the metformin group was consistent with increased insulin sensitivity in that cohort, no formal measurement of insulin resistance using techniques such as hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was conducted. Furthermore, changes in physical activities during the study, which could alter insulin sensitivity, were not measured; and plasma or urine metformin levels were not obtained to monitor adherence. Intake of calories and macronutrients was not monitored and analyzed as these could represent strong modifiers of glycemic control in patients with T1D.</p><p>The trial was stopped before reaching enrollment target because most youth were reluctant to commit to this long-term study. An analysis of the characteristics of the 10 subjects who were consented for the study but not randomized, showed no differences in anthropometric and glycemic characteristics between the randomized subjects and the 6 dropouts. The remaining 4 subjects were excluded because they either had an HbA1c value of &#x0003c;8% or BMI of &#x0003c;85% on the day of their scheduled randomization.</p><p>The study&#x02019;s strengths lie in its randomized controlled design, the long duration of intervention, the enrollment criteria, and the use of a common insulin treatment protocol of multiple daily insulin injections only, thus ensuring a uniformity of timing and delivery of both short- and long-acting insulins. This is the first trial to employ a standardized insulin titration protocol, the treat-to-target insulin regimen, in the investigation of the role of adjunctive metformin therapy in youth with T1D. The employment of treat-to-target insulin regimen ensured that all participants used the same algorithm for insulin dose adjustment throughout the duration of the study. This protocol addressed the problem of the uniformity of insulin administration, which has been a recurrent confounder in other trials on adjunctive metformin therapy in T1D. Further strengths of the study include the use of a common insulin analog for the short-acting and long-acting insulin formulations; the use of a single basal insulin dose given every evening to ensure accuracy of titration of long-acting insulin dose to FPG levels, and the incorporation of the MyCareTeam software to capture glucose readings for the entire duration of the study. The trial&#x02019;s retention rate of 78.6% ensured that the completers were representative of the original cohort. This is the first trial in youth to accurately determine that the differential increase in insulin requirement in the placebo group was a function of escalations in the dose of long-acting insulin, and not the short-acting insulin dose. Thus, the long duration of this trial ensured that our conclusions were free from initial Hawthorne effects, and the institution of a standardized insulin delivery protocol allowed conclusions to be drawn on the effect of adjunctive metformin therapy on glycemic control and insulin requirements that were not possible in previous studies in this field. Therefore, though this trial&#x02019;s relatively small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings, the study&#x02019;s randomized, placebo-controlled design and the novel measures implemented to limit confounding variables, ensured the validity of these results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this nine-month randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial, we report a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group. This clinically significant difference [<xref rid="pone.0137525.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in HbA1c did not reach statistical significance most likely due to type 2 error arising from inadequate sample size. This reduction in HbA1c suggests that adiposity-associated insulin resistance may be one of the primary mechanisms for poor glycemic control in these patients while other factors such as socio-demographic, hormonal, and therapeutic factors may play a secondary role on glycemic control in this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137525.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137525.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137525.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137525.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137525.s003"><label>S1 Amendment</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137525.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Alan D.
