Participants were eligible if they were 18&#x02013;69&#x000a0;years old, were available for follow-up during the study period and provided written informed consent. Individuals were excluded when they had any health or medical conditions that contraindicated influenza vaccine or zanamivir administration, had received the 2008&#x02013;2009 influenza vaccine prior to the study start date, were pregnant or planning to be pregnant or were breastfeeding, had received immunoglobulin therapy within 6&#x000a0;months of study entry, were participating a study of any investigational drug during the study period or had an immunocompromising condition or therapy.

A random number table was used to generate assignments, in blocks of 4 or 6. A staff member not affiliated with the study generated the list and provided the assignment to study nurses following consent. Participants in the vaccine group received one intramuscular injection of Fluviral&#x000ae; (GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada) 2008&#x02013;2009 trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine containing influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) and B/Florida/4/2006. Participants in the antiviral prophylaxis arm were prescribed one 10&#x000a0;mg dose of zanamivir (Relenza&#x000ae;; GlaxoSmithKline) per day for the influenza season. Participants who experienced side effects and discontinued antiviral prophylaxis were given either Fluviral&#x000ae; or Vaxigrip&#x000ae; (Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, ON, Canada) but remained in the antiviral arm of the study for analysis. The influenza season was defined, <italic>a priori,</italic> as starting when the proportion of all specimens tested for influenza in the province was &#x0003e;3% positive for 1&#x000a0;week or &#x0003e;2&#x000b7;5% for two consecutive weeks and ending when the proportion was less than 2% positive for two consecutive weeks. These definitions were established to keep the risk of exposure to influenza low for participants on prophylactic antiviral medication. This study was approved by Health Canada and Mount Sinai Hospital's Research Ethics Board, was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00784784) and was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection started on the day of enrolment and continued until the end of the seasonal influenza season.

Sera were extracted and stored, frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C for later testing. Active surveillance for acute respiratory illness occurred using web-based weekly diaries of symptoms throughout the influenza season. Participants with any acute respiratory symptom (runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, sore or scratchy throat, hoarseness, cough) or an unexplained fever were asked to have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected by study nurses and to self-collected a mid-turbinate nasal swab.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Adherence to prophylaxis was assessed using weekly diaries and medication counts at each of four study visits.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participation in clinical trial, November 2008 to June 2009.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="irv0009-0078-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Laboratory testing</title><p>All mid-turbinate nasal and NP swab samples were tested for influenza virus using the CDC influenza A matrix and influenza B NAAT at the Ontario Public Health Laboratory, Toronto, ON.

Two cases occurred in participants from the vaccine arm: both tested positive to influenza A (H1N1, seasonal strain) but neither had a significant increase in HAI titres to tested strains. One participant randomized to antiviral prophylaxis, who reported taking 93% of prescribed doses, tested positive for influenza B by NAAT on 18 February 2009, but had no change in HAI titres. A second person taking antiviral prophylaxis did not report symptoms of an acute respiratory illness on questionnaires nor when questioned during the final study visit, but had a 16-fold increase in antibody titres to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). This individual reported 100% compliance with the prophylaxis, stopped taking medication May 25th and had their final study visit (and blood draw) on July 15th. The period between discontinuing medication and the blood draw was during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> making it possible that the participant was exposed after discontinuing zanamivir prophylaxis.

The odds of reporting an acute respiratory illness also increased with recent exposure (past 7&#x000a0;days) to a patient, co-worker, spouse or child who had symptoms of a respiratory illness. Using a multivariable model to adjust for the impact of other factors, the odds of reporting an acute respiratory illness doubled following recent exposure to a patient or child who had symptoms but

use antiviral prophylaxis against influenza for an entire influenza season with 90% of participants taking at least 90% of scheduled doses for up to 18&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;weeks of prophylaxis. In this study, 7&#x000b7;5% of people discontinued the antiviral medication due to side effects. This is similar to an unblinded randomized controlled trial of adults taking oseltamivir or given influenza vaccine for the prevention of influenza infection. In that study, 10% of participants discontinued prophylaxis due to side effects over a full influenza season.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In comparison, in three blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials only 1&#x02013;2% of participants in each study arm discontinued zanamivir, oseltamivir or placebo prophylaxis due to side effects experienced during treatment.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In adults, seasonal influenza vaccines prevent about 59% of laboratory-confirmed influenza illnesses compared with no vaccine.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In randomized, placebo-controlled studies of antiviral prophylaxis, the protective efficacy of zanamivir and oseltamivir against laboratory-confirmed influenza ranged from 31 to 83% in adults and adolescents in studies that ranged in duration from 28&#x000a0;days to 6&#x000a0;weeks.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Studies that directly compare vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis, including the current study and another pilot study conducted in our facility in the 2007&#x02013;2008 season,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> highlight the fact that neither option is perfect, but that both provide greater protection than no intervention. Antiviral prophylaxis may provide protection for those at higher risk of contracting, transmitting, and/or suffering severe consequences of infection caused by influenza strains not included in the seasonal vaccines (e.g. during a pandemic or a year with significant mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains).</p><p>In this study, the direct provision of patient care and exposure to a patient with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection in the previous week were both associated with higher odds of illness. This is consistent with other studies reporting that people working in healthcare institutions are at higher risk of acute respiratory illness than people working in other professions.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Williams <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> report that people working in acute care hospitals in Germany had higher odds of reporting ARI during the 2006&#x02013;2007 influenza season than people working for other employers after adjusting for age, sex and smoking status. In the current study, the risk of an acute respiratory illness was also higher for participants who were exposed to their spouse or child who was ill during the previous week. Exposure to an ill family member was reported as a risk factor for influenza for healthcare workers during the 2009 pandemic<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, while living with<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> or being otherwise exposed to children<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was a risk for respiratory illnesses in several other studies.</p><p>A limitation of this pilot study was the inability to blind participants to their treatment which may have biased both the reporting of respiratory symptoms and side effects of the antiviral medication. Secondly, participants provided exposure information after they reported ARI, which likely biased their recall of exposure to people who had symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. Also, since the 2009 pandemic strain of influenza A started to circulate towards the end of the planned study period, it likely increased long-term adherence to the prophylactic antiviral medication. In a previous study, it was found that adherence started to wane towards the end of the influenza season.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> As most of the study participants worked in an acute care facility and had regular internet access, it is likely that our study population was of a higher socioeconomic status than the general population which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Strengths of the study are that it was randomized and an overwhelming majority of participants consistently completed weekly diaries reducing recall bias of symptoms and exposures.</p><p>Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in preventing influenza infections and adults can comply with a schedule of once daily doses for a full season, with a low percentage having to discontinue because of side effects. Exposure to a spouse, child or patient with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness within the past week are risk factors for respiratory illness in healthy adults exemplifying the need to follow guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory infections, both at home and in the workplace.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded, in part, by an investigator-initiated research to AJM with GlaxoSmithKline Inc.
