Immediate and short-term effects were therefore examined across attentional biases, state and trait body dissatisfaction in a randomised controlled trial consisting of 62 female participants aged 18&#x02013;35&#x02009;years. The results show no changes to attentional bias across either the experimental or control condition and no significant changes in body dissatisfaction immediately post-training or at 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks follow-up. Single-session attention bias modification protocols may therefore not be sufficient in modifying appearance-based biases and associated disordered body schemas within a nonclinical sample.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attentional bias</kwd><kwd>attention bias modification</kwd><kwd>body dissatisfaction</kwd><kwd>dot-probe</kwd><kwd>females</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July-December 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>High rates of body image disturbances are found in western cultures, with body dissatisfaction or the desire to lose weight estimated to affect 74&#x02009;per cent of adult women (<xref rid="bibr15-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al., 2008</xref>). Given that body dissatisfaction is a consistent predictor of problematic eating pathology and is a diagnostic criterion for eating disorders (<xref rid="bibr9-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Coker and Abraham, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Stice and Shaw, 2002</xref>), it is important to better understand factors that may exacerbate body image concerns.</p><p>A central tenant of cognitive models of eating disorders is the activation of maladaptive schemas (i.e. highly efficient knowledge structures) that bias the processing of shape-, weight-, food- and self-related information over other incoming information (<xref rid="bibr37-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek and Hollon, 1990</xref>). These cognitive biases, particularly attentional biases, have been implicated in the exacerbation of general body image concerns in nonclinical samples (<xref rid="bibr31-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rieger, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smeets et al., 2011</xref>) and women with eating disorders (<xref rid="bibr25-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Rieger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et al., 2007</xref>). This biased schema-driven processing may be one mechanism through which high levels of body dissatisfaction are reinforced and maintained over time (<xref rid="bibr14-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Glauert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Stice and Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek and Hollon, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Researchers have been investigating the role of selective attention in eating disorders for over two decades. This selective bias towards shape-, weight- and food-related information has been found in a variety of tasks including the modified Stroop task (<xref rid="bibr11-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Dozois, 2004</xref>), the dichotic listening task (<xref rid="bibr27-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Schotte et al., 1990</xref>) and the dot-probe task (<xref rid="bibr25-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Rieger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et al., 2007</xref>). This attentional bias is not, however, specific only to those with clinical eating disorders (<xref rid="bibr38-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al., 1999</xref>). It is theorised that nonclinical samples will also display attentional biases towards body-related information due to body schemas being both universal and particularistic (<xref rid="bibr23-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Perpi&#x000f1;&#x000e1; et al., 1993</xref>). That is, all women possess body-related schemas, yet only some women possess dysfunctional particularistic schemas that act to bias information selectivity. Although less consistent than eating disorder samples, certain subgroups within the nonclinical population who are preoccupied with dieting or body size (e.g. restrained eaters or women with high body dissatisfaction) will also exhibit appearance-related biases, particularly towards negative shape, weight and food-related stimuli (<xref rid="bibr13-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Glauert et al., 2010</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bibr14-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Glauert et al. (2010)</xref> found that undergraduate women demonstrated an automatic attentional bias towards thin rather than fat body figures, suggesting a general preference towards thin bodies. This bias was found regardless of how dissatisfied women were with their bodies.</p><p>Manipulating these biases directly through attentional training can improve body dissatisfaction or worsen body dissatisfaction when women are trained to focus on positive or negative appearance cues, respectively (<xref rid="bibr30-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smeets et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rieger, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr32-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). <xref rid="bibr31-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rieger (2006)</xref> successfully induced an attentional bias via a single-session modified dot-probe task in a female undergraduate student sample aged between 17 and 28&#x02009;years (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;70). Those trained to attend to negative shape- and weight-related information reported greater body dissatisfaction after completing a body image stressor task compared to women in the control condition who displayed no changes in body dissatisfaction. These findings were replicated in a second study by <xref rid="bibr32-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rieger (2009)</xref> using a sample of female undergraduate students, aged between 17 and 26&#x02009;years (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;98). Training attention towards negative appearance-based information in a single session again exacerbated body dissatisfaction after completion of a body image stressor task compared to the control condition in which participants displayed no changes in body dissatisfaction. However, training attention towards positive shape- and weight-related information did <italic>not</italic> affect body dissatisfaction. It may therefore be negatively valenced information specifically, and not appearance information generally, that intensifies body dissatisfaction. These findings are important as they help to identify potential processes through which body image outcomes may be improved.</p><p>An established attentional re-training protocol designed to manipulate patterns of attention is attention bias modification (ABM). The use of ABM to improve psychological outcomes has been extensively studied within anxiety disorders. For example, several randomised, controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in clinical anxiety symptoms when attention is trained away from threatening stimuli (<xref rid="bibr1-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Amir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr3-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Haim et al., 2011</xref>). Although multiple-session ABM protocols are currently proving to be more effective in producing sustained changes to attention over time, a number of studies have found that single-session ABM can also alter attentional processing. For example, when used in the context of food biases, single ABM sessions have been used to successfully increase attention towards healthy foods (<xref rid="bibr17-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kakoschke et al., 2014</xref>) and reduce biases towards general food stimuli in obese women (<xref rid="bibr19-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kemps et al., 2014b</xref>), with flow on effects in reducing consumption of craved foods (<xref rid="bibr18-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kemps et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">2014c</xref>) and unhealthy snack foods (<xref rid="bibr17-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kakoschke et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether a single-session ABM would be effective in improving body dissatisfaction in a sample of young women from the community, based on calls for more research into this area (e.g. <xref rid="bibr24-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Renwick et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This study reports the outcome of a double-blind randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a single-session ABM protocol, aimed at redirecting attention towards neutral information over appearance-related information. Immediate effects on attentional biases and state and trait body dissatisfaction were taken as well as short-term (1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks) follow-up on the state and trait measures. The effects were compared across women high and low on trait body dissatisfaction as the ABM protocol was expected to be strongest in women with pre-existing body dissatisfaction. The sample for this study was divided into high and low body dissatisfaction to determine whether trait body dissatisfaction is a prerequisite to the efficacy of ABM in a nonclinical but at-risk female population. Words related to both negative and positive appearances were included to examine the specificity of any training effects.</p><p>Three hypotheses were proposed. Women in the ABM condition, compared to women in the control condition, would show the following: (H1) a significant reduction in attentional bias towards negative appearance information, (H2) an improvement in state body dissatisfaction scores immediately after training and (H3) improved state and trait body dissatisfaction 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks following the intervention. Across all hypotheses, the magnitude of change was expected to be greater in women with pre-existing body dissatisfaction.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2055102915614310"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2-2055102915614310"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 62 women aged between 18 and 35&#x02009;years (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23.95&#x02009;years; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.84&#x02009;years) provided data across all three stages of the study.

The task was designed to induce an attentional bias towards neutral non-appearance word stimuli and away from negative appearance-related stimuli. The dot-probe task consisted of four phases: pre-assessment of attentional biases, ABM training (or placebo), post-assessment of attentional biases and booster ABM/placebo training.</p><p>To begin each trial, a fixation cross (+) directed attention to the centre of the screen, with participants pressing the space bar to begin. Participants were presented with a pair of words (one appearance word and one matched neutral word) with one in the upper location of the screen and one in the lower location. After 500&#x02009;ms, the word pair was replaced with a dot-probe (*) in either the upper or lower screen location. Participants were required to indicate as quickly as possible the spatial location of the dot-probe by pressing the up or down arrow key on the computer keyboard. Reaction times were recorded in milliseconds for each trial, with the trial recording a no-response after 1500&#x02009;ms. Once a response was made, the fixation cross-appeared to signal the start of the next trial.</p><p>During assessment phases, 10 word pairs were presented from each of the three word categories: positive appearance, negative appearance and neutral non-appearance. The word pairs were presented for a total of four times at random, once across each possible location combination: upper location/congruent, lower location/congruent, upper location/non-congruent and lower location/non-congruent. Congruent trials refer to the dot-probe replacing the target word in either the upper or lower location of the screen, while non-congruent trials refer to the dot-probe replacing the matched neutral word in either the upper or lower location of the screen. This resulted in 120 pre-assessment trials and 120 post-assessment trials.</p><p>During the ABM phase, only negative appearance/neutral word pairs were included. During these trials, the dot-probe always appeared in the location of the neutral word, implicitly directing attention away from the negative appearance-related word. Each word pair during the ABM phase was presented eight times across the two non-congruent location combinations (upper/non-congruent; lower/non-congruent) for a total of 160 trials. The booster ABM phase included an additional 80 trials of the same type and was used to ensure participants ended the session on a training phase. The control group experienced no manipulation of attention. Instead, they completed 160 placebo trials (plus 80 placebo booster trials) that had the same contingencies as the pre-/post-assessment phases. Thus, each participant completed a total of 480 trials over the four phases plus an additional 20 practice trials at the beginning.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2055102915614310"><title>Word stimuli</title><p>Three categories of word stimuli were used in the ABM task: positive appearance, negative appearance and neutral (unrelated to appearance) words.

Our sample showed no changes to their attentional bias scores, for either positive or negative appearance words, after undergoing a single-session ABM protocol which aimed to direct attention <italic>away</italic> from negative appearance&#x02013;related words. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was not supported. Furthermore, we found no evidence of changes to immediate state body satisfaction (Hypothesis 2) or follow-up state and trait body satisfaction 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks after training (Hypothesis 3). The effectiveness of ABM in modifying appearance-related attentional biases is therefore questioned, at least within a nonclinical but body image&#x02013;concerned group.</p><p>There are a number of possible reasons for these non-significant effects.

Thus, multiple training sessions that provide systematic practice in redirecting attention away from negative appearance-related information might be required to compete with elaborate schemas for appearance-related information that have been acquired over years. Although the most effective ABM results within anxiety literature have been demonstrated with regular ABM sessions ranging from online daily sessions (e.g. <xref rid="bibr28-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">See et al., 2009</xref>) to twice-weekly sessions over 4&#x02009;weeks (e.g. <xref rid="bibr1-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Amir et al., 2009</xref>), <xref rid="bibr31-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rieger (2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr32-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) were still able to successfully manipulate appearance-based attentional processing within a single training session. Both studies were successful in inducing attentional biases towards emotionally salient appearance stimuli and neutral stimuli. However, the premise of ABM as introduced by <xref rid="bibr21-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (2002)</xref> is to redirect attention <italic>towards</italic> a neutral item and <italic>away</italic> from an emotionally salient item, and successful training has occurred within a single session when redirecting attention away from food stimuli in obese women (<xref rid="bibr19-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kemps et al., 2014b</xref>) and undergraduate women (<xref rid="bibr20-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kemps et al., 2014c</xref>). ABM may therefore be more effective in competing with appearance-based schemas when attention is re-directed <italic>towards</italic> positive appearance words rather than <italic>towards</italic> neutral words in the presence of negative appearance information. The lack of ABM research within the body image field means that &#x02018;best practice&#x02019; protocols are not available but remain an important direction for future research.</p><p>The second reason for the non-significant findings may be that attentional biases were not sufficiently evident at pre-test to allow for any modification. Most of the bias values were close to zero with the one exception of a small bias (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.11) towards positive appearance information found in the high body dissatisfaction group. The role of pre-existing biases in modifying the outcomes of ABM has also not been fully explored (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Mogoa&#x0015f;e et al., 2014</xref>). However, <xref rid="bibr2-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Haim (2010)</xref> has argued that pre-existing biases are not required for ABM to work, although this may only apply to samples with anxiety. It is crucial for future research to clarify the ABM mechanism of change as empirical data to date, although limited, do not provide as much support as expected for the assumption that ABM works by counteracting the dysfunctional attentional bias (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Mogoa&#x0015f;e et al., 2014</xref>). It may be that the measurement of attentional bias itself (i.e. dot-probe task paradigm) needs to be further investigated in order to clarify the mechanism of change in ABM procedures. Again, further research is needed to examine these factors within the context of appearance-based biases and body dissatisfaction.</p><p>Although this study failed to find evidence for the effectiveness of ABM, it does add to the limited body of ABM research outside of the anxiety disorders. Within anxiety literature itself, a number of studies that have delivered attentional bias modification tasks have failed to successfully modify biased attentional patterns or impact clinical symptomology (<xref rid="bibr5-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Bunnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Schoorl et al., 2013</xref>). As in this study, without a change in attention, it is likely that no subsequent changes in outcomes are to be expected. Unsuccessful ABM trials therefore represent an absence of evidence for the effectiveness of ABM, but not so far as to provide evidence that ABM is ineffective (<xref rid="bibr8-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Certain limitations must be taken into account when considering directions for future research. Limitations of this study include the use of a university sample with varying levels of body dissatisfaction which may limit generality to at-risk subgroups within the general population. It was also difficult to eliminate demand effects, especially with three testing points where participants became more familiar with the tone of the study. The body image questionnaires focused solely on dissatisfaction with body size and weight rather than global appearance satisfaction and importance of appearance which should also be explored. Furthermore, the reliability of the dot-probe procedure to assess differential changes in appearance-specific attentional processes may also have limited our findings.</p><p>Despite these limitations, a number of methodological strengths were present. First, we employed a gold-standard measure of training effects through a double-blind, randomised controlled trial design. Pre-training and post-training measures of attentional bias allowed for the direct examination of attentional change, ensuring any statistically significant changes were due to the experimental manipulation and not pre-existing differences. The pre-test measure of state and trait body dissatisfaction also allowed for experimental ABM outcomes to be further distinguished according to pre-existing high or low body dissatisfaction, which is an important factor in determining the practical benefit of ABM as a preventative therapy for at-risk populations. In addition, we addressed the methodological disruption of learning suggested to occur between training and assessment trials (<xref rid="bibr2-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Haim, 2010</xref>), by including an additional booster phase of ABM trials so that participants ended the session on training trials rather than assessment trials.</p><p>Further research is needed into the ideal protocols for ABM within body dissatisfaction. In particular, an examination is needed of multiple versus single sessions of ABM as well as consideration of the usefulness of directing attention towards or away from appearance-related informa-tion. Although attentional biases have been shown to be successfully modified within single-session protocols across ABM research (e.g. <xref rid="bibr18-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Kemps et al., 2014a</xref>), multiple training sessions are required for sustained changes in nonclinical samples that extend beyond the re-training protocol (<xref rid="bibr12-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Fadardi and Cox, 2009</xref>). This study&#x02019;s findings suggest that a single-session ABM treatment is insufficient to deliver therapeutic benefits for appearance-related concerns, but the question remains whether multiple-session ABM could be effective.</p><p>Other methodological considerations include identifying optimal ABM stimulus type (e.g. word or pictorial) and presentation times, and optimal training paradigms (e.g. eye-tracking). Finally, exploration is needed into task performance-based factors such as variations in verbal instructions, participant task compliance (e.g. fatigue), engagement with stimuli and increasing task awareness and attentional control (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Mogoa&#x0015f;e et al., 2014</xref>). Research targeting multiple cognitive processing biases such as interpretation and memory may also prove effective in exploring potential cognitive interventions for body image dysfunction. Modifying these biases simultaneously may produce an interactive or additive effect on symptom improvement (<xref rid="bibr16-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In terms of therapeutic implications, future work is needed into the potential applicability of ABM as an additional treatment method for reducing the role attentional mechanisms play in body image disorders. This may be particularly useful in adults with more persistent symptoms where conventional psychological therapies targeting &#x02018;top&#x02013;down&#x02019; cognitive processes have limited treatment success (<xref rid="bibr24-2055102915614310" ref-type="bibr">Renwick et al., 2013</xref>). This will first require larger-scale, randomised controlled trials in order to increase our knowledge of the ability to modify attentional mechanisms maintaining such appearance-based psychopathology.</p><p>In summary, we found no evidence for the potential therapeutic value of single-session ABM in reducing body dissatisfaction. Continued research is needed to improve our understanding of ABM&#x02019;s mechanism of change and determine the conditions under which ABM may serve as an effective treatment for reducing appearance-based attentional biases and pathological body image.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received funding from the Discipline of Psychology at USC to cover the publishing cost of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2055102915614310"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
