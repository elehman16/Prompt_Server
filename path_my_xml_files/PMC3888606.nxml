Recently, new classification criteria for axial SpA have been developed, which cover both subgroups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> There are currently only two treatments with proven efficacy available for these patients with axial SpA: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;&#x02013;targeted therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Until now, TNF antagonists have only been investigated and are only recommended for patients with axial SpA who fail previous NSAID therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Although data are limited, studies have demonstrated up to 50% remission rate with TNF-&#x003b1; antagonist therapy in NSAID-refractory patients with axial SpA who are treated in the first 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years of their disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7">5&#x02013;7</xref> This raises the question of whether even earlier treatment of axial SpA in patients who are not refractory to NSAID therapy would result in even higher response rates and potentially even in biologic drug-free remission, as has been recently investigated in great detail in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>The Infliximab (IFX) as First Line Therapy in Patients with Early Active Axial Spondyloarthritis Trial (INFAST) evaluated whether combination therapy with the TNF antagonist IFX and naproxen (NPX) was superior to treatment with NPX alone in patients who had active moderate-to-severe axial SpA and who were na&#x000ef;ve to NSAIDs or had only been treated with a submaximal dose of NSAIDs. All patients had to fulfil the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axial SpA, thus including patients both with AS and with nonradiographic axial SpA; had to have a disease duration &#x02264;3&#x02005;years; and had to have evidence of inflammatory SI lesions on MRI at baseline. Thus, this study is the first investigation of the potential benefits of early TNF-antagonist treatment in active axial SpA patients who are not yet refractory to NSAID therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and patients</title><p>INFAST was a Phase 3b, randomised, parallel-group, multisite, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled study of IFX in adults with moderate-to-severe, active axial SpA who were not refractory to NSAIDs (Protocol P05336, NCT00844805). Patients were recruited consecutively by rheumatologists in hospitals or private practice settings. Patients were enrolled in 47 centres in nine countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia, South Korea and Ukraine). The study protocol was reviewed by appropriate institutional review boards for each study site. All patients gave written informed consent to participate. Data were collected between 22 October 2009, and 20 September 2011.</p><p>Patients were 18&#x02013;48&#x02005;years of age with a diagnosis of active axial SpA according to the local investigator and disease duration of &#x02264;3&#x02005;years.

For inclusion into the study, the MRI scans were read locally. All patients had active disease at screening and baseline, defined as a total back pain evaluation of &#x02265;40&#x02005;mm (visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm) and a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of &#x02265;4&#x02005;cm (0&#x02013;10&#x02005;cm VAS).

Both groups also received oral NPX 1000&#x02005;mg daily. A computer-generated randomisation list was created by the sponsor and held by the central randomisation centre, which was contacted by the site to assign treatment to each patient as he or she enrolled.

Nearly two-thirds of patients who received IFX+NPX combination treatment achieved ASAS partial remission at week 28, compared with about one-third of the group who received NPX alone. This pattern of greater improvement in the IFX+NPX group was apparent as early as week 2; and continued, steady improvement occurred up to week 28.</p><p>The good results in the group receiving NSAIDs alone (35% partial remission) were rather surprising. NPX and other NSAIDs have been shown to be similarly effective in AS patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13 R14">11&#x02013;14</xref> and most of these NSAID trials used a flare design similar to the design used in INFAST (ie, patients using NSAIDs before inclusion must stop treatment and demonstrate worsening symptoms to be included in the study). However, none of these trials found ASAS partial remission rates greater than about 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13">11&#x02013;13</xref> Although the controlled phase of these studies was usually shorter (12&#x02005;weeks rather than 28&#x02005;weeks), response rates did not increase during trials with longer, open-label periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> One possible reason for the good response in the PBO+NPX group in the INFAST study may be the short symptom duration required for study entry (&#x02264;3&#x02005;years, with actual mean duration &#x0003c;2&#x02005;years) and, therefore, a mixture of patients with AS and patients with nonradiographic axial SpA; other studies have used populations with longstanding AS. In addition, all patients in INFAST had lesions seen on MRI at study entry, which was not a selection criterion for the NSAID studies. Although placebo response in the PBO+NPX group cannot be excluded, another study of patients with active axial SpA (refractory to previous NSAID therapy) with a symptom duration of &#x0003c;3&#x02005;years found a placebo response rate of only 12.5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Our data suggest that axial SpA patients respond better to a full NSAID dose if they are treated early.</p><p>Within the first 2&#x02005;weeks of NSAID therapy for patients in the PBO+NPX group, a strong improvement in disease activity was seen; mean BASDAI decreased from 6.3 to 4.4, with a continued, slower decrease up to week 28 (mean, 3.2). These data suggest that response to NSAIDs can be judged in the first 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;weeks of treatment, as noted in the ASAS treatment guidelines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and that further improvement may occur with continued treatment.

The superiority of treatment with IFX+NPX was most obvious in the binary outcome parameters, which measured low disease activity status or major response rates (eg, ASAS partial remission and ASDAS inactive disease rate, followed by ASAS-40 response). Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the treatment groups for minor response levels such as ASAS-20. For nearly all the continuous efficacy measures, approximately 75% reductions from baseline were seen in the IFX+NPX group, and approximately 50% reductions were seen in the NPX-alone group. Whether a combination of IFX+NSAID would be superior to IFX alone cannot be determined from the INFAST study because no IFX-alone group was included. However, information about a potentially additive effect of NSAIDs and TNF antagonists for improvement of signs and symptoms would be of interest, especially given the reported inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on radiographic progression in AS (eg, refs. 15, 16).</p><p>The response rates in the IFX+NPX group of INFAST are comparable to those from a smaller, placebo-controlled IFX trial in active axial SpA patients with symptom duration of &#x0003c;3&#x02005;years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>: ASAS partial remission rates were 61.9% vs 55.6%, and ASAS-40 response rates were 67.6% vs 61.1% in the two trials, respectively. No detailed information was given in the smaller trial on the status of NSAID treatment, but these patients are likely to have been NSAID failures. The comparable response rates in the two trials and the good response rate to NSAIDs in the INFAST study support an early step-up treatment approach, with early diagnosis and treatment with NSAIDs, escalating to combination treatment after an insufficient response,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> although such an approach was not specifically tested in our trial. Currently, these two IFX studies are the only ones that limited symptom duration of axial SpA to 3&#x02005;years and included a blinded control group. In a recent trial of etanercept in axial SpA, symptom duration at inclusion was limited to 5&#x02005;years, and the two treatment groups, etanercept versus sulfasalazine, were not blinded for the clinical outcome assessments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> At week 48, ASAS partial remission was reached in 50% of the etanercept group versus 19% of the sulfasalazine group. In two trials of adalimumab in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA with no limit on symptom duration, a better response rate was reported in a subgroup of patients who had shorter symptom duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>

The percentage of patients with radiographic sacroiliitis in INFAST (59%), based on the local reading of the x-rays, was relatively high compared to the other IFX trial described above that had a similar symptom duration (12%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), but the percentage was not so different from other analyses of patients with axial SpA in the first 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years of their disease (50%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Some of the variability across studies may be due to the challenge of reading x-rays of patients with early sacroiliitis; rather low sensitivity and specificity have been reported in some studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p><p>Overall, the current study results, combined with evidence from other studies in which patients were already optimised on NSAID treatment, suggest that response to anti-TNF therapy may be improved with selection of patients who are young, have short disease duration and have objective evidence of inflammation (as demonstrated by MRI and elevated CRP). Evaluation of the best strategy for maintenance and/or continued improvement in patients who had achieved partial remission after 28&#x02005;weeks of therapy with either IFX+NPX or NPX alone was the subject of a follow-up phase of the INFAST study that continued to week 52. Predictors of maintenance of remission were evaluated in that study, and the data will be reported in a separate manuscript.</p><p>The AE profiles for each treatment arm were as expected in patients receiving TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;targeted therapy and NSAID therapy. Both treatments appeared to be well tolerated, and no new safety signals were identified. Good tolerability appears to have been reflected in the drug adherence rates, which were close to 100% in both treatment groups. Safety and good drug tolerability are especially important in this young patient population in the early phase of their disease.</p><p>In conclusion, results of the INFAST study demonstrated better outcomes on a variety of efficacy measures in patients with early axial SpA who were treated with IFX+NPX than in those treated with NPX alone. Overall, available evidence supports early diagnosis and treatment of SpA with a full dose of NSAIDs first, escalating to combination NSAID+TNF antagonist treatment in patients who have insufficient response.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Ellen Stoltzfus, PhD, and Sarah Thornburg, MS, of JK Associates, Inc., Conshohocken, PA.
