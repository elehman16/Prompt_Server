Although by 8 weeks, walking speed improved by 0.24 ft/sec and 0.27 ft/sec in these two studies, respectively, the gain in speed gradually diminished, so by the end of the studies, the mean walking speed was similar to or slightly below the baseline level; however, in MS-F203EXT, more than 70% of the enrolled patients reached the 2-year period with a mean walking speed that remained above the baseline mean.</p><p>The pattern of walking speed changes observed among dalfampridine-ER non-responders was similar to that of the responders, although the percent improvement in walking speed was substantially lower than for responders. The 6&#x02013;8% improvement in walking speed seen at the end of the double-blind phase was lost after treatment discontinuation, but returned upon re-initiation of open-label dalfampridine-ER. Although patient retention in the LTEs was generally greater among the dalfampridine-ER responders of the parent studies, relative to non-responders, the retention rates were high even among the non-responders: 62.0% and 53.9% in MS-F203EXT, and 73.5% and 68.3% in MS-F204EXT for responders and non-responders, respectively. For the placebo-treated patients in the parent studies, the LTE retention rates were 58.8% and 65.7% in MS-F203EXT and MS-F204EXT, respectively.</p><p>When patients from the placebo group in the double-blind phase were initiated on dalfampridine-ER in the LTE, the average percent change in walking speed at the 2-week assessment was 14.7% in MS-F203EXT and 21.7% in MS-F204EXT. This change was substantially higher than during the double-blind period, which had been 5.2% and 9.7% in each parent study, respectively. The magnitude of these observed improvements was between that of the responders (21.2% in MS-F203EXT and 28.0% in MS-F204EXT) and non-responders (6.9% and 9.5% in MS-F203EXT and MS-F204EXT, respectively). Relative to the dalfampridine-ER non-responders during the double-blind phase, improvements in walking speed over the duration of the LTEs were generally sustained among dalfampridine-ER responders, as well as the patients treated with placebo in the parent trials.</p><p>Changes over time in group mean data could be significantly influenced by missing data from patients whom discontinued the study. Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458514563591">Figure 3</xref> presents walking speed data only for those patients with continuous participation, i.e. whom had a walking speed assessment at approximately 2 years after initiation of the parent study.

The placebo group in the double-blind studies, consisting of both responders and non-responders, showed mean improvements in walking speed during the LTE that consistently remained greater than those in the non-responders whom were in the dalfampridine-ER group in the parent studies.</p><fig id="fig3-1352458514563591" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Percent change from baseline in walking speed at each scheduled visit, among patients with continuous participation at approximately 2 years, by treatment allocation and dalfampridine-ER responder status in the parent study.

Although seizures were observed in four patients, one of whom was not on treatment at the time, the 0.8% seizure rate for the combined LTEs was similar to what was seen in the actively-treated and placebo groups in the parent trials; and so it was within the range expected from the epidemiology of seizures in the MS population.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1352458514563591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1352458514563591" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Dalfampridine-ER efficacy results were consistent with the parent studies in that walking speed improvements among the timed walk responders returned upon re-initiation of treatment; and remained greater among those individuals whom were previously double-blind responders, relative to those whom were non-responders. The return of improvement as early as 2 weeks after re-initiation of treatment in the LTEs suggested that these effects have a relatively rapid onset after treatment initiation.</p><p>Of note, placebo-treated patients in the parent study would be expected to represent a mixture of responders and non-responders, when treated with dalfampridine-ER in the LTE studies. These patients showed changes from baseline in walking speed with initial treatment in the LTE studies that were intermediate between the changes seen in the parent study dalfampridine-ER timed walk responder and non-responder groups. Mean changes from baseline became more similar between the original placebo patients and timed walk responders, over the course of 2 years of treatment; and the difference from the original non-responder group, while still present, was somewhat less. This pattern may indicate that responder status may change in either direction over longer periods of time. This possibility could only be investigated effectively with a long-term placebo-controlled study.</p><p>The overall decline in walking speed that was observed over the course of the LTEs is consistent with the natural history of MS: These studies showed a rate of decline similar to that previously observed over 2 years, in a longitudinal study of disease progression.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1352458514563591" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Since the pattern of decline was similar in the dalfampridine-ER responders and non-responders, it is unlikely that this reflects a decline in the response to the medication.</p><p>Although the group who were dalfampridine-ER responders in the double-blind trials had a higher rate of retention in the extension phase, patient retention in both LTE studies was higher than expected, based on the proportion of patients whom were dalfampridine-ER responders in the parent trials. While the reasons for patients who were not responsive on walking measures to remain in the trial are not known, we suggest that other factors not readily captured by objective assessment may have also contributed to retention. Such factors may include: Patients&#x02019; perceptions of improvement, improvements in domains not measured in the trials, or variables generic to participation in clinical trials and not associated with any specific drug effect. Of note, the demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between those whom completed the studies and those whom discontinued, except for a significantly higher proportion of female subjects whom completed MS-F204 EXT, which is not likely to be clinically relevant.</p><p>These results should be interpreted within the context of the studies&#x02019; limitations, which are those generally associated with open-label LTEs: Lack of a placebo group, enrollment of patients from clinical trials that have specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the fact that patients completing the study generally represent a self-selected population of those whom tolerate the drug and may be more likely to have perceived a benefit. On the other hand, patients may stay in a long-term study of this kind for reasons unrelated to specific treatment, including altruism and interest in supporting the efforts of their medical practitioners; thus, the results of these LTEs may not be generalizable to the treatment response nor treatment adherence in a real-world setting.</p><p>In summary, long-term safety and tolerability of dalfampridine-ER for up to 5 years in open-label extensions of two Phase 3 clinical trials were consistent with observations in the parent trials: No new safety signals were detected. Efficacy with regard to improvement in walking speed was maintained in the subset of patients whom were dalfampridine-ER responders in the parent studies, relative to the dalfampridine-ER non-responders. An overall decline in walking speed was observed over the duration of the open-label extension studies, but this decrease likely represented natural MS disease progression.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1352458514563591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank EJ Bienen of The Curry Rockefeller Group in Tarrytown, NY, for editorial assistance.
