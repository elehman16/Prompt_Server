There is strong evidence that stopping smoking is associated with improved mental health, and this improvement may result from breaking the tobacco withdrawal cycle.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, it is not clear whether reducing daily cigarette consumption is associated with change in mental health. Two previous studies have reported no significant association between smoking reduction and mental health; although, both were small and therefore may have been insufficiently powered to detect associations, and only one used a standardised measure of mental health.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>No previous literature has discussed the possible impact of smoking reduction on mental health and how this may differ from abrupt cessation; however, based on what is currently known about tobacco and mental health, there are three possibilities. As the chemical components in tobacco have a short half-life, psychological withdrawal symptoms occur shortly after smoking a cigarette, and these symptoms become more severe with longer periods of abstinence.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Thus, the first possibility is that by reducing cigarette consumption and, in turn, increasing the duration between cigarettes, the smoker may experience longer periods of and more intense withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, depressed mood and anxiety, thus leading to worsened mental health. Mental health may also worsen for some smokers on reduction if they derive a mental health benefit from smoking, according to the self-medication hypothesis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Second, there is evidence that higher levels of tobacco consumption are associated with poorer mental health,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and that stopping smoking is associated with improved mental health.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, it follows that if there is a dose&#x02013;response association between tobacco consumption and mental health, reducing tobacco consumption may be associated with improvements in mental health. The third hypothesis is that mental health could remain unchanged. After maintaining reduced cigarette consumption, the smoker may adapt to their new tobacco consumption level and their mental health will remain the same. Another reason it may not change is that the association between poor mental health and smoking could be caused by a common factor<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which would not be expected to change on smoking reduction.</p><p>If smoking reduction worsens mental health, this may not be the most appropriate route to quit for those with mental health disorders or who are experiencing stress. However, if smoking reduction improves mental health or leads to no change, smokers and clinicians can be reassured that the intervention is unlikely to cause psychological distress. No previous study has adequately assessed the association, therefore in this study, we aimed to do so. A randomised study to assess this hypothesis would be ideal, however, it would not be practical. Observational methods are useful in this situation and different statistical approaches offer different benefits and drawbacks, therefore, we aimed to compare two common methods to assess the association in question. We conducted a secondary analysis of individual level patient data of five randomised trials of treatment for smoking reduction. We aimed first to estimate the association using traditional regression modelling with adjustment for covariates, and second, to compare the results derived from the regression model with those derived from propensity score matching (PSM). Effect estimates from PSM provide evidence that an association is not due to membership bias or observed confounding, and therefore offer stronger evidence of a causal association.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

Change scores were not compared between groups because of regression to the mean when using within-person repeated measures data. Using change scores can overestimate the effect, therefore, it is recommended to use outcome scores with adjustment for baseline values.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We then repeated the model adjusting for FTND score and treatment allocation (active/placebo), age, sex and trial. We also tested for an interaction between treatment allocation and reduction status, to account for the possible effect of active NRT on psychological withdrawal symptoms in reducers.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p><italic>Propensity score matching</italic>&#x02014;This involved three steps. First, a logistic regression model was developed using covariates which predicted whether or not smokers reduced smoking. Nicotine dependence (FTND) and treatment allocation<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> were forced into the model, and a forward stepwise procedure was used to add baseline mental health, intention to reduce (eg, make a serious attempt to reduce smoking in 1 month), intention to quit, sex, age, smoking history, CPD, single item questions from the self-rated &#x02018;Relief from smoking questionnaire&#x02019; (eg, report of calming effects from smoking), all at the p&#x0003c;0.10 level.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Second, this model was combined using the PSMATCH2 command in Stata V.13 to calculate each participant's propensity score. Reducers were matched to the continuing smoker in the same trial with the closest propensity score on a ratio of 1:1 using a nearest neighbour greedy algorithm with no replacements, and matching was restricted to the common support region. Third, we conducted a series of model adequacy checks (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007812/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>). Finally, to determine the association between smoking reduction and mental health we repeated the linear regression model discussed above using the matched sample.</p><p>We developed three sensitivity analyses using different PSM models. Our adjusted regression model was rerun for each PSM sensitivity analysis, and we compared the regression coefficients between the sensitivity models. The trials measured key baseline variables consistently; each trial also measured some variables differently to others. Therefore, we (1) matched participants within trials using all relevant variables, (2) matched participants across trials including variables measured consistently and (3) repeated models with and without common support restrictions (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007812/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics of participants in whole sample</title><p>Trial non-completers (n=1342) did not differ greatly from those who were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015007812TB1">table 1</xref>).

This study lost one point for high attrition, scoring 4/5 which indicates a low risk of bias (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007812/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Comparison of regression and PSM approaches indicated there was no statistical evidence of an association between smoking reduction maintained over 12&#x02005;weeks and change in mental health. The point estimates derived using regression and PSM were close to the null, and the CIs were reasonably precise, albeit just encompassing a clinically important difference in the direction of either an improvement or worsening in mental health.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>There were some important strengths to this study. Data were collected following a strict protocol, with biological validation of smoking reduction status. Mental health was assessed using a psychometrically sound tool designed to measure change in general mental health, rather than the presence or absence of mental health disorder. Moreover, participants and raters in the trials were not aware of the study hypothesis, so there were no demand characteristics which may have biased the results. PSM methodology matched participants on factors previously found to predict ability to reduce daily tobacco consumption, and after PSM, a good balance of covariates was achieved and extensive sensitivity analysis showed no evidence that the results were sensitive to the methodological decisions we made. The Newcastle-Ottawa score suggests that the results were also unlikely to result from multiple sources of bias. A weakness of this study was loss to follow-up, although this rate was similar to other studies of NRT.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It is possible that this introduced bias,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> however we suggest this is unlikely. To have biased the study, participants who were lost in the reducer group would have had to have shown the opposite change in mental health to participants who were lost from the continuing smokers group, which seems improbable.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Results from previous studies have similarly reported a null association;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> however, these studies were imprecise because they used a small sample or a non-validated outcome measure which could also have underestimated the strength of association. This study overcame these issues by use of a larger sample and a validated measure of mental health. As with many observational analyses, our initial approach using regression was at risk of bias through confounding and group membership. The propensity score approach can overcome bias through group membership and offers more control for confounding,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> but gave a similar result to the regression modelling in this case. However, the estimates from PSM were a little more imprecise by reducing the effective sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications</title><p>Many smokers and clinicians are reluctant to address patients&#x02019; smoking behaviour for fear that they may cause harm to mental health.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This study adds to the evidence from previous studies that reducing daily cigarette consumption was not associated with change in mental health.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Therefore, on average, clinicians can be confident that smoking reduction is unlikely to negatively influence patients&#x02019; mental health.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>If smoking reduction was found to be associated with worsened mental health, this could be due to increasing the duration of withdrawal symptoms,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;45</xref> thus supporting the hypothesis that repeated exposure to tobacco can worsen mental health through the withdrawal cycle.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;45</xref> Equally, this could indicate that by reducing the frequency of any psychological benefit of tobacco the smoker experiences worse mental health.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, based on these data analysed in two ways, the evidence here was consistent with previous studies and show no association between smoking reduction and change in mental health, thus suggesting that on average smoking reduction is not any better or worse for mental health than continuing to smoke. Clinicians offering smoking reduction as a route to quit can be confident that on average smoking reduction is not associated with negative change in mental health.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Gemma Taylor at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/GemmaMJTaylor">@GemmaMJTaylor</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> GT contributed towards the study design, analysis and writing the manuscript.
