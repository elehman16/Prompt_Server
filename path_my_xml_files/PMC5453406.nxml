Because this was a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), we were able to provide results of EMST in comparison to sham treatment. First, we found that the capacity to generate MEP improved significantly both for the EMST and sham groups. Notably, in effect, the sham group practiced simple expiratory breathing with the spring removed and negligible pressure of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O. This result suggests that simple expiratory breathing practice alone can improve the MEP in those with MS. Second, the EMST intervention holds promise for reducing abnormal airway penetration during swallow. Third, according to within-group analyses, the EMST intervention produced significantly improved total SWAL-QOL score and sub-domains of pharyngeal function and saliva symptom status (SSS), whereas the sham group showed no change in these measures.</p><sec id="sec22-2055217317710829"><title>MEP</title><p>EMST has been shown to increase MEP-generating capacity (or MEP) in other populations<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> such as in Parkinson disease, the sedentary elderly, and young healthy adults. Several RCT studies reported approximately 20%&#x02013;30% increases in MEP after six to 12 weeks of EMST training in individuals with MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> We found a greater than 20% increase in MEP in our MS patients after five weeks of training, which is consistent with the published data.</p><p>The observation of the significantly but similarly improved MEP both in EMST and sham groups in the current study is new and somewhat surprising. Commonalities in study procedures across the two groups offer a potential explanation. First, both groups participated in the MEP testing for seven consecutive weeks (week 1: baseline testing; weeks 2&#x02013;6, during the five weeks of home training; week 7, post-treatment testing). The MEP test is a maximum effort task, which was repeated multiple times at any given single test session until the threshold 5% variability was obtained in three trials. Typically, this required no more than three to five repetitions but in isolated cases, more repetitions were necessary. In every case the participant was offered ample recovery time between repetitions, as it is a maximum effort task. This same procedure was used at baseline and post-treatment data acquisition for the MEP outcome measure, resulting in a total of seven MEP test sessions (five for treatment decision making and two for MEP outcome measurement). Since muscle weakness is common in MS, it is possible that a strength-training effect could have manifested as a result of the weekly MEP testing, which required repetition and likely strengthening of the respiratory muscles. Second, the sham group was assigned the same frequency and duration of home exercise program as was the EMST group albeit in the absence of a positive pressure load. This underscores the commonality that both groups consequently practiced expiratory breathing for the same duration and frequency, further engaging muscle activations. Two other studies support this reasoning. First, Westerdahl et&#x000a0;al. used a moderate positive pressure threshold (10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O), intermediate between the current study groups (2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O, control group; minimum of 36&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O EMST group). They reported improved lung function with respect to vital and forced vital capacities in patients with mild to moderate MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Second, recent work by Ishida et&#x000a0;al. (2017) revealed significantly improved inspiratory and expiratory pressures in a cohort of elderly participants trained <italic>without a pressure threshold</italic> to complete &#x0201c;fast expiratory&#x0201d; exercises into a peak flow meter, suggesting that maximum effort tasks alone may be sufficient to achieve respiratory strengthening.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> A third commonality is that motor imagery could have played a similar role in both groups.

Consistent with our findings, other groups have demonstrated improved swallow physiology (i.e. reduced PAS scores) following EMST.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>There is strong clinical relevance of improved PAS score because it indicates a safer swallow in that oral contents are more effectively diverted away from the airway, which is desirable, and as occurs during a normally coordinated swallow. The EMST protocol could potentially have provided two aspects of training: (1) improving hyolaryngeal elevation during swallowing, thereby lessening the risk of aspiration; and (2) improving cough strength to assist airway clearance should aspiration occur. It is likely that the training did produce the effect of improved PAS scores, since swallowing is an automatically controlled precision movement and therefore the PAS measure is not subject to the factors of &#x0201c;greater effort&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;test-retest&#x0201d; aspects of other types of measures that can be biased through effortful learning. The clinical significance in improved PAS and swallow function is that it lessens the probability of pneumonia and costly hospitalizations, in addition to supporting better quality of life for the clients for whom we care. These are strong justifications for billing and insurance payment of this simple clinical treatment, which could be accomplished for the most part in the home. Additionally, given the relatively simple treatment protocol, many different professionals could administer and supervise the treatment in other care scenarios both during inpatient and out-patient visits. This could include professionals in fields such as physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and nursing.</p><p>Activity-based brain plasticity for motor coordination change requires daily and weekly practice sessions of breathing with certain intensity and high repetitions.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Although our findings are preliminary, it is reasonable to consider that five weeks of breathing practice with the positive pressure threshold set at 75% of the maximal MEP helps improve or preserve swallow coordination and maintenance of a clear airway.</p></sec><sec id="sec24-2055217317710829"><title>SWAL-QOL</title><p>In within-group, pre-/post-treatment comparisons, for the overall SWAL-QOL measure, there was a significant improvement of the total quality (score) for the EMST group, but not for the sham group. The results from exploratory analyses of the separate SWAL-QOL domains may provide explanatory information underlying these results. Many MS disease-related issues such as fatigue and motor dysfunction could potentially have a general effect on certain SWAL-QOL domains. Our data showed no training effect for either group in the following: Eating Desire, Eating Duration, Oral Symptom Status (moving food inside the mouth), Communication, Social Functioning, Fatigue Level, Food Selection, and Sleep.</p><p>In contrast, the Burden domain did exhibit a training effect for both groups. The Fear domain also displayed a significant improvement for EMST and showed a similar trend for sham (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.056). These results altogether indicate a reduction of emotional distress over swallowing. This is reasonable for both groups, considering that they had the opportunity to rehearse expiratory muscle function for the same frequency and duration and improved MEP similarly. Consistent with a reduction of fear, the Mental Health domain was improved for both groups as well. It is likely that the improved MEP scores reflected improved strength, which would presumably promote coordination needed to improve the PAS swallow score. With improvement in these two impairment measures, we could expect a more safe swallow with concomitant reduction of fear of swallowing (improved swallow function) and mitigation of the depression, discouragement and frustration (Mental Health domain) that would accompany a more impaired swallow.</p><p>The Burden and Mental Health domains of the SWAL-QOL measure feelings of anxiety, frustration, fear of dysphasia and pneumonia, and depression; the SWAL-QOL social domains assess the ability to engage in social activities. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with swallowing impairment showed increased fear, burden, mental stress and social withdrawal and isolation.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> With oculopharyngeal-muscular-dystrophy (OPMD), SWAL-QOL score for burden, eating duration, and fatigue were decreased.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Participants with MS in our study had abnormally low scores on the SWAL-QOL. These results are consistent with those reported for ALS and OPMD. Further, when both groups in our study performed breathing exercises, Burden and Mental Health scores improved. The clinical implication is that even simple breathing exercises may help promote positive feelings and reduce burden in patients with MS.</p><p>The two SWAL-QOL domains most specific to pharyngeal function are PSS and SSS. Both significantly improved in response to EMST, but not sham. These findings are reasonable given that EMST directly provided two types of exercise. The EMST resistance breathing provided strengthening exercise. Practice and repetition of complex movements (coordination) is known to improve coordination. These two types of exercises could have improved function of the pharyngeal muscles that control swallow and saliva management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec25-2055217317710829"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This was an initial study of the effects of EMST for those with MS, with any interested individuals with MS enrolled if they were participating in an MS support group. A limitation of the study is that there was no information acquired regarding the following: history of depression, disease modification treatment, or MS duration or type. A future study would be valuable in which these variables are included.</p><p>The current study had begun prior to the publication of the psychometrics study of the modified barium swallowing tool (MBSImp) measure.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2055217317710829" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In future work, it would be advisable to consider using the MBSImp, given its fine-grained approach to identifying any impairment in the separate oral and pharyngeal movements that are precisely coordinated during swallows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec26-2055217317710829"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The MEP improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment both for the EMST and sham participants, suggesting that strengthening of the expiratory muscles can occur with repetition of focused breathing practice in the absence of high resistance. On the other hand, results from the PAS and from the SWAL-QOL domains suggest that the high resistance of the EMST was required in order to improve the functional safety (reduced penetration/aspiration according to PAS), as well as coordination of the complex function of coordinated swallowing, specifically pharyngeal function and saliva management (according to SWAL-QOL subscales).</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec27-2055217317710829"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="sec28-2055217317710829"><title>Funding</title><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is funded by a Veterans Affairs Administration Medical Research Merit Review Award (no.
