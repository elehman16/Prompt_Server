We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b&#x02013;T3aN0M0). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7&#x000b7;4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3&#x000b7;8 weeks) all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques. Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3&#x02013;6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression. Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1&#x000b7;208. Analysis was by intention to treat. Long-term follow-up continues. The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients). Median follow-up was 62&#x000b7;4 months (IQR 53&#x000b7;9&#x02013;77&#x000b7;0). The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88&#x000b7;3% (95% CI 86&#x000b7;0&#x02013;90&#x000b7;2) in the 74 Gy group, 90&#x000b7;6% (88&#x000b7;5&#x02013;92&#x000b7;3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85&#x000b7;9% (83&#x000b7;4&#x02013;88&#x000b7;0) in the 57 Gy group. 60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0&#x000b7;84 [90% CI 0&#x000b7;68&#x02013;1&#x000b7;03], p<sub>NI</sub>=0&#x000b7;0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1&#x000b7;20 [0&#x000b7;99&#x02013;1&#x000b7;46], p<sub>NI</sub>=0&#x000b7;48). Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group. There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures. The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13&#x000b7;7% (111 events) and 9&#x000b7;1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11&#x000b7;9% (105 events) and 11&#x000b7;7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11&#x000b7;3% (95 events) and 6&#x000b7;6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.

Management options include external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, active surveillance (for men with low-risk disease), and watchful waiting (for those unsuitable for radical curative treatment), with management choices often affected by potential treatment-related toxic effects. Prostate cancer and its treatment are the leading cause of cancer years lived with disability.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Oct 18, 2002, before trial commencement using the terms &#x0201c;radiotherapy AND prostate cancer AND (hypofractionation OR alpha/beta ratio)&#x0201d; and then updated results to Sept 8, 2015. Before the CHHiP trial began, reports based on retrospective series of patients suggested that the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio for prostate cancer might be low, but only two small randomised trials had tested hypofractionation compared with conventional fractionation, both using relatively low doses of radiotherapy, and neither trial was large enough to confirm or refute a benefit. Since CHHiP started, more recent results from a meta-analysis of five small trials testing hypofractionation and retrospective reviews of large patient databases have been done, suggesting that the best estimates for the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio are between 1&#x000b7;4 Gy and 1&#x000b7;9 Gy, although estimates up to 8&#x000b7;3 Gy have been calculated. However, these retrospective analyses and reviews have not changed clinical practice; hence the need for a large randomised controlled trial. Meta-analyses of studies of dose-escalated radiotherapy and neoadjuvant androgen deprivation show improved disease control compared with standard radiotherapy doses, but dose escalation increases bowel side-effects. However, conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy improves dose distributions of radiotherapy and conformal radiotherapy reduces side-effects.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>The CHHiP trial is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised treatment study undertaken in localised prostate cancer. We tested two experimental hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules using 3 Gy per fraction to total doses of 60 Gy and 57 Gy compared with standard fractionation using 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 74 Gy. We have shown that the hypofractionated schedule of 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to a standard schedule of 74 Gy in 37 fractions for the endpoint of biochemical and clinical disease control. Overall treatment time was reduced from 7&#x000b7;4 weeks to 4 weeks. 57 Gy in 19 fractions could not be claimed to be non-inferior to the control 74 Gy group. The results give an estimate of 1&#x000b7;8 Gy for the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio for prostate cancer. Quality controlled IMRT techniques were used and the side-effect profiles were favourable and low in all three randomised groups.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>The findings from this pre-planned analysis of the CHHiP trial show that the hypofractionated IMRT schedule giving 60 Gy in 3 Gy fractions in 4 weeks is both effective and safe and can be recommended as a new standard of care for patients with localised prostate cancer using the high-quality radiotherapy techniques described. The results are most robust for patients with intermediate-risk disease who received short-course androgen deprivation therapy.</p></boxed-text></p><p>External-beam radiotherapy is most appropriate for men with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and is associated with long-term disease control in most patients.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> About 15&#x02008;800 men receive radical prostate radiotherapy in the UK every year (Ball C, National Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team, The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, personal communication).

The &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio for most cancers and acute normal tissue reactions is believed to be high and about 10 Gy. However, for prostate cancer, a value as low as 1&#x000b7;5 Gy has been suggested, which is lower than the 3 Gy reported for the late reactions of most normal tissues (including rectum).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> These findings have potentially important therapeutic implications.

On Aug 1, 2006, after 454 patients had been recruited, these criteria were revised to reflect the developing consensus on use of long-term androgen deprivation in locally advanced disease.

The trial was sponsored by the Institute of Cancer Research and was done in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice. All patients provided written informed consent. The Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU; London, UK) coordinated the study and carried out central statistical data monitoring and all analyses. The trial management group was overseen by an independent trial steering committee.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Men were registered into the trial before or after commencement of androgen deprivation therapy. Following registration, and within 4&#x02013;6 weeks before radiotherapy, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive conventional fractionation (control) or one of two hypofractionated schedules. Randomisation was via telephone to the ICR-CTSU. Computer-generated random permuted blocks of sizes six and nine were used, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk-classification (low <italic>vs</italic> intermediate <italic>vs</italic> high)<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and radiotherapy treatment centre.

Injections of a luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue every month, combined with initial anti-androgen to reduce testosterone flare, or an anti-androgen alone, were allowed. Individuals assigned to the 74 Gy in 37 fractions control group received 2 Gy daily fractions (Monday to Friday treatment) for 7&#x000b7;4 weeks. Individuals in the experimental groups received hypofractionated treatment with 3 Gy daily fractions to a total dose of either 60 Gy in 20 fractions in 4&#x000b7;0 weeks (&#x02265;28 days) or 57 Gy in 19 fractions in 3&#x000b7;8 weeks (&#x02265;27 days). Biological doses in the hypofractionated schedules were calculated to be equivalent to those in the conventional schedule assuming &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratios of 2&#x000b7;4 Gy for the 60 Gy group and 1&#x000b7;4 Gy for the 57 Gy group. All treatment groups received intensity-modulated radiation techniques (IMRT). Treatment delays for toxic effects, and for technical reasons of up to 5 days, were permitted.</p><p>Planning of radiotherapy treatment for all three groups was done with forward or inverse three-dimensional methods about 12 weeks after the start of hormonal treatment. The complex forward-planned multisegment technique using an integrated simultaneous boost has been previously described<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> using three treatment fields with a total of eight segments. Pelvic lymph nodes were not included in the target volumes. Mandatory dose constraints were defined for target coverage and avoidance of normal tissues including rectum, bowel, bladder, and femoral heads. Treatment plans were reviewed and dose reductions permitted to meet dose constraints. Treatment was delivered with 6&#x02013;15 MV photons with multileaf collimators to shape beams. Portal imaging was used to verify treatment accuracy, which was to be within 3 mm and was taken at least three times during week 1 and at least weekly intervals thereafter. Use of image-guided techniques (IGRT) was permitted but not required. Details of target volumes, dose parameters, and constraints are given in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 2, 3, 15)</xref>. The integral quality-assurance programme has previously been described.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Staging investigations included PSA measurement, standard haematology and biochemistry, lymph node assessment by pelvic MRI or CT, and bone scans for patients at intermediate or high risk. Histology was locally assessed with diagnostic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (or specimens from transurethral resection of the prostate) and reported with the Gleason system. PSA concentrations were recorded before commencement of androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy and subsequently at weeks 10, 18, and 26 after radiotherapy and then at 6-month intervals for 5 years and subsequently annually.</p><p>Baseline, pre-radiotherapy treatment, acute, and late toxicity data were collected using physician-completed and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Instruments chosen reflected practice at the time of trial commencement, the desirability of assessing symptoms before radiotherapy to allow consideration of emergent events, and to facilitate comparison with other studies. Baseline bowel, bladder, and sexual function assessments were made before androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy and were graded using the Late Effects on Normal Tissues: Subjective/Objective/Management (LENT/SOM)<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH)<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> scoring systems and patient-reported outcome questionnaires.

When the sample size was increased (see Statistical analysis) it was felt that sufficient data had been collected on acute toxicity to allow robust conclusions to be drawn about comparisons between the three randomised groups. Reactions were graded every week during radiotherapy and at weeks 10, 12, and 18 from radiotherapy start date using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system for acute toxicity.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Late side-effects were then assessed beginning 26 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly to 5 years, as previously described,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> using the RTOG grades for late side-effects,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> RMH, and LENT/SOM scoring systems.

The initial definition of biochemical failure (PSA &#x0003e;2 ng/mL 6 months or more after the commencement of radiotherapy and a PSA rising by 50% or more from the nadir) was updated in 2007, and applied retrospectively, to reflect the Phoenix consensus guidelines as a PSA concentration greater than nadir plus 2 ng/mL.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The nadir PSA was the lowest concentration recorded at any time after commencement of androgen deprivation therapy or radiotherapy. A consecutive confirmatory PSA concentration was required. Biochemical failure events were determined centrally from PSA concentrations and confirmed by the local investigator. Prostate cancer recurrence events were as reported by the investigator and included recommencement of androgen deprivation therapy, local recurrence, lymph node or pelvic recurrence, and distant metastases.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcome measures were disease-free survival (time from randomisation to any prostate cancer-related event or death from any cause); overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause); development of metastases; and recommencement of hormonal treatment for disease recurrence. Cause of death was centrally reviewed by a panel of three trial investigators (DD, JG, IS), masked to treatment allocation.</p><p>Additional secondary endpoints were acute and late side-effects. Acute toxicity outcomes were summarised by reporting the peak and week 18 bowel and bladder side-effects. Clinician-reported late toxicity outcomes were the proportion of patients with a grade 2 or worse toxic effect at 2 and 5 years, and time to development of grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 toxicity (assessed using each scoring method). Patient-reported outcomes included overall bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction bother reported as single items on the UCLA-PCI and EPIC-50 instruments.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial was powered to assess non-inferiority in biochemical or clinical failure-free rate between the hypofractionated and conventional radiotherapy schedules. A three-arm design allowed estimation of isoeffective doses for both efficacy and complications. We assumed a 70% failure-free rate at 5 years in the control group and, with 2163 patients, initially wished to exclude a decrease of 6% in a hypofractionated group. Due to accrual exceeding expectations, a protocol amendment on Nov 23, 2009, increased the sample size to allow a smaller non-inferiority margin of 5%, corresponding to a critical hazard ratio (HR) of 1&#x000b7;208, to be used. This critical HR was used for all non-inferiority analyses. To conclude non-inferiority with 80% power (one-sided &#x003b1;=0&#x000b7;05), 3163 men (1054 per treatment group) were required. This analysis would require 349 events in the control group but, as agreed with the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, data could also be considered sufficiently mature for analysis after a median follow-up of 5 years. A small allowance (1&#x000b7;5%) for dropout or loss to follow-up was incorporated.</p><p>Analyses for all time-to-event endpoints were on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was also analysed in the per-protocol population, including all patients receiving at least one fraction of their allocated radiotherapy schedule. For time to biochemical or clinical failure, patients event free at the time of analysis were censored at their last known PSA assessment. For disease-free and overall survival, patients were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. For development of metastases and recommencement of hormonal treatment patients were censored at the date they were last seen or date of death.</p><p>Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate event rates. Estimates of treatment effect were made using unadjusted and also adjusted Cox regression models, with an HR less than 1 indicating a decreased risk of the event in the hypofractionated treatment group compared with control. Covariates included in adjusted Cox regression models were age (&#x02264;69 years <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;69 years), NCCN risk group (low <italic>vs</italic> intermediate <italic>vs</italic> high), Gleason score (&#x02264;6 <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;6), clinical stage, and pre-androgen deprivation therapy PSA (&#x0003c;10 ng/mL <italic>vs</italic> 10&#x02013;20 ng/mL <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;20 ng/mL). Although the trial was not designed to directly compare the hypofractionated schedules, hypothesis generating comparisons have been made, with an HR less than 1 indicating a decreased risk of the event in the 60 Gy group compared with the 57 Gy group. For time to biochemical or clinical failure, HRs are provided with two-sided 90% CIs (equivalent to one-sided 95% CIs) in accordance with the one-sided non-inferiority design. p values to reject the null hypothesis of HR of 1&#x000b7;208 or greater (p<sub>NI</sub>) are reported. In all other instances, 95% CIs are reported. Comparisons were made between the control group and each hypofractionated group using the log-rank test, with a p value less than 0&#x000b7;05 indicating statistical significance.</p><p>Absolute treatment differences (&#x003b4;) in time to biochemical or clinical failure have been calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the failure-free rate in the control group and the HR. A competing risks analysis was done using the methods of Fine and Gray for the primary outcome measure, with death due to any cause as the competing event with consistent results (data not shown). Pre-planned subgroup analyses of the primary outcome by NCCN risk group were done in addition to multivariable analyses adjusting for risk group and prespecified clinically prognostic factors. Heterogeneity of the treatment effect was tested using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for interaction. The &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio for prostate cancer was estimated<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> assuming a linear fit for data from the hypofractionated groups.</p><p>Acute toxicity analyses were done in the safety population, including all patients who received at least one fraction of radiotherapy. All available data were used irrespective of timing of assessment, with the exception of comparisons at 18 weeks, where a 2 week window either side of the expected date was used. Pairwise comparisons of the distribution of acute toxicity scores were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. For each late toxicity scale, the proportion of late grade 2 or worse toxicity at 2 years and 5 years is reported with exact binomial 95% CIs. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare each hypofractionated group with control. Time to first late adverse event was compared with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients not experiencing an event were censored at last known toxicity assessment. The proportion of small or worse patient-reported bother and time to first very small, small, moderate, or worse late bother score were analysed as for late toxicity endpoints. To make some allowance for multiple testing of toxicity and patient-reported endpoints, a p value of less than 0&#x000b7;01 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>For all time-to-event analyses the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and found to hold (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 25&#x02013;26</xref>).</p><p>Analyses were based on a database snapshot taken on Sept 8, 2015, and were done using Stata version 13.

Demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>). 3213 (97%) patients received concurrent androgen deprivation therapy, with 2700 (84%) patients receiving LHRH analogues and short-term anti-androgens. Most patients who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy had low-risk disease (73 [78%] of 93 patients). For patients who received androgen deprivation treatment, the median duration before commencement of radiotherapy was 16 weeks (IQR 15&#x02013;20). Overall, 3152 (98%) patients received radiotherapy, and 3117 (97%) received the allocated dose and fractionation schedule (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Treatment delays of 1 week or more occurred in only 23 (1%) patients. At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 62&#x000b7;6 months (54&#x000b7;1&#x02013;77&#x000b7;2) in the 74 Gy group, 62&#x000b7;2 months (53&#x000b7;9&#x02013;77&#x000b7;2) in the 60 Gy group, and 62&#x000b7;4 months (53&#x000b7;7&#x02013;76&#x000b7;6) in the 57 Gy group.</p><p>By 5 years, the number of patients with biochemical or clinical events were 111 of 1065 in the 74 Gy group, 88 of 1074 in the 60 Gy group, and 132 of 1077 in the 57 Gy group, respectively. 5-year biochemical or clinical failure-free rates were 88&#x000b7;3% (95% CI 86&#x000b7;0&#x02013;90&#x000b7;2) in the 74 Gy group, 90&#x000b7;6% (88&#x000b7;5&#x02013;92&#x000b7;3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85&#x000b7;9% (83&#x000b7;4&#x02013;88&#x000b7;0) in the 57 Gy group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). With reference to the critical HR for non-inferiority, 60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy with HR 0&#x000b7;84 (90% CI 0&#x000b7;68&#x02013;1&#x000b7;03), p<sub>NI</sub>=0&#x000b7;0018. Since the upper limit of the 90% CI for the HR comparing 57 Gy with 74 Gy (HR 1&#x000b7;20 [0&#x000b7;99&#x02013;1&#x000b7;46]) exceeds 1&#x000b7;208 (p<sub>NI</sub>=0&#x000b7;48), non-inferiority of the 57 Gy schedule relative to 74 Gy cannot be claimed. To facilitate comparison with other studies, 95% CIs were estimated as 0&#x000b7;65&#x02013;1&#x000b7;07 for the HR in the 60 Gy group and 0&#x000b7;96&#x02013;1&#x000b7;51 for the HR in the 57 Gy group. The estimated absolute difference in the proportion of patients in the hypofractionated groups free from biochemical or clinical failure compared with that in the control group at 5 years is &#x003b4;=1&#x000b7;80% (90% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;34 to 3&#x000b7;58) for 60 Gy versus 74 Gy and &#x003b4;=&#x02013;2&#x000b7;20% (&#x02013;4&#x000b7;88 to 0&#x000b7;08) for 57 Gy versus 74 Gy.

At 5 years, the proportions of patients with RTOG grade 3 or worse bowel events were none of 534 patients in the 74 Gy group, two (&#x0003c;1%) of 569 patients in the 60 Gy group, and three of 549 (&#x0003c;1%) in the 57 Gy group; RTOG grade 3 or worse bladder events occurred in two (&#x0003c;1%) of 534 patients in the 74 Gy group, four (&#x0003c;1%) of 569 patients in the 60 Gy group, and five (1%) of 549 patients in the 57 Gy group. The estimated cumulative incidence of grade 3 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events at 5 years was 2% (17 events) and 3% (27 events) in the 74 Gy group, 3% (20 events) and 6% (38 events) in the 60 Gy group, and 4% (23 events) and 3% (21 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C, D</xref>).

At 5 years, the proportion of assessable patients reporting small or worse bowel bother was 49 (14%) of 341 in the 74 Gy group, 57 (15%) of 375 in the 60 Gy group, and 59 (15%) of 387 in the 57 Gy group.

The cumulative incidence of late small or worse bother in each hypofractionated schedule was not significantly different from control for bowel, bladder, and sexual symptoms, and there were no significant differences between the hypofractionated groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5E, F</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 8&#x02013;10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pre-planned analysis with a median follow-up of over 5 years, we found that the 60 Gy hypofractionated schedule is non-inferior to the 74 Gy conventionally fractionated schedule in terms of time to biochemical or clinical failure for patients with localised prostate cancer. Evaluation of the lower 57 Gy hypofractionated schedule was inconclusive: it cannot be stated to be non-inferior to the 74 Gy control group but it was inferior to the 60 Gy group. Notably, the proportion of patients free from biochemical or clinical failure at 5 years in all treatment groups (88&#x000b7;3% for the 74 Gy group, 90&#x000b7;6% for the 60 Gy group, and 85&#x000b7;9% for the 57 Gy group) were considerably higher than the 71% reported for the 74 Gy group in the national MRC RT01 trial.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Recent meta-analyses<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> identified five relatively small phase 3 trials comparing modest hypofractionation with conventional 1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;2&#x000b7;0 Gy fractions. A total of 1825 patients were included, although 1153 received relatively low doses of radiotherapy (&#x02264;67 Gy in the control groups). There were no consistent differences between randomised groups, and the investigators concluded that larger trials were required to establish the non-inferiority of hypofractionation for clinical effectiveness.

However, we have now documented that the peak acute bowel toxicity is greater in patients receiving a hypofractionated schedule, although it is noteworthy that only 2% of patients had grade 3 or worse toxic effects and only 1% had a prolongation of treatment time of more than 1 week, indicating the tolerability of the hypofractionated schedules. An increased acute gastrointestinal reaction in patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy has been noted by other investigators<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> but not by Norkus and colleagues,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> who treated patients using a 4 day per week schedule. The different treatment schedules and total dose given might account for these differences (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>). There were no significant differences in late bowel toxicity between the 74 Gy and 60 Gy groups in any of the domains at any timepoint. The 57 Gy group had less grade 1 or worse and grade 2 or worse LENT-SOM bowel and grade 2 or worse RTOG bladder side-effects than the 60 Gy group with outcomes on other toxicity scales supporting this effect, although they were not significant; there were no significant differences between the 57 Gy and 60 Gy groups in sexual function domains. The results are in accord with a recent meta-analysis indicating the general tolerability of hypofractionated radiotherapy,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> although two studies have reported approximate doublings of grade 2 gastrointestinal<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> or genitourinary<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> side-effects compared with conventional 1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;2&#x000b7;0 Gy fractions (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>).</p><p>Post-radiotherapy symptoms relate to treatment methods, total dose, patient factors, and fractionation schedules.

We previously reported complementary findings from the CHHiP trial showing a greater than 50% reduction in bowel bother or distress compared with the RT01 trial using the UCLA-PCI instrument.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Additionally, the apparently more favourable bladder toxicity results reported in the CHHiP trial compared with other studies might relate to lower total delivered dose<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> or amount of bladder and trigone included in the high-dose volume,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> which would be in keeping with our observation of lower side-effects in the 57 Gy compared with 60 Gy hypofractioned groups. This finding suggests that a steep dose&#x02013;volume association might exist for late bladder complications using hypofractionated schedules.</p><p>Strengths of the CHHiP trial include its size and multicentre recruitment. Consistent and quality assured radiotherapy delivery in 40 centres demonstrates the generalisability of the radiotherapy techniques. The study design, using two experimental hypofractionated groups, enables clarity of clinical interpretation. Limitations are that results are primarily applicable to patients receiving short-course androgen deprivation therapy (97% of the men treated) and might not be generalisable for populations who do not receive androgen deprivation therapy, and are most robust for patients with intermediate-risk disease (73% of the men treated), although there was no heterogeneity of effect across all risk groups. We have found a low level of side-effects in all groups. However, further follow-up is required to assess 10-year and 15-year outcomes, and it is possible that differences might yet emerge. Because the hypofractionated and conventional radiotherapy were given over different lengths of time, the study does not address the issue of treatment duration and accelerated repopulation in prostate cancer and our estimate of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio of 1&#x000b7;8 Gy does not include a time factor.</p><p>Other complementary phase 3 studies treating patients with prostate cancer with radiotherapy alone without androgen deprivation therapy and using hypofractionated radiotherapy with different treatment durations will clarify these issues. In the Netherlands, the HYPRO study (ISRCTN85133859)<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> randomised 820 patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease to high-dose conventional radiotherapy (78 Gy in 39 fractions) or dose-escalated hypofractionated radiotherapy of 64&#x000b7;6 Gy in 19 fractions given over a period of 6&#x02013;7 weeks with or without androgen deprivation therapy. In Canada, the PROFIT trial (ISRCTN43853433) has randomised 1204 men with intermediate-risk disease to receive either 60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 78 Gy in 39 fractions. For the low-risk patient group, the RTOG 0415 study recruited 1115 patients who were randomly assigned to receive 70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5&#x000b7;5 weeks or 73&#x000b7;8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8&#x000b7;1 weeks. More extreme forms of hypofractionated radiotherapy are now being studied. The HYPO trial (ISRCTN45905321) will shortly complete recruitment of 1200 men comparing 43&#x000b7;7 Gy in seven fractions over 15&#x02013;19 days with 78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7&#x000b7;8 weeks and the PACE trial (ISRCTN17627211) compares 36&#x000b7;25 Gy in five fractions over 1&#x02013;2 weeks with 78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7&#x000b7;8 weeks. Both trials use IGRT, which permits reduced target margins around the prostate, and might reduce treatment side-effects. Outcome results will not be available for several years.</p><p>Prostate cancer radiotherapy accounts for 27% of the workload of radiotherapy departments in the UK.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Radical external-beam radiotherapy was given to 14&#x02008;364 patients in 2014&#x02013;15 in England and Wales involving 455&#x02008;638 attendances. Before commencement of the CHHiP trial, 3 Gy fraction schedules were rarely used, but by 2014&#x02013;15, after publication of initial safety results,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> 19% of patients received 3 Gy hypofractionated schedules (Ball C, personal communication). A uniform change to a 20-fraction schedule could reduce the number of treatment fractions and attendances by over 200&#x02008;000 annually in the UK. The CHHiP trial results show that the combination of hypofractionation and high-quality radiotherapy techniques gives excellent tumour control, a low level of side-effects, and increased convenience for patients compared with a conventional fractionation schedule. High-dose modest hypofractionation using high-quality treatment methods such as those used in this trial should become a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy. The trial results might act as a benchmark for comparison with other treatment approaches, including radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and external beam radiation therapy without androgen deprivation therapy or using extreme hypofractionation schedules.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10a"><p><bold>This online publication has been corrected.
