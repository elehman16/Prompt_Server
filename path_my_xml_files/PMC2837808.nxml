However, the method of fixation for hip replacement components has remained a matter of controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The cemented all-polyethylene acetabular component has been regarded as a gold standard, and multiple reports confirm survival of 85&#x02013;92% after 16&#x02013;25&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and revision rates of 2&#x02013;17% after 17&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] when aseptic loosening is the end-point. However, results are worse for younger patients, and rates of revision increase with longer follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The uncemented acetabular component has been regarded as a viable alternative to the cemented cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the hemispheric porous-coated cup inserted with press-fit technique has emerged as the most commonly used component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Multiple series have demonstrated low rates of revision when aseptic loosening is the end-point, but revision due to osteolysis and polyethylene wear remains a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Survival of the shell after 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years is reported to be 100% in several studies when aseptic loosening is the end-point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereas survival of the acetabular component may be 64&#x02013;80% when liner exchange, osteolysis, and wear are end-points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a study of a first-generation porous-coated cup (PCA) with 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years follow-up, 17% of the cups had been revised due to loosening with or without osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], whereas a recent 20-year study found 96% survival of shell and 17% liner revision rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>As the acetabular component of the Charnley arthroplasty has remained virtually unchanged for close to 40&#x000a0;years, there is an abundance of clinical studies documenting the results of the cemented acetabular component. A recent PubMed search yielded more than 400 studies on the Charnley arthroplasty, but only 8 were comparative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and only 1 compared the Charnley with a modern hemispheric porous-coated press-fit cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This was a radiostereometric study in 21 patients which found no difference between the Charnley cup and the Harris Galante cup in terms of fixation.</p><p>Thus there is a lack of good evidence with regards to the comparative outcome of the modern porous-coated cup and the traditional cemented all-polyethylene cup. Randomized controlled studies provide the best evidence, and in this report we convey the results of a randomized controlled trial comparing the Duraloc cup with a conventional Charnley cup with 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;year follow-up to help resolve the lack of evidence from direct comparisons of these two hip arthroplasty techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Between April 1994 and June 1997, 215 patients treated at one clinic consented to take part in the study, which was conducted at a county hospital with an annual case load of 300 total hip replacements. According to the inclusion criteria, patients were eligible for participation in the study if they suffered from noninflammatory degenerative disease of the hip including osteoarthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. They were also eligible if they suffered from joint diseases of inflammatory origin such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well as systemic lupus erythematosus. The upper age limit was 75&#x000a0;years, but there was no lower age limit. Previous prosthetic replacement was a contraindication to participation, but osteotomies and internal fixations were not. Twenty-five patients consented for both of their hips, resulting in a total of 240 hips enrolled. Patients were given sequential enrollment numbers, but the assignment of patients to treatment groups was randomly chosen using a table of random numbers. The randomization was concealed until after surgery had been initiated. In order to reduce potential bias, patients were not told which acetabular implant they received until their 2-year follow-up visit, which was covered in the preoperative consent form.</p><p>Patients were grouped in accordance with the Charnley classification (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to allow stratification according to presence of comorbidities and condition of other joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Surgery was performed using a direct lateral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] by five orthopedic surgeons. The femoral component was cemented using third-generation cementing techniques with vacuum mixing, retrograde filling of the canal, and pressurization prior to insertion of the femoral component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Cement containing gentamycin and a Charnley stem (DePuy, Leeds, UK) with 22.225&#x000a0;mm head diameter was used in all cases.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Charnley classification including modification of group&#x000a0;B</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">A</td><td align="left">Single-joint arthropathy and no significant medical comorbidity</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B</td><td align="left">One other joint in need of an arthroplasty, or an unsuccessful or failing arthroplasty in another joint</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B1</td><td align="left">Contralateral hip in need of arthroplasty, but untreated</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B2</td><td align="left">Contralateral hip has been successfully treated with an arthroplasty</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C</td><td align="left">Multiple joints in need of arthroplasty, multiple failing arthroplasties or significant medical or psychological impairment</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>For the uncemented group, the Duraloc 1200 cup (DePuy, Leeds, UK), a hemispherical modular cup consisting of a titanium shell with a porous-coated surface, was used. The surface has a mean pore size of 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. The Duraloc 1200 cup was considered a second-generation cup because it had a minimum polyethylene thickness of 6&#x000a0;mm, dome-loading of the polyethylene, and an improved locking mechanism designed not to interfere with liner&#x02013;shell conformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The shell had a central hole for the insertion device and 12 holes for screw fixation. An ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liner (Enduron; DePuy, Leeds, UK) with a 10&#x000b0; posterior lip was used in all cases.</p><p>The Charnley cup (DePuy, Leeds, UK) used for the other group was an all-polyethylene cup with a flange. The Ogee cup was used in 101 cases and the Low Posterior Wall cup was used in 19 cases. The surgeon cut the flange to fit the rim of the acetabulum, which provided increased pressure to the cement, augmenting cement penetration into the bone of the acetabulum. Surgery was performed under laminar air flow.</p><p>For prophylaxis against thromboembolic events, dalteparin (Fragmin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), a low-molecular-weight heparin, 5000&#x000a0;IE was given subcutaneously on the night before surgery, 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h postoperatively, and daily for the length of the stay. Cefuroxim (Zinacef<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was given routinely in the study period as prophylaxis for infection. Patients were screened for urinary-tract infection prior to surgery and treated appropriately if bacteriuria was detected. Postoperatively, patients were allowed restricted weight bearing on the day after surgery. All patients were encouraged to use two crutches for at least 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The objectives of the study were to assess the safety and efficacy of the implants by means of clinical evaluation by means of Harris Hip Score (HHS), and radiological evaluation after 6&#x000a0;months, and 2, 5, and 10&#x000a0;years, as well as adverse event reporting. Though not part of the original study protocol, we conducted an implant survival analysis as well. No subgroup analysis was performed.</p><p>Patients were seen by their surgeon 6&#x000a0;weeks after surgery and by a physiotherapist 6&#x000a0;months, and 2, 5, and 10&#x000a0;years after surgery. The physiotherapist was specifically trained to evaluate hip replacement patients. The patients, but not the physiotherapist, were blinded as to which implant had been used in order not to bias the subjective part of the evaluation. The physiotherapist obtained a Harris Hip Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] at each visit. Radiographs were obtained at all visits and analyzed by a radiologist not directly involved in the study but very competent in this field. Radiographic changes that were noted included radiolucencies, bone resorption, cortical hypertrophy, cement fracture, and migration of components in the femoral zones of Gruen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and acetabular zones of DeLee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. No measure of polyethylene wear and no formal quantification of osteolysis was performed as this was not a part of the original study protocol.</p><p>All patient charts were examined during the summer of 2008, and censoring dates were set to July 31, 2008 for patient and implant survival. Thus, the follow-up was 12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years in the survival analysis. During the chart review we collected information that was not included in the protocol, including duration of surgery, bleeding, and any secondary use of antibiotics that might indicate complications not routinely recorded in the research protocol.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparing continuous data.

The difference in Harris Hip Score between the implants was 2.4 points after 5&#x000a0;years and 2.5 points after 10&#x000a0;years, in favor of the Charnley cup. The study probably did not have sufficient power to detect a difference of this magnitude as statistically significant. Harris Hip Scores between 90 and 100 are regarded as excellent, and we feel that a clinically relevant difference between treatment groups would have to be 5 points. In the study by Kalairajah [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], the mean HHS was 89 and the standard deviation was 13.3. In a study designed to detect a 5% effect size with 80% power and 95% certainty and a standard deviation of 13.3, one would need 87 subjects in each treatment group. In our study, loss of patients due to revision, death, and ill health was underestimated, resulting in somewhat small samples.</p><p>The observed decline in HHS from 5&#x000a0;years in the Charnley group and from 2&#x000a0;years in the Duraloc group is in accordance with what is usually seen. When splitting the Harris Hip Score into a pain component and a functional component, it can be seen that the arthroplasties remain pain free even though function declines. For this reason, we feel that the decline in HHS corresponds to a decline in general health due to aging of the patients, which has been reported in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] earlier studies. This supports the previous findings that call for a separate instrument to assess activity level of the arthroplasty patient beyond what is measured by the Harris Hip Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>There was a large discrepancy in the frequency of infection which warrants more investigation. Five of the 240 arthroplasties became infected (2.1%), but all occurred in the Charnley group. There was a significant association between urinary infection and later deep infection of the hip, which is consistent with findings in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, since we do not have information on the infecting agent, it is not possible to suggest a causal relationship between urinary-tract infection and subsequent prosthetic infection. However, the finding is interesting and may suggest an underlying predisposition for infection. In any case, the finding certainly represents a cautionary reminder concerning perioperative instrumentation of the urinary tract. On a slightly different note, it may be argued that the patients who became infected should be removed from the survival analysis, but we have elected to keep them, since infection is an important aspect of implant survival in the clinical setting.</p><p>The radiographic analysis indicated that 9.9% of the Charnley cups and 1.2% of the Duraloc cups had some signs of loosening. However, since none of them had changed position, they were not deemed to be definitely loose. In our study, we included any sign of loosening larger than 1&#x000a0;mm noted by the radiologist in the analysis, and many of these signs were probably very subtle. This may have exaggerated the number of cups with radiographic signs of loosening, but the relationship between radiographic signs and loosening is complicated, as radiographically loose cups may function well clinically whereas painful, loose cups do not always display definite signs of loosening radiographically. Furthermore, we have not studied wear and osteolysis, which are known to affect predominantly uncemented cups. For this reason, our findings may underestimate problems with uncemented cups.</p><p>There are limitations to any long-term study of this nature. Because of death and deterioration in general health, only 59% in the Charnley group and 67% in the Duraloc group were available for clinical and radiographic evaluation at the 10-year mark. While it is has been shown that the results in patients lost to follow-up are worse than patients who stay in clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we were able to determine reason for loss to follow-up for almost all of our patients, with the vast majority of those who declined a follow-up visit doing so because of advanced comorbid diseases and not because of poor function of the hip. In addition, our overall follow-up rate was similar to other long-term studies of hip function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], even though our patient population was significantly older. The generalizability of the study is felt to be good as the study was conducted at a nonacademic center, included most patients under 75&#x000a0;years of age, and the surgery was performed by general orthopedic surgeons.</p><p>The lack of precise recording of comorbidities is also a limiting factor. Indices of comorbidities have previously been shown to predict functional outcome as well as complications after total hip arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The Charnley score is not a dedicated comorbidity instrument and might not be sensitive enough to record subtle nuances in patient health status, which could have contributed to a better understanding of the large discrepancy in infection rates between the two study groups. Another limitation is the lack of a formal account for patient activity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Level of activity is important as it is of primary interest to the patients for performing recreational activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] as well as for improving physical fitness, although increased level of activity correlates with wear and potential failure of an implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The Harris Hip Score contains assessment of physical function, but it does not quantify what the patient actually does, only what he or she is capable of doing. Dedicated scales have been developed for the sole purpose of estimating level of activity before and after total hip arthroplasty (THA), but these scales were not available for use in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>The issue of bilateral procedures is controversial since the presence of two procedures in one patient violates the assumption of independent observations on which many statistical tests rely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, other authors have discussed this and found that inclusion of bilateral procedures did not alter the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In a recent study from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register, 27% of the cases analyzed were bilateral cases, and inclusion of bilateral cases in the analysis was considered appropriate, even though the statistical technique (Cox regression) formally requires independent observations. In out study, 21% of the cases were bilateral. We did find statistically significant differences in preoperative BMI, which raises the question of whether other unknown confounders might influence the results. However, the issue of bilaterality was not addressed in the study protocol. The presence of an arthroplasty in the contralateral hip was not an exclusion criterion for the study, nor was there any criterion excluding patients with poor function of the contralateral hip. For these reasons, we find it justified to include the patients who had two arthroplasties during the study and treat them as independent cases.</p><p>While the Charnley cup has remained unchanged since the inception of this study, uncemented cups have undergone a continuous process of change. As screw-holes are believed to transmit increased stress to the polyethylene, in addition to providing a potential pathway for polyethylene debris, a shell with 12 screw-holes is now rarely used in primary surgery. Furthermore, the polyethylene used in this study has largely been replaced by cross-linked polyethylene (PE) or alternative bearings, and there is an international trend moving toward larger head sizes. Nevertheless, the Charnley low-friction arthroplasty continues to be regarded by many as a gold standard against which new implants are compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our 10-year results confirm previous reports from noncontrolled studies that survival of an uncemented hemispherical porous-coated cup as well as the cemented all-polyethylene cup is excellent. With no statistically significant differences in outcomes or survival between the two implants, surgeons should choose the system that they are either more familiar with in terms of surgical technique or that would most benefit the individual patient. Further studies might indicate whether one implant will perform better than the other in the long term.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to express their gratitude to Helen Scmidt, Janne Hensmo, and other physiotherapists as well as to Dr. Asle Bunes, radiologist, for their hard work and dedication.
