Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) has been shown to affect many dimensions of patient QOL, including mood, sleep, work, self-esteem and social relationships, and has a particular impact on individuals with suboptimally managed pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately one in four people with type 2 diabetes will experience some level of PDPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which often presents as numbness, tingling, burning, aching, electric shocks, or lancinating pains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many patients with PDPN remain undiagnosed or undertreated and few experience complete resolution of pain. There is a clear unmet need for new therapeutic options to improve current standard of care (SOC); available treatments such as antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and opioids are often limited by contraindications and safety issues, and frequently have insufficient efficacy to achieve adequate pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One alternative to these treatments is the capsaicin 8% patch, which contains 179&#x000a0;mg or 8% weight for weight capsaicin and is optimised for rapid delivery of a high concentration of capsaicin directly into the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Defunctionalisation of hyperactive nociceptors in the skin induced by the rapid delivery of capsaicin provides fast, targeted, and sustained pain relief after a single treatment. Furthermore, local application of the capsaicin 8% patch provides minimal systemic absorption, without the potential for drug-drug interactions or requirement for dose adjustment in elderly patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The capsaicin 8% patch is well tolerated and provides effective relief of pain for a variety of types of PNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A single capsaicin 8% patch treatment has demonstrated significant improvements in pain relief versus a placebo patch over 12&#x000a0;weeks, and was well tolerated with no sensory deterioration in patients with PDPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present study in patients with PDPN (PACE) was the first evaluation of the long-term safety and tolerability of capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment plus SOC, compared with SOC alone, over 52&#x000a0;weeks. The study had an open-label design; it primarily assessed the safety of capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment, with efficacy of the capsaicin 8% patch in PDPN assessed in the double-blind STEP study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) questionnaire was chosen as the primary endpoint to assess the safety of capsaicin treatment. The Norfolk scale is a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire, which captures the entire impact of nerve fibre dysfunction on QOL in diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Norfolk tool includes the concentration of symptoms in the extremities and subtle loss of function, such as fine motor impairments, slight sensory changes, unique problems with proprioception and balance and autonomic symptoms. The Norfolk QOL-DN scale was therefore used to assess any functional consequences associated with potentially deleterious effects of capsaicin treatment on peripheral nerve endings in patients with PDPN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>PACE was a Phase 3, multinational, open-label, randomised, controlled, 52-week safety study, conducted in Europe between November 2011 and February 2014 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01478607).

All patients were pretreated with a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) containing lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%, to limit pain or discomfort during the application period. The 30-min application time was chosen to align with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A 60-min application time was also evaluated in order to ensure that the safety objectives of the study were fully covered with respect to possible exposure periods. SOC was optimised for each patient at the discretion of each investigator and was assessed at clinic visits and on days 1 to 5 post-treatment, by completion of a rescue pain medication diary. The treatment area was mapped at screening and baseline visits, and re-mapped before treatment if the treatment area changed. Treatment borders were defined by the most painful areas of the feet, up to a total combined surface area of 1120&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> (four patches) for both feet. Assessments were scheduled every two months; clinic visits were scheduled for Month 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and telephone contact was scheduled at Month 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Capsaicin 8% patch retreatment could occur at both scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion, but only after at least 8&#x000a0;weeks had elapsed since the last treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p><p>*Capsaicin 8% patch treatment (Groups 1 and 2) took place at scheduled bi-monthly visits (P) or unscheduled visit at intervals of at least 8&#x000a0;weeks.

The power calculation for this study used the principle of a non-inferiority study with 90% power and a 95% one sided confidence interval [CI]. The non-inferiority limit was 20%. A clinically meaningful difference in the percentage reduction from baseline on the Norfolk scale was chosen using data from a clinical trial in diabetic peripheral neuropathy with ruboxistaurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which showed a drug effect of 37.2%, and selecting 20% as the lower margin for clinically meaningful effect. A number of statistical measures were used to describe the data: descriptive statistics for absolute and change from baseline values at each visit and at EoS; 90 or 95% CI for the estimated mean difference between each of the active treatment groups against SOC control for change from baseline; percentage change from baseline at each post-baseline analysis visit and EoS. As the objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term capsaicin 8% patch treatment, no formal statistical testing was performed to calculate <italic>p</italic>-values for the difference between both capsaicin groups and SOC alone. At EoS, for each subject, the last available observation was used with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method.

</p><p>Severe PRAEs were reported by 12.2, 7.6 and 6.5% in the patients in the capsaicin 30&#x000a0;min, capsaicin 60&#x000a0;min, and SOC alone, groups, respectively; overall, these severe PRAEs were most commonly categorised as cardiac disorders, infections and infestations, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The difference in PRAEs between the capsaicin plus SOC groups and SOC alone was primarily due to the reporting of application site pain or erythema in the capsaicin groups, which were predominately mild or moderate in severity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p>TEAEs were similar in the capsaicin 8% patch 30-min and 60-min plus SOC treatment groups (66.7 and 67.5%, respectively) and were generally mild or moderate in severity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Over one-third of TEAEs in the capsaicin groups were application site reactions; the type and frequency of these reactions were comparable between both capsaicin groups. The proportion of patients with application site reactions decreased throughout the study, from between the first and second to between the sixth and seventh treatments (application site pain: 30&#x000a0;min, &#x02212;6.9%; 60&#x000a0;min, &#x02212;7.9%, burning sensation: 30&#x000a0;min, &#x02212;2.8%; 60&#x000a0;min &#x02212;2.2%). Four patients in the 60-min group discontinued due to drug-related TEAEs (four events: muscle spasms, rectal adenocarcinoma, neuralgia, and psoriasis); no drug-related discontinuations were reported in the 30-min group. Severe TEAEs were reported by 12.2% in the 30-min group and 7.6% in the 60-min group; severe TEAEs considered as drug related were reported by 2.6% in the 30-min group and 1.9% in the 60-min group. Serious TEAEs considered as drug related were reported by two patients in the 60-min group (three events: angina pectoris, rectal adenocarcinoma and accelerated hypertension), and by no patients in the 30-min group. These events were officially classified as drug-related by the investigator because causation could not be excluded; however, the sponsor considered it unlikely that repeat treatment with capsaicin 8% patch was the cause of these events. Four deaths were reported during the study: capsaicin 30&#x000a0;min, multiple injuries and brain death (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1); capsaicin 60&#x000a0;min, hypotension (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1); SOC alone, pneumonia (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), atrial fibrillation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). None of the deaths were considered to be drug related by the investigator. The only finding of note from vital sign and laboratory analyses was that the change in HbA1c from screening to EoS was marginally greater in the SOC alone arm (0.24%), compared with the capsaicin 30&#x000a0;min (0.06%) and 60&#x000a0;min (0.06%) arms, although HbA1c levels were generally controlled throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Concomitant medications</title><p>Overall, there was no decrease in the use of concomitant medications in any of the treatment groups throughout the study; use of concomitant medications was comparable from baseline to EoS in both capsaicin groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S3). The proportion of patients using antiepileptics at the end of the study was comparable with the proportion reported at baseline for both capsaicin groups. However, the proportion of patients using antiepileptic drugs had increased by &#x0003e;&#x02009;10% in the SOC alone group at the end of the study. Small increases were also observed in antidepressant and opioid use in the SOC alone group from baseline to the EoS.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>In patients with PDPN, capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment plus SOC over 52&#x000a0;weeks was well tolerated, had no negative functional or neurological effects and raised no new safety concerns compared with SOC therapy.</p><p>While the efficacy and safety of a single capsaicin 8% treatment has been previously characterised in patients with PDPN in the double-blind STEP study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the open-label PACE study was the first to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of repeated treatment over 52&#x000a0;weeks in PDPN. Capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment plus SOC was not associated with any deterioration in Norfolk QOL-DN total or subscale scores compared with SOC alone. For the safety endpoints, few differences were observed in results between the 30-min and 60-min capsaicin groups.</p><p>Regarding the UENS total score and &#x02018;pinprick sensation&#x02019; subscale, and sharp, cold, warm and vibration sensation on standardised neurological tests, no deterioration was observed with capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment. By EoS, the majority of patients showed no change in sensation category, indicating that the changes observed in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a and b</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S5 were predominantly in patients who transitioned from &#x02018;absent&#x02019; to &#x02018;diminished&#x02019; or to &#x02018;normal&#x02019; during the study. Taken together, these findings indicate that there was no small fibre mediated sensory loss with capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment. The sensory testing observations in the subset of patients who received seven consecutive capsaicin treatments demonstrated that regular, repeat treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch was also not associated with deterioration in sensory function.</p><p>Alongside the double-blind STEP study, the PACE study formed part of a successful regulatory submission to remove the restriction of treatment with capsaicin 8% patch in patients with diabetes in Europe. The capsaicin 8% patch is now indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although the open-label design of this study may be perceived as more representative of capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment in clinical practice than in a double-blind design, the observed safety evaluations may have been biased by the open-label design. Although the physicians assessing neurological function were blinded to treatment, patients and investigators were unblinded, which may have impacted on the findings. As the primary objective of this open-label study was to assess the safety and tolerability of capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment, <italic>p</italic>-values were not calculated to supplement the 90% CIs for the between-group differences each month. Furthermore, differences between treatment groups in an open-label study may be caused by the fact that patients know which treatment they are receiving. The LOCF imputation method is a conservative method to estimate the treatment effect. The underlying assumption is that subjects that withdraw have worse efficacy than those that stay in the trial. The LOCF imputation method did use the data of withdrawn subjects and therefore, theoretically, gave worse results in this study than from a non-imputed analysis. As the limitations of the LOCF for missing data methodology are recognised, the results were also analysed using the baseline observation carried forward method, and no differences in the results were observed. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) was not performed in this multicenter study and instead, &#x02018;bedside&#x02019; sensory testing was used. Although it was not feasible in this multicenter study to provide adequate QST training across all centres, or standardise all assessments in all study centres, potential advantages of QST such as quantification of sensory deficits and allodynia/hyperalgesia, and standardisations of values for several painful sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] may have provided greater sensitivity in detecting small variations of thermal or mechanical deficits, and reduced possible variability in testing within and between centres. Other limitations include the impact of concomitant opioid use on the results and that the patient population was 99% Caucasian, and therefore the findings may not be widely applicable to patients of other ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Repeat treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch plus SOC versus SOC alone over 52&#x000a0;weeks in patients with PDPN was well tolerated and consistent with the established safety profile of the capsaicin 8% patch.
