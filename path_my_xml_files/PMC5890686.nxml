The most common treatment-related AEs in delafloxacin-treated patients were gastrointestinal in nature reported in 12% of patients, primarily nausea and diarrhoea. Extensive analysis of AEs typically seen with fluoroquinolones was conducted. There were no cases of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> diarrhoea and there were no cases of tendinitis or tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy or myopathy thought to be related to delafloxacin treatment. One delafloxacin-treated patient and two vancomycin/aztreonam-treated patients had a report of hypoglycaemia related to treatment; two delafloxacin patients and one vancomycin/aztreonam patient had reported hyperglycaemia potentially related to treatment. Intensive glucose monitoring for 12&#x02009;h post-dose in patients who were also undergoing pharmacokinetic testing did not show differences between the two treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx329-F4">4</xref>). Treatment-related infusion reactions (extravasations, pain, oedema, phlebitis, swelling, etc.) occurred in 3% of patients in each treatment group. Renal failure was reported as potentially related to treatment in three patients on vancomycin/aztreonam compared with one report of renal impairment on delafloxacin. The occurrence of TEAEs resulting in premature study drug discontinuation was lower in the delafloxacin group compared with the vancomycin/aztreonam arm (0.9% and 4.3%, respectively).</p><fig id="dkx329-F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Box-plot of glucose concentrations (mmol/L): intense glucose analysis set.

Of those, none in the delafloxacin treatment group and one in the vancomycin/aztreonam treatment group were considered to be potentially related to treatment. One death occurred in each treatment arm, with neither considered related to the study drug.</p><p>The groups were generally similar regarding changes from baseline in haematology and serum chemistry. Vital sign measurements, physical examination findings and ECGs were unremarkable. There were no increases in hepatic AEs in the delafloxacin treatment group when compared with vancomycin/aztreonam. In all patients regardless of baseline medical history or baseline laboratories, only three patients in the delafloxacin treatment group reported ALT &#x0003e;5&#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN) result at any time in the study, compared with five patients in the vancomycin/aztreonam treatment groups. Only two patients in either treatment group had AST &#x0003e;5&#x000d7; ULN any time during the trial (see Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S3</xref>). There were no reports of cases meeting the Hy's law definition in any patients during this study. Serum creatinine &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN was seen in three vancomycin-treated patients any time during the trial, compared with no reports in delafloxacin-treated patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This large, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 trial established that delafloxacin, an anionic fluoroquinolone, was non-inferior to vancomycin/aztreonam for the treatment of ABSSSIs. The non-inferiority of delafloxacin and vancomycin/aztreonam was demonstrated for the objective response at 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;h after initiation of treatment (FDA primary endpoint) and the investigator-assessed cure at FU (EMA primary endpoint). Moreover, across the various sensitivity analyses and secondary objectives, the delafloxacin and vancomycin/aztreonam arms were comparable. This study demonstrates that delafloxacin monotherapy is effective across a range of Gram-positive and -negative pathogens, and was comparable to vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA. Treatment with vancomycin requires a second antibiotic (aztreonam in this study) as initial empirical therapy if Gram-negative pathogens are suspected.</p><p>The focus of recent antibiotic development in ABSSSI has been on the coverage of Gram-positive infections, particularly MRSA. However, the risk for inappropriate antimicrobial therapy increases in skin infections when Gram-negative and mixed cultures are present.<xref rid="dkx329-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dkx329-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Other MDR bacteria are demonstrating similar trends, as seen with the rise in MRSA, and are increasing in prevalence in ABSSSIs.

Other antibiotic studies in skin infections have defined a successful outcome as clinical improvement where no further antibiotic therapy is required. This aligns with the definition of success in this study. Whether using cure or success (cure&#x02009;+&#x02009;improved), delafloxacin was comparable to vancomycin/aztreonam in later clinical response at FU and LFU demonstrating a sustained clinical response.</p><p>Delafloxacin was well tolerated with a lower overall discontinuation rate compared with vancomycin/aztreonam.

Delafloxacin offers the potential for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA and Gram-negative pathogens, without the need for combination therapy.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy of obese patients presents additional challenges to physicians and pharmacists.<xref rid="dkx329-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> A previous Phase 2 study noted better outcomes with delafloxacin in obese patients than vancomycin at FU and LFU.<xref rid="dkx329-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Unlike vancomycin, delafloxacin does not require weight-based dosing or drug monitoring. The results of this study demonstrated that, in obese patients (BMI &#x02265;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the investigator-assessed outcome at FU and LFU favoured delafloxacin, although it failed to meet statistical significance in all but investigator-assessed cure at LFU. However, the current study was not stratified for obesity at enrolment and a weight limit of 140&#x02009;kg was instituted due to difficulties in blinding of vancomycin in an obese population.</p><p>Other limitations to this study include a low number of burn infections and surgical wounds and the number of Gram-negative pathogens was limited by use of the current ABSSSI definition that favours Gram-positive infections. There were a low number of older adults and non-whites and the rate of diabetes was lower than in the general population.</p><p>Delafloxacin was found to have comparable clinical activity to vancomycin in the treatment of patients with ABSSSI by early objective response, later clinical assessments and microbiological response including impact on MRSA. Additionally, delafloxacin was well tolerated. With both intravenous and oral formulations, delafloxacin is appropriate for the treatment of diverse skin infection types due to Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including patients with MRSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="supplementary_data_dkx329.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>An abstract of the data was presented at IDWeek 2015, San Diego, CA, USA, 2015 (Abstract no. 776).</p><sec><title/><sec><title>Members of the PROCEED Study Group</title><p>Anna Barvinska, Lviv, Ukraine; Michal Chowers, Kfar Saba, Israel; Dennis Cortes, Miramar, FL, USA; Sadia Dar, Smryna, TN, USA; Oleksii Datsenko, Kharkiv, Ukraine; Robert Eyzaguirre, Long Beach, CA, USA; Brett Farley, Modesto, CA, USA; Janis Gardovskis, Riga, Latvia; Juan Pablo Horcajada Gallego, Barcelona, Spain; Osamah Hussein, Safed, Israel; Heidi Kabler, Las Vegas, NV, USA; Richard Keech, Anaheim, CA, USA; Lajos Kem&#x000e9;ny, Szeged, Hungary; Sergii Kosulnykov, Dnipropetroversusk, Ukraine; Oleksandr Kosynskyi, Dnipropetroversusk, Ukraine; Viktors Lovcinovskis, Daugavpils, Latvia; Christopher Lucasti, Somers Point, NJ, USA; Paul Manos, Oceanside, CA, USA; Carlos Munoz, Richmond, TX, USA; Maris Nalivaiko, Liepaja, Latvia; William Nseir, Nazareth, Israel; Steven O'Mara, Montgomery, AL, USA; William O'Riordan, Chula Vista, CA, USA; Scott Overcash, La Mesa, CA, USA; Ivan Puljiz, Zagreb, Croatia; John Pullman, Butte, MT; Galia Rahav, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Juan Diego Ruiz Mesa, M&#x000e1;laga, Spain; Shaukat Shah, Stockton, CA, USA; Vadym Shevchenko, Cherkasy, Ukraine; Warren Shu, Pasadena, CA, USA; Kaspars Snipe, Riga, Latvia; Sergiy Vasylyuk, Ivano-Frankiversusk, Ukraine; Anatoliy Zaichuk, Odesa, Ukraine.</p><p>&#x02003;These members enrolled patients in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by Melinta Therapeutics.
