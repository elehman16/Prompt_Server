To date, empirical support for these effects is limited, and no previous studies have assessed both acute effects of &#x00394;-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), as well as associations with cannabis dependence.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study were (1) to examine acute effects of cannabis with CBD (Cann + CBD) and without CBD (Cann-CBD) on effort-related decision-making and (2) to examine associations between cannabis dependence, effort-related decision-making and reward learning.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In study 1, 17 participants each received three acute vaporized treatments, namely Cann-CBD (8&#x000a0;mg THC), Cann + CBD (8&#x000a0;mg THC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mg CBD) and matched placebo, followed by a 50&#x000a0;% dose top-up 1.5&#x000a0;h later, and completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). In study 2, 20 cannabis-dependent participants were compared with 20 non-dependent, drug-using control participants on the EEfRT and the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) in a non-intoxicated state.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cann-CBD reduced the likelihood of high-effort choices relative to placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.042) and increased sensitivity to expected value compared to both placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.014) and Cann + CBD (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006). The cannabis-dependent and control groups did not differ on the EEfRT. However, the cannabis-dependent group exhibited a weaker response bias than the control group on the PRT (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cannabis acutely induced a transient amotivational state and CBD influenced the effects of THC on expected value. In contrast, cannabis dependence was associated with preserved motivation alongside impaired reward learning, although confounding factors, including depression, cannot be disregarded. This is the first well powered, fully controlled study to objectively demonstrate the acute amotivational effects of THC.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00213-016-4383-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cannabis</kwd><kwd>Cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>THC</kwd><kwd>Cannabidiol</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Reward</kwd><kwd>Effort-related decision-making</kwd><kwd>Reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>Addiction</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University College London (UCL)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endocannabinoid system, which includes the cannabinoid-1 (CB1) and cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and their endogenous ligands, is putatively involved in reward processing and addiction (Curran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>; Maldonado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>; Parsons and Hurd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). &#x00394;-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active compound in cannabis, is a CB1 receptor partial agonist (Petitet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1998</xref>), which may modestly increase dopamine release in the human striatum (Bossong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Dopamine is considered critical in various reward processes (Berridge and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>; Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>). Individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence or abuse showed reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (Bloomfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014a</xref>), which was negatively correlated with their apathy scores (Bloomfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014b</xref>). However, other studies have shown no difference between cannabis users and non-users in dopamine receptor density (Albrecht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>; Sevy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>; Stokes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2009</xref>; Urban et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2012</xref>). In terms of alterations to the endocannabinoid system, cannabis dependence has been associated with reduced levels of CB1 receptors (D&#x02019;Souza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Hirvonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>) and reduced anandamide levels in cerebrospinal fluid (Morgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013b</xref>).</p><p>Cannabis contains many cannabinoids, other than THC. Of particular interest is cannabidiol (CBD) which has a complex mode of action, including inhibition of the metabolism and reuptake of anandamide, inhibition of adenosine uptake, agonism of the 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptor (McPartland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>) and agonism at the GPR55 receptor (Ryberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2007</xref>). Acute THC has dose-related amnestic (Curran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>), psychotic (Morrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>) and anxiogenic (Morrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>) effects. CBD has been shown to attenuate or block these negative effects (Bhattacharyya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Englund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>; Morgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2010b</xref>). Furthermore, CBD may have some anti-addictive properties in animals and humans ( Morgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013a</xref>; Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2009</xref>), and use of high-THC/low-CBD cannabis was especially predictive of cannabis dependence, compared with other types of cannabis (Freeman and Winstock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>). Given these opposing pharmacological and psychological effects of THC and CBD, we hypothesized that CBD may buffer the effects of THC on reward processing.</p><p>Historically, cannabis use has been associated with reduced motivation (McGlothlin and West <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1968</xref>). Early, poorly controlled studies into the acute effects of cannabis found both amotivational (Miles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1974</xref>) and null (Mendelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1976</xref>) effects. More recently, both pro-motivational (Foltin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1990</xref>) and amotivational (Cherek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>) effects have been reported. However, the former study did not provide traditional rewards (e.g. money, food) in return for work, preferred work activities were earned instead. Furthermore, the latter study had a sample of only five participants. Hence, there is very little well-conducted, empirical research into the acute effects of cannabis on motivation to earn rewards. Moreover, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no one has examined the effects of CBD on motivational processing in humans.</p><p>Early studies of chronic effects of cannabis found no difference when comparing heavy with light cannabis users on fixed ratio button-pressing tasks for rewards (Mello and Mendelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1985</xref>; Mendelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1976</xref>). Survey data has also failed to demonstrate a link between long-term cannabis use and amotivation (Barnwell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>; Musty and Kaback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1995</xref>), although cannabis use has been shown to predict anhedonia (Bovasso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>). Daily, adolescent cannabis users had a lower motivation for monetary reward than non-users, although comorbid mental health problems and other drug use were not reported and may have confounded group differences (Lane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). Studies that have investigated anticipatory BOLD response for monetary reward, thought to be an indicator of intact reward processing, have found opposing results, with one showing reduced (van Hell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2010</xref>) and another showing enhanced (Nestor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>) striatal activation in dependent cannabis users compared to healthy controls.</p><p>Much of the research concerning the psychopharmacology of reward processing has focused on dopamine. In the past, learning about rewards (Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>), vigour of responding (Niv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2007</xref>), incentive-salience attribution (Flagel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>) and the pleasure taken from reward consumption (Small et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2003</xref>; Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1997</xref>) have all been linked to dopamine. Two key aspects of reward processing are effort-related decision-making (i.e. motivation) and reward learning, which have been operationalized in humans using the well-validated Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) (Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>) and Probabilistic Reward Task (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>). Performance on both of these tasks has been investigated with regard to dopaminergic functioning (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2008</xref>; Wardle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>; Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2012b</xref>), suggesting that enhanced extracellular dopamine levels improves motivation (Wardle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>) and a reduction in phasic dopamine firing impairs reward learning (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2008</xref>). However, performance on neither task has been manipulated using cannabinoid drugs or correlated with cannabis dependence, despite the claims that cannabis use is associated with amotivation and reward processing impairments.</p><p>Across two experiments, we first tested the acute effects of cannabis without CBD (Cann-CBD) and with CBD (Cann + CBD) on effort-related decision-making. Second, we investigated associations between cannabis dependence, effort-related decision-making and reward learning. We hypothesized that<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cann-CBD would reduce motivation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This effect would be weaker following Cann + CBD, i.e. CBD would buffer the amotivational effects of THC.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cannabis dependence would be associated with reduced motivation and reward learning.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study 1</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p>A repeated measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind design was used to compare Cann-CBD, Cann + CBD and placebo. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three treatment order schedules, which were based on a Latin Square design. Seventeen participants<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> (9 women) took part in the study; this sample size was adequately powered to detect drug &#x000d7; task interactions in a three-way crossover of d-amphetamine using the EEfRT (Wardle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged between 18 and 70, smoked cannabis 3 times/week or less and have smoked cannabis 4 or more times in the last year. Exclusion criteria were as follows: regular negative experiences when smoking cannabis, alcohol use &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;days/week, other illicit drug use &#x0003e;2 times/month, current or history of psychosis and MRI contraindications.</p><p>Participants were recruited through word of mouth and all provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the University College London (UCL) ethics committee and was conducted in accordance of the Declaration of Helsinki. They were reimbursed &#x000a3;7.50/h and could win extra money via completion of various tasks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Effort expenditure for rewards task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2012a</xref>)</title><p>This task tapped effort-related decision-making. Participants made a series of decisions between two different effort options: a low-effort choice, in which a small amount of money was available to be won (50p), and a high-effort choice, in which a larger amount of money was available to be won (80p, &#x000a3;1.00, &#x000a3;1.20, &#x000a3;1.40, &#x000a3;1.60, &#x000a3;1.80, &#x000a3;2.00). The low-effort choice required 30 spacebar presses with the little finger of the non-dominant hand in 7&#x000a0;s. The high-effort choice required 100 spacebar presses with the little finger of the non-dominant hand in 21&#x000a0;s. Participants were not guaranteed to win the money available if they completed the task; this was determined probabilistically. On one third of the trials there was a 12&#x000a0;% chance (low probability), on another third there was a 50&#x000a0;% chance (medium probability), and on another third there was an 88&#x000a0;% (high probability) chance of winning the money if they completed the required number of spacebar presses in time. The probability level applied to both the low-effort and high-effort choices.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Diagrammatic representation of a single trial from the EEfRT.

Participants had 8&#x000a0;s to make their choice; if they did not make a choice in that time, the computer randomly selected one. Following a 0.5&#x000a0;s fixation cross and the spacebar-pressing stage, 2&#x000a0;s of feedback was given about whether the participant had successfully completed the spacebar-pressing in time, and if successful, 2&#x000a0;s of feedback was given about whether money had been won or not. Participants completed 21 trials in total, and the trial order was randomized. Participants kept the amounts of money won on two trials; these were randomly selected at the end of the task.</p><p>Important predictor variables in this task are probability (chance of winning on each trial if the trial is completed), magnitude (the amount of money available on the high-effort choice) and expected value (the multiplication of probability and magnitude). Furthermore, previous research has suggested that both earlier trials and male gender have been associated with a greater likelihood of making a high-effort choice (Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>).</p><p>Trials were considered &#x02018;incomplete&#x02019; if the participant did not finish the button pressing in the allocated time. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they failed to complete ten or more trials on any one session. This was because we wished to exclude participants who did not carry out the task properly. The main outcome variable of the task was, on each trial, whether the participant made a low-effort or a high-effort choice.</p><p>It is possible that the speed at which a participant tapped affected choice behaviour. Hence, before the actual task, they were asked to press as fast as they could with their little finger in order to complete 30 and 100 presses; the time taken to make that number of presses (baseline button-pressing time) was recorded.</p><p>It is important to note that the EEfRT used here (as described above) was slightly different to the original EEfRT (Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>) in a number of ways, the original version: (1) had more trials; (2) finished after a set amount of time, not a set amount of trials; (3) used the dominant index finger for the easy option; (4) had a continuous variation in money available to be won; and (5) gave participants 5&#x000a0;s to make their decision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Drug history</title><p>Lifetime use was recorded as &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019;.

Across three occasions, we aimed to administer 8&#x000a0;mg THC (Cann-CBD), 8&#x000a0;mg THC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mg CBD (Cann + CBD) and placebo (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The amounts of THC and CBD that we aimed to administer were based broadly on previous THC/CBD vaporizer experiments (Bossong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Hindocha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015a</xref>) and Bedrocan product potencies (Brunt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). This amount of THC is approximately equal to that which would be found in one quarter of a cannabis user&#x02019;s joint, assuming that the cannabis has 10&#x000a0;% THC (Freeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>). Furthermore, cannabis resin in the UK has approximately equal levels of THC and CBD (Hardwick and King <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), which is similar to the ratio in the Cann + CBD in this study. Drugs were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in foil-sealed pouches, then at ambient temperature prior to administration and then used within 6&#x000a0;months of purchase.

After drug administration, participants underwent MRI scanning for 1&#x000a0;h (data from the MRI section of the experiment will be reported elsewhere). Next, they received their top-up drug administration (approximately 90&#x000a0;min after the first) and began an approximately 90-min long battery of behavioural tasks. Participants completed ratings of stoned at five time points: (1) immediately before first drug administration (time&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;0&#x000a0;min), (2) immediately after first drug administration (time&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;min), (3) immediately before second drug administration (time&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;90&#x000a0;min), (4) immediately after second drug administration (time&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;95&#x000a0;min) and (5) end of the session (time&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;180&#x000a0;min).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were carried out using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS version 22).</p><p>Stoned ratings were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA with two within-subject factors: drug (placebo, Cann-CBD, Cann + CBD) and time (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

A repeated measures ANOVA with a within-subject factor of drug was used to analyse Snaith Hamilton pleasure scale (SHAPS) scores.</p><p>Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to analyse the likelihood of participants making a high-effort choice. GEE models allow the outcome variable to be non-normally distributed with correlated residuals, which is a binary outcome in this case. GEE models allow parameters that vary on a trial-by-trial basis to be incorporated and they deal with missing data without excluding all of a participant&#x02019;s data. Furthermore, these characteristic mean GEE models have more power to detect effects than general linear model approaches. The outcome measure was choice (high effort or low effort), modelled using a binary logistic distribution. We used an unstructured working correlation matrix.</p><p>Using the same approach as Treadway et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>), we tested the effect of drug condition, and its interaction with task parameters on effort-related decision-making across four models.

At the start of each trial, a fixation-cross was presented for a jittered time (750, 800, 850, or 900&#x000a0;ms). A mouthless face was then presented for 500&#x000a0;ms followed by the appearance of the mouth in the face for 97&#x000a0;ms. After the mouth disappeared, the mouthless face remained on the screen for 1500&#x000a0;ms or until the participant responded with the &#x02018;v&#x02019; or &#x02018;m&#x02019; key. The participant pressed the &#x02018;v&#x02019; key if they thought the mouth was short and pressed the &#x02018;m&#x02019; key if they thought the mouth was long. Subsequently, feedback was provided for 1500&#x000a0;ms, e.g. &#x02018;Correct!!!

Each block had 50 rich stimuli and 50 lean stimuli; 30 of the rich stimuli had the opportunity for reinforcement, while 10 of the lean stimuli had the opportunity for reinforcement. If a stimulus with the opportunity for reinforcement was not correctly identified, the next stimulus of that type (rich or lean) that was not going to be reinforced became a stimulus with the opportunity for reinforcement. This was to ensure that participants had similar numbers of reinforced rich and lean stimuli (ideally 30 and 10 respectively). Before the task began, participants were told that only some of the correct responses would be reinforced but they were not told that one of the stimuli was more likely to be reinforced than the other.

To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this report is the first to examine the acute effects of different cannabinoids on effort-related decision-making and to investigate associations between cannabis dependence and effort-related decision-making and reward learning.</p><p>In study 1, acute administration of cannabis without CBD (Cann-CBD) reduced the overall likelihood of making high-effort choices (i.e. motivation) for monetary reward compared with placebo. Contrary to our hypothesis, this effect was not, overall, attenuated by cannabis with CBD (Cann + CBD). However, Cann-CBD increased sensitivity to expected value of the monetary outcomes, relative to both placebo (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.129) and Cann + CBD (OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.092); this was due to magnitude having a greater effect on behaviour in the Cann-CBD condition at low probability. These data therefore suggest that acute cannabis administration can lead to transient amotivation and they provide some evidence that CBD partially moderates the effects of THC on motivation, via altering the way THC interacts with expected value. In study 2, no relationship between cannabis dependence and effort-related decision-making emerged. However, cannabis-dependent participants had overall weaker reward learning than the controls, and the cannabis-dependent participants also failed to improve their response bias between blocks. Due to other group differences and the nature of the study, it is hard to conclude whether these effects were driven by cannabis dependence or confounding variables, such as depression.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Acute cannabis and motivation</title><p>Despite enduring beliefs that cannabis acutely reduces motivation, we are aware of only one controlled study which used a work-for-reward design (Cherek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>), and they had a sample of five participants. Some older work had suggested null (Mello and Mendelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1985</xref>; Mendelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1976</xref>) or pro-motivational (Foltin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1990</xref>) effects of acute cannabis; however, these studies were not well controlled or did not provide a clear reward respectively. Here, the results provide evidence to support this hypothesis using a task that has previously demonstrated sensitivity to anhedonia, major depressive disorder and dopaminergic function ( Treadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">b</xref>; Wardle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>). In the first model, placebo, relative to Cann-CBD, was a significant, positive predictor of the likelihood of making a high-effort choice. Hence, the administration of Cann-CBD reduced motivation for monetary reward, and this supports a transient amotivational effect. It is difficult to speculate on the pharmacology underlying this effect. THC may boost dopamine release (Bossong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), which would be expected to enhance motivation, but we found the opposite. The endocannabinoid system&#x02019;s role in motivation must be more clearly elucidated before attempting to explain in detail THC&#x02019;s amotivational effects, but this result at least suggests that functioning of CB1 receptors is important in effort-related decision-making.</p><p>Although CBD has been shown to shield individuals against some of the negative effects of THC (Englund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>; Hindocha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015a</xref>; Morgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010a</xref>), the overall difference between Cann-CBD and Cann + CBD was null in the first model. There is thus no evidence that cannabidiol reduced the overall amotivational effects of THC. It may be the case that a higher dose of cannabidiol or a different time of administration relative to THC is needed to produce a stronger pro-motivational effect.</p><p>However, Cann-CBD influenced the effects of expected value on effort-related decision-making differently to Cann + CBD. Expected value refers to the multiplication of the outcome value with the probability of receiving the outcome, so it represents how good an option is and how much it is worth. According to model 4, expected value increased the likelihood of making a high-effort choice more following administration of Cann-CBD than placebo and Cann + CBD. This implies that CBD affected the way people made decisions about different effortful outcomes. Further exploration showed that these drug by expected value interactions were at least partially due to Cann-CBD, significantly and marginally increasing sensitivity to magnitude on low probability trials relative to Cann&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CBD and placebo respectively. In other words, at low probability, magnitude had a larger effect on behaviour following Cann-CBD than Cann + CBD and, to some extent, placebo. These results could suggest that the presence of CBD attenuated THC&#x02019;s effects on the processing of expected value, such that Cann + CBD was more similar to placebo than Cann-CBD, in this regard. Alternatively, one could conclude that the presence of CBD made it less like placebo: Cann-CBD augmented the effect of expected value more than Cann + CBD and placebo, so this means that as expected value increased, Cann-CBD somewhat recovered from its amotivational effects, while Cann + CBD did not. Therefore, CBD&#x02019;s role in effort-related decision-making is slightly ambiguous. Replications of this study are needed before any conclusive remarks about CBD&#x02019;s motivational qualities are made.</p><p>Importantly, becoming stoned is a major motivator for cannabis use and it is noteworthy that CBD did not compromise this desired effect of THC, consistent with previous findings (Haney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>; Hindocha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015a</xref>). The lack of CBD&#x02019;s effect on stoned ratings may be important in harm reduction messages if users wish to maintain the degree to which they feel subjective effects, while potentially reducing some of the harmful consequences of THC (Curran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Cannabis dependence and reward processing impairments</title><p>No association emerged between cannabis dependence and effort-related decision-making. The results are concordant with previous survey-based research which have failed to find a relationship between long-term cannabis use and self-reported motivation (Barnwell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>; Musty and Kaback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1995</xref>). Thus, these results imply that cannabis acutely but not chronically alters effort-related decision-making. However, given the cross-sectional nature of the study, the results should be interpreted cautiously. A large, longitudinal study that records frequency of cannabis use, type of cannabis used and different aspects of motivation is needed to more thoroughly address the question of how chronic use might relate to amotivation.</p><p>Similar to the associations with depression (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2008</xref>) and nicotine withdrawal (Pergadia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>), we demonstrated that cannabis dependence (with &#x0003e;12&#x000a0;h of abstinence) was associated with reduced reward learning compared with non-dependent, drug-using controls. Not only did the cannabis-dependent individuals have an overall reduced response bias, but they also did not improve their response bias between blocks, as is usually seen in healthy controls (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>), although the group by block interaction was only a trend.</p><p>Drug addiction has been associated with deficits in non-drug reward processing (Goldstein and Volkow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>; Lubman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>) and anhedonia (Garfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>; Hatzigiakoumis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Leventhal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). Given cannabis&#x02019;s putative effects on reward circuitry (Bloomfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014a</xref>; Maldonado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>) and the depressive effects of cannabis withdrawal (Budney and Hughes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>), our finding concerning reduced reward learning was expected. Whether this reward deficiency was a consequence of chronic cannabis, a predisposing factor for cannabis use, other factors or a combination of these remain to be seen and will require longitudinal studies. Whatever the causal relationships, a reduced capacity to direct behaviour towards more reinforced stimuli is an important finding as it may contribute to reduced subjective wellbeing and could negatively impact treatment success, as seen in depression (Vrieze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the groups were very similar in terms of other illicit drug use, age, gender and educational achievement, they did differ significantly in depression levels and tobacco use. This is not surprising, given that depression and tobacco use are positively associated with cannabis dependence (Hindocha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015b</xref>). We found that when these factors were included as covariates, the effects of group and block were lost. Given this result and the strong relationship between depression and reward responsiveness on the PRT (Pizzagalli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2008</xref>), as well as emerging evidence that tobacco use and nicotine withdrawal affect task behaviour (Janes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Liverant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>; Pergadia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>), drawing any conclusions about specific relationships between cannabis use, tobacco use, depression and reward learning is difficult. However, just because the effect of group was lost when depression and cigarette smoking were included as covariates, this does not mean that cannabis dependence is not associated with reduced reward learning. As a relatively large amount of variance was shared between group and tobacco use (approximately 30&#x000a0;%) and depression (approximately 20&#x000a0;%), covarying for these variables is not statistically optimal and may be considered inappropriate (Miller and Chapman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>). Future case-control studies should therefore aim to match groups on depression and cigarette smoking.</p><p>It is also important to note that we did not include a healthy, non-drug-using control group in this study. Cannabis-dependent individuals may well have impaired effort-related decision-making and reward learning relative to this alternative group. Indeed, the drug-using controls in study 2 may even have some reward-processing deficits relative to healthy controls. However, our choice of control group provided the most conservative test for reward-processing deficits attributable to chronic cannabis use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Study 1 was a placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment and so provides strong evidence for cannabis <italic>causing</italic> transient amotivation. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first time this has been shown in an adequately powered study (they are consistent with a previous study (Cherek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>) with a sample size of five). Furthermore, the investigation of CBD was highly novel. We found preliminary evidence that it can moderate the effects of THC on effort-related decision-making. The drug administration protocol was effective as stoned ratings were similar immediately after the first and second doses. Although cannabis-dependent participants were more depressed and smoked more cigarettes than drug-using controls in study 2, they were well matched on all other demographic variables, including other drug use, which is a key strength.</p><p>One important limitation of both studies was that there were positive drug urine test results for various participants, and residual drug effects could have affected task performance. Furthermore, the criteria for inclusion in the cannabis dependent group could have been improved by carrying out interviews to assess DSM cannabis dependence/use disorder. Although all cannabis-dependent participants smoked skunk on &#x02265;50&#x000a0;% times they smoked cannabis, we did not actually assess preference of cannabis type in the cannabis-dependent group and so we may have missed out on reward-processing differences between skunk-preferring and hash-preferring participants.</p><p>While these two studies have addressed the acute effects of cannabis on and association of cannabis dependence with reward processing, we only employed one type of reward. Money, as a secondary reward, activates somewhat different brain regions compared with primary rewards (Sescousse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>) and may also be considered a way of buying drugs, rather than being seen as a reward in itself. Future studies should investigate reward processing of a variety of rewards, including cannabis itself, so that comparisons between drug and non-drug reward processing can be made (Lawn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). Moreover, although urinalysis was conducted in both experiments, we were not able to relate task performance to quantitative indices of cannabinoid metabolites, which could have improved our ability to infer acute and chronic effects of THC and CBD (Morgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). Finally, study 2 could obviously have been improved if depression and cigarette smoking were not different between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, cannabis without CBD led to an overall reduction in motivation as evidenced by a lower likelihood of making a high-effort choice to earn monetary reward. Cannabis with CBD did not appear to reduce this effect but did moderate THC&#x02019;s effects on expected value to some extent. Cannabis dependence was associated with preserved motivation and impaired reward learning. However, given the observational nature of the data and the confounding group differences, it is difficult to ascertain what caused the impaired reward learning. In summary, these results support a transient amotivational syndrome caused by acute cannabis administration but do not support a chronic amotivational syndrome associated with cannabis dependence. Future research should employ large, longitudinal designs to better probe reward processing impairments in long-term cannabis users.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec43"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="213_2016_4383_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 35.3 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>As 17 is not divisible by 3, the Latin square was not completed with equal numbers of participants in each treatment order.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p>Data was missing for one participant for BDI, TEPS and drug history</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p>One participant missed a rating at time 3 on the Cann + CBD session; this was imputed from the group mean.</p></fn><fn id="Fn4"><label>4</label><p>We excluded one participant for failing to complete 13 and 14 trials on two of his sessions, thus he clearly did not complete the task as instructed.</p></fn><fn id="Fn5"><label>5</label><p>We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.</p></fn><fn id="Fn6"><label>6</label><p>One control&#x02019;s BDI score was missing so it was imputed from the group mean</p></fn><fn id="Fn7"><label>7</label><p>One control&#x02019;s urine test results were missing</p></fn><fn id="Fn8"><label>8</label><p>One cannabis-dependent participant was excluded because they failed to complete 16 trials.</p></fn><fn id="Fn9"><label>9</label><p>Eleven out of 40 participants were excluded due to not meeting task criteria, 5 were drug-using controls and 6 were cannabis-dependent participants.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p>The study was approved by the UCL ethics committee, all participants provided written informed consent and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec id="FPar6"><title>Funding</title><p>Study 1 was funded by Drug Science.
