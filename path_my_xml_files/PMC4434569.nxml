The aim of the study is to outline the study protocol of a trial to test the efficacy of a mobile coach based intervention for the prevention of childhood drowning.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>A two-arm cluster randomized community trial will be conducted to test the efficacy of the mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning on parents with children below five years of age and compared to an assessment only control group. A total of 1680 parents in the villages with children aged below five years of age will participate. The village will be used as a randomized unit, randomly assigned to an intervention group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;840) receiving the mobile coach based intervention or an assessment only control group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;840). An individualized mobile coach intervention based on the demographic data and the individual will be developed, and SMSs, audio messages, videos and images about childhood drowning will be sent to the participants of the intervention group over a period of six months. The participants will receive per week one text message (SMS) and image and one video and audio text per month. The primary outcome measure will be increased knowledge and safety awareness, and behaviour practice about childhood drowning assessed at the six-month follow-up, and the secondary outcome measure will be the reduced incidence of childhood drowning in Bangladesh. The study assistants conducting the baseline and the follow-up assessments will be blinded regarding the group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study testing a fully mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning prevention in Bangladesh.

Drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury worldwide, and constitutes 7&#x000a0;% of all injury related deaths globally. There are an estimated 388,800 annual drowning deaths worldwide. Among children, drowning accounts for a higher mortality rate than any other, and, unfortunately, the drowning rate in Asia is 20 times higher than in developed countries. The parent&#x02019;s socio-economic status and lack of education, infants left unsupervised, access to water, and children under 5&#x000a0;years of age, especially males, are the factors that represent the greatest risk from drowning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Drowning is the single leading cause of death after infancy, 50&#x000a0;% of drowning occurs between the ages of 0 to 4&#x000a0;years, 60&#x000a0;% happens between 9&#x000a0;a.m. and 1&#x000a0;p.m., 80&#x000a0;% occurs in ponds, ditches, buckets and drums, 80&#x000a0;% happens within 20 m of the child&#x02019;s home, and children from large families are twice as vulnerable to drowning than those from small families. In Bangladesh, a child drowns every half hour, with a total of 50 per day and 18,225 during the course of a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Bangladesh is a largely rural low-income country with most households located near bodies of water. Many children do not know how to swim and families are large, leading to decreased adult supervision. These factors combine to make drowning the leading cause of child death after infancy. The drowning mortality rate is 28.6 deaths per 100,000 child-years in Bangladesh, which is 22 times greater than in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The drowning of rural children aged 1&#x02013;4 years in Bangladesh was found to be 156.4 per 100,000 (95&#x000a0;% CI 138.5 - 176.6 per 100,000) with boys numbering 175.5 and girls 135.8. The proportional mortality from children drowning in respect of the overall child mortality was about 28&#x000a0;%. Ponds, ditches, buckets and drums were the most frequent places of drowning, and over 40&#x000a0;% occurred in ponds. The risk factors include the sex of the identified child, mother&#x02019;s age and literacy, family income and ownership of agricultural land by the families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The incidence of drowning among children aged 1 &#x02013; 4&#x000a0;years old was 157 per 100,000 children-years. The highest rate was 328.1 per 100,000 (95&#x000a0;% CI 254.8 &#x02013; 421.7) among 1&#x000a0;year old male children. The risk factors include mothers&#x02019; age, literacy and family income. Male children from poor families were at great risk of drowning in rural Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>What are the risks?</title><p>Drowning happens in many different ways, and needs a range of prevention strategies to target the biggest risks. The main risk factors are: Lack of physical barriers between people and water, particularly close to home, Lack of supervision of young children, Uncovered or unprotected water supplies and lack of safe water crossings, Lack of water safety awareness and risky behaviour around water, such as swimming alone, Travelling on water, especially on overcrowded or poorly maintained vessels, Flood disasters, whether from extreme rainfall, storm surges, tsunamis or cyclones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Governmental goals in Bangladesh</title><p>Today, injury is the biggest killer of Bangladeshi children between 1&#x02013;18 years, and the greatest danger is from drowning. The remarkable progress made in the reduction of child mortality from infectious diseases in Bangladesh during the last two decades has meant that injuries are now emerging as a greater threat to child survival. Although the rate of drowning has remained stable since the 1980s, drowning as a proportion of all deaths in children aged 1&#x02013;4 increased from 9&#x000a0;% in 1983 to 59&#x000a0;% in 2003. Bangladesh Target: To reduce deaths of children under five by two-thirds by 2015; that is, reduce the under-five mortality rate to 48 deaths per 1000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>How can the threat of drowning be reduced?</title><p>Drowning can be prevented through targeted prevention strategies, improved community infrastructure (water supply, bridges, levees, etc.), public awareness, appropriate policies and legislation, and research that refines what is seen as best practice and that identifies new drowning prevention measures. Such measures include: Reduced exposure to water hazards through the strategic use of barriers, Comprehensive boating regulations and enforcement, Close and capable adult supervision for young children, Signage and designation of hazardous water bodies, Improved swimming and water safety skills, Timely rescues and resuscitation by a trained bystander or lifesaver through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compression when needed, Requirements for use of personal flotation devices and Supervision of recreational swimming areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study is a trial to test the efficacy of a <italic>MOBILE COACH</italic> based intervention for the prevention of childhood drowning in Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Research objectives</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Main objective</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02756; To develop and implement effective mobile coach intervention on childhood drowning prevention among parents with children&#x02019;s age below five years in rural areas in Bangladesh</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Specific objectives</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02756; To determine the differential between the ages and gender of the children in respect of knowledge, awareness, practice and child drowning.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To develop and assess the initial response of a community to an intervention package in terms of acceptability, feasibility and sustainability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To determine the social-demographic factors (educational level of parents, occupation of parents, social-economic status of parents and medical condition), environmental factors (places of residence, time of day, time of season, distance from the house, place of drowning, safety equipment, presence of lifeguard, activity immediately before drowning and mothers activity) and behavioural factors (supervision practices of parents and swimming ability of parents and child) through pre-test and post-test on knowledge, awareness, practice and child drowning.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To understand the perception of the community concerning the problem of drowning and its possible implications for designing a preventive programme for the rural areas of Bangladesh.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To identify the association between the knowledge, awareness and practice of child drowning with social-demographic variables, environmental variables and behavioural factors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To evaluate the mobile coach for its effectiveness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02756; To determine the risk factors based on social-demographic, environmental and behavioural factors in respect of childhood drowning, knowledge, awareness and practice pertaining to child drowning.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method/design</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Design and main hypothesis</title><p>A two-arm cluster randomised community trial will be conducted to test the efficacy of the mobile coach based intervention for the prevention of childhood drowning among parents with children aged below five years compared to an assessment only control group. In respect of the childhood drowning knowledge, awareness and practice, SMSs, videos, audio messages and images will be sent to participants based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh Government and Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh. The mobile coach will be sent to the participants over a period of six months and data will be gathered at baseline, with a weekly SMS and images, and monthly videos and audio assessment. The main hypothesis is that the integrated intervention will be a more effective and inexpensive way to prevent childhood drowning among children aged below five years, and also increases the parent&#x02019;s awareness of their children in respect of drowning. At the six-month follow-up, the primary outcome will be the per monthly increase in knowledge, safety awareness and behavioural practice in respect of childhood drowning prevention of the intervention group compared to those in the assessment only control group. The secondary outcome measures will be reducing the incidence of childhood drowning to compare the baseline and end line assessment with the self-efficacy for childhood drowning prevention, and also to determine the risk factors for childhood drowning.

Parents with children aged below five years will be collected from selected rural areas in the Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. College teachers from approximately 15 village schools will be invited to participate with other individuals from their village in a study to test the efficacy of the mobile coach based childhood drowning programme. The participating teachers will schedule one village per hour for screening the eligibility criteria, study information and baseline assessment. The study participants will be recruited by study assistants (graduate students).</p><p>The study assistants will invite all the participants from a village to participate in the survey. Furthermore, they will inform other individuals who will be invited to participate in a study to test the efficacy of mobile coach intervention for the prevention of drowning. To decrease the reporting bias, the study assistants will not provide additional information about the purpose of the study before the screening of the eligibility criteria is completed. Afterwards, the participants will be invited to complete the screening. The screening includes the assessment of demographic, environmental, behavioural data, knowledge and awareness about childhood drowning, and ownership of a mobile phone. The inclusion criteria for the study participation are (1) parents who have less than five children, children living with parents, children aged 0&#x02013;4 and must have a mobile phone in the house. The exclusion criteria are (1) parents who are not available at the time of data collection (after checking the house three times) and children with a physical disability (inability to walk). Subsequently, eligible persons will be informed about the aim of the study, the intervention aims, assessments and data protection. The study information will be provided in paper form by the study assistants.

Written informed consent will be obtained from all respondents before collecting data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>To avoid spillover effects within the villages, we will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial using the village as the randomisation unit. Due to the heterogeneity of participants in various disciplines (e.g. gender or educational level), we will use separate randomisation lists for each village (stratified randomisation). Furthermore, for approximate equality of sample size in the study groups, we will use computer generated block randomisation. The study assistants supervising the baseline assessment in the villages will be blinded concerning the group allocation of the village. In addition, group allocation will not be released to the study participants until they provide informed consent, their username, mobile phone number and baseline data. Furthermore, the study assistants conducting the face-to-face interviews at follow up will be blinded when assessing the primary and secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study settings and population</title><p>Rural Bangladesh is almost demographically and geographically homogeneous.

To determine the knowledge pertaining to childhood drowning, five questions about the knowledge of childhood drowning are provided. The questions will be answered YES or NO. A correct answer will score one mark and a zero mark will be given for an incorrect answer. The participants will be classified as having knowledge of drowning if they correctly answer all five questions. Based on those five questions, the total summated score will be calculated. Five questions will be used to measure the awareness about childhood drowning. Based on the five questions, the total summated score will be calculated. The behaviour practices will be divided into supervision practices and swimming ability. In addition, five questions will be used to measure the behaviour practices. Based on the five questions, the total score will be calculated. The study assistants will conduct the six-month follow up assessment by field interviews. The primary outcome will be the monthly assessment of increased knowledge, and safety awareness and practice about childhood drowning. The secondary outcome will be the assessment of reducing the incidence of children drowning to compare the baseline data and end line data, and also to determine the risk factors for childhood drowning. Finally, the outcome variables will be the effects of the mobile coach Intervention on the community in Bangladesh.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study protocol is to determine the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial testing concerning the efficacy of mobile coach intervention to increase the knowledge and safety awareness, and practice about childhood drowning among the parents with children, and reduce the incidence of childhood injuries. This is the first controlled trial testing of the efficacy of mobile coach based childhood drowning intervention in a population consisting mainly of parents with children. Due to the realization of participant recruitment, it is also the first trial to test the efficacy of mobile coach based intervention in parents with children in terms of increasing their understanding pertaining to the risks of childhood drowning. Among the limitations of the study is that the majority of drowning cases go unrecorded, due to a lack of adequate survey data in hospitals and clinics, information bias and dependence on other data sources, such as police data and post-mortem data. Given that the mobile coach intervention is effective, it would provide an attractive, cost-effective model to increase the knowledge and awareness about childhood drowning and reduce childhood drowning in rural Bangladesh. The programme could be easily disseminated nationwide or via national prevention campaigns or internationally to other middle/low-income countries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MMH is responsible for the study design, mobile coach intervention and data collection.
