Still it receives relatively little attention from researchers trying to establish best interventions to treat it. With high prevalence of stressful life events, which might be leading to adjustment disorder, and limited resources of mental health service providers, online interventions could be a very practical way of helping people who have these disorders or are in the risk to develop them. The proposed study protocol is aimed to describe a randomized controlled trial of an internet-based modular intervention for adjustment disorder as it is defined in a proposal for the ICD-11.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a two-armed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of a web-based intervention BADI (Brief Adjustment Disorder Intervention) for adjustment disorder symptoms. BADI has four modules: Relaxation, Time management, Mindfulness and Strengthening relationships. It is based on stress and coping research and integrates evidence-based treatment approaches such as Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness and body-mind practices, as well as exercises for enhancing social support. Primary outcome of the study are symptoms of adjustment disorder and well-being. Engagement into the program and motivation for change is a secondary outcome. All participants after completing the baseline assessment are randomly assigned to one of the two groups: either to the one in which participant will instantly gain access to the BADI intervention or a group in which participants will be given access to the BADI program after waiting one month. Participants of BADI can choose exercises of the program flexibly. There is no particular order in which the exercises should be completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Study will provide new insights of modular internet-based interventions efficacy for adjustment disorders. The study will also provide information about the role of motivation and expectancies on engagement in modular internet-based interventions. In case this RCT supports effectiveness of fully automated version of BADI, it could be used very broadly. It could become a cost-effective and accessible intervention for adjustment disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The study was retrospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with the registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370832">ACTRN12616000883415</ext-link>.

Despite that, it has been considered a poorly defined area of psychopathology, therefore conceptual changes were proposed both for DSM-5 and ICD-11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In DSM-5 adjustment disorders have been classified under trauma and stress related disorders for the first time. However, some scholars argue that they still remain rather loosely defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Proposals for ICD-11 conceptualize adjustment disorder as a maladaptive reaction to identifiable stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Intrusive preoccupations with the stressor, avoidance and failure to adapt should separate this disorder from normal reactions and no requirements for severity of the stressor should distinguish it from PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>This new conception of adjustment disorder, that was proposed for ICD-11, was employed in a representative national wide survey of general population in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Results of the study indicated 0.9&#x000a0;% prevalence of adjustment disorder fulfilling clinically significant impairment criterion, and 1.4&#x000a0;% without fulfilling this criterion. This study also established life events that were most frequently associated with adjustment disorder: serious illness, conflict with neighbours and job-related conflict. The proposed new structure of the adjustment disorder was also recently validated in a Lithuanian representative population sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study supported the two core symptom adjustment disorder structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Interventions for Adjustment disorder</title><p>In addition to vagueness of definitions, adjustment disorder received relatively little attention from researchers trying to establish best interventions to treat it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As evidence for the benefits of pharmacological treatment is extremely limited, psychotherapeutic interventions are considered as treatment of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among specific psychotherapeutic approaches the following were tried without clear consensus which are the most effective: supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive, psychodynamic, Interpersonal, ego-enhancing, problem-solving, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, support groups, &#x0201c;mirror psychotherapy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;activating intervention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>E-health advantages in treating adjustment disorder</title><p>Having in mind high prevalence of stressful life events, which might be leading to adjustment disorder, and limited resources of mental health service providers, online interventions could be a very practical way of helping people who have these disorders or are in the risk of developing them. Especially if these interventions could be provided automatically, thus requiring little human resources.</p><p>Studies of another more severe stress related disorder &#x02013; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) &#x02013; show that stigmatization of help, practical issues such as incompatible time, transportation problems, financial problems, lack of professional services in residential area, negative prejudice about the effectiveness and availability of help are among those barriers that prevent people from getting help they really need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Internet-based interventions might be a good way to remove at least some of these obstacles for treatment.</p><p>A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of internet-based psychotherapeutic interventions for various conditions showed that these interventions could be as effective as face to face therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A more recent meta-analysis of telehealth treatments supported the use of telehealth treatments specifically for individuals with PTSD-related symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To our knowledge there are only two telehealth interventions developed specifically for adjustment disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Both interventions have not been evaluated in large-scale empirical studies yet.</p><p>We have developed a web-based intervention BADI (Brief Adjustment Disorder Intervention) to help people to deal with adjustment disorder symptoms after stressful life events. This paper reports on the protocol of a RCT examining the effectiveness of this intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>There are two aims of this RCT: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an internet-based modular intervention for adjustment disorder (BADI); 2) to examine correlations between effectiveness, motivation, expectations, drop-out and adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/design</title><p>BADI is an open access internet-based modular intervention for adjustment disorders registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with the registration number ACTRN12616000883415.

Randomization is conducted by study team member using an online true random number service <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/">www.random.org</ext-link>.

Level of adjustment disorder symptom severity is evaluated with Adjustment disorder new model (ADNM-20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] questionnaire. This questionnaire is constructed of a stressors list and evaluation of symptoms. The list is composed of seven of acute events (e.g. divorce, moving) and nine chronic stressors (e.g. conflict with neighbours, serious illness). Participants are instructed to indicate all severe events from the list that they had experienced in the last 2&#x000a0;years and that caused significant level of stress. There is also a blank item for participants to fill in other significant stressors. Psychometric properties of the Lithuanian version of the ADNM-20 questionnaire are acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is a short self-report measure for well- being assessment. Participants are asked to rate how each of the 5 statements applies to them when considering the last 2&#x000a0;weeks. Each item is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score therefore ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (highest well-being). Participants who score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;16 on ADNM and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50 on WHO-5 are included into the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes are motivation to use the program, expectations for the intervention and engagement into the program. These outcomes are measured with tools incorporated into the program and self-report questionnaires at assessment time points.</p><p>Motivation is measured by a three item questionnaire created by the authors of this study. Expectations are measured as the difference of two 10-point Likert scale questions: 1) <italic>How do you feel today before starting the intervention BADI?</italic> 2) <italic>How do expect to feel after using the intervention BADI for one month?</italic> Participants are also asked to indicate how often they are planning to use the intervention in the upcoming month and the reasons for choosing this intervention.

First internet-based interventions for adjustment disorders were developed only recently and have not been evaluated in large scale empirical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we have developed BADI &#x02013; a modular internet-based intervention for adjustment disorders. Users of this intervention do not have to complete all four modules (twelve exercises) in order to improve their condition. Rather they can test and choose modules and exercises which they like most and find useful. This is different from the linear approach, where users have to complete certain steps before they can progress to others.</p><p>We believe that a modular approach to internet-based intervention for adjustment disorders has several important benefits. Adjustment disorders can be caused by very different stressors therefore interventions should also reflect this variety, if they are targeting at the general population. Availability of different modules also means that users can choose according to their needs and preferences. And finally a modular approach provides flexibility for users &#x02013; they can use the intervention whenever they need it and spend as much time as they feel appropriate. Thus it gives participants a sense of control, something that is important when facing stressful life events that may seem out of control.</p><p>BADI consists of 4 modules: Relaxation, Time management, Mindfulness and Strengthening relationships. It is based on stress and coping research and integrates evidence based modern treatment approaches such as Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness and body-mind practices, as well as exercises for enhancing social support. In this respect it differs from eHealth intervention developed by Maercker team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], where PTSD treatment techniques such as written narrative exposition are also included.</p><p>In addition to evaluating effectiveness of BADI intervention, it will also examine correlations between effectiveness, motivation, expectations, drop-out and adherence. We believe that is important to look for new ways how to understand and measure drop-outs and adherence in the context of fully automated internet-based interventions as they are very different from traditional face-to-face interventions.</p><p>In case this RCT supports effectiveness of a fully automated version of BADI, it could be used very broadly.
