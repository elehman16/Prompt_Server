Pathologically, AD is defined by the presence in the brain of extracellular neuritic plaques containing aggregated amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) peptide and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau proteins.</p><p>The &#x0201c;amyloid cascade hypothesis&#x0201d; proposes that the accumulation of A&#x003b2;, resulting from an imbalance between A&#x003b2; production and clearance in the brain, is the main driver of AD pathogenesis <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A&#x003b2;, a peptide generated by sequential enzymatic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), exists in several isoforms, including A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42. These monomeric peptides have a tendency to aggregate into higher molecular weight oligomers, which may transit into insoluble fibrils that deposit in the brain as amyloid plaques <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The deposition of A&#x003b2; plaques occurs long before any clinical symptoms and as many as 20&#x000a0;years before the onset of dementia <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Evidence suggests that both soluble oligomers and amyloid plaques are neurotoxic <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and clearance of amyloid plaques can lead to normalization of calcium homeostasis, neuronal activity, and reduction of oxidative stress in the brain of an animal model of AD <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Currently approved therapies for AD provide only modest symptomatic benefit and do not attenuate the course of the disease (are not disease modifying). The screening of libraries of human memory B&#x000a0;cells for reactivity against aggregated A&#x003b2; led to the molecular cloning, sequencing, and recombinant expression of aducanumab (BIIB037), a human anti-A&#x003b2; monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of A&#x003b2;, including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. Preclinical studies in Tg2576 mice showed brain penetration and target engagement of aducanumab, leading to a reduction of brain amyloid burden <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01397539" id="intref0025">NCT01397539</ext-link>) were to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aducanumab after single ascending-dose administration in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. This was the first study of aducanumab in humans.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-dose-escalation, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 multicenter study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0030">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01397539" id="intref0035">NCT01397539</ext-link>). Eligibility criteria included: age 55 to 85&#x000a0;years; and a clinical diagnosis consistent with (1) probable AD according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and (2) dementia of Alzheimer's type according to <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#x02013;Text Revision</italic> criteria <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14&#x02013;26.</p><p>Patients were scheduled to be enrolled into seven sequential cohorts of eight patients each randomized 6:2 to receive aducanumab (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, and 60&#x000a0;mg/kg) or matching placebo. For the last cohort, a ratio of <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers to noncarriers of at least 1:1 was planned but was not achieved due to early termination of that cohort after five patients had been enrolled (three for 60&#x000a0;mg/kg and two for placebo). Patients received a single dose, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion after dilution into saline, on day 1 at the study clinic. Randomization was performed by a centralized Interactive Voice and Web Response System. A dose of 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg was predicted to provide a mean aducanumab exposure (area under the serum concentration&#x02014;time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time [AUC<sub>inf</sub>]) in humans of up to approximately 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02022;h/mL. This predicted human exposure calculation assumed human clearance of approximately 7&#x000a0;mL/day/kg (based on allometric scaling and considering human clearance values reported for similar compounds). A dose of 60&#x000a0;mg/kg was predicted to provide a mean exposure that would not exceed the mean exposure in Tg2576 mice given 500&#x000a0;mg/kg (402,000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02022;h/mL). Tg2576 mice are a commercially available animal model of AD that, with aging, accumulate amyloid in the central nervous system and are considered the most relevant pharmacologic species to evaluate the toxicity profile of aducanumab. Before escalation to the next dose level, the Data Safety Review Committee reviewed unblinded safety data for all patients in the current cohort through 21&#x000a0;days after dosing and before escalation to the highest dose for all patients from all previous cohorts through 11&#x000a0;weeks after dosing. Patients were followed-up for 24&#x000a0;weeks after dosing.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of a range of aducanumab doses administered as single IV infusions in patients with AD. Secondary objectives were to assess the PK and to evaluate the immunogenicity of aducanumab after single-dose administration. Exploratory objectives were to assess the effects of&#x000a0;aducanumab on potential plasma biomarkers and on cognition.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and ethics committee approval was obtained at each participating site. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study assessments</title><p>Vital signs, physical and neurologic examinations, clinical chemistry and hematology, and urinalysis were assessed during inpatient observation and at eight follow-up visits on days 3 and 4 and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and 24 after dosing. Electrocardiograms (12-lead paper ECGs) were performed during inpatient observation and at weeks 1 and 24 after dosing. Continuous cardiac monitoring using Holter monitoring was performed during the study treatment infusion and for 12&#x000a0;hours after the end of the infusion. ECGs were read by the investigator and reported as normal, abnormal-no adverse event (AE), or abnormal-AE. All AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were monitored and recorded continuously throughout the study.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (including T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and gradient echo) taken at screening and at weeks 3, 11, and 24 were evaluated by each site's local radiologist and by a central reader (Bioclinica Inc.), who performed blinded assessment of all MRIs for ARIA-edema/effusion (ARIA-E) and/or ARIA-microhemorrhage/hemosiderosis (ARIA-H). Radiographic evidence of ARIA-E was followed with serial MRI until resolution. Radiographic evidence of incident hemorrhage(s) was followed-up with MRI within approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks of observation to assess stability.</p><p>Samples were collected at pre-infusion, &#x02264;10&#x000a0;minutes, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;hours, and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and 24 after dosing, with periodic biomarker sampling. A validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#x000a0;(ELISA) was used to quantify concentrations of aducanumab in serum. Microtiter plates were coated with anti-idiotype aducanumab antibody, followed by blocking, washing, and incubation with 1/100 diluted calibrators, controls, and samples. A horseradish-peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated anti-human IgG and tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate were used to detect bound aducanumab. The standard curve range was 0.2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for aducanumab in human serum. Samples measuring above 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL were reanalyzed at an appropriate dilution. Sample results below 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL were reported as below the limit of quantitation.</p><p>Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were measured in serum using a screening assay based on a bridging solution ELISA format. Samples (including positive and negative controls) were diluted 1:100 with phosphate-buffered saline/Casein containing an equimolar mixture of biotin-aducanumab and digoxigenin (DIG)-aducanumab and incubated overnight at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C. The bridging complexes formed of ADA, biotin-aducanumab, and DIG-aducanumab molecules were captured on a streptavidin-coated Nunc plate and detected using anti-DIG&#x02013;HRP conjugate and TMB substrate. Enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid. Absorbance read at 450&#x000a0;nm was proportional to the amount of ADA. A sample was considered positive when: average (sample signal)&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;screening assay cut point (1.16 &#x000d7; mean negative control signal).</p><p>Samples that tested positive in the screening assay were further evaluated in a confirmatory assay using excess unlabeled aducanumab in a competitive binding format to demonstrate the specificity of the binding interactions in the antibody and/or labeled drug complex. Briefly, serum samples were incubated overnight with either labeled drugs alone or labeled drugs with excess unlabeled aducanumab (final concentration 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) added. After the overnight step, the remainder of the assay procedure was the same as for the screening assay. Percentage inhibition of signal by the excess unlabeled drug should be &#x02265;&#x000a0;confirmatory cut point to confirm the sample as a true positive. The titer was also assessed for confirmed positive samples using the screening assay as the reciprocal of the lowest sample dilution, where: average (sample signal)&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;titration assay cut point (1.16 &#x000d7; mean negative control signal).</p><p>A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 were measured in plasma using the qualified MULTI-SPOT Human/Rodent (4G8) Abeta Triplex Ultra-Sensitive Assay (Meso Scale Discovery) per manufacturer's protocol.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (13 items; ADAS-Cog 13) was administered at day 1 and at weeks 3 and&#x000a0;24.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For all analyses, all patients assigned to placebo were treated as a single group.

The study was conducted in patients with mild-to-moderate AD to enable characterization of the initial safety, tolerability, and PK of single escalating-doses of aducanumab. Aducanumab demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability, and linear PK at single doses up to 30&#x000a0;mg/kg&#x02014;the maximum tolerated dose. The only SAEs were symptomatic ARIA-E, which developed in all 3 patients who received the highest dose of 60&#x000a0;mg/kg; follow-up MRIs showed that these events completely resolved. One of these 3 patients was an&#x000a0;<italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carrier. Interim results from the 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a phase 1b multiple-dose study of aducanumab in patients with prodromal or mild AD have also reported dose-dependent ARIA as the main safety and tolerability finding and showed dose- and time-dependent reductions in A&#x003b2; plaque with aducanumab <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>It is well recognized that treatment with some amyloid-targeting drug candidates, including the monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and gantenerumab, are associated with incident cases of ARIA <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These rates of ARIA, however, may be under-represented in small single-dose studies which may have variable <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 status distribution between dose cohorts. These abnormalities can include ARIA-E and ARIA-H and are readily detectable by standard MRI sequences (fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]/T2 for ARIA-E and T2*/gradient echo for ARIA-H) <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the single ascending-dose study of bapineuzumab, ARIA were observed in 3 of 10 patients who received 5&#x000a0;mg/kg bapineuzumab, with no cases in the 0.5- and 1.5-mg/kg groups, and all resolved over time <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Retrospective analysis of data from three phase 2 studies and the results of two phase 3 studies of bapineuzumab showed that ARIA-E incidence increased with dose and <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 copy number and most cases were identified after the first or second dose <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In our study, ARIAs were only observed in the 60-mg/kg dose group. Further studies should stratify/enroll patients based on <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 status to ensure that the clinical trial population reflects the AD population.</p><p>There were no treatment-induced immunogenicity responses against aducanumab. All 4 ADA-positive patients had pre-existing ADA activity that remained relatively constant throughout the study. It is not known at this time if this pre-existing activity was caused by anti-aducanumab antibodies or some other matrix components. For example, labeled drug in the ADA assay could potentially be bridged by some A&#x003b2; peptide aggregates in circulation that are recognized by aducanumab. There was no apparent impact of anti-drug activity on PK or safety.</p><p>Mean AUC<sub>inf</sub> in this study was between approximately 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02022;h/mL at 0.3 mg/kg aducanumab (as predicted, see Methods) and 279,000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02022;h/mL at 60&#x000a0;mg/kg. The mean exposure at 60&#x000a0;mg/kg did not exceed the mean exposure in APP Tg2576 transgenic mice given 500&#x000a0;mg/kg (402,000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02022;h/mL). Aducanumab C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> increased in a dose-proportional manner between 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg and 60&#x000a0;mg/kg. T<sub>max</sub> was comparable between the dose groups. Increasing doses of aducanumab did not alter its clearance, t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>, or volume of distribution.</p><p>Exploratory objectives of this study were to assess the effects of aducanumab on potential plasma biomarkers and on cognition. Systemic administration of antibodies that bind to soluble A&#x003b2; typically leads to an increase in plasma A&#x003b2; concentrations due to stabilization of the peptide in circulation <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although there was an increase in plasma levels of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 at 60&#x000a0;mg/kg, aducanumab did not appear to significantly affect plasma levels of A&#x003b2;40 or A&#x003b2;42 at the lower doses (0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg to 30&#x000a0;mg/kg). The largely unaffected soluble A&#x003b2; levels are consistent with the very low affinity of aducanumab for soluble monomeric A&#x003b2;. At 60&#x000a0;mg/kg, both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 also demonstrated higher baseline/pre-dose values and higher patient variability than the lower dose cohort patients, thus complicating the interpretation. No dose-dependent response was observed for change in mean ADAS-Cog 13 scores after single-dose administration of aducanumab.</p><p>The limitations of the present study include the small sample size of the cohorts and the use of a sequential, dose-escalation design rather than a parallel-arm design. Thus, the analysis using a pooled placebo group does not align the randomization in the study design.</p><p>In summary, a single dose of aducanumab up to 30&#x000a0;mg/kg was well tolerated and the PK well behaved. Dose-limiting transient ARIAs were observed in the 60-mg/kg dose group, resulting in termination of further dosing in that cohort. Increasing doses of aducanumab (0.3&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg/kg) did not alter its overall clearance indicating linear PK. No unexpected safety concerns associated with the use of aducanumab in patients with mild-to-moderate AD were observed.
