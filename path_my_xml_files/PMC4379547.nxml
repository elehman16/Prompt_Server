On the other hand, exogenous pulmonary surfactant (PS) therapy has been shown to substantially improve outcomes of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recognizing the merits of surfactant, especially when given early, some clinicians choose to intubate infants on CPAP solely for the purpose of giving PS, followed by immediate extubation. However, approximately 10% of those intubated solely for surfactant administration could not be extubated within 1&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, intubation of the trachea with an endotracheal tube is an invasive procedure and may not be without risk.</p><p>Less invasive methods of delivering PS have been pursued. In 1992, Verder firstly described the use of a thin diameter catheter to apply surfactant to premature infants with emerging RDS on CPAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the observation study had not been paid much attention, until Kribs and colleagues used a similar method, which was called less invasive surfactant administration again in clinical observations (LISA), in Cologne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The technique rapidly spread in Germany. Although no improved effects on long-term outcome have so far been demonstrated, these methods have shown promise in terms of achieving a clinical response without passing an endotracheal tube or using mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In previous studies, sedation and/or analgesia and/or atropine, to reduce secretions, may be given prior to the procedure. However, medication may interfere both with cardiovascular function (blood pressure) and respiratory effort.</p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and the feasibility of LISA technique without medication and to compare the effects with the conventional management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population</title><p>The study was conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of the Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Zhejiang University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2012.

The diagnosis was confirmed radiologically by reduced lung volumes, a reticulogranular pattern of lung consolidation, and air bronchograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

More and more preterm infants with respiratory distress are now treated with nCPAP soon after birth. The issue that intubation is solely required for the purpose of surfactant administration has risen. The operation of LISA aims at reducing the failure rate of nCPAP and minimizing intubation injury. However, LISA is not the &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; solution for surfactant therapy in premature infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The optimal gestational age and risk factors for failure of LISA are still not determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we show that LISA can be successfully applied to 28&#x02013;32 gestational age infants with RDS who are receiving nCPAP, with no significant procedural complications. Moreover, the technique of LISA was relatively easy to learn: Given the initial lack of experience with LISA, there were a relatively low proportion of cases requiring a second catheterization attempts (2 out of the first 10 infants). We speculate that a narrow bore designed catheter, instead of conventional endotracheal tube was the main reason for the ease, because an external diameter about 1&#x000a0;mm of the catheter could be passed down and easily through the vocal cords. In our experience, the most difficulty of the method was how to perform direct laryngoscopy and expose the vocal cords on the infant with RDS on NCPAP. In the pilot trial, one baby was intolerant to LISA: the infant became and remained apneic while the catheter was intratracheal. This complication is rarely described in the literature. Two issues need to be discussed. One is the issue of sedation. The rate of sedation before the operation of LISA varied from about 0 in the study of Kanmaz, H. G et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to 26% in AMV study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or more in other study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although there was no consensus that sedation should be use before the operation of LISA, use of sedation may be a good choice. Further study of LISA may be focused on the issue of premedication. The other is the result of excessive individual sensitivity to airway manipulation, which was probably the cause of apnea in our infants. Thus, we infer that LISA may not be suitable for all premature infants.</p><p>In our study, we explored not only the respiratory indices pre-and post-surfactant administration, but also the change of FiO2 and SpO2 every 30&#x000a0;seconds during the procedure of surfactant administration by LISA, which were seldom reported in the previous papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We found an immediate and similar final physiological benefit, with a rapid and sustained reduction in FiO2 after surfactant administration by both LISA and conventional management. Although, it took longer (mean 3.2&#x000a0;min) to complete the whole LISA procedure, and more surfactant reflux was observed during LISA procedure.</p><p>Our results on the clinical benefits of LISA was slightly different from previous studies of minimally invasive PS instillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the pilot study, we only found that LISA had benefit in reducing the duration of both ventilation and nCPAP, instead of reducing the rate of ventilation during the first 72&#x000a0;hours. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we found that LISA had no benefit on reducing incidence of BPD. We speculate that this discrepancy could be explained by the difference in our patient demographics: infants who received PS in our study were an average of 29&#x000a0;weeks GA in our study. Our future studies will focus on the infants with less gestational age (24&#x02013;28 weeks), who are more likely to receive mechanical ventilation and require oxygen for a longer time.</p><p>Fluctuations in oxygen saturation have been associated with certain neonatal diseases, including BPD, IVH and ROP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We found conventional PS administration, especially with bag-mask ventilation, when compared with LISA was more likely to result in oxygen saturations greater than 95%, and infants would experience brief periods of desaturation after extubation (lasting about 3-5&#x000a0;min). We infer that we should pay attention to regulate tidal volumes and oxygen concentration and closely monitor the oxygen saturation during the whole procedure of PS administration.</p><p>Our study was an open-label, randomized, controlled pilot with a sample of about 90 infants. Since the optimal oxygen saturation for premature infants was changed to 90-95% in our NICU in 2014, we had to restrict our analysis to the data that had been gathered in 2013, with the pre-specified saturation ranges of 85-95%. This led to us not achieving the requisite sample size. Our results warrant further study. A large multicenter trial would be required to confirm that LISA reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Moreover, such studies would give us more information about the practicalities and complications of LISA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The LISA technique in spontaneously breathing infants on nCPAP is feasible, may prevent intubation with an endotracheal tube in certain premature babies.
