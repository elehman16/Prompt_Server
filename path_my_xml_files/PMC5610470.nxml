We aimed to determine recruitment rate and participant throughput in a randomised trial of glibenclamide compared with standard therapy insulin (added to maximum tolerated metformin) for treatment of GDM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted an open label feasibility study in 5 UK antenatal clinics among pregnant women 16 to 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation with metformin-treated GDM. Women failing to achieve adequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy were randomised to additional glibenclamide or insulin. The primary outcome was recruitment rate. We explored feasibility with uptake, retention, adherence, safety, glycaemic control, participant satisfaction and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Records of 197 women were screened and 23 women randomised to metformin and glibenclamide (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) or metformin and insulin (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10). Mean (SD) recruitment rate was 0.39 (0.62) women/centre/month. 9/13 (69.2%, 95%CI 38.6&#x02013;90.9%) women adhered to glibenclamide and all provided outcome data (100% retention). There were no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, but metformin and insulin gave superior glycaemic control to metformin and glibenclamide, with fewer blood glucose readings &#x0003c;3.5&#x000a0;mmol/l (median [IQR] difference/woman/week of treatment 0.58 [0.03&#x02013;1.87]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">A large randomised controlled trial comparing glibenclamide or insulin in combination with metformin for women with GDM would be feasible but is unlikely to be worthwhile, given the poorer glycaemic control with glibenclamide and metformin in this pilot study. The combination of metformin and glibenclamide should be reserved for women with GDM with true needle phobia or inability to use insulin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par400">

Glucose lowering treatment in women with GDM improves outcomes including reducing birth weight, the proportion of large for gestational age infants, caesarean section and perinatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Lowering diagnostic thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and an increasing prevalence of risk factors such as obesity have led to many more women being diagnosed with GDM and requiring glucose lowering treatment.</p><p id="Par13">Insulin has traditionally been the first drug of choice for treatment of GDM if diet and lifestyle advice fail to lower glucose adequately. Oral anti-diabetic agents including metformin (a biguanide) and glibenclamide (glyburide, a sulphonylurea) are increasingly considered attractive alternatives to insulin with equivalent efficacy to insulin, lower cost, ease of administration and patient preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Metformin is now used as first-line therapy in the UK, although both oral agents are endorsed in national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the USA, glibenclamide is more widely used first-line with prescriptions increasing from 7.4% in 2001 to 64.5% in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, with reported &#x0201c;failure rates&#x0201d; of metformin in three randomised studies between 32% and 46% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and of glibenclamide between 16% and 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a significant number of women require supplementary or alternative treatment with insulin.</p><p id="Par14">Combination treatment with sulphonylureas and metformin is well established for treatment of type 2 diabetes in non-pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but has not (to our knowledge) been tested in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Combination therapy may be a desirable approach for women with GDM with glucose levels remaining above the target range despite maximum tolerated oral monotherapy. Such a regimen has the potential to avoid the discomfort of subcutaneous injections and the expense of insulin therapy. However, it is not known whether using the combination therapy in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia or side effects, though neither are more common with combination therapy in non-pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In women with GDM who failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, we hypothesised that combination therapy with glibenclamide, compared to insulin would result in similar glycaemic control and clinical outcomes, and would be preferable to women. In this feasibility study, we aimed to determine the recruitment rate/participant throughput in a randomised controlled trial of glibenclamide compared with insulin (in addition to maximum tolerated metformin), for the treatment of GDM and to explore glycaemic control and compare clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par16">We conducted an open-label feasibility study between 1st August 2014 and 31st October 2015 in antenatal clinics at 5 NHS hospitals in Scotland, UK.

Women were commenced on metformin 500&#x000a0;mg once daily and the dose up-titrated as tolerated to a maximum of 2&#x000a0;g daily in two divided doses. If it became clear that metformin therapy was insufficient to maintain normoglycaemia, women were given further information about the study. Those wishing to participate gave written consent and were randomised. Demographics, medical history, gestation of diagnosis of GDM and dose of metformin therapy were recorded at the time of randomisation.</p><p id="Par20">Participants randomised to glibenclamide were prescribed glibenclamide 2.5&#x000a0;mg once daily (time of day decided by their clinician according to home blood glucose monitoring) in addition to their current dose of metformin. Glibenclamide therapy was up-titrated to a maximum dose of 20&#x000a0;mg daily in two or three divided doses during clinic visits by diabetes specialist nurses and/or research midwives with diabetes/obstetric medical support, according to a treatment algorithm drawn up by consensus amongst study clinicians at the start of the trial (RMR, MWJS, RL) (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). All participating prescribers received training in use of the algorithm. Women were phoned three to five days after starting glibenclamide or after any dose increase in glibenclamide, with up-titration of treatment if sustained hyperglycaemia occurred. Similarly, if hypoglycaemia occurred, the dose was down-titrated. If women failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control with dual oral therapy, glibenclamide was discontinued and replaced with insulin therapy. Women randomised to insulin (standard care) were treated according to the clinician&#x02019;s standard practice and doses adjusted to achieve target glycaemic control. For those who achieved normoglycaemia, allocation to glibenclamide or insulin treatment, in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of metformin, was maintained until delivery.</p><p id="Par21">Participants were asked to check their blood glucose 4 times per day (fasting prior to breakfast, and 2&#x000a0;h post-breakfast, lunch and evening meal).

We assumed that the first blood sample of the day was a &#x0201c;fasting&#x0201d; sample, and that where multiple readings of glucose were available within five minutes of each other, the last of the series was the correct reading. Clinical information was extracted from the clinical record and details of daily drug treatment were extracted from the participants&#x02019; treatment diaries at each clinic visit. Clinical outcomes including gestational weight gain, birthweight, gestation at delivery, mode of delivery, and any complications including neonatal hypoglycaemia were collected from the clinical record post-delivery. Women were asked to complete a questionnaire using a visual analogue scale to assess satisfaction at 38&#x02013;40&#x000a0;weeks gestation and to answer the question &#x02018;If you were given the choice in the future, would you prefer to receive insulin injections, or the glibenclamide tablets if you had diabetes again?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par22">The primary outcome was the absolute number and throughput/recruitment rate of eligible women with GDM who were on maximum tolerated metformin and who agreed to be randomised to glibenclamide or insulin.

The 23 participants were randomly assigned to glibenclamide (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) or insulin (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) in addition to metformin therapy, and all were included in the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes, i.e. no post-randomisation exclusions and 100% retention (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Adherence to the glibenclamide intervention was achieved in 9/13 (69.2%, 95%CI 38.6&#x02013;90.9%) women, with 4 women switched to insulin therapy due to hyperglycaemia (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) or hypoglycaemia (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2017_1505_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

However, only 1 woman (12.5% of those expressing a preference) who was randomised to insulin expressed a preference for glibenclamide, and 3 women did not complete the questionnaire (1 in glibenclamide group, 2 in insulin group). There were no significant differences between groups in any of the other secondary outcomes including gestational weight gain, birthweight, gestation at delivery, mode of delivery and other complications including neonatal hypoglycaemia, although both episodes of neonatal hypoglycaemia were in the group whose mothers were treated with glibenclamide (in addition to metformin) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2 and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Main findings</title><p id="Par33">Based on our recruitment rates of 0.39 women/centre/month, we estimate that a large randomised trial of glibenclamide compared with insulin (assuming a sample size of between 500 and 800) would require 30&#x02013;60 centres recruiting for 3&#x000a0;years. Such a study is likely to be feasible, but expensive. However, our prior hypothesis that glibenclamide and insulin would be equivalent in terms of glycaemic and clinical outcomes appears incorrect, given that we showed significantly greater frequencies of excursions in blood glucose below 3.5&#x000a0;mmol/L in the glibenclamide group. Preference for oral therapy was not universal, with 45% of all participants either expressing no preference or preferring insulin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="Par34">The combination of glibenclamide and metformin appears worse than the combination of insulin and metformin. Contrary to our expectations about the unattractiveness of subcutaneous injections, women did not universally express a preference for glibenclamide over insulin. Hence we believe that further trials of glibenclamide and metformin in pregnancy in unselected women with GDM are unwarranted. In this small sample, preliminary data suggest that insulin (in combination with metformin) gives superior glycaemic control, with a lower incidence of glucose excursions &#x0003c;3.5&#x000a0;mmol/L (compared with glibenclamide in combination with metformin). A recent systematic review of drug treatments for GDM highlighted an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia with glibenclamide compared with insulin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The pharmacokinetics of metformin are unchanged in pregnancy, whereas oral clearance rates of glibenclamide increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Whether there are further changes in pharmacokinetics of the two drugs used in combination in pregnancy is unknown. Metformin crosses the placenta, but there is debate about whether this is true for glibenclamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Other factors which may have contributed to the poorer glycaemic control in the glibenclamide arm of our trial include limited flexibility to titrate doses (smallest tablet dose was 2.5&#x000a0;mg) and inexperience of clinicians with titrating doses due to lack of routine use of glibenclamide, which has largely been replaced by sulphonylureas with a shorter duration of action (gliclazide, glipizide) in diabetes practice in the UK. Our other secondary outcomes showed no differences between treatment with glibenclamide or insulin, but must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.</p><p id="Par35">We were surprised to find little evidence of preference for oral therapy. A previous study found no increase in anxiety and depression symptoms in women with GDM when treatment was intensified from diet alone to insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another study indicated the dominant concern in women with GDM was &#x02018;the baby&#x02019;s health&#x02019;, whereas treatment satisfaction was generally high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A woman&#x02019;s concerns about choice of adjuvant therapy for GDM when metformin has failed are also likely to be different from individuals with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] due to the much shorter duration of need for therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par36">The strengths of our study include the robust multicentre randomised controlled design, and the statistically significant difference in hypoglycaemic episodes in association with glibenclamide. We also demonstrate that using routinely collected clinical data including downloads of home-blood glucose measurements gives a wealth of information about maternal glycaemic control in &#x02018;real life&#x02019;. We do not believe that the open-label design impacted on outcome, as an algorithm was used by all clinicians for titration of medication doses and to guide decisions for &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; therapy. The limitations of the study include the small sample size, which could have contributed to a chance imbalance on prognostic factors including weight and time of diagnosis. The lower than planned recruitment rate to our study occurred principally because the majority of women achieved adequate glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy, though rates of metformin &#x02018;failure&#x02019; in around a third of women were consistent with other published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A further limitation is that the lack of ethnic diversity in our sample mean our findings may not be generalisable, though we are not aware of any studies showing ethnic differences in responses to either metformin or glibenclamide monotherapy in pregnancy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion, this small feasibility study shows that a large randomised controlled trial comparing additional glibenclamide or insulin in women with GDM who are failing to achieve adequate glycaemic control with metformin alone is feasible, but is unlikely to be clinically worthwhile given both the poorer glycaemic control with glibenclamide and metformin in this pilot study and the lack of universal preference for glibenclamide over insulin. The lack of adverse effects in our study suggests that the combination of metformin and glibenclamide may be considered as treatment option for selected individual women with GDM who are failing metformin monotherapy, if there is careful monitoring of glycaemic control. Such an option may be useful for women with a needle phobia, women with an inability to use insulin therapy or where insulin is unavailable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
