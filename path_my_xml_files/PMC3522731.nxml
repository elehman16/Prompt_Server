Two hypotheses were: 1) Integrated Management of Infectious Disease (IMID) training would improve clinical competence as tested with a single arm, pre-post design, and 2) on-site support (OSS) would yield additional improvements as tested with a cluster-randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six Ugandan health facilities (randomized 1&#x02236;1 to parallel OSS and control arms) enrolled two MLPs each. All MLPs participated in IMID (3-week core course, two 1-week boost sessions, distance learning). After the 3-week course, OSS-arm trainees participated in monthly OSS. Twelve written case scenarios tested clinical competencies in HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Each participant completed different randomly-assigned blocks of four scenarios before IMID (t0), after 3-week course (t1), and after second boost course (t2, 24 weeks after t1). Scoring guides were harmonized with IMID content and Ugandan national policy. Score analyses used a linear mixed-effects model. The primary outcome measure was longitudinal change in scenario scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Scores were available for 856 scenarios. Mean correct scores at t0, t1, and t2 were 39.3%, 49.1%, and 49.6%, respectively. Mean score increases (95% CI, p-value) for t0&#x02013;t1 (pre-post period) and t1&#x02013;t2 (parallel-arm period) were 12.1 ((9.6, 14.6), p&#x0003c;0.001) and &#x02212;0.6 ((&#x02212;3.1, +1.9), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.647) percent for OSS arm and 7.5 ((5.0, 10.0), p&#x0003c;0.001) and 1.6 ((&#x02212;1.0, +4.1), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.225) for control arm. The estimated mean difference in t1 to t2 score change, comparing arm A (participated in OSS) vs. arm B was &#x02212;2.2 ((&#x02212;5.8, +1.4), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.237). From t0&#x02013;t2, mean scores increased for all 12 scenarios.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Clinical competence increased significantly after a 3-week core course; improvement persisted for 24 weeks. No additional impact of OSS was observed.

Participants in arm B attended IMID.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0051319.g002"/></fig><p>The IMID training program began with a 3-week core course, followed over a 24-week period by two 1-week boost courses and distance learning. In 2010, a 3-week session was offered to participants in arm A in either March (A1) or April (A2) 2010, and to arm B in May (B1) or June (B2). Twelve and 24 weeks after the 3-week IMID course, all participants participated in 1-week boost courses. The start and end dates were different for each session, but the duration of follow-up was the same. The second boost course for the A1 session finished on 1 October 2010 and for the B2 session on 17 December 2010.</p><p>The 3-week IMID core course addressed diagnosis and management of HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, diarrhea, acute respiratory infections and other infections of local importance in pregnant women, non-pregnant adults, infants and children. Its content was specifically adapted to Ugandan national policy and to the clinical context of a health center IV (HC IV), which included responsibility for child health and prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases within a health subdistrict. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Government1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> The content was summarized in 14 Clinical Decision Guides. The core course and boost courses included both classroom sessions taught at IDI by expert clinicians in Kampala, Uganda and12 half-day clinical rotations. Distance learning between courses used a case-based method; participants reflected on and recorded cases encountered in their home health facilities using structured log books. Review of original IMID content during boost courses built on the participants' cases from the log books.</p><p>All participants were also encouraged to use the AIDS Treatment Information Center (ATIC), which is a Kampala-based warm-line staffed by medical doctors and pharmacists experienced in infectious disease, for advice on management of complicated patients.</p><p>The facilities randomized to Arm A (1&#x02236;1 allocation) participated in monthly OSS beginning in April 2010. Arm B participated in OSS beginning in March 2011, but the impact of OSS on clinical competence in Arm B was not assessed. OSS was provided by a four-member mobile team: medical doctor, clinical officer, registered nurse and laboratory technologist. The teams' two-day visits included multidisciplinary didactic sessions, discipline-specific break-out sessions, mentoring for both clinical and laboratory staff, and continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities. Each OSS visit was structured around a theme, beginning with &#x0201c;Emergency, Assessment, Triage, and Treatment.&#x0201d;</p><p>The OSS sessions for clinicians were based on IMID core course materials. The multi-disciplinary training was primarily an overview of national guidelines. The IMID participants attended the break-out session for clinicians, which focused on the Clinical Decision Guides. For the mentoring sessions for clinicians, all of the mentors attended the pilot version of the IMID core course. The mentoring sessions varied however, with the patients at the facility during the OSS visit. The mentors sought to build the following six patient care competencies: 1) history taking, 2) routine physical examination including danger signs, 3) clinical reasoning including identification of differential diagnoses, 4) ordering laboratory investigations, 5) appropriate diagnosis, and 6) appropriate treatment and management plan.</p><p>The CQI activities were designed to support the CQI teams at the sites, which included IMID participants, and focused on a subset of 13 of the facility performance indicators. All of the indicators were selected in collaboration with the curriculum developers for the IMID core course and reflected its content. Some indicators measured individual clinicians' performance, such as reducing the percentage of patients with a negative malaria smear who were treated with anti-malarials. Others measured team performance, such as increasing the percentage of malaria suspects with laboratory tests for malaria for which the clinician ordered the test and the laboratory staff performed it. The sites generally chose to focus on six indicators. Three CQI activities for each visit were organized around those indicators: 1) preparing data on the indicators, 2) mapping processes of care, and 3) reviewing the data and processes of care to identify problems and goals for the next month.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objectives</title><p>The hypothesis for the single-arm intervention with pre-post design was that the IMID course is effective at building clinical competence, where competence was measured by participating clinicians' scores on written case scenarios. The hypothesis for the cluster-randomized trial component was that OSS will yield additional improvement in the competence of individual MLPs relative to those in the control arm, using the same measure.</p><p>The primary objectives of our assessment of the impact of IDCAP interventions on individual clinician competence were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Estimate mean change in written case scenario scores from t0 (baseline) to t1 (end of 3-week IMID course) for arms A and B combined. (Between t0 and t1, both arms received the same intervention.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compare mean changes in written case scenario scores from t1 to t2 (end of second boost course) between arm A and arm B. (Between t1 and t2, only arm A received OSS.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Estimate overall mean changes in scenario score for arms A and B from t0 to t2 and t1 to t2.</p></list-item></list><p>Secondary objectives were description of association of scores with characteristics of scenario administration, and differences in scores over testing points for individual case scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was change in aggregate scores (all participants or across arms, depending on objective) on written case scenarios across three time intervals (t0&#x02013;t1, t0&#x02013;t2, t1&#x02013;t2). For the cluster-randomized trial only, the primary outcome was the difference in score change across study arms from t1 to t2.</p><p>We selected written case scenario scores, sometimes referred to as vignettes, as our primary measure of competence, because case scenarios test both knowledge and clinical reasoning skills. Case scenario scores have been validated as a measure of quality of care against data from clinician encounters with standardized patients in the United States. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Peabody1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> Case scenario scores have also been used successfully to describe differences in clinician competence across groups characterized by practice setting, level of training, and other factors. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Peabody2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051319-Leonard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> Recently, Das et al. identified a gap between case scenarios and standardized patients or observation of clinical care as measures of practice, called the &#x0201c;know-do-gap,&#x0201d; among doctors in India and Tanzania. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Das2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> Leonard et al. noted differences in the gap across professions in Tanzania, but the differences were associated with the organization where they practiced rather than years of training. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Leonard2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>
</p><p>Twelve case scenarios were designed to cover the main elements of IMID content. A sample case scenario is presented in Web <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051319.s001">Appendix S1</xref>. Scenario structure was based on a template that included danger/emergency signs, history, physical examination, laboratory testing, initial diagnosis and treatment, and evolution of the case over time (hours to months).The template document also referenced specific IMID curriculum sessions and Ugandan national policy documents that addressed the subject of each question. Scenario questions were short-answer and open-ended (e.g. &#x0201c;What are the three most likely causes of this patient's current signs and symptoms?&#x0201d;). In a pre-trial pilot, scores on draft versions of the case scenarios increased significantly after MLP exposure to a pilot version of the IMID core course (Weaver M et al., unpublished manuscript).</p><p>Available time for assessment did not allow for administration of all 12 case scenarios to each participant at a single testing point. In addition, each case scenario was structured in four parts where the answers to one part were revealed at the beginning of the next part (except the fourth). To isolate course learning as opposed to familiarity with the case scenarios, participants responded to different case scenarios at each testing point. Consequently, the 12 case scenarios were divided into three blocks of four scenarios, and each block was assigned to participants from one-third of the sites within each arm at each testing point.

The sequence for the first block was repeated in subsequent blocks; for example a participant whose sequence in block A at t0 was 1234, had sequence 5678 in block B at t1. We selected 12 of 24 possible sequences for each block and randomly assigned one sequence to each of the 12 participants assigned to that block in each arm. The same 12 sequences were assigned to each arm, so the sequences were balanced across arms.</p><p>To test whether score improvements on repeated case scenarios reflected course learning or familiarity with case scenario content, each participant repeated one (at t1) or two (at t2) randomly selected scenarios from earlier testing points. Their position in the sequence for the current time was also selected at random.

To eliminate inter-scorer variability, a case scenario was always scored by the same person (Weaver M, et al., unpublished manuscript). After t1, the four co-authors who are clinicians (IC, SE, MG, JN) and Paula Brentlinger reviewed the participants' answers at t0 and t1 to identify correct answers that had not been anticipated in the original scoring guidelines; for example, clinical actions that were technically correct but generally not relevant in the HC IV context, such as requesting computerized tomography of the brain. They also reviewed changes in Ugandan national policy guidelines and/or IMID training program content that had occurred after the case scenarios were drafted. The scoring guidelines were revised and expanded, based on consensus. The revised guidelines were used to score all of the scenarios and those scores are reported below.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculations for IDCAP were based on testing the effect of OSS on facility performance, and thus were not based on power requirements for the analysis of the case scenarios.

No other adverse events or side effects were reported for either arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The IMID training program resulted in statistically significant increases in the clinical competence of participants between pretest and after the 3-week core course, and these improvements were maintained, for participants in both arms, through the subsequent 24 week training program. These increases were measured with scores of new cases scenarios. Scores on repeat scenarios were statistically significantly higher than new scenarios, reflecting the small effect of familiarity with the scenarios' content. IMID training increased competency in domains relevant to multiple different infectious diseases and patient subgroups, because score increases were demonstrated for all 12 scenarios and for all three blocks.</p><p>Between t1 and t2, there was no significant difference in score change across arms. The effect size was small, indicating that absence of statistical significance was not a consequence of inadequate sample size. Although this suggests that OSS did not significantly add to the development of clinician competency, it is also possible that OSS reinforced competencies that were not well-represented in the case scenarios. Although the OSS training materials were based on IMID training materials, the case scenarios were designed before the OSS training materials, and consequently without reference to them. Improvements in clinical practice and facility performance would be reflected in those measures.</p><p>Concerning the mechanics of scenario administration, order of scenario administration is important; statistically significantly lower scores for four or more suggested that participant fatigue may influence scores. If scenario order is not randomized, it should be the same for all participants for on-going courses or across arms for comparison.</p><p>Also, it was difficult to tailor different scenarios to test the same competencies. Comparisons of individuals who completed different blocks at each testing point were not possible; someone who completed block A with the lowest average scores at t0 and block C with the highest average scores at t1 might show an increase on average, whereas those who completed the opposite might show a decrease. Given the modest increase associated with the repeat case scenarios, using the same scenarios at two or more time points would be more comparable than using different scenarios addressing similar competencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>Scenario scores are well-validated measures of competence, but may overestimate clinical performance. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Das2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> For this reason, IDCAP has also assessed individual practice and facility-level clinical performance, and will report them separately. Scenarios completed by participants with poor handwriting or less advanced English-language skills may have been underscored. The intentionally challenging content of the scenarios may have discouraged some participants. Finally, the research design did not allow comparison of competence across professions or types of facilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Concerning facilities, the primary results may generalize to other settings without an on-going CQI program and with de facto task shifting. Uganda's National AIDS Control Program benefited from two large scale, on-going CQI programs, which would have confounded the measurement of the effects of OSS on HIV care. Hence IDCAP's eligibility criteria focused on a narrow range of health facilities to isolate the effect of OSS. Consequently, the effects on competence in HIV care may not generalize to other facilities that are accredited to provide ART within Uganda. They may however, generalize to facilities that serve patient populations at risk for malaria, tuberculosis and other common infectious diseases within Uganda, and to other contexts in which CQI interventions for HIV care were not on-going.</p><p>With regard to clinicians, the primary results may generalize to other active clinicians with leadership roles and previous training in counseling, IMCI or IMAI. IMID participants were not chosen at random, and these results would not necessarily generalize to junior clinicians or those with less in-service training. Evidence from the Integrated Management of Malaria course <xref rid="pone.0051319-Ssekabira1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> however, suggested that all MLPs would potentially benefit.</p><p>The IMID training program used material developed and adapted specifically to Ugandan clinical officers and registered nurses and to the local policy and clinical environment, with real-time updates to reflect changing local Ugandan policy. As with other training initiatives such as IMCI and IMAI, the content of the IMID curriculum materials and case scenarios would require adaptation before use in other countries or for other cadres, <xref rid="pone.0051319-World1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and the magnitude of observed evolution of scenario scores might vary in other contexts.</p><p>The secondary results may also generalize to other applications of case scenarios to test the effect of training on clinical competence. Our findings that scenario scores varied significantly depending on new vs. repeat status and on order, and that scores differed across scenarios that addressed similar infectious-disease problems in different ways, are likely to be applicable to other similar evaluations of capacity-building interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>In spite of recent international emphasis on programs that encompass more than one disease entity and more than one target population, only a handful of integrated programs have been implemented and evaluated. <xref rid="pone.0051319-Schellenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051319-Rowe2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> IDCAP's interventions were an innovative approach to supporting clinicians in development of routine and adaptive reasoning skills. Clinical competence was measured by case scenarios, which was the first application of this measure for longitudinal evaluation of a capacity-building program. The case scenarios and scoring guidelines carefully reflected the IMID training program's content. In addition to randomized allocation of health facilities to parallel arms assigned to OSS or delayed OSS, the novel research design exploited randomization to permit more extensive assessment of curriculum content than would otherwise have been possible, and to test different approaches to scenario administration. The IMID core course was effective at improving clinical competence. Although the measure of competence failed to demonstrate an additional impact of OSS, forthcoming data on the impact of OSS on measures of individual clinical practice, health facility performance, and health outcomes suggested that that both IMID and OSS may have contributed to improving the quality of care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051319.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
