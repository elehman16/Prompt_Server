Stability studies indicate that storage at a temperature of 4&#x000b0;C in a normal refrigerator guarantees complete maintenance of live micro-organisms for 24&#x02005;months, while storage at 22&#x000b0;C (room temperature) decreases the stability time to 4&#x02005;weeks (described in drug datasheet). In Thailand, however, preserving probiotics in a refrigerator is not generally feasible for all patients and room temperature ranges from 28&#x000b0;C to 32&#x000b0;C. It is reported that at 37&#x000b0;C Infloran&#x000ae; is stable for only 2&#x02005;weeks and that the amount of live micro-organisms halves during that time. We hypothesise that even if the number of live organisms is reduced by storage at high temperature, killed bacteria may conserve their therapeutic properties. This study examined duration of diarrhoea and decrease in the number of abnormal stools as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, after administration of refrigerated Infloran&#x000ae; and Infloran&#x000ae; kept at room temperature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>A double-blinded, randomised control trial was conducted between January and October 2008 in children aged between 2&#x02005;months and 7&#x02005;years admitted to the paediatric unit of Srinakharinwirot University Hospital with a diagnosis of acute diarrhoea. Decisions regarding admission and general management were made, respectively, by the emergency and attending physicians. Children who had passed abnormal watery and/or mucous stools more than three times within the previous 24&#x02005;hours with duration of diarrhoea for more than 72&#x02005;hours were eligible for enrolment. Patients with evidence of systemic infections, neurological disturbances, a history of convulsions or conditions such as chronic immunodeficient gastro-intestinal conditions or severe dehydration were excluded.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Children who had received treatment with probiotics and medications which interfere with intestinal motility during the present illness were also excluded. Informed consent was obtained and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Srinakharinwirot University.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Demographic analysis</title><p>After enrolment, demographic characteristics and clinical history were recorded. Weight to the nearest 100&#x02005;g and length/height to the nearest mm were measured. Clinical evidence of dehydration was documented in accordance with WHO guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Investigations</title><p>Serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and complete blood counts were measured. Urinalysis and microscopic faecal examination were routinely performed on admission. Faecal examination for rotavirus by immunochromatography assay (Rota-strip, Coris Bioconcept, Belgium) was undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>After obtaining written consent from care-givers, children were randomised by a computerised programme into one of three groups: to receive live <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> (minimum of 10<sup>9</sup>/capsule) and <italic>B. bifidum</italic> (minimum of 10<sup>9</sup>/capsule) (Infloran&#x000ae;, Berna, Switzerland) stored in a refrigerator (average 4&#x000b0;C); to receive Infloran&#x000ae; stored at room temperature (average 28&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C) for 1&#x02005;month before administration; or to receive a placebo stored in a refrigerator. The placebo was a capsule of powdered oral rehydration solution (ORS), identical in colour and size to the Infloran&#x000ae;. Capsules were opened and the powder inside was dissolved in milk or some other fluid before administration. Both patients and attending physicians were blinded to which children were receiving which medication. Children in each group received the assigned medication three times daily until the end of the diarrhoea episode and up to a maximum of 5&#x02005;days. The end of a diarrhoea episode was defined as the first of two consecutive semi-formed stools or the last stool followed by 12&#x02005;hours without passing stool. Duration of diarrhoea was a primary outcome and the number of abnormal watery or mucous stools passed, duration of hospital stay and requirement for rehydration fluid were considered secondary outcomes. Adverse events were recorded by interviewing parents or guardians.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normal distribution of data was tested using the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Normally distributed data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), and non-normally distributed data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The Pearson <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests were used to compare proportions between the groups. Continuous variables were compared by analysis of variance. The least square difference (LSD) method was employed for <italic>post hoc</italic> comparison. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 software package. A <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>From January to October 2008, 102 potentially eligible patients were approached to enrol in the study. Of these, 67 children accepted and were randomly assigned to the treatment groups: 23 received probiotics stored in a refrigerator, 22 received probiotics stored at room temperature and 22 received a placebo. Two children given probiotics stored at room temperature and a child in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study before receiving medication because of their parents&#x02019; concerns. However, the data of all 67 children were included in the intent-to-treat analysis of primary outcome. The data of one child in the placebo group were not analysed for secondary outcomes owing to a later diagnosis of lymphoma.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Sixty-three per cent of enrolled children were boys with a mean age (range) of 1.9&#x02005;years (2&#x02005;months to 7&#x02005;years). Demographic characteristics, clinical history and biochemical parameters are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="atp-30-04-299-t01">Table&#x02005;1</xref>. There were no significant differences among the groups in mean age, gender, weight, height, baseline haematological or biochemical parameters.

Twenty-one (31.3%) were infected by rotavirus with no significant difference among the groups. Stool examination was positive for white blood cells in 35 (52.2%) children. The mean number of abnormal stools during admission and duration of diarrhoea before admission were six (range 1&#x02013;20) and 36&#x02005;hours (range 1&#x02013;72), respectively, and these figures

Several reports have shown that, in infants and children, probiotics significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea by more than 3&#x02005;days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> In particular, major benefits are achieved when there is infection with rotavirus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> However, in developing countries, diarrhoea is often caused by agents other than rotaviruses and infections are often heterogeneous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> Available data on the benefits of probiotics in acute diarrhoea in low-income countries have demonstrated variable outcomes. Treatment with <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> has not shown any benefit in children aged from 3 to 36&#x02005;months with acute, watery diarrhoea, but lactose malabsorption might have affected these results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Furthermore, tyndalised (heat-killed) <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> has not demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in acute diarrhoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> In contrast, <italic>Lactobacillus LB</italic> was found to be an effective and safe treatment for children with diarrhoea for more than 24&#x02005;hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Severity of diarrhoea may interfere with probiotic activity. Suggested inclusion criteria for studying the clinical use of probiotics are diarrhoea duration &#x0003c;7&#x02005;days and more than three stools in the previous 24&#x02005;hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> The present study enrolled children with mainly mild diarrhoea. We included some common parameters important in the management of gastro-intestinal disorders such as degree of dehydration, number of diarrhoeal stools before admission, high-grade fever, absence of hyponatraemia and acidosis (bicarbonate &#x0003c;15&#x02005;mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="atp-30-04-299-t01">Table&#x02005;1</xref>).</p><p>Whether killed or live microbes are used might determine efficacy as the action of probiotics as biological modifiers is different in the case of live or killed micro-organisms: live probiotics may influence both intestinal microflora and the immune system, while dead cells are able to reduce inflammation in the gastro-intestinal duct.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> In adults, lyophilised, heat-killed <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> improves clinical symptoms of chronic diarrhoea in comparison to living lactobacilli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> In infants, heat-killed <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> has a positive effect in the management of non-rotavirus diarrhoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></p><p>Viable Infloran&#x000ae; has already shown efficacy for treating acute diarrhoea in infants in Thailand.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> This study demonstrates that, in a warm developing country, probiotics are effective even if stored at room temperature (range 28&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C). Further studies on the stability and viability of Infloran&#x000ae; will be able to clarify how long probiotics can be stored at room temperature without losing their therapeutic properties for the
