[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Indeed, preadolescent patients requiring orthopedic treatment are known to have a higher high rate of malocclusions (83-87%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. According to Solow et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] the &#x0201c;soft tissue stretching hypothesis&#x0201d; emphasizes the functional influence of cervical posture on maxillo-mandibular growth. A correlation between increases in cervical lordosis and maxillofacial growth has been demonstrated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This is supported by observations that suggest a correlation between the growth patterns of the mandible and the cranium, as well as between the vertical type of the mandible itself and the sagittal back contour parameters such as Fleche Cervicale, Fleche Lombaire and trunk inclination. Such observations suggest a possible interaction between craniofacial growth and spinal development. However, a better understanding of these mechanisms will require developmental studies that analyze the possible influence of orthodontic treatment on both the craniofacial complex and body posture. Mandibular asymmetries presenting with lateral cross bite are of particular interest due to the high incidence of orthopedic posture irregularities in affected patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The therapeutic impact of manipulating mandibular position has been assessed by Bracco et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The effects of different jaw relations on body posture were studied in a sample of 95 subjects with a computerized footboard for posturometric and stabilometric analysis. Intriguingly, body posture was found to vary with jaw position. The results of this study confirmed that significant improvements in postural balance could be achieved with a myocentric position of the jaws.</p><p>In our own recent study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we established that therapeutic improvements in mandibular condyle position could be achieved using orthodontic treatment for functional unilateral posterior cross bite in a sample consisting of 65 children (6.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0&#x02009;years of age) with late deciduous and early mixed dentition. Of the 65 children used in this randomized clinical trial, 31 underwent early orthodontic treatment and 34 did not. A three-dimensional ultrasound based assessment (Arcus Digma) of deviations between maximum intercuspidation and centric position was carried out at the beginning and at the end of treatment, and the condylar deviations between the groups were found to be significantly reduced in the treatment group. In contrast, the untreated subjects showed no spontaneous self-healing tendencies. The interaction between orthodontic treatment of unilateral cross bite and mandibular condyle position is of clinical interest given the positive influence that such an intervention can have on further preadolescent craniofacial growth.</p><p>The aim of the present trial was to assess the therapeutic effect of an early orthodontic treatment protocol in patients with unilateral posterior cross bite
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] on body posture, as measured through several parameters. We hypothesized that early orthodontic treatment can induce negative therapeutic changes in body posture through thoracic and lumbar position changes in preadolescents with uniltaral cross bite. To assess body posture, we utilized a study protocol incorporating optical 3-D back shape measurement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The investigation was planned as a randomized clinical trial and was approved by the local ethics committee with reference number &#x0201c;2IXEhm&#x0201d; (Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty, Westf&#x000e4;lische-Wilhelms-Universit&#x000e4;t M&#x000fc;nster, Germany) and registred with the number: DRKS00003497. The study protocol was established and the number of patients needed for adequate statistical power was determined through assistance from Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Klinische Studien M&#x000fc;nster (ZKS). A minimum of 30 patients each for the therapy and control group was established. Patients to be included were required to have late deciduous and early mixed dentition, unilateral posterior cross bite and functional mandibular asymmetry (according to Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Patients with previous orthodontic treatment, ongoing habits, systemic illness under long-term therapy (e.g., diabetes mellitus), syndromes, cleft lip and palate, physical or mental handicaps and known structural orthopedic illnesses (e.g., Scheuermann&#x02019;s disease, stiff neck) and spinal deformities were excluded. The subjects were screened for sport habits before and during the orthodontic therapy and it was recommended to them, not to change the initial sports habits in order to minimize this functional factor in the study. Parents gave their informed consent according to the requirements of the local ethics committee and the Helsinki criteria. The patients were initially randomized using block randomization (block length 20; allocation ratio 1:1) to either the control or therapy group. A total of 82 children (38 boys and 44 girls) met the above criteria; 40 were assigned to the therapy group, 42 were assigned to the control group and 77 children attended the initial examination appointment. Due to various personal reasons, 5 children dropped out after randomization. A total of 37 children remained in the therapy group, and 40 children remained in the control group. For the final examination, 11 children were excluded from the study for either personal reasons or for being unable to keep to the mandatory time schedule. Thus 66 children (30 boys and 36 girls) remained: 31 in the therapy group (13 boys and 18 girls) and 35 in the control group (17 boys and 18 girls). The children&#x02019;s mean age was 7.3 (SD 2.1&#x02009;years) at the beginning of the study and 8.3&#x02009;years (SD 2.1) at the end of the study. The gender ratio was nearly equal in the groups. For all patients, two examination appointments were fixed: an initial examination appointment (T1) and a final examination appointment one year later (T2).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Lateral Crossbite.</bold> Asymmetric dental occlusion: posterior crossbite in the early mixed dentition with resulting midline deviation due to the inherent functional asymmetries of the mandibular system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-13-151-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Orthodontic treatment</title><p>In the therapy group for slow expansion of the maxillary bone formation, a bonded palatal expansion appliance (Figure

The recording required only 0.04&#x02009;sec with the subject standing free without pads or trunk fixation.</p><p>Evaluating the record was accomplished in three steps. First, the back shape was reconstructed by photogrammetric methods that generated a list of 3-D coordinate data of back surface points in a regular array. Second, three anatomical landmarks &#x02013; the vertebra prominens and the two spina iliaca posterior superior (lumbar dimples) &#x02013; were detected and localized using automated mathematical procedures that scanned the reconstructed surface for its characteristic shape. When these three landmarks were localized, they spanned a body fixed coordinate system, which provided an objective and automated determination of the longitudinal, sagittal and lateral direction. Third, the symmetry line of the back was determined by mathematical shape analysis and model calculation based on the 3-D reconstruction of the back surface. The symmetry line is a reasonable estimate of the line of spinous processes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, the lateral projection of the symmetry line, which is virtually the sagittal back profile, was calculated and analyzed such that the appropriate shape parameters for the back could be determined.</p><p>The automated mathematical evaluation procedures necessitate a high level of accuracy of the input data: back shape and the sagittal profiles were therefore recorded with 0.25&#x02009;mm accuracy. The precision in localizing the vertebra prominens landmark and the dimple landmarks was of high accuracy according to Hierholzer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Shape parameters of the back were calculated from the sagittal profile and from the back shape. Geometric analysis of the sagittal profile was used to determine the kyphotic and lordotic angle. Geometric analysis of the profile provided the points of inflection and their respective inflection tangents in the cervico-thoracic transition (ICT), thoracic-lumbar transition (ITL) and lumbar-sacral transition (ILS). The kyphotic and lordotic angles are spanned by two of the inflectional tangents each (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>a). Additional parameters used in the characterization of back and spinal shape were the lateral deviation, the vertebral rotation, the pelvic tilt and the pelvic torsion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These parameters rely on biomechanical modeling of the spine and on the shape analysis of the back with methods from differential geometry
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and are consistent with radiological findings

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As noted above, the current literature is lacking in randomized clinical trials addressing the development of the dental and craniofacial complex and its possible influence on the morphology of the cranio-cervical and vertebral column. Although the close functional and morphological relationship between the stomatognathic system and the vertebral column have been described
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] to date no randomized trials have addressed the possible impact of that treatment of unilateral posterior cross bite could have on the vertebral column.</p><p>Our working hypothesis for this study was that early orthodontic treatment in preadolescents with unilateral cross bite could induce a negative change in vertebral alignment with respect to the thoracic and lumbar spine sections. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the parameters quantifying the sagittal curvature in the kyphotic and lumbar spine in a randomized clinical trial, using rasterstereography to evaluate possible effects of treatment. Additionally, we assessed frontal plane effects based on surface rotation and lateral deviation. In this study, we found that in both the therapy and the control group, the kyphotic and the lordotic angle were within the limits of clinical tolerance. A significant difference was observed in the kyphotic angle between initial (T1) and follow-up (T2) examination; while in the control group the kyphotic angle slightly increases, the converse is observed in the therapy group. However, a change of 1 to 2 degrees in the kyphotic angle is not of clinical relevance, especially in a juvenile population.</p><p>No significant difference in the control and therapy group was observed in surface rotation. The control group and therapy group showed measurement values that did not differ significantly from the expected biomechanical value of zero. Nevertheless, in the therapy group, the distance from zero decreases between T1 and T2 &#x02013; a decrease that is significant as assessed by the paired <italic>t</italic>-test. The distance from zero does not change significantly in the control group.</p><p>No significant changes were detected for the pelvic tilt, and no pelvic torsion was observed for the patient sample due to the small amount of pelvic tilt. The orthopedic data collected in this study reveal no manifest orthopedic illnesses; furthermore, no clinically relevant changes in the parameters of kyphotic angle, surface rotation and lateral deviation were observed.</p><p>Our results suggest that modern orthodontic treatments for unilateral posterior cross bite
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] does not influence negatively the thoracic spine. The orthodontic treatment had no impact on impairing postural parameters. Therapy had no negative effect on several parameters of spinal positioning, including kyphotic and lordotic angle, surface rotation, pelvic angles and lateral deviation. We therefore conclude that our working hypothesis &#x02013; namely, that early orthodontic treatment can induce negative therapeutic changes in body posture through thoracic and lumbar position changes in preadolescents with uniltaral cross bite&#x02013; is not valid within the limitations of this study.</p><p>While it has been hypothesized that orthodontic treatment can influence the cervical spine, it seems likely that in lower segments, these effects disappear due to biomechanical effects or by inherent measurement limitations. According to the theory of scoliosis progression postulated by White et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], an imbalance in the thoracic spine can result in imbalanced loading of the spinal muscles and ligaments that finally results in a progression to scoliosis. Solow et al. proposed a similar theory about the development of the cranio-cervical complex based on the individual muscular balances
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Local imbalances are suggested to contribute to the development of idiopathic scoliosis in the preadolescent growth phase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The effects of asymmetric loads on the spinal system were suggested by Roaf to be the major contributing factor in the development of juvenile idiopathic scoliosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Idiopathic scoliosis in the preadolescent growth phase is believed to be reversible based on work in animal models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We therefore conclude that early treatment of unilateral cross bite is advisable since it does affect negatively the vertebral column. After the adolescent growth spurt, conservative correction of spinal postural disorders seems to be more difficult
