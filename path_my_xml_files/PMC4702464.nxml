We have developed a novel nasal hGH product (CP024) that showed excellent nasal absorption in animal models; however, the translation of these results into the clinical setting is essential because past attempts to develop such formulations by other groups have been unable to induce IGF-1 in man.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective:</title><p>The objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of CP024 compared with a sc hGH injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Design:</title><p>This was a single-center, nonrandomized placebo-controlled, open-label, five-way crossover study in eight healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting:</title><p>The study was carried out at a contract research organization, Quotient Bioresearch.</p></sec><sec><title>Volunteers:</title><p>Eight healthy male volunteers, given an iv infusion of octreotide to suppress the endogenous GH secretion during the study period, participated in the study. No volunteers were withdrawn due to side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Main Outcome Measures:</title><p>Measurement of hGH and IGF-1 levels and tolerability of the drug product was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>No serious adverse events were reported and no subjects withdrawn from study due to the treatment. After the nasal administration of CP024, 3-fold higher hGH blood levels were obtained as compared with hGH nasal control. The relative bioavailability was about 3%. CP024 (given twice daily) induced a significant increase in IGF-1 levels up to 19 hours after administration, with no significant difference to those obtained after the sc injection of hGH.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The study indicates that CP024 is a promising candidate for an efficacious nasal product for the treatment of GH deficiency due to induction of IGF-1 similar to that after a sc injection, despite the lower plasma hGH concentration obtained. A dose-response study is needed to evaluate the optimal nasal dose.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>When human GH (hGH), isolated from the pituitaries of human cadavers, was first used to treat GH deficiency in children, it was injected im three times a week, primarily due to the scarcity of supply (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The availability of recombinant hGH in the mid-1980s not only avoided the iatrogenic risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease but also allowed an increase in production of the hormone and hence made possible the investigation of alternative treatment regimens. Because sc injections are less painful than im injections and are easier to self-administer, this became the preferred route of administration in children and adults, eventually by means of the easy-to-use pen-type delivery devices (eg, Novo Nordisk Norditropin FlexPro Pen; Eli Lilly Humatrope Pen). Despite having a very different pharmacokinetic profile to that found after im injection, the efficacy after the sc administration of hGH was shown to have increased, and interestingly, neither route of administration produces a pharmacokinetic profile equivalent to the endogenous hGH profile in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Since that time, with the aim of developing formulations that might further increase efficacy, increase patient compliance and persistence, or reduce side effects, investigators have evaluated the administration of hGH via the iv, oral, pulmonary, transdermal, and nasal routes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Also, numerous sustained-release formulations have been investigated, with two reaching the market (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite these efforts and the significant advances achieved in drug delivery over the last few decades, hGH replacement therapy still requires administration via injection, usually on a daily basis.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that patients (particularly children) and their caregivers dislike the administration of injections due to needle phobia, the (real or anticipated) pain associated with them, the inconvenience and/or complexity of the regimen (eg, the multiple steps involved in the injection protocol and storage and needle disposal issues) as well as injection site reactions such as bruising (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Indeed, in the case of pediatric GH deficiency treatment, adherence has been estimated to be as low as 18% (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As might be expected, adherence to hGH replacement therapy is correlated to efficacy, and missing as little as one injection per week has been shown to significantly reduce the growth rate in children (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Not only is the health care benefit reduced by nonadherence, but also this results in increased health care costs as physicians use additional diagnostic procedures and alter the treatment to achieve therapeutic success and/or treat the consequences of GH deficiency, eg, increase the dose, prescribe additional drugs, and/or try alternative therapeutic interventions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The development of improved efficacious hGH products administered via alternative routes of delivery is therefore highly desirable.</p><p>The nasal route of drug delivery is particularly attractive due to the favorable environment in the nasal cavity for drug absorption (the pH and paucity of enzymes, its abundant blood supply, and absorptive mucosa) and the relative ease with which nasal sprays can be administered (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A recent study showed that 69% of the children participating in the study preferred the nasal route of administration of an influenza vaccine over injection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and a follow-up study showed that parents and caregivers would also prefer the nasal route as long as efficacy was maintained (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of nasal administration of hGH has been evaluated in volunteers and in patients using absorption enhancers to improve absorption across the nasal mucosa (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, pharmacodynamic studies in patients using nasally administered hGH did not induce increased levels of IGF-1, and hence, these formulations were considered therapeutically inactive (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>We recently discovered a novel absorption enhancer, CriticalSorb (Solutol HS15, BASF), that promotes the transepithelial transport of coformulated proteins and peptides across the nasal membrane. This resulted in the development of a dry powder nasal formulation of hGH (CP024) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A variety of species has been shown to express GH and GH receptors in multiple tissues in the central nervous system such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary, and hippocampus, which implicates a role for GH signaling in the development and maintenance of neural tissue as well as cognition and memory (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) Furthermore, the regulation of GH synthesis and secretion is complex and involves modulation by both central and peripherally derived modulators (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) We hypothesized that the proximity of the pituitary gland and its blood supply to the site of absorption, the potential for direct nose to brain delivery of hGH with the possibly of reaching hGH receptors in the brain, and the potential for a more physiologically equivalent hGH plasma profile (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) could make the nasal route of delivery particularly promising for GH replacement therapy. After the completion of a preclinical safety assessment package on both CriticalSorb and CP024, the current studies evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of CP024 in healthy volunteers.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Recombinant hGH was supplied by Sandoz. hGH from the same supplier was also used to manufacture Omnitrope.

The variability in the pharmacokinetics after the intranasal administration of hGH was similar to that observed after the sc injection (the C<sub>max</sub> coefficients of variation were 55.1%, 46.0%, and 52.8% for SC hGH, and CP024 once or twice daily, respectively). When CP024 B was dosed twice daily, the PK profile of CP024 after the first dose was similar to the second dose as well as similar to the single-dose administration regimen.

The CriticalSorb absorption vehicle and hGH nasal formulations were well tolerated, with any local nasal irritation being mild and transient. As a nasal spray, the nasal administration of hGH has the advantage of not having side effects associated with hGH injections, including pain, injection site reactions, inflammation, bruising, and lipoatrophy. Lack of pain, needle free, and safety all scored high in patient surveys (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and nasal delivery of hGH is therefore likely to be preferred by patients. Previous attempts to deliver hGH intranasally reported that the formulations were less well tolerated with frequent reports of pain, itching, burning, stinging, and an unpleasant taste (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These side effects almost certainly resulted from the absorption enhancers used (sodium taurodihydrofusidate and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine), causing irritation.</p><p>The formulation was able to significantly increase the bioavailability of nasally administered hGH, but it is likely that the bioavailability calculations are a low estimate of the actual value due to the blowback/powder loss effect observed with the Aptar Pharma unit powder dose device, the prolonged absorption from the sc dose, and potentially a loss of the nasally administered hGH via the nasopharynx into the stomach in which it would be degraded and digested.</p><p>Importantly, the nasal hGH formulation containing CriticalSorb also induced IGF-1, with the levels obtained after twice-daily nasal dosing being the same (not significantly different) as for a sc injection of the hGH up to 19 hours after the first administration. The 7-hour interval between doses for regimen E was chosen based on the evaluation of the PK/PD data from regimens B and C to give the optimal rise in IGF-1 concentrations over a 24-hour period. This is the first report of IGF-1 induction in man after the intranasal administration of hGH. For example, Laursen et al (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) reported the bioavailability and bioactivity of nasal GH (0.05, 0.10, 0.20 IU/kg) in GH-deficient patients and found that only the sc injection of the hormone induced increased levels of IGF-1 in the patients. Intriguingly, given the lower hGH exposure observed after dosing with CP024 compared with the sc injection, it appears that for a given plasma level of hGH, intranasal dosing results in a greater induction of IGF-1 compared with a sc injection. This could be due to the hGH plasma profile more closely resembling the endogenous pattern of GH secretion in healthy individuals.</p><p>Endogenous GH is stored and secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in a pulsatile fashion throughout the day, each burst lasting 2&#x02013;4 hours and the largest peak occurring just after the onset of sleep (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The pharmacokinetics observed after the nasal administration of CP024 are reminiscent of these endogenous bursts, with elevated levels lasting approximately 4 hours. The effect of pulsatile GH on the growth rate of hypophysectomized rats has been explored by different researchers using iv injections of hGH. The studies suggested that frequent GH (pulsative) administration was superior to infrequent delivery or continuous infusion in terms of promotion of bone growth or body weight (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and increased serum IGF-1 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It was found in GH-deficient children that a daily sc dose of hGH injected at night before sleep rather than a two- to three-times-weekly dose resulted in a significant increase in growth for the same total dose of 12 IU/wk (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The results were found in two similar studies in which the total dose was changed from being administered three times weekly im to daily administration by sc injection (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A study evaluating the effect of a pulsatile vs continuous iv administration of hGH in GH-deficient patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) found that eight boluses (given at 3 h intervals starting at 8:00 <sc>pm</sc>) or a continuous infusion of a fixed total hGH dose were equally effective in generating an increase in IGF-1, whereas the same amount of hGH given as two large boluses (at 8:00 <sc>pm</sc> and 2:00 <sc>am</sc>) resulted in a significantly smaller increase in IGF-1.</p><p>Serum IGF-1 levels have been correlated with the achieved growth rate after GH replacement therapy (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Achieving the same IGF-1 induction with lower serum GH levels has the potential to maintain efficacy of treatment while reducing the risk of side effects due to the direct actions of hGH. In particular, given the increasing incidence of diabetes, there is increasing concern of GH's effects on insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Indeed, an analysis of data from the Pharmacia KIGS postmarketing surveillance database found an increased incidence of diabetes in children treated with GH replacement therapy (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). By achieving similar IGF-1 levels with lower systemic exposure to hGH, CP024 may mitigate this risk.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a nasal spray formulation of hGH able to induce IGF-1 levels to a similar extent as that observed after sc injection. Because nasal sprays are pain free and relatively simple to administer, CP024 could be an attractive treatment option for patients, particularly children and needle-phobic patients, but in addition, because a similar PD effect is possible with lower systemic hGH exposure, there could be less potential for insulin insensitivity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
