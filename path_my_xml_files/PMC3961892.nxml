Injuries to them result in devastating emotional as well as functional disturbances. The malar bone represents a strong bone on fragile support, and it is for this reason that though the body of the bone is rarely broken, the four processes-Frontal, orbital, maxillary, and zygomatic are frequently the site of fracture.</p><p>The zygomaticotemporal articulation is very thin and delicate connection that fracture frequently with minimal forces. For unstable, displaced fractures of the zygoma, miniplates were found to efficiently stabilize the bones with minimal complications. Titanium miniplates may have disadvantages as the possibility of bone atrophy due to stress-shielding and the obligation to remove these devices in the second operation.</p><p>An area of ongoing research is the use of biodegradable plate system for fixation of facial fractures. The main advantage of the biodegradable plates and screws is that they lose their mechanical properties due to degradation, so that masticatory loads are gradually retransferred to the bone preventing stress-shielding of the healed bone. These plates cause less interference with craniofacial growth in children and with postoperative radiotherapy.</p><p>Current study was done to compare the stability of zygomatic complex fracture using biodegradable plates and titanium miniplates with one point fixation in the management of zygomatic complex fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>Twenty patient shaving fracture of zygomatic complex involving either frontozygomatic suture or zygomatic buttress region were included in this study and were selected among the patients who reported to the casualty/outpatient Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Santosh Medical Dental College and Hospitals, Ghaziabad.

Similar results were seen in the studies of Mehrotra <italic>et al.</italic>, Dziadek, <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but in the studies of Chowdhary <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] right side was more involved than the left side.

The reason being that the upper buccal sulcus approach has a number of advantages over Gillies approach like no skin scar and more precise application of the force by the operator, placement of bone plate at buttress through the same incision, minimal bleeding, and simple mucosal closure. Similar observation was observed with the study of Courtney[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Ho.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In our study, only one point fixation was done either at zygomatic buttress or at frontozygomatic suture. We observed that zygomatic buttress was one of the best sites of fixation as it is the direct antagonist to the pull of masseter muscle and the site of fixation was deep and the plates were rarely felt in this area so the fixation was longer and stronger. Frontozygomatic suture was also a good site for fixation of zygomatic complex fracture as the bone in this area was thick which was ideal for rigid fixation.</p><p>Similar observations were noted by Ellis[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that in isolated zygomatic complex fracture zygomatic buttress provides great mechanical advantage for stabilization to the fracture segment by application of bone plates and one plate can prevent medial rotation of the zygomatic complex into maxillary sinus.</p><p>Praveen and Parmar[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] observed that the fixation at zygomatic buttress can provide acceptable stability of the zygomatic complex but in highly unstable fracture two or three point of fixation was additionally achieved to fix the fracture at infraorbital and frontozygomaticline.</p><p>Davidson <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] observed that single point fixation of frontozygomatic suture or infraorbital rim using miniplate would appear to be a method of internal fixation that provide acceptable post reduction stability and concluded that stable fixation is achieved by methods that involve the use of at least one miniplate and incorporate the frontozygomatic suture line as one of the point of fixation.</p><p>Champy[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Mitchell <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that single bone plate in the frontozygomatic suture provides adequate three-dimensional stability of an unstable zygoma.</p><p>Oyen <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed that the tensile strains predominates in the frontozygomatic region thus it supports the use of compression plates in osteosynthesis for improved stabilization in this region.</p><p>Maski <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] concluded in their study that one plate fixation of zygomatic complex fracture was significantly rigid when the fracture was not comminuted and three point alignment can be achieved.</p><p>Kelly <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed in their study that the best site for fixation is zygomatic buttress as it is the direct antagonist to the pull of masseter muscle and frontozygomatic suture is also ideal for rigid fixation, but the plate in this area is palpable so one should use thin plate.</p><p>Wittwer <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] observed in their study that the optimum location for the placement of biodegradable plate is frontozygomatic suture, as most appropriate anchorage of screws and most suitable fixation is achieved at this site. On the contrary, Parashar <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Ho,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hanemann <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] observed in their study that three-point fixation group maintained better stability at the fracture site resulting in decreased incidence of dystopia and enophthalmos, they had better malar projection and malar height as measured radiographically, when compared with two-point or one-point fixation group.</p><p>The complications that were observed in our study were intraoperative complications and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complication included screw breakage. This was seen in only one case in which the fixation was done at zygomatic buttress with biodegradable plates. This happened during the screw tightening and was seen in the first case which was done with the biodegradable plate which suggested that there is a learning curve with this material. This complication was also seen in the study of Menon <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Wittwer <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Bessho <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] On the contrary, there were no intraoperative complication seen with titanium plates.</p><p>In our study, postoperative complication included plate exposure and infection at the site after 6 months in one patient in which fixation was done with biodegradable plate at zygomatic buttress [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>]. The plate was not removed rather they were treated conservatively with the antibiotic and the healing occurred.

Pupillary reflex was reduced for the first postoperative day in two patients but on 3 months review no patient was suffering from decreased pupillary reflex. All the patients were on soft diet on the first postoperative day, but thereafter all the patients were on normal diet and no patient reported with decreased biting efficiency for the next 6 months follow-up.</p><p>The postoperative radiograph showed adequate reduction in all the cases and only holes were seen where the biodegradable plate were placed.</p><p>Thus, in our study, we observed that there was uneventful healing of the zygomatic complex fracture in almost all patients and both the systems provided adequate stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Reviewing results from all the aspects and keeping in mind the limitation and variables in this study, it can be concluded that though two-point and three-point fixations provides more stable fixation, but acceptable stability can also be achieved with one-point fixation either at frontozygomatic suture or at zygomatic buttress as was the case in our study.</p><p>Also, there is no significant difference in postoperative outcomes between two groups, but still bioresorbable system has some advantage over titanium system as these plates' resorbes over a period of time and does not cause any interference with growth and postoperative radiotherapy. However, application of biodegradable system demanded a highly pr&#x000e9;cised technique as compared with titanium system.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahluwalia</surname><given-names>TP</given-names></name><name><surname>Jatin</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Changing picture of facial fractures: A retrospective study with special, reference to incidence and etiology</article-title><source>Indian J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>2002</year><fpage>172</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Divya</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fractures of zygomatic complex: An evaluation of surgical management</article-title><source>J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>2003</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>2</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Etiology and management of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures in armed forces</article-title><source>MJAFI</source><year>2005</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>3</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chowdhary</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of bioresorbable vis-&#x000e0;-vis titanium plates and screws for craniofacial fractures and osteotomies</article-title><source>MJAFI</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>331</fpage><lpage>3</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dziadek</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cie&#x0015b;lik</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Causes and effects of zygomatico orbital and zygomatico-maxillo-orbital fractures managed by open reduction and rigid internal fixation?</article-title><source>Ann Univ Mariae Curie Sklodowska Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>44</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16146047</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>Zachary SFacial trauma, zygomatic complex fractures; emedicine &#x02013; facial trauma, zygomatic complex fracture</source><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 11 Mar 2009</date-in-citation><comment>Available from: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.emedicine.com/Plastic/topic531.htm">http://www.emedicine.com/Plastic/topic531.htm</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>MOC-PS CME Article: Zygomatic fractures</article-title><source>Plast Reconstr Surg</source><year>2008</year><volume>121</volume><issue>(1S)</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>11</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Courtney</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Upper buccal sulcus approach to management of fracture of the zygomatic complex: A retrospective study of 50 cases</article-title><source>Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1999</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>464</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10687908</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref9"><label>9</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Ho</given-names></name></person-group><source>Zygomaticomaxillary Complex Fracture.
