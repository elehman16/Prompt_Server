Physical examination and clinical laboratory findings were assessed at visit 1 and visit 5, with Tanner stage of development assessed at visit 1 only. Patient&#x02019;s and/or parent&#x02019;s global assessment of overall well-being was assessed at baseline and week 6. This assessment consisted of the parent/legal guardian of the patient placing a vertical line on a visual analog scale of 1&#x02013;100 mm (where 0 = very well and 100 = very poor) to indicate a response to the statement: &#x0201c;Considering all the ways that arthritis affects your child, rate how your child is doing&#x0201d;. Patients aged &#x02265;8 years at baseline also evaluated their own well-being using the same method, in response to the statement &#x0201c;Considering all the ways that arthritis affects you, rate how you are doing&#x0201d;. AEs were evaluated during visits 2&#x02013;5.

The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline and 90% or 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. Change from baseline BP was also analyzed using a repeated measures model for sensitivity analysis. All randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication were eligible for analysis. The primary analysis was conducted using the safety population. Sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy safety measure (change from baseline to week 6/early termination in SBP). A sample size of 100 patients per treatment group would provide a 90% CI with an expected width of 4.42 mm Hg. The standard deviation (SD) used for the sample size calculation was based on a recent trial conducted by Pfizer in JIA patients (Study N49-01-02-195), which yielded a SD of 9.5 mm Hg for change in SBP. With 100 patients per group and with the above assumption on the SD, the study had 90% power to detect 3.95 mm Hg difference between the celecoxib and naproxen treatment groups, at the &#x003b1;-level of 0.1. Similarly, 100 patients per group with the same SD assumption had 90% power to detect 4.42 mm Hg difference between the celecoxib and naproxen treatment groups, at the &#x003b1;-level of 0.05.

In a post hoc analysis of BP data from that study, there was no difference between the two treatments in SBP or DBP change from baseline. In this study, we obtained similar results (with 95% confidence) and detected no significant difference when changes in SBP from baseline measurements were assessed at week 2 and for DBP at weeks 2, 4, and 6/final visit. The evaluation of the changes in SBP at week 4 indicated a treatment difference between celecoxib and naproxen, but this difference was small and not considered to be clinically important. The results of the sensitivity analysis, which applied a repeated-measures model for weeks 2, 4, and 6 were consistent with the primary analysis.</p><p>A retrospective cohort study in adults, which compared the effects of celecoxib, naproxen, and ibuprofen on BP in adult patients with hypertension, demonstrated that all three NSAIDs were associated with moderate mean increases (2 mm Hg) in SBP.<xref rid="b10-cmped-9-2015-055" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Consistent with these data and with the known vascular and hemodynamic effects of NSAIDs, our assessment of 24-hour ABPM measurements showed that both celecoxib and naproxen increased 24-hour SBP and DBP slightly. After 6 weeks of treatment, both celecoxib and naproxen exhibited nominal changes in 24-hour mean SBP: celecoxib increased mean (SD) SBP by 2.4 &#x000b1; 7.0 mm Hg while naproxen increased SBP by 1.9 &#x000b1; 4.1 mm Hg after exclusion of an outlier from the analysis, whose data were considered to be clinically implausible. These slight increases were similar for both drugs and were not considered to be clinically relevant. Awake and asleep mean values for SBP and DBP followed a similar pattern.</p><p>This study also evaluated efficacy of the study treatments via the patient&#x02019;s and parent&#x02019;s assessments of overall well-being. No statistically significant differences in the LS mean changes from baseline to week 6/final visit were observed between celecoxib and naproxen for these assessments, and a similar proportion of patients in each treatment group) reported &#x02265;30% improvement in overall well-being. The efficacy of celecoxib for the treatment of JIA has previously been confirmed in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study that assessed the effects of 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg doses with 7.5 mg/kg naproxen.<xref rid="b13-cmped-9-2015-055" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When the effect of celecoxib treatment was assessed against the American College of Rheumatology&#x02019;s pediatric 30% improvement criteria,<xref rid="b15-cmped-9-2015-055" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> both doses were found to be at least as effective as naproxen.</p><p>In this study population, celecoxib and naproxen demonstrated comparable and acceptable safety and tolerability profiles that were consistent with their known profiles. Most TEAEs were considered to be of mild to moderate intensity. A limitation of this study is the relatively short duration of the observation period (6 weeks). Furthermore, ABPM data were collected from only a small subset of patients, making it difficult to extrapolate these results. Nevertheless, from the results of this study, it can be concluded that celecoxib is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment effect of celecoxib, compared to naproxen, on blood pressure (BP) in pediatric subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Celecoxib is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment for the JIA; however, there are limited data about the cardiovascular effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in children. This study examined the effect of celecoxib treatment on BP levels in a pediatric population. The results demonstrate no significant effect on BP of either celecoxib or naproxen in children. These findings can support physicians&#x02019; decision-making when prescribing safe and effective treatments for children and young people who have JIA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Editorial support was provided by Kate Bradford, PhD, of PAREXEL.
