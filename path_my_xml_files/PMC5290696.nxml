CVD is one of the major causes of nontraumatic death and is responsible for approximately 20% of all deaths of individuals older than 30 years in Brazil.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The last epidemiological study on the subject revealed that 962,931 individuals older than 30 years had died in 2009, with CVD responsible for 95,449 deaths and stroke for 97,860 deaths.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Recently, clinical and public health efforts to reduce the impact of CVD have highlighted the importance of calculating the short-term death risk by examining trends in the predicted 10-year risk for CVD with algorithms derived from the Framingham Heart Study.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Furthermore, in many cases, the disease severity may lead patients to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).</p><p>The surgical procedure is complex, and most interventions need a sternal longitudinal incision, which can cause moderate to severe pain postsurgery, as well as nonnegligible incidence of chronic pain, which can persist for more than 1 year. Pain intensity around the incision has been described as higher on the 7<sup>th</sup> day postsurgery compared to 1 month after hospital discharge, and it has significant repercussions on functionality. Adequate analgesia after a sternotomy reduces postoperative adverse events and improves patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The analgesic effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) have been validated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Possible mechanisms of action include endorphin secretion stimulation, reduction of interstitial fluid at the site of inflammation with a marked increase in vasodilatation, and improvement in local circulation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] LLLT also can stimulate immediate analgesia to control neuropathic pain by releasing local neurotransmitters such as serotonin, promoting the release of endorphins, or increasing mitochondrial ATP production, or through anti-inflammatory effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although many studies have been performed to help understand the analgesic and tissue repair mechanisms of LLLT,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] additional clinical studies are necessary to better understand those effects.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LLLT for reducing acute pain from sternotomy in patients who underwent CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>All of the individuals provided written, informed consent, and their rights were protected. The protocol for this study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee, CAAE 0127.0.043.000-11, and registered with the Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization under RBR-38wgx6 and Universal Trial Number U1111-1128-9666, respectively.</p><p>This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial containing both a placebo and a control group. It was carried out at Santa Maria Hospital that performs cardiac surgery for the Brazilian public health system, in Teresina, Piaui, Brazil. All patients admitted to the hospital during the study period were invited to participate if they had indicated interest in having CABG and met the inclusion criteria. The study was conducted with ninety volunteers who were randomly allocated into three groups of equal size (<italic>n</italic> = 30): control, placebo, and laser groups.</p><p>Patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery with a longitudinal sternotomy incision and extracorporeal circulation and patients between ages 18 and 75 years and of both sexes who were hemodynamically stable and had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were included in the study. Exclusion criteria consisted of previous thoracic surgery, emergency or urgent coronary artery bypass surgery, respiratory or renal insufficiency after surgery, low cardiac output syndrome, clinical complications that demanded changes in analgesic protocols, and any other postsurgery complications. Patients who could not be monitored during the 1<sup>st</sup> month after the operation were also excluded from the study.</p><p>The randomization and blinding procedures consisted of simply drawing cards marked 1, 2, 3, or 4, where 1 meant the control group, 2 meant the placebo group, and 4 meant the laser group, whereas 3 meant that the individual should be part of another group irradiated with light-emitting diode (LED), as part of secondary studies carried on by research group.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The drawing was performed during the patient's hospital admission, which always occurred at least 24 h before the surgery. The researchers were separated into therapists and evaluators. The therapists were assistants responsible for conducting the therapy and registering the procedures, and the evaluators were responsible for assessing the patients and their outcomes. Each patient was identified by a code registered by one of the therapist researchers, who ensured that the evaluating researchers were blinded to the code until the final statistical analysis was performed. The patients were blinded to the study by the use of opaque goggles during the laser irradiation.</p><p>A preoperative assessment consisted of an explanation of the procedures; inclusion and exclusion criteria certification; a clinical assessment, including laboratory tests; and group drawing. The laser group was subjected to irradiation immediately after surgery and on subsequent days 2, 4, 6, and 8. The irradiation was performed at spots alongside the incision 2 cm apart, perpendicularly and in contact with the skin, for a total of eight points. A translucent film protected the probe. The equipment's characteristics and irradiation parameters are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The placebo group was subjected to the laser application process but with the equipment turned off. The control group was only subjected to the assessment protocols and the follow-up. The outcome assessed was pain during the hospitalization period and after the 1<sup>st</sup> month postsurgery.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Parameters of the instruments used for phototherapy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Equipment</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Laser Hand MM Optics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy density (J/cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy (J)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Power (W)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot diameter (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot size (cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time of irradiation (s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Power density (W/cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment time per point (s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of spots</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SAEF</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wavelength (nm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">660</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SAEF = Power output &#x000d7; time treatment per point &#x000d7; point numbers/total treated area.

Pain was assessed using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire from day 2 to the 1<sup>st</sup> month postsurgery. Patients were stimulated to cough, and their level of pain was recorded at that moment. Coughing is important for these patients because they must be stimulated to keep their airways free from obstructions, which helps prevent respiratory complications in the postoperative period. The employed analgesic protocol was the one routinely set by the hospital, which consisted of tramadol hydrochloride and dipyrone administered intravenously on a fixed 6-h schedule. Morphine sulfate was administered on an as-needed basis. Those patients who needed morphine were excluded from the study. The patients were followed for 1 month after surgery, and their pain was also evaluated during this period.</p><p>The results were evaluated using the software STATISTICA 7.0 StatSoft<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> (Dell Statistica (Headquarters), Tulsa, United States).

Variables such as weight, height, and BMI presented no significant differences among the groups. Regarding gender, males had 2 times greater prevalence, which corresponds to epidemiological statistics for CVD.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Cardiac surgery with sternotomy causes acute pain immediately after surgery. A number of studies have suggested that cardiac surgery patients have significant pain after surgery in both the Intensive Care Unit and after their transfer to the floor. This pain is believed to be caused by peripheral mechanoreceptors that are stimulated during surgical procedures with sternal retraction. Most of the pain after a sternotomy is caused by damage to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, bone, and sternal cartilage.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The principal thoracic nerves providing sternum sensitivity are T2&#x02013;T6. Intercostal nerves arising from the thoracic nerve roots innervate the sternum, ribs, and surrounding subcutaneous tissue. The pericardium is innervated with pain fibers that ascend from the phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, and sympathetic trunks.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>After CABG, patients experience considerable pain during the critical postoperative period. Cardiac postsurgery pain can cause complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis because pain can limit a patient's ability to cough and mobilize efficiently. Moreover, persistent postoperative pain can have a negative psychological effect and delay postoperative recovery.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, pain was assessed by the VAS and the McGill questionnaire for the first time on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day after surgery. At this time, patients were conscious, extubated, breathing spontaneously, and, consequently, able to cooperate. The patients were stimulated to cough, and their pain level was recorded. The assessment was repeated every 2 days until the 1<sup>st</sup> day after hospital discharge, on the 8<sup>th</sup> day postsurgery, and again at the 1-month postsurgery follow-up. Yorke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied 104 patients&#x02019; perceptions of pain after cardiac surgery and reported that 46.1% of patients experienced pain with coughing, 26.5% with physical therapy, 32.4% with self-moving, and 27.4% with movement assisted by nurses. Lahtinen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also testified that cough was the main trigger for sternotomy pain after CABG. In their study with 113 patients, 78% mentioned pain when coughing as severe.</p><p>The VAS has been proven to be one of the most reliable scales for the evaluation of pain intensity.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Although the VAS is a subjective method of pain assessment, it is one of the best available options for pain studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, we can see that all groups experienced a pain decrease from the 2<sup>nd</sup> day to the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> month postsurgery, when patients recorded a pain level of zero. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> days, all groups had similar pain perception. Nevertheless, on the 6<sup>th</sup> day to 1<sup>st</sup> day after hospital discharge (the 8<sup>th</sup> day postsurgery), we noticed that the pain reduction was statistically greater in the laser group than in the placebo or control groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) when coughing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows a graph with pain perception according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed by Melzack to assess the sensory, affective, and evaluative dimensions of pain,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and it has been translated into Brazilian Portuguese and used to complement the VAS.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This instrument has also been used to evaluate pain after cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] According to the sensory dimension, the laser group experienced a lower pain level on days 6 and 8 postsurgery as compared to the control and placebo groups. When assessed by the affective dimension, the analgesic effect was observed on the 6<sup>th</sup> day. Evaluative and miscellaneous dimensions did not present any significant difference among the groups in pain perception. Sensory scores are comparable with those on the VAS assessment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], revealing an analgesic effect on the 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> days. However, the other dimensions were not capable of detecting this effect, which could be explained by the fact that sensory words are easier for patients who just underwent surgery to express. Yorke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] mentioned that sensory expressions had been used to describe surgical pain, including words such as sharp, stabbing, aching, and dull, and are expressed more easily by patients. Pimenta and Teixeira[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also mentioned that the sensory dimension had a higher impact on the McGill questionnaire on pain assessment. This idea was reinforced by Gauthier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] when validating the McGill Pain Questionnaire to assess pain in younger and older people with cancer.</p><p>Similarly, postoperative cardiac surgical patients related strong emotional components of pain, which could explain why that dimension could be considered more effective for revaluating postsurgical pain. This fact has important clinical implications. Patients are expected to ambulate and participate in a physiotherapy regimen beginning the day after surgery. When pain is not properly managed, patients may experience difficulties in reaching the planned goals of care. Khoueiry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that at baseline and 1 month postoperative, 98% of patients had some level of anxiety. Those findings were also reported by Lima <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Karlekar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and could support the higher influence of affective aspects on the McGill scores when applied to postoperative cardiac patients.</p><p>A number of studies revealed that LLLT could affect pain in multiple ways. de Jesus <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that in rats with partially injured Achilles tendons, LLLT probably modulated the pro-inflammatory agents by reducing the interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions and, consequently, reducing the PGE2 levels, and also by reducing cell migration and the quantity of neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages in the injured tissue. Furthermore, comparable results were found by Prianti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] who studied the COX-2 mRNA expression in both subplantar and total brain tissues in a model of peripheral inflammation induced by the administration of carrageenan. Souza <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that LLLT could reduce oxidative stress because it is associated with a mechanism involving the upregulation of histone deacetylase activity and the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced tumor necrosis factor and IL-8 secretion, which also results in pain control.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>As &#x0201c;adequate pain relief&#x0201d; was not defined, most of the patients remained with pain scores more than 5, up to day 6. This is a gross limitation, which we did not overcome.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the efficiency of a therapy protocol using LLLT (with 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) for analgesic purposes in patients who underwent CABG. With the present therapy parameters, it may be assumed from our data that LLLT was effective in controlling pain mainly after the 6<sup>th</sup> day postsurgery. Further study is needed to clarify the influence of different protocols and doses and their effects on mediators and cell types in inflammatory models and clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the Uninovafapi College and Santa Maria Hospital for administrative support.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferreira-Gonz&#x000e1;lez</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The epidemiology of coronary heart disease</article-title><source>Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed)</source><year>2014</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>139</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24795124</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mansur Ade</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Favarato</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in Brazil and in the metropolitan region of S&#x000e3;o Paulo: A 2011 update</article-title><source>Arq Bras Cardiol</source><year>2012</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>755</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22735870</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Dyer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Garside</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ning</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2012</year><volume>366</volume><fpage>321</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22276822</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trends in predicted 10-year risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease among U.S. adults from 1999 to 2010</article-title><source>J Am Coll Cardiol</source><year>2013</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>2249</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23563124</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakata</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pain after sternotomy &#x02013; Review</article-title><source>Rev Bras Anestesiol</source><year>2016</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>395</fpage><lpage>401</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25796483</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aras</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Omezli</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000fc;ng&#x000f6;rm&#x000fc;s</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Does low-level laser therapy have an antianesthetic effect?
