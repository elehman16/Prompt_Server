self-massage using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup> versus ibuprofen on reducing upper
back pain associated with myofascial trigger points. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty patients
who were diagnosed as having upper back pain associated with myofascial trigger points
were randomly allocated to either a massage group using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup>
or a medication group taking ibuprofen for 5 days. Both groups were advised to perform the
same daily stretching exercise program. Pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, tissue
hardness, and cervical range of motion were assessed at baseline, immediately after the
first treatment session, and on the fifth day after the last treatment session. [Results]
The massage group had significant improvement in all parameters at all assessment time
points. Similar changes were observed in the medication group except for the pressure pain
threshold and tissue hardness. The adjusted post-test mean values for each assessment time
point were significantly better in the massage group than in the medication group.
[Conclusion] Tradition Thai self-massage using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup> provides
better results than taking ibuprofen for patients who have upper back pain associated with
myofascial trigger points. It could be an alternative treatment for this patient
population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Massage</kwd><kwd>Massage stick</kwd><kwd>Trigger points</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are involved in pain associated with autonomic nervous
systems caused by one or several hyperirritable spots called trigger points (TrPs) in muscle
tissues or fascia, leading to muscle stiffness and hence loss or failure of bodily
systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and neuromuscular
dysfunction<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment of MTrPs is
aimed at relieving or eliminating TrPs and include pharmacological approaches, such as the
administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in conjunction with muscle
relaxants or painkillers, and non-pharmacological approaches, such as ischemic compression
and massage<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
non-pharmacological approaches, massage is considered an effective treatment for MTrPs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In Thailand, traditional Thai massage (TTM)
is practiced nationwide for alleviating musculoskeletal pain. The main technique of TTM
focuses on pressing the points along the massage meridian lines using the thumbs or palms
(which provide deeper pressure) followed by stretching the affected muscles and joints. A
study regarding the effectiveness of Thai exercise with traditional massage for pain,
walking ability, and QOL of older people with knee osteoarthritis also indicated that Thai
massage with exercise results in pain alleviation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although massage is an effective treatment, it usually requires a
therapist or another individual, since patients may not be able to reach certain body parts,
such as the upper back, by themselves. Thus, self-massage using appropriate equipment should
be a viable option. One research applied a device called a Thera Cane to provide ischemic
pressure followed by sustained stretching in the treatment of MTrPs and found that the
treatment was effective in reducing TrP sensitivity and pain intensity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, a piece of equipment called the
Backnobber II was examined for its effectiveness in the relief of discomfort associated with
MTrPs. The results indicated that the device was effective in bringing down muscle and
fascia pain and irritability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. These two
types of self-massage stick, are however, a bit heavy and, relatively rigid (non-elastic
property) when performing the self-massage. The Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup> is a
lightweight device especially invented for self-massage and is made from an aluminum shaft
with a 1-inch diameter bent into a shape resembling a hook. The curve of the stick was
designed according to ergonomics principles to enhance gripping and handling while
performing self-massage. The tip of the stick is slightly raised and has a wooden massage
ball that is 1.2 inches in diameter. A preliminary study suggested that it could decrease
pain and increase active range of motion (AROM) in patients with upper back pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. An experimental study with a control group
and appropriate sample size has not been conducted to verify these effects. Therefore, the
objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional Thai massage
using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup> in comparison with the administration of ibuprofen
in reducing pain intensity and tissue hardness and in increasing the pressure pain threshold
(PPT) and cervical range of motion (CROM) in patients with upper back pain associated with
MTrPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was a randomized controlled trial approved by the Ethics Review Committee for
Research Involving Human Research Subjects of the Health Science Group of Chulalongkorn
University (COA No. 082/2557). It was conducted at the Traditional Thai Medicine Clinic of
Lat Lum Kaew Hospital, Thailand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow chart of entry and discontinuation by participants during the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3493-g001"/></fig>). The participants received information on the research through poster and radio
announcement during June 2014 and November 2014. They gave informed consent for
participation in the study. The patients included in the study were 18- to 60-year-old males
and females diagnosed with upper back and having least 1 TrP for at least 12 weeks. In
accordance with the method of following Travell and Simon<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, the diagnosis involved the presence of 1) a palpable taut band, 2)
palpable nodule, and 3) palpable spot tenderness. At the time of the research, they had
stopped using painkillers, NSAIDs, and/or other forms of treatment for at least 2 days.
Patients were excluded from the study based on any history of disease or disorder that may
be contraindicated for TTM such as contagious skin disease, injury or inflammation of
muscle, bone fracture and/or joint dislocation, open wounds, and cervical radiculopathy, as
were pregnant or breastfeeding women. Patients who expressed unwillingness to continue their
participation in the research; suffered from severe side effects of the administration of
ibuprofen or massage with the Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup>, such as gastrointestinal
bleeding or greater pain intensity; received other types of treatment other than those
prescribed by the doctor during their participation, such as acupuncture and medical
injection; and failed to follow the conditions of the research or missed appointments were
also excluded. Sixty subjects passing the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to
treatment with self-massage using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup> (TTMW) or treatment
with ibuprofen (control), which was accomplished using a simple random sampling approach.
There were 30 subjects in each group. The subjects were examined by a licensed
physiotherapist who was not informed of their group before the beginning of the treatment,
at day 1, at day 2, and at day 5 after the last treatment. In the Wilai massage
stick<sup>TM</sup> group (TTMW group), the patients were provided instructions regarding
self-massage according to TTM principles as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Holding a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3493-g002"/></fig>). The upper back was to be divided into the left side and the right
side using the spinal processes as the point of reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>The meridian massage lines of TTM on the upper back<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3493-g003"/></fig>). For each side, there were two massage lines. The first one was about the width of a
finger from the spinous processes, and the second line was about the width of three fingers
from the spinous processes. Each line was further comprised of eight points on the upper
back region. The self-massage was performed in a sitting or standing posture, starting from
the first point along the massage line on the left side of the back. The pressure was
gradually increased until mild pain was felt, maintained for 5 seconds, and then released.
This was performed for all the eight points and then repeated 5 times. The procedures were
performed for all the massage lines of both sides of the back, lasting approximately 10
minutes and follow stretching exercise 2 minutes. Thus, the total duration of each treatment
was 12 minutes, and the treatment was continued for 5 days. In the medication group, the
patient took 400&#x02005;mg ibuprofen three times a day after each meal and performed muscle
stretching 2 minutes every day for 5 days. The medication was prescribed by a licensed
medical doctor. The primary outcome was pain intensity rated with a visual analog scale
(VAS). The secondary outcomes included the PPT, tissue hardness, and CROM. These secondary
outcome measures were measured by a physical therapist that was blinded with respect to the
group allocation of the patients. The pain intensity was measured with a VAS. The patients
were asked to rate the intensity of pain at the time of measurement and then marked an &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;
on a 10-cm-long straight line that had the numbers 0 (indicating on pain at all) to 10
(indicating the most severe pain) marked on it from left to right. The PPT was measured
using a tissue hardness meter/algometer (OE-220,ITO Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a pressure
tip having a 1&#x02005;cm diameter. Pressure was exerted vertically at a constant speed (1&#x02005;kg/sec)
on a TrP of the upper back and was gradually increased until the patients felt pain and
pushed a button on to the algometer. Then the applied pressure was recorded. This process
was done 3 times, and the reading were averaged for statistical analysis. Measurement of
tissue hardness was performed using the tissue hardness meter/algometer (OE-220, ITO
Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 10-cm diameter plastic disc and the measuring tool
was adjusted to the tissue hardness measuring mode. The device has a preset pressure sensor,
and the displacement of the 1-cm pressure tip with respect to the disc indicates the tissue
hardness. Pressure was gradually and vertically exerted from the handle of the tool onto the
painful pressure point to be examined until a beep sounded from the tool, and the tissue
hardness was then automatically recorded. This was carried out 3 times, and the readings
were averaged for statistical analysis. The CROM of the patients was measured with a CROM
goniometer, and the measurements included flexion, extension, left lateral flexion, and
right lateral flexion. Each motion was measured 3 times, and the readings were averaged for
statistical analysis. A reliability study was performed for each outcome measure before the
study using 10 upper back pain patients to measure the pain intensity (VAS, intraclass
correlation coefficient [ICC] =0.97), PPT (ICC=0.92), tissue hardness, and CROM (ICC=0.97).
All outcomes measures showed a high degree of correlation with an ICC over 0.90. All
statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics,
including the mean, percentage, and standard error (SE) were used to describe continuous and
concrete variables. The within-group inferential statistic used was repeated measure
analysis of variance (ANOVA), whereas the between-group inferential statistic employed was
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In order to account for baseline differences, the
pretreatment results were employed as covariates. The degree of confidence was established
at 0.05. Post hoc testing using Fisher&#x02019;s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was applied
for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The average ages of the patients participating in the study were 42.8&#x000b1;10.0 and 41.6&#x000b1;11.7 in

upper back pain associated with MTrPs. This is consistent with the findings reported
elsewhere in the literature. For example, in a study investigating the use of a Thera Cane
in patients with TrPs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was found that
the application of ischemic pressure with the device was able to reduce pain when continued
for 5 days followed by sustained stretching. In another study, use of activator TrP
therapeutic equipment was found to be able to reduce pain in patients suffering from
nonspecific neck pain with upper trapezius TrPs when 10 thrusts were performed at the rate
of 1 thrust per second<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It should be
point out, however, that those studies did not apply TTM principles and differed markedly
from the present research in terms of the types of patients, body parts treated, pressure,
treatment procedures, duration, and the equipment involved. A comparison of TTMW and
ibuprofen revealed a statistically significant difference between the two types of
treatment. Specifically, although both treatments were generally effective in treating
patients with upper back pain associated with MTrPs, the former was found to contribute to
greater pain reduction than the latter as shown in <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The superior effectiveness of TTMW may be explained by the gate control
theory, which postulates that the exertion of pressure through the skin and muscle tissues
will stimulate pressure receptors, thereby blocking the gate transmitting pain nerve
impulses at the spinal cord level<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
finding indicates the effectiveness of TTMW in increasing PPT, supporting the results of a
study examining the effects of the Backnobber II on upper back TrPs when treatment is
carried out in 30-second session 6 times every other day for 1 week<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, similar procedures were performed
with the Wilai stick for massaging the upper back and shoulders (i.e., area where MTrPs are
most felt), following TTM principles, in conjunction with muscle stretching. Such findings
are not surprising as it has been reported that massage together with muscle stretching can
relieve muscle tightness and aid muscles in returning to a normal state, thereby reducing
pain sensitivity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results
demonstrate that TTMW is effective in increasing flexion, extension, left lateral flexion,
and right lateral flexion. The effects were felt immediately after the first treatment
session and 1 day after the last treatment session. Even at day 5 after the last treatment
session, the increase in extension and left lateral flexion remained high at 5&#x000b0; which was
considered a clinically significant figure. This might be due to the relaxation effect of
TTMW, which mobilizes the facet joints of the thoracic spine as well as the upper back and
posterior neck muscles. On the other hand, ibuprofen did not bring about such results
despite being able to alleviate pain, a finding consistent with that in past research
reporting the effectiveness of pharmacological approaches in reducing pain, but not in
increasing CROM<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This finding points to
the effectiveness of TTMW in reducing tissue hardness. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, also lead
to similar effects, but probably by a different mechanism. Specifically, they inhibit the
production of prostaglandin, which in turn relieves inflammation and pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the action of drugs has
systemic effects and involves pharmacological stimulation. On the other hand, TTM involves
the stimulation of blood circulation and nerve endings, resulting in reflexive effects that
reduce muscle contraction and hardness<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>,
a mechanism different from that associated with administration of drugs<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. TTMW applies compression, i.e., the exertion of pressure
on muscle fibers, along massage lines, which enhances the circulation of arterial blood to
the massage area<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and the removal of
toxins from the affected areas through venous blood. This mechanism helps to relax muscle
stiffness or tension and improve motion and flexibility. Also, sustained pressure, an
inhibition technique, can block the transmission of nerve impulses and thus reduce muscle
spasm. Traditional Thai self-massage was found to be a better alternative than
pharmacological approaches in the treatment of patients with upper back pain associate with
MTrPs. Based on the results of the present study, the procedures recommended to ensure the
effectiveness of TTMW are as follows. TTMW is advice, but pressure is not necessary to be
exerted directly on TrPs. In other words, patients should be instructed to use a Wilai
stick<sup>TM</sup> to carry out self-massage without having to identify the TrP location.
In addition, pressure should be gradually increased until mild pain is felt. Furthermore,
massage should be done 5 times for each of the massage lines along the upper back area.
Finally, pressure should be maintained for 5 seconds on each massage point to enhance muscle
relaxation. One limitation of this research is that comparison with a group receiving a
placebo treatment or not receiving any treatment at all could not be performed due to
ethical requirements. Another matter of concern is the different skills of each patient in
using a Wilai massage stick<sup>TM</sup>. Finally, the results may involve some degrees of
human error, as patients&#x02019; perceptions of pain and PPT are subjective, varying from person to
person. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of TTMW in the treatment of
patients with upper back pain associated with MTrPs. Thus, it should be a viable
alternative, especially for those suffering from adverse effects of anti-inflammatory drugs,
as it poses little (minimal degree of muscle soreness in some patients) or no side effects
risks. Further research along this line should examine the long-term effects of TTMW.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research
