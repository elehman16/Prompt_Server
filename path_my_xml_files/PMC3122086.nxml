Antioxidant therapy in the form of high-dose vitamin has been used for the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis with equivocal results. We wished to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antioxidant (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E) therapy in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Setting and design: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label with blinded endpoint assessment study of antioxidant therapy, conducted in the emergency department attached to our hospital.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Thirty-nine patients with severe acute pancreatitis were randomly assigned to antioxidant treatment group (<italic>n</italic>=19) or a control group (<italic>n</italic>=20) within 96 hours of developing symptoms. Patients in the antioxidant group received antioxidants (vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C) in addition to the standard treatment provided to both the groups for a period of 14 days. The primary outcome variable was presence of organ dysfunction at day 7. The secondary outcome variables were length of hospital stay, multiorgan dysfunction (MODS) at day 7, recovery at the end of 4 weeks, complications, and mortality. The change in markers of oxidative stress from baseline was also measured.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated no significant difference in organ dysfunction (<italic>P</italic>=1.0), MODS (<italic>P</italic>=0.8), and length of hospital stay (<italic>P</italic>=0.29) between the two groups. All the patients survived in the antioxidant-treated group, whereas two patients died in the control group. The change in the levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione were not significantly different in the two groups at day 7. Univariate analysis showed marginal benefit with antioxidant treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.034) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This randomized study demonstrates that there is no significant benefit from antioxidant therapy in patients with established severe acute pancreatitis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute pancreatitis</kwd><kwd>antioxidant</kwd><kwd>free radicals</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is predominantly secondary to symptomatic gallstone disease and excessive alcohol intake. Because of improvements in the management, including better diagnostics and treatment modalities, disease-related mortality has declined during the past two decades despite an increase in the overall incidence of AP in many countries. Most AP episodes are mild and self-limiting. However, about one-fifth of patients develop a severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), which is associated with a mortality rate of 40%. This type of AP is characterized by necrosis of the pancreas and surrounding tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>]</p><p>Recent research has indicated that oxidative stress caused by short-lived intracellular oxygen-free radicals is one of the mediators of acinar injury in AP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Oxidative stress occurs when oxygen-derived free radicals overwhelm endogenous oxidative defenses, causing damage to the cellular constituents. A number of experimental models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] have shown that glutathione and other sulphydryl compounds are depleted and lipid peroxidation is increased in models of AP. Endogenous enzymic free radical scavengers are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and glutathione peroxidase, and the non-enzymic scavengers are carotenes, ascorbic acid, and tocopherol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>Beneficial effects of antioxidants and free radical scavengers have been shown in experimental models of AP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Marked improvement in indices of pancreatic injury such as acinar cell injury and edema following treatment with enzymic antioxidants, vitamin C analogues, and glutathione monoethyl ester has been demonstrated. A few clinical studies are available;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] notable amongst them is a small randomized control trial conducted by Siriwardena <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Although these molecular and clinical studies provide a rational framework for studying the effect of antioxidant supplementation, there is limited data available on the effect of vitamin antioxidant supplementation in patients with SAP. The available clinical evidence is limited by studies including patients with mild disease and by heterogeneous definition of disease severity and complications. The lack of substantive evidence of benefit from antioxidant therapy in AP means that this treatment forms no part of contemporary guidelines for the management of this disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>The present study tries to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin (A, C, and E) supplementation in patients with SAP as defined by computed tomography (CT) severity grading.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-center, prospective randomized, open-label with blinded endpoint assessment study of antioxidant therapy, conducted over a period of 1 year in the emergency OPD attached to the Nehru hospital, PGIMER, Chandigarh, in patients with SAP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion/Exclusion criteria</title><p>We included in this study adult patients of either gender between 18 and 75 years of age presenting to the medical emergency unit, and whose clinical and biochemical presentation was consistent with AP (specifically, a history of acute abdominal pain associated with a greater than threefold elevation of the serum amylase and/or lipase &#x0003e;3 times normal, along with CT evidence of AP). Severe AP was defined for the purposes of this study as an APACHE II score of 8 or more at admission[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] and CT severity index (CTSI) &#x02265;7.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] Only those patients presenting with a first attack or an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis were enrolled. The patients were enrolled within 96 hours of onset of the symptoms. All the criteria had to be present before the patient could be randomized. Exclusion criteria were: age &#x0003c;18 or &#x0003e;75 years; pregnancy; AP secondary to surgery, trauma, or malignancy; psychosis (except alcoholic delirium); need for urgent therapeutic intervention (endoscopic papillotomy, cholecystectomy, and/or choledochotomy); those enrolled in any other trial; patients with serious diseases of the heart, brain, liver, or kidney; peptic ulcer; autoimmune disease. The study was conducted after getting written permission from the institutional ethics committee. All the patients signed written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Standards of clinical care for SAP</title><p>The eligible patients were admitted to the medical emergency ward. A detailed history and general physical examination was carried out. CT of all the patients was done at admission to assess the severity of the condition. The standard basal treatment according to generally accepted principles and other optional treatment, if required, were given to all patients. Prophylactic antibiotics were used at the discretion of the treating clinician. Patients were followed up until discharge from hospital (or death).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study medication</title><p>In the present study, the patients were randomized (blocks of four) to two parallel groups: antioxidant group and control group. The antioxidant group received, in addition to maximal conventional therapy, vitamin C (1000 mg in 100 ml normal saline), vitamin E (200 mg oral), and vitamin A (10000 IU intramuscularly).The antioxidants were administered once daily. Initially the drugs were given parenterally (except vitamin E, as no parenteral formulation is available), followed by oral administration as soon as the patient&#x02019;s condition permitted. The treatment was continued for 14 days from the day of enrolment into the trial. The control group was given the standard treatment only. The selection of doses was done according to previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Vitamin C was used in a megadose of 1 g/day, since there is evidence of early ascorbic acid depletion in patients with pancreatitis. The dose of vitamin A was sufficient to cure the deficiency without causing toxicity.

Close scrutiny of the two deaths in the control group revealed that both patients had coagulopathy at admission. One patient was 28 and the other 53 years old. Duration of disease from admission to death was 23 and 3 days, respectively. The probable cause of death was multiple organ failure secondary to SAP in both of them, but nosocomial infection may have contributed to demise.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we looked at the role of vitamin antioxidants in established SAP. In experimental AP, oxidative stress mediates (but does not initiate) acinar cell injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] and there is clinical evidence of serum antioxidant depletion during the course of AP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] There is little data available on the exact role of supplemental antioxidant vitamin therapy in high doses during the course of AP.</p><p>The presence of organ dysfunction and MODS at day 7 showed no significant difference in the two groups. Although the mean duration of hospital stay was decreased in the antioxidant-treated group, this did not reach statistical significance. A separate <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was done excluding one patient in the control group who died early (on day 3), and the analysis then showed a trend towards a further decrease in the mean stay in hospital with the antioxidant supplementation (<italic>P</italic>=0.07). Two deaths in the control group and none in the treatment group suggests some benefit in the patients receiving antioxidants, but the number of patients in each group is too small to make any meaningful conclusions. Overall, there was little clinical improvement seen with antioxidant therapy in patients with SAP.</p><p>The increase in the levels of free radicals, as shown by raised levels of MDA at admission, was decreased on subsequent analysis at day 7 in both the groups. The depleted levels of SOD and GSH were restored to some extent late in the course of treatment in both groups, but the rise was not statistically significant post-supplementation in the treatment group. This, suggests that antioxidant administration did not significantly help in quenching free radicals generated during the inflammatory process of AP.</p><p>Our findings differ from that of an earlier study in which a high dose (10 g/day) of vitamin C was administered,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] probably due to the relatively low dose (1 g/day) that we used. It might be postulated that stabilization of the disease naturally in due course, with conventional treatment and good ICU care, may have resulted in the decrease in oxidative stress markers in the samples collected at day 7 in both the groups.</p><p>The complication score was higher in the treatment group at inclusion. This was a chance finding. The median difference between the complication scores at inclusion and over the course of treatment (newly developed complications) was 7 in both the groups. The univariate analysis (taking the baseline variability into consideration) showed only marginal improvement with the treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.034) in the antioxidant-treated group. There were few new complications that emerged in the intervention group as compared to the control group. The occurrence of two deaths in the control group may be a chance finding, or could have resulted from a higher baseline CTSI (early death) or development of nosocomial infection (late death). Although the difference in mortality between the two groups did not reach statistical significance it is clinically relevant, as antioxidant supplementation could modulate end organ injury and prevent mortality.</p><p>Current experimental evidence suggests that multiple antioxidant supplementation modulates end organ injury in experimental AP when intervention is done early in the disease course,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>] but not when intervention is delayed. Antioxidant therapy may be able to modulate mild to moderate injury but may not affect the more severe forms of disease, as seen in this study. Compared with an earlier cohort study, in which the median delay in instituting antioxidants was 2 (range: 0-7) days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] and another randomized controlled study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] in which the delay has not been mentioned, the antioxidant supplementation in the present study was administered with a median delay of 3 days (range: 1&#x02013;8). The delay suggests that there was a well-established inflammatory process before the intervention. This is clinically relevant, since the concept of the &#x02018;therapeutic window&#x02019;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>] suggests that the best chance of success is by intervening at the disease inception. It is possible that the different outcomes in our study may also have been related to the time delay in instituting antioxidant therapy.</p><p>The trend for decreased hospital stay and development of fewer complications can translate into lower cost of hospitalization; however, a study conducted with a large sample size would be required to provide conclusive results. It is also possible that recruiting more patients may lead to a statistically significant fall in the mean duration of hospital stay, but then it may also result in increase in the number of new complications. The two deaths in the control group also carry clinical relevance, which could become statistically significant with an adequately powered study.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. This study was conducted over a 1-year period and the recruitment was not undertaken to satisfy a pre-specified power calculation but was limited to a planned recruitment period. As a result, the number of patients in both groups is small. The dose of vitamin C used in our study is also relatively low, but this may have been compensated for by the other two agents used as antioxidants. We could have studied the effect of individual antioxidants separately but for that a very large sample size would be needed, which was not feasible during the short study period. Also, the open-label nature of the study could have resulted in the introduction of some bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The present study shows that vitamin-based antioxidant therapy has no significant beneficial effect on organ dysfunction or on clinical outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis during the hospital stay. Larger multicenter studies are required to address this issue in a more comprehensive manner.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
