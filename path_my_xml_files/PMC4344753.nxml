Long-term mortality among patients discharged alive after OHCA does not differ markedly from that of myocardial infarct (MI) patients without OHCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a recent study of Lindner and colleagues, the five-year survival rate for OHCA patients discharged from hospital alive was 75%, and the mean potential life-years saved per patient was 22.8&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, not only survival but also functional outcome and quality of life are important long-term outcomes.</p><p>Neurologic outcome after CA is commonly evaluated by Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This five-step category classification is simple, but it has a limited value in discriminating between mild and moderate brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cognitive deficits may markedly impair the functional status of CA survivors and their quality of life. Regrettably, the CPC classification does not comprise cognitive impairment in conscious subjects, unless the impairment is severe. The increased survival of OHCA-VF patients in the hypothermia-era does not seem to be associated with decrease in survivors with clinically significant cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Comprehensive data on functional outcome of OHCA patients is still limited. As the number of CA survivors is increasing, there is clearly a need for data of their functional outcome and quality of life.</p><p>Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the functional neurologic and cognitive outcome of hypothermia treated OHCA-VF survivors and their quality of life in a cohort of OHCA-VF patients included in a randomised controlled trial on strict versus moderate glucose control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH). All postresuscitation patients in the HUCH area with witnessed OHCA caused by VF and admitted to the two participating intensive care units (ICU) from November 2004 to December 2006 were screened for the SUGAR-trial. The inclusion criteria were VF of presumed cardiac origin, witnessed arrest, age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years, basic life support (BLS) delay less than 15&#x000a0;min, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) less than 35&#x000a0;min and unconsciousness at hospital admission. Exclusion criteria were persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure below 65&#x000a0;mmHg for over 30&#x000a0;min) despite therapy, pregnancy, terminal illness, pre-arrest illness limiting follow-up (eg. dementia), or a do not attempt resuscitation order. After obtaining informed consent from a close relative, patients were randomized into a strict (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mmol/l) or a moderate (6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;mmol/l) glucose control group for the first 48&#x000a0;hours of treatment in the ICU. Short-acting insulin was used in both groups as needed. All patients received therapeutic hypothermia of 33&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;hours induced with an intravascular cooling device (CoolGard, Zoll Medical Corporation), followed by slow warming (warming rate not exceeding 0.5&#x000b0;C per hour) to normothermia. General treatment of the patients was conducted according to the ICU&#x02019;s written standard protocols. The delay from discontinuation of sedative medication to recovery of consciousness (defined as ability to obey verbal commands) was recorded. The cause of CA was classified as acute MI, myocardial ischemia without infarction, primary arrhythmia, or other. The short-term outcome of the SUGAR-trial has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evaluation of outcome</title><p>All patients alive 6&#x000a0;months after CA were contacted and invited for a follow-up visit. The evaluation at follow-up visit included an interview and standard neurologic examination performed by the same board certified neurologist (MT). For institutionalized patients the assessment included also an interview with the nearest relatives and/or with nursing staff. The neurological outcome was also assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Barthel Index (BI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cognitive outcome was evaluated by neuropsychological examination including two measures of each cognitive function: cognitive speed, execution, memory, verbal skills and visuospatial performance. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed by the 15D questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The neurologist and the neuropsychologist performing the evaluations were unaware of the patient&#x02019;s glucose treatment group. If a patient was not able or not willing to attend a follow-up visit, a telephone interview was performed, with evaluation of CPC, BI and mRs.</p><p>Modified Rankin scale is a widely applied measure of global disability and handicap after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The scores for patients alive range from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (bedridden, incontinent, and requires constant nursing care and attention). Favourable outcome in stroke studies is defined as mRs 0-2 (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms at all, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;no significant disability despite symptoms, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;slight disability; independent but unable to carry out all previous activities). The Barthel Index is a measure to assess an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living related to self-care and mobility; for example, transfers, stairs, feeding, dressing, personal care and bathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The range of functionally independent outcome is 95 to 100. BI score 90-55 indicates moderate dependency, and score 50-0 indicates full dependency. NIHSS is a widely used instrument for the evaluation of neurologic impairment after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A 15-item scale provides a quantitative measure of the key components of a standard neurologic examination, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</p><p>Neuropsychological examination was designed to estimate cognitive functions sensitive to CA related cognitive deficits. Different cognitive functions were measured by the Similarities, Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), and by the Logical Passages subtask of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and the List Learning task of the WMS-III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the Trail-Making Test (Parts A and B), the Interference and naming subtasks of the modified Stroop Test, semantic fluency task (animal names) and visual search task were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A patient&#x02019;s test performance was categorized as normal or impaired using the cut point of one standard deviation (SD) below the mean of the Finnish normative sample. If among the 10 tests none or only one (&#x02264;10%) was impaired a subject&#x02019;s cognitive performance was considered intact. When two to four tests (11- 49%) were below 1 SD cut point a cognitive functioning was scored as mildly to moderately defective, and when at least half of the tests (&#x02265;50%) were impaired it was scored as severely defective.</p><p>15D is a generic, standardized, non-disease-specific self-administered multidimensional measure of HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It has 15 dimensions: mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, elimination, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality and sexual activity. Each dimension is divided into five grades of severity. The 15D can be used both as a profile and single index score measure. The single index score, 15D score on a 0&#x02013;1 scale, represents the overall HRQoL, and is calculated from the health state descriptive system by using a set of population-based preference or utility weights. The maximum score is 1 (no problems on any dimensions) and the minimum score 0 (being dead). The minimal clinically significant difference in 15D is 0.03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The 15D instrument has been tested in various states of illness, e.g. in invasive treatment of coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We present categorical variables as counts and percentages, and non-normally distributed continuous data as median and range, compared with the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test.

Furthermore, the HRQoL of CA survivors did not differ from that of age- and sex-matched normal population.</p><p>The proportion of independent patients in this study was higher than the previously reported 65% one year after CA from the pre-hypothermia era [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and comparable to that of hypothermia-treated patients reported by Cronberg et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Focal neurological sensomotor deficits among CA survivors are relatively scarce, which was also reflected in the low NIHSS scores among our study patients. The CPC outcome in our study was comparable to that of our Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest -study patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In resuscitation studies it is usually assumed that all CA patients have a pre-arrest CPC level of 1, which is not the case in clinical settings. Thus, measuring change from assumed pre-arrest CPC level in addition to the achieved CPC level could reflect more accurately the clinical outcome.</p><p>Recent large prospective multicenter study reported that in medical and surgical ICU patients one out of four patients had cognitive impairment 12&#x000a0;months after critical illness, similar in severity to that of patients with mild Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; and that neurocognitive dysfunction occurred both in young and old patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Neuropsychological deficits are common in survivors of CA, ranging from mild deficits in memory and executive functions to severe amnestic syndrome. In the present study half of studied survivors were cognitively intact at six months after CA. As in previous studies with detailed cognitive testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the most frequent cognitive deficits were found in memory and executive functions. Extensive neuropsychological testing is not routinely offered for all CA survivors, and studies concentrating on predictors of cognitive outcome would be of great importance in order to detect survivors needing further cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation. Mild or moderate cognitive impairments do not necessarily translate to deficits in the activities in the daily living or threaten independency, but especially in the current demanding work life even subtle cognitive deficits may severely impair the person&#x02019;s working capacity. Recognition of cognitive defects would thus be important, as awareness of limitations enables the use of compensating strategies. In our study 73% of survivors employed at the time of CA returned to work. This high percentage could be related to the relatively small number of patients, but in previous studies this number has also been quite high, between 42-79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In the study of Hsu et al, the CPC score at hospital discharge correlated poorly with all categories of the QoL measurements performed at least 6&#x000a0;months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In our study the HRQoL score correlated well with CPC and mRs assessed by a neurologist at six-months after CA. Of note, for both CPC and mRs, there were significant differences in HRQoL between outcome classes generally regarded as good outcome (CPC 1-2 and mRs 0-2). It seems that even mild residual symptoms are reflected as lower self-assessed QoL. On the other hand, mild to moderate cognitive deficits did not result in significantly lower self-assessed HRQoL. A possible explanation for this is that 15D emphasizes physical symptoms, compared to cognitive complaints. It is also possible that patients with mild cognitive decline manage quite well in familiar environment, adapt to their deficits, or alternatively are unaware of their cognitive deficits. Further studies examining the association of cognition and quality of life using methods sensitive to symptoms caused by cognitive deficits would be of importance.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that most survivors of out-of-hospital CA present a satisfactory quality of life comparable to that of age- and disease-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In the study of Cronberg et al, CA survivors had a slightly lower HRQoL measured by the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale than an age-adjusted healthy cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In our study the HRQoL of CA survivors did not differ from that of age- and sex-matched control population. In fact, their overall HRQoL measured by the 15D single index score (median 0.883) was higher than previously published scores for patients with coronary artery disease six months after CABG (mean 0.858, SD 0.110) or PCI (mean 0.847, SD 0.105) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and higher than after stroke (median 0.86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], mean 0.801 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]).</p><p>This study has some important limitations. First, 28% of patients did not attend the neuropsychological examination. It is possible that subjects with cognitive deficits were more prone to refuse the neuropsychological examination which may have caused bias. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the noticed cognitive deficits existed already before CA, although we tried to exclude patients with pre-existing major cognitive impairment. Third, due to the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the results cannot be generalized to all OHCA patients treated in the ICU with hypothermia. Finally, the number of patients was inadequate to find any differences between standard and intensive glucose control, if present. Therefore, we analyzed the patients as one group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study the functional outcome six months after CA and therapeutic hypothermia was good (CPC1-2) in 88% of the survivors, and half of them were cognitively intact. 95% of survivors had been able to return to their home, and 73% of patients employed at the time of CA had returned to work.
