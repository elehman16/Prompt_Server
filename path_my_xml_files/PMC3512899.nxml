We report findings from a noninferiority study that compared effects of MF/F and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) combination therapies on pulmonary function and onset of action in subjects with persistent asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority trial enrolled subjects (aged &#x02265;12 years) previously treated with medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid alone or combined with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist. Following a 2- to 4-week run-in treatment period with MF administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) 200 &#x003bc;g twice daily (BID), eligible subjects were randomized to MF/F-MDI 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID or FP/S administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this trial was change from baseline in area under the curve (AUC) in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) measured serially for 0 to 12 hours postdose (FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02212;12h</sub>). Key secondary endpoints included onset of action, defined as change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 5 minutes postdose on day 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>722 subjects were randomized to MF/F-MDI (n = 371) or FP/S-DPI (n = 351). The trial's primary endpoint was met, demonstrating that MF/F administered via an MDI was noninferior to FP/S administered via a DPI in the patient population investigated. Mean FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02212;12h</sub> at endpoint for MF/F-MDI and FP/S-DPI was 3.43 versus 3.24 L &#x000d7; h, respectively (95%, CI, &#x02212;0.40 to 0.76). Analysis of onset-of-action characteristics revealed that MF/F's effect on lung function occurred significantly faster than the effect observed with FP/S-DPI. MF/F-MDI was associated with a 200-mL mean increase from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 5 minutes postdose (first scheduled measurement) on the first day of treatment vs a 90-mL increase for FP/S-DPI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This trial demonstrated that MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID administered via an MDI was noninferior to FP/S 250/50 &#x003bc;g BID administered via a DPI in its effect to improve lung function as measured by FEV1 AUC0&#x02013;12h. However, the onset of action for this effect was significantly faster with MF/F-MDI than with FP/S-DPI.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
