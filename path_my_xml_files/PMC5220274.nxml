According to recent estimates, 12.3% of US adults aged 20&#x02005;years and older, and 25.9% of those aged 65&#x02005;years and older, have diabetes. In addition, another 37% of US adults aged 20&#x02005;years or older, and 51% of those aged 65&#x02005;years or older, have prediabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90&#x02013;95% of all diagnosed cases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the USA. Diabetes complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, blindness, kidney disease, nervous system damage, limb amputations, and biochemical imbalances that can cause acute life-threatening events. Rates of cardiovascular mortality are about 1.7 times higher among adults aged 18&#x02005;years or older with diagnosed diabetes than among adults without diagnosed diabetes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Overweight or obesity is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Compared with healthy weight adults, obese individuals are more than seven times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The more fatty tissue that is present in the body, the more resistant the cells become to insulin.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Fat stored primarily in the abdomen increases the risk of type 2 diabetes greater than if the fat were stored elsewhere, such as in the hips and thighs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Weight gain of as little as 10&#x02005;lb over 15&#x02005;years can double a person's insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Insulin resistance may also contribute to high blood pressure, increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Weight reduction is an important objective for overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A moderate and sustained weight reduction of 5&#x02013;7% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity, decrease fasting glucose, and reduce the need for some diabetes medications.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

In a meta-analysis by Shin <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> egg consumption was associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in the general population and cardiovascular morbidity among diabetes patients. In another recent meta-analysis by Djouss&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> infrequent egg consumption showed no association with type 2 diabetes, but consumption of three or more eggs per week demonstrated a modest increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes.

As a satiating and protein-rich food, eggs seem to have potential to foster calorie and weight control, and to reduce the dietary glycemic load, offering potential advantages in type 2 diabetes. We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, crossover trial to assess the effects of daily egg inclusion (ie, 2 eggs per day) in the habitual diet for a 3-month period in comparison to egg exclusion on glycemic control, anthropometric measures, and overall diet quality in adults with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>A cohort of 34 participants (20 men and 14 women) was recruited from the Lower Naugatuck Valley in Connecticut through &#x0fb02;yers and newspaper advertisements. Interested participants (n=351) were prescreened over the telephone. The study coordinator/research assistant prescreened potential participants for eligibility via a structured telephone interview using established inclusion criteria. Those who met preliminary eligibility criteria and agreed to participate were invited to undergo clinical eligibility screening, and asked to sign a consent form approved by the Griffin Hospital Institutional Review Board. All participants were informed of the option of discontinuing participation at any time during the study. They were advised to discontinue egg intake at least 4&#x02005;weeks before receiving the intervention. The clinical screening physical examination consisted of weight, height, and blood pressure measures obtained by experienced study personnel using calibrated equipment. Participants underwent a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) assessment. All screening laboratory assays were performed at the Griffin Hospital clinical laboratories.

After a 4-week run-period of an ad libitum diet, participants were randomized to one of two possible sequence permutations, and then underwent repeated measures following inclusion of 10&#x02013;14 eggs/week or egg exclusion for 3&#x02005;months in their diet in random sequence, with a 6-week washout between treatments. To provide a sound basis for the statistical comparison of outcome measures for treatment assignments, participants were randomized to one of two sequence permutations of egg inclusion and egg exclusion from the habitual diet.

The study dietitian provided individualized guidance to participants on how to make room calorically for two daily eggs in their diet, relative to their habitual intake during the egg exclusion phase, while giving them latitude in determining how to adjust for the approximately 150&#x02013;300 extra daily calories from the eggs, to better approximate real-world conditions. The participants were instructed to make approximate caloric adjustments for the eggs depending on their preferred method of preparation, for example, hard-boiled, poached, fried, scrambled, or as part of egg salad or an omelet on a given day. All eggs for this study phase were provided to participants by the researchers. The eggs were acquired from the Griffin Hospital Dining Services department, which in turn ordered the eggs from one of its vendors.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Egg exclusion phase</title><p>Participants met with the dietitian and received relevant meal planning guidance and instructions to follow their usual ad libitum diets, with the exception of avoiding eggs and specific egg-containing products.</p><p>During both intervention phases, study participants were advised to eat to their usual state of fullness, and their weight and dietary intake were monitored to ensure that an isocaloric condition was maintained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measurements were evaluated at baseline, after a run-in period with an ad libitum diet, and then after each of the two interventions (ie, egg inclusion and egg exclusion). During each visit to the Prevention Research Center (PRC), subjects underwent measures of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and fasting plasma insulin, along with an assessment of anthropometric values, and completed a 3-day food record. Physical activity level and prescription medication use were assessed at the end of each phase to monitor variation of activity level and medication intake. A written side effects survey was completed once at the end of each phase.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p><italic>Glycemic control:</italic> HbA1c was used to measure the average plasma glucose concentration. The HbA1c is a predictor of the average amount of plasma glucose. It serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 3&#x02005;months before the measurement, as this is the lifespan of red blood cells. In diabetics, higher amounts of HbA1c indicate poor control of blood glucose levels. HbA1c was measured using a finger-prick test.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p><italic>Fasting glucose and insulin:</italic> Glucose and insulin were measured at each time point. Participants were asked to fast for at least 8&#x02005;hours before glucose and insulin measurement. Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) values were calculated from fasting serum glucose and serum insulin levels using HOMA calculator V.2.2.1 to gauge the degree of insulin resistance.</p><p><italic>Body composition:</italic> Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat. The Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer was used to measure body composition. The SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer measures weight and calculates body fat percentage and total body water percentage, in addition to BMI. In a multicenter European study by Deurenberg <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> with adults between the ages of 18 and 70&#x02005;years, the use of an impedance-based prediction equation for body fat percentage (which is the basis for the Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer function) when compared with either dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or densitometry (underwater weighing)&#x02014;two current standards used to measure body composition&#x02014;was found to provide good estimates of body fat percentage. In addition, the Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer has demonstrated accuracy in estimating body fat percentage as compared with DXA in white and African-American children and adolescents.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Studies have shown correlation in visceral fat rating between BIA and abdominal radiographic imaging exams.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref></p><p><italic>Body weight:</italic> Body weight was measured during each visit. It was measured to the nearest 0.5&#x02005;lb using a balance-type medical scale. Subjects were measured in the morning (fasting), unclothed with the exception of undergarments.</p><p><italic>Waist circumference:</italic> Waist circumference was measured using the US government standard protocol. It was measured around the narrowest point between ribs and hips when viewed from the front after exhaling.</p><p><italic>Diet quality:</italic> To help the study team track any variation in dietary pattern over the course of the study, all participants were asked at two time points to provide information on the foods and beverages that they consumed. Three 24-hour recalls (ie, for two weekdays and one weekend day) were collected at each time point. For each 3-day period, participants completed three 24-hour recalls using a web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24) (available from the National Cancer Institute at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/">http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/</ext-link>) which guided them through the process of completing the recall data. Diet quality based on these recalls (ie, the average of the 3-day recalls at each time point of assessment) was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index 2010.</p><p><italic>Medication use:</italic> We tracked any changes in prescription medication use. We controlled for this variable in our multivariable regression models.</p><p><italic>Compliance:</italic> During each visit to the PRC, the study coordinator/research assistant met with participants to answer questions, document any study-related health or other issues, and assess compliance to the treatment assignment. Compliance was assessed by self-report, using egg consumption logs returned by participants at the end of each phase. Good compliance was defined as &#x0003e;80% use of treatment. Habitual dietary pattern, as assessed by the average of three 24-hour recalls during each phase, was also used to monitor compliance. Variation in compliance was used as a control variable in multivariable analysis; intertreatment comparisons were conducted in accord with the intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Generalized linear models were used to analyze changes in our outcome measures between treatment assignments. Changes in outcome measures from baseline were assessed using paired t-test. Regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors (ie, age, gender, race, medication use, compliance, and treatment sequence). To preserve randomization, all analyses of end points were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Results are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD in text and tables except otherwise stated. SAS software for Windows V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used to carry out all statistical analyses.</p><p>The sample size was estimated to provide &#x02265;80% power to detect a minimal difference of &#x02212;0.3% in HbA1c between egg inclusion and egg exclusion in the habitual diet, with maximum allowable type I error of 5%.

The exclusion of eggs from the habitual diet increased insulin resistance. The inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet did not improve overall diet quality.</p><p>In our study, the inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet, as compared with egg exclusion, non-significantly reduced glycemic hemoglobin and had no effects on insulin resistance. The exclusion of eggs from the habitual diet increased insulin resistance. In a previous study by Pearce <italic>et al</italic> with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance individuals,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> daily consumption of eggs for 12&#x02005;weeks as compared with lean animal protein improved glycemic control and cholesterol levels. In another study by Ratliff <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> with apparently healthy men, daily consumption of eggs for breakfast for 1&#x02005;week, as compared with bagels, reduced plasma glucose, insulin, energy intake, and suppressed ghrelin response. Eggs have a relatively low glycemic index and therefore do not affect blood glucose levels. In addition, eggs are a satiating food and hence can reduce caloric intake, which may consequently help to improve glycemic control. While the detectable difference observed in glycemic control in our study is clinically meaningful, the lack of statistical significance on the effects on glycemic control with the inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet could be due to small sample size, inadequate amount of eggs consumed, and/or inadequate intervention length.</p><p>We demonstrated that daily inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet for 12&#x02005;weeks reduced body weight, waist circumference, visceral fat rating, and percent body fat in adults with type 2 diabetes. Similarly, in a study by Vander <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the consumption of an egg breakfast for 8&#x02005;weeks, as compared with bagel, reduced body weight, waist circumference, and percent body fat in overweight adults. However, Katz <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showed no effects in body weight with the inclusion of eggs or Egg Beaters in the habitual diet of adults with established coronary artery disease. Eggs are considered a reference food for protein quality, and are considered a satiating food due to their relatively high protein content and low energy density.</p><p>The inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet of adults with type 2 diabetes non-significantly reduced systolic blood pressure. In a previous study by Katz <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> daily consumption of eggs or Egg Beaters for 6&#x02005;weeks had no effects on blood pressure in adults with established coronary artery disease. Eggs produce some peptides that act in a manner similar to ACE inhibitors in lowering blood pressure.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Although the reduction we observed in systolic blood pressure with the inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet was clinically meaningful, we did not see statistical significance. The lack of statistical significance in our study is probably due to the small sample size and/or short duration of intervention.</p><p>The inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet of our study participants did not improve their overall diet quality. Better diet quality has been associated with lower mortality, and with reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In theory, the inclusion of eggs could improve diet quality by displacing less nutritious food in the habitual diet. On the other hand, the exclusion of eggs from the habitual diet could lead to the introduction of less nutritious foods which could negatively impact diet quality. In our own study, we did not see improvement in diet quality, possibly due to the small sample size or an inadequate amount of eggs consumed.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the participants were predominantly Caucasians, which limits the ability to generalize our findings. Second, the study had a small sample size. This limitation was overcome to some extent by crossing over the participants to the two different treatment assignments, thereby improving the power of the study. Third, the study relied on self-report by the participants for their dietary records, which can introduce measurement and recall biases. Fourth, the participants were not monitored on a daily basis and were not administered a supervised diet. However, this can also be viewed as a strength of the study because it provides a more realistic scenario and potentially increases external validity. In addition, the variation of the dietary patterns of participants may make it difficult to interpret the findings. Fifth, the Tanita SC-240 analyzer that we used to measure body composition can only be used for individuals with body weight not exceeding 200&#x02005;kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Short-term daily inclusion of eggs in the habitual diet of adults with type 2 diabetes led to improved anthropometric measures and had no effect on glycemic control and blood pressure.
