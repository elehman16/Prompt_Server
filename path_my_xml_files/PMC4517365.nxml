Approximately 40&#x000a0;% of new cancers are found in the working population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], of whom many are motivated for and expect to return to work (RTW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as RTW constitutes &#x0201c;normalcy&#x0201d;, has impact on quality of life and economic independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the cancer disease and the treatment still increases the risk of early withdrawal from the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even though work is perceived as an important factor in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], for some cancer survivors work participation may be deprioritised by other ways of active participation in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore knowledge on how cancer survivors value their work and how this affects the RTW process is needed. Among cancer survivors who do RTW some may face both health-related and work-related difficulties leading to reduced workability and recurrence of sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which further increases the risk of prematurely exit from the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some consistency exists in the literature about which factors are associated with RTW despite adverse side-effects from cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, often cancer patients are left on their own to deal with these challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; partly due to unclear agreements between stakeholders responsible for occupational rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and partly due to reluctance and fear of articulating work and RTW to a cancer survivor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Research on RTW in cancer survivors has in recent years increased, partly because survival rates have increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and because patients with advanced, incurable disease are able to perform some kind of work, and will often prefer to stay on the labour marked as long as possible. Nevertheless, there still is a need for rigorous studies applying a randomised controlled trial design, with thorough information on intervention components and data reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to the inconsistent conclusions drawn from the existing RTW studies in cancer survivors; evidence from research conducted on musculoskeletal and/or mental-related sickness absentees can give insights into effective RTW interventions in general and guide researchers in putting hypotheses forward on which elements cancer-oriented RTW interventions may contain. Thus, the provision of occupational rehabilitation to cancer survivors that consists of a combination of general and cancer specific intervention elements may prove to be an effective approach.</p><p>Some evidence supports that RTW interventions targeted musculoskeletal-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or depressed absentees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] are more effective when they address the workplace than interventions not targeting the workplace. Thus, in the planning of the present study it was crucial to incorporate involvement of the workplace as one of the key elements in the intervention. In a cancer setting it has been shown that employer and colleague support as well as work accommodation increases the RTW rate and reduces the likelihood of cancer-related work impairments after RTW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Problem-solving-therapy interventions towards employees sick-listed due to adjustment disorders enhanced partial RTW compared to a non-guideline based care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cancer survivors may also display adjustment disorders due to difficulties in coping with having a cancer diagnosis along with expectations from relatives and friends, workplace and health care professionals in the RTW process. Fear of cancer recurrence may lead to fear avoidance behaviour, which limits participation in life - including work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of cancer survivor-experienced barriers regarding RTW and assistance in barrier modification were important elements that the present intervention should include.</p><p>Feuerstein et al. developed the Work and Cancer Model based on an extensive review of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A variety of factors coexists and may act both as facilitators and inhibitors of RTW among cancer survivors; individual characteristics, health and well-being, symptoms, function, work demands, work environment and finally structural factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There seems to be agreement in the literature that RTW-interventions in general should target the multi-dimensional factors that are associated with sickness absence and that seems also to be true in a cancer specific context. This perspective is in part substantiated in the Cochrane review by de Boer et al. on RTW interventions to cancer survivors. Although the studies had low quality it was concluded that one-dimensional interventions, i.e. psychological, physical or medical interventions did not improve RTW compared to care as usual, whereas a moderate quality evidence was found for a multidisciplinary approach (involving physical, psychological and vocational elements) compared to care as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Cancer survivors in low socioeconomic groups may in particular experience the RTW-process difficult and tend to be at risk of recurrent sickness absence, unemployment or permanent withdrawal from the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is not clear which role socioeconomic status plays on cancer survivors&#x02019; RTW-process, but unfavourable work conditions characteristic for low income and low-level educational jobs may explain some of this inequality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore work accommodations and supervisor support may be of particular importance in occupational rehabilitation in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] to help cancer survivors overcome the imbalance between health and work demands.</p><p>Despite improved long-term survival rates for cancer patients, survivorship does not mean living without health complaints, but rather living with a chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Cancer survivors do have an increased risk of recurrent cancers along with co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporoses etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This further increases the risk for reductions in workability and calls for collaboration between the occupational rehabilitation stakeholders to enhance the chance of sustainable RTW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Danish healthcare system</title><p>Permanent residents in Denmark pay approximately 40-50&#x000a0;% taxes of their income, by which almost all examinations and treatments within the Danish healthcare system are free of charge. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority is responsible for the organizational and clinical standards for the diagnostics and treatment for all cancer types, i.e. integrated cancer pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The objective of the pathways is to reduce referral time, obtain faster diagnosing and early onset of treatment. To accomplish these general goals the pathways are operationalised in several Disease Management Programmes for Cancer of which one defines Rehabilitation and Palliation in Cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The specific aim of cancer rehabilitation is, besides optimizing the patient's physical, psychological and social functioning while countering the limitations imposed by the side effects of cancer treatments and/or co-morbid conditions, also to offer occupational and vocational rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Few studies have been conducted on occupational rehabilitation offered parallel to cancer treatment at the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], however more studies are ongoing/in preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, knowledge is scarce on whether occupational rehabilitation applied early and parallel to cancer treatment facilitates the RTW-process for cancer survivors. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in a Danish setting or in other Nordic countries, which has similar tax-financed health care systems as Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sickness absence management in Denmark</title><p>According to the Danish Sickness Benefit Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], the municipal job centres are responsible for paying sickness benefits and initiating occupational/vocational rehabilitation to help sick-listed persons to RTW.</p><p>All employed, self-employed, temporarily employed and unemployed persons fulfilling the criteria of previous employment (minimum 74&#x000a0;h within a period of 8&#x000a0;weeks) are eligible for sickness benefits.</p><p>According to law, the employer pays sickness benefits during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks, afterwards the municipality refunds the employer&#x02019;s wage expenses for a maximum period.</p><p>The regulations for sickness benefits have been subject to several changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and continue to be so. When the study started the maximum period was 52&#x000a0;weeks within a period of 78&#x000a0;weeks. From July 2014 the maximum period in general was reduced to 26&#x000a0;weeks. However, extensions can be granted and for persons suffering from cancer the maximum period may be unlimited.</p><p>Medical certificates were not mandatory but could be requested by the municipal social security system and the employer. However, from January 2015 a medical certificate became obligatory after 8&#x000a0;weeks of sickness absence.</p><p>After the newest reform in 2014&#x02013;15 the sickness beneficiaries are assigned into three categories: Category 1 includes persons who are likely to RTW within eight weeks without intervention. Category 2 includes persons who are unlikely to RTW within eight weeks unless activities facilitating RTW are initiated, i.e. coping-sessions and graded RTW. Category 3 includes persons who are unlikely to RTW within eight weeks unless multidisciplinary rehabilitation is implemented. This is planned by a municipal rehabilitation team within 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>In accordance with the law sickness benefit officers are obliged to conduct regular follow-up interviews at least every four weeks with beneficiaries in category 2 and 3. Thus, municipal officers have been appointed the role as case managers, whereas employers have little responsibility for sickness absence management after they have had the first obligatory meeting with the employee after four weeks of sick-listing.</p><p>Most cancer survivors may be assigned in category 2, but in reality they are often spared the obligatory meetings with the social security officer and activities initiated by the job centre while receiving their treatment. This leads to a short time frame in which the cancer survivors are offered vocational/occupational rehabilitation; i.e. time between the end of treatment and the maximum period of sickness benefit reimbursement. Offering early occupational rehabilitation parallel to cancer treatment focusing on preparations for RTW and making arrangements together with the employer regarding work accommodations, graded RTW etc. should improve the RTW-process and reduce the recurrent sickness absence after RTW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Readiness for return to work scale</title><p>RTW after long-term sickness absence may be seen as a behavioural change or a process in several stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], depending on factors of which the person&#x02019;s own RTW perceptions are predictive of future work participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility, which can be defined as the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behaviour that support one&#x02019;s own values. Psychological flexibility is established through six core ACT processes: acceptance, cognitive fusion, being present, self as context, values, and committed action. Each of these areas is conceptualized as a positive psychological skill.

Hence, the ACT inspired dialogue and the systematic occupational needs assessment are integrated in the IPS phases by which the job consultant supports the survivor&#x02019;s RTW-process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Furthermore, it was anticipated that 80&#x000a0;% gave informed consent to participate in the study. Hence, an expected number of 288 cancer patients per year. We estimated a mortality rate of 10&#x000a0;% during the one-year follow-up. Based on previous studies the RTW rate among cancer survivors who underwent occupational rehabilitation is approximately 82&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and that the share will be approximately 60&#x000a0;% in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Already job consultants are appointed the role as case managers in cases of long-term sickness absence. Sick leave due to cancer is however, dealt with in different ways compared to less serious conditions; partly because of taboo, reluctance of discussing work with a potentially fatally ill absentee and off cause due to compassion for this person. However, the social security system, i.e. the Sickness Benefit Act and whether the cancer survivor is entitled to receive sickness benefit may not differentiate between the reasons for sick leave. As a consequence the cancer survivor may lose financial security while being sick-listed and also lose her or his job in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, the cancer survivor is left on her or his own to deal with these challenges, despite the fact that the majority of cancer survivors are motivated for and wishes to RTW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The innovative element of this intervention is the timing and early onset of the occupational rehabilitation which is much earlier than usual and that the job consultants are articulating work and take action on the cancer survivors&#x02019; R-RTW and support them in behaviour change towards RTW. The evaluation of this intervention will point out if this approach in deed increases the RTW chance compared to the control municipalities.</p><p>The intervention will also be evaluated through qualitative interviews in terms of its acceptability to stakeholders and whether the existing setting is appropriate and whether job consultants are capable of this task.</p><p>The knowledge of RTW facilitators and barriers are quite extensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, in the present trial it was not possible for us to take into account all of these factors. The cancer-related symptoms and possible disabilities due to treatment are not addressed directly within our intervention protocol. As the intervention takes place parallel with cancer treatment all of the cancer survivors are in contact with the health care system. If the job consultants identify health-related barriers in relation to RTW, they are intended to suggest the cancer survivor to get in contact with the treating oncologist or the general practitioner (GP). As well as the job consultants themselves can contact the health care professionals for advice.</p><p>According to the integrated cancer pathway &#x0201c;Rehabilitation and Palliation in Cancer&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; each municipality in Denmark is obliged to provide cancer rehabilitation. The municipal job consultants are well informed about the local offered rehabilitation within their municipality. Therefore we anticipate that health-related issues will be addressed because the healthcare stakeholders are close to the survivor and to the job consultants.</p><p>The theory behind our hypothesis that the intervention will increase RTW chance originates from the stages of change model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The R-RTW model addresses the motivational factors of behaviour change towards RTW and maintenance of work and was validated in a population of claimants with muscular-skeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The scale has been translated to Norwegian and was validated in a Norwegian inpatient occupational rehabilitation program in sick-listed people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The scale was reliable and a valid tool for the RTW prognosis.</p><p>In Denmark the R-RTW scale is currently being validated. The data from this study will be used in the validation of responsiveness. It was not possible to obtain R-RTW scores from the control group in this study. Thus, the scores obtained from the cancer survivors in the intervention group are used solely by the two job consultants to adjust their rehabilitation to the right stage.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The golden standard when effects of an intervention are to be assessed is the randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, when studies are conducted in real settings, like in municipal job centres; recently published articles from the Danish national return-to-work program showed challenges in applying a randomised study design; i.e. spill over effects between study arms within the municipality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Therefore we chose a controlled study design. When the control municipalities are to be chosen, high priority will be given to municipalities that resemble the RTW rate of the intervention municipalities the year before our study was initiated, i.e. 2013. For that purpose official rates from Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] will be used. We may not be able to identify municipalities which also can supply sufficient numbers of cancer patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We might need to compromise on which municipalities to include as controls to get sufficient numbers of cancer survivors, which in turn might give residual confounding that will lower the internal validity of our results.</p><p>We believe that if the job consultants are to succeed in their support and help to the cancer survivors and thereby increase the R-RTW; they must identify barriers and facilitators in the RTW process and use the ACT inspired dialogue. Otherwise they may not be able to engage the cancer survivors in committed actions that are value-based and make sense to the survivors&#x02019; perception of quality of life (including work). In order for us to keep track of the compliance with the study protocol; the job consultants attend monthly supervisions with the psychologist who trained them in the use of ACT and IPS. Because the intervention takes place in the job consultants usual work setting, we fear that they are at risk of resuming old work habits and thereby violate the innovative elements in our intervention. We anticipate that the supervisions act as an arena where experiences are shared and difficult situations are discussed in order for the job consultants to learn and cope with their new job tasks and demands.</p><p>Due to the described intervention given by the job consultants it is not possible to blind the cancer survivors nor the job consultants or the person who will perform the analyses.</p><p>The sample size calculations are based on cancer survivors being sick-listed at entry time in the analyses. This means that we may need more than 430 cancer survivors in total. This might lead to a longer inclusion period than the anticipated 1.5&#x000a0;years. We anticipate that results will be available ultimo 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Acceptance and commitment therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIP</term><def><p>Cumulated incidence proportion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPSOQ</term><def><p>Copenhagen psychosocial questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DREAM</term><def><p>Danish register for evaluation of marginalisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>Hazard ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPS</term><def><p>Individual placement and support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>R-RTW</term><def><p>Readiness for return to work</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RTW</term><def><p>Return to work</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors conceived the study and gave valuable contributions to the study design.
