However, the central analgesic mechanism remains poorly understood. Studies have demonstrated that single stimulus of the verum acupuncture in healthy subjects can induce significant connectivity or activity changes in pain-related central networks compared with sham acupuncture. However, these findings are not indicative of the central analgesic mechanism of acupuncture at <italic>Shaoyang</italic> acupoints. Thus, we recruited 100 migraine sufferers and randomly assigned them into five groups: <italic>Shaoyang</italic> uncommon acupoint, <italic>Shaoyang</italic> common acupoint, <italic>Yangming</italic> uncommon acupoint, non-acupoint control, and blank control groups. Subjects were subjected to evaluation of curative effects and functional MRI prior to and after 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. All subjects were diagnosed by physicians and enrolled following clinical physical examination. Subjects were observed during 1&#x02013;4 weeks after inclusion. At the fifth week, the first clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI were conducted. The <italic>Shaoyang</italic> mon acupoint, <italic>Shaoyang</italic> common acupoint, <italic>Yangming</italic> uncommon acupoint, and non-acupoint control grousp then were treated with acupuncture, five times per week, 20 times in total over 4 weeks. The second and third clinical evaluations and resting functional MRI screenings were conducted following 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. The blank control group was observed during the 5 to 8 week period, followed by clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI.

</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Migraine is a common complaint worldwide that typically manifests as repeated episodes of moderate or severe pulsating hemilateral headache, often accompanied by nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia. National epidemiological investigations have reported a prevalence in adults of 4.2&#x02013;14.6% in China[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and approximately 12% in Western countries[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Migraine also presents with a sex-related prevalence, with 16&#x02013;18% of females and 6&#x02013;8% of males affected[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Almost 90% of migraine patients experience moderate or severe pain, 75% have to limit their daily activities, and 33% are confined to bed during migraine attacks[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, effective therapies are required by both patients and practitioners.</p><p>Acupuncture is widely used by Chinese and other Oriental populations for analgesia, and has been gradually accepted as a complementary analgesic therapy in the West. Clinical data suggest that acupuncture can be at least as effective as migraine prophylactic drugs with fewer adverse events, and also relieve acute or chronic migraine symptoms[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In traditional Chinese acupuncture theory and practice, acupoints on <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians (<italic>Sanjiao</italic> Meridian and Gallbladder Meridian) are the classical targets for migraine treatment. Thus, acupuncture, especially puncturing <italic>Shaoyang</italic> acupoints, may become a recommended treatment for migraine sufferers.</p><p>Functional MRI has been increasingly applied to detect central mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia. For example, in healthy subjects undergoing experimental induced pain, our previous study indicated that both verum acupuncture (puncturing verum acupoints) and sham acupuncture (puncturing sham acupoints) could modulate amygdala-associated brain networks that regulate pain sensation and modulation; however, verum acupuncture induced a higher level of correlations among this network[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Other studies have also demonstrated that verum acupuncture can increase the connectivity of the default mode network with the pain and sensorimotor network and with pain-related brain regions[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and elicit significant activation in the affective components of the pain matrix[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, Li <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Linde <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggested that acupuncture may delay suffering from migraines. Although signal changes in pain-related brain areas were induced both in verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture, some of the brain regions showed strong functional connectivity during the post-verum acupuncture period[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This provides an explanation for the efficacy of vernum acupuncture during the post-needling period for migraine treatment.</p><p>However, previous functional MRI studies were performed on healthy subjects with pain tasks to observe central responses induced by a single acupuncture stimulus. It remains unclear whether there are different central responses in migraine patients and healthy subjects, and whether there are different brain responses evoked by a single acupuncture stimulus versus repeated acupuncture treatment.</p><p>Additionally, acupoints of <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians are the most frequently applied for treating migraine in traditional Chinese style acupuncture. Our previous study supported the superior effect of <italic>Shaoyang</italic> acupoints, which involved central regulation <italic>via</italic> brain regions related to the pons-pain matrix, in migraine subjects when compared with stimulating other meridians[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, on <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians, some acupoints are more frequently used in migraine treatment than others. However, it remains unclear whether the analgesic mechanism induced by acupoints of <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians differs from that by acupoints of other meridians, and whether commonly used acupoints of <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians differ from that by uncommonly used Shaoyang meridians.</p><p>Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether migraine sufferers exhibit: (1) different central analgesic responses induced by sessions of verum acupuncture <italic>versus</italic> sham acupuncture; (2) different functional brain responses evoked by puncturing acupoints on <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians versus acupoints on other meridians; and (3) different brain responses aroused by puncturing commonly used acupoints versus uncommonly used acupoints on <italic>Shaoyang</italic> meridians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>A clinical study of neuroimaging.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Time and setting</title><p>The experiments were conducted from April 2010 to December 2012.

Although there are numerous neuroimaging studies on acupuncture, only 3 of 137 clinical trials have examined the central responses of acupuncture in patients, none of which applied multiple acupuncture treatment sessions. Hence, the two novel components of our study are: (1) migraine patients will be used as observation subjects rather than healthy subjects, and (2) multiple acupuncture treatment sessions will be used rather the single acupuncture stimulus.</p><p>Because of the innovative study design, we have attempted to improve the experimental quality and reduce external interference to functional MRI scanning. First, the verum acupoints will be identified according to their frequency in traditional Chinese acupuncture ancient literature (many without English versions) and clinical Chinese trials. Non-acupoints will be selected by methods stated in previous studies, and include those lateral to acupoints, between two meridians, or between physical landmarks (without clarified acupoints)[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Second, &#x0201c;<italic>deqi</italic>&#x0201d; sensation is considered to be crucial to efficacy in traditional Chinese acupuncture. In the present study, sham acupuncture manipulations are usually required to conduct superficial stimuli with or without &#x0201c;<italic>deqi</italic>&#x0201d; sensations, resulting in some deficiencies. This method has great similarity with the traditional Chinese acupuncture technique of &#x0201c;shallow needling&#x0201d;, a puncturing method on the skin level recorded in &#x0201c;(<italic>Huangdi's</italic>) Internal Classic&#x0201d;. The superficial stimuli may excite sensory nerve peripherals below the skin, and eventually induce some acute effects. Therefore, this type of sham acupuncture is not the correct comparison to verum acupuncture. On the other hand, sensations induced by verum acupuncture and superficial sham acupuncture will produce difficulty in blinding patients. In our experiments, each manipulation on both verum acupoints and non-acupoints will require &#x0201c;<italic>deqi</italic>&#x0201d; sensations of soreness, numbness, heaviness, or fullness. Third, the treatment frequency of acupuncture is considered comparable to drug dose by Chinese acupuncturists. As a result, participants will be required to receive at least 10 treatments over a 4-week duration.</p><p>Bias factors will be well controlled throughout our experimental design. An independent practitioner will be responsible for randomization allocation and concealment, and will not be involved in any other parts of this trial. Because of difficulties in blinding the acupuncturists, blinding will be performed in a separate treatment room. The evaluator and statistician will also be blinded to allocation of patients.</p><p>Functional MRI image acquisition can be easily affected by external factors. Thus, we will control this in our study, as follows. Acupuncture manipulation prior to scanning will be conducted by the fixed acupuncturists in case any interference comes from manipulations of different practitioners. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of the mental status of the patients, practitioners will be trained to evaluate patient anxiety and depression in advance, and to inform patients of light, noise, and temperature during screening prior to the first scanning.</p><p>In summary, in migraine sufferers, this functional MRI trial protocol will be used to examine (1) different brain functional networks induced by a 4-week duration of verum acupuncture versus sham acupuncture; and (2) different functional brain networks evoked by continuous stimuli on acupoints of Shaoyang meridians versus other meridians, and commonly used acupoints versus others on Shaoyang meridians.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments:</title><p>We thank Tian J, Sun JB, Yuan K, and Dong MH from Xidian University in Xi&#x02019;an, Shaanxi Province, China for assistance in data acquisition and analysis.
