Further analyses showed that men in the experimental group rated a significantly heavier female body size as maximally attractive than the control group. Men in the experimental group also rated heavier female bodies as more attractive and idealised a wider range of female figures than did the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that the experience of stress was associated with a preference among men for heavier female body sizes.

This proposition highlights the fact that a primary function of adipose tissue is the storage of calories, which in turn suggests that body fat is a reliable predictor of food availability <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In situations marked by resource uncertainty, therefore, individuals should come to idealise heavier individuals <xref rid="pone.0042593-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, as fatness would be associated with access to resources. Conversely, thinness in such contexts may be associated with increased incidence of ill-health <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and, for women, ovulatory irregularities and lower capacity to support pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0042593-Ellisson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support this reasoning. First, cross-cultural studies have reported a strong inverse relationship between socioeconomic status (a covariate of resource security) and ideal body size <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Second, experimental studies have shown that hunger has an effect on men's body size preferences, such that hungry men prefer a significantly heavier body size than satiated men <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These findings mirror reports that hunger intensifies selection for a larger body size in non-human species, such as water-spiders <xref rid="pone.0042593-Ortigosa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the strength of the relationship may depend on the way in which resource security is operationalised: at least one study has failed to replicate the preference for a heavier body size when resource security was experimentally manipulated in terms of financial satisfaction <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami7" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Related work has also suggested that the experience of stress may affect body size preferences. Specifically, the Environmental Security Hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> suggests that, when socioeconomic or individual conditions are threatening or uncertain, individuals will prefer others with more mature physical characteristics, including a heavier body size, compared to their preferences in non-threatening conditions. This is because physical maturity is associated with the ability to handle threatening situations and because more mature physical features may communicate attributes such as strength, control, and independence during periods when such qualities should be most desired <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To date, however, most of the evidence in favour of the Environmental Security Hypothesis is archival in nature: there is evidence, for example that American actresses with more mature facial and bodily features are more popular during periods of socioeconomic hardship <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>By contrast, experimental tests of the Environmental Security Hypothesis are currently lacking. In one study, Pettijohn and Tesser <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> experimentally manipulated stress by making female and male participants believe they would receive either benign or harmful shocks. These authors reported that, in the stress condition, participants preferred women with decreased eye size, whereas when stress was absent they preferred women with increased eye size. To date, however, experimental studies have not investigated the impact of psychological stress on perceptions of body size, which would appear to be a more direct candidate for assessing the impact of stress on physical attractiveness ideals for a number of reasons. First, although maturity is a broad construct, body size appears to be an important signal of both physical and psychological maturity, such that heavier and taller figures are perceived as more mature and also as having more mature personality traits <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Melamed1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Second, psychological stress, like any form of threat, helps prepare individuals for adaptive courses of action, which might include physical attractiveness ideals <xref rid="pone.0042593-Loewenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Psychological stress signals a threat to the individual and should lead the individual to show a preference for more mature physical characteristics that would be beneficial during periods of threat <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In short, to the extent that heavier body sizes are perceived as more physically mature <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, it seems plausible that individuals experiencing psychological stress may experience a shift in their body size ideals. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of acute stress on men's body size preferences. By utilising a standardised stress test and by controlling for subjective perceptions of hunger, we were able to investigate the direct effects of stress on body size preferences. Based on previous work <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we predicted that men would show a preference for a larger female body size when experiencing psychological stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>The ethics committee at the Department of Psychology, University of Westminster, specifically approved this study.

Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants provided informed consent and were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Participants in the stress condition took part in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) <xref rid="pone.0042593-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, a 15-minute laboratory stressor that has been reliably shown to increase levels of acute psychological stress (e.g., as measured by free cortisol levels) <xref rid="pone.0042593-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Dickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As part of the TSST, participants were given a 10-minute preparatory period, after which they were taken to a room in which four individuals (mixed genders) were already seated at a table and in which a video camera and tape recorder were installed. The participants stood at a microphone in front of the four individuals and took the role of a job applicant invited for a personal interview with a company's selection committee. Participants had to introduce themselves to the committee in a free speech of 5 minutes and attempt to convince the committee that they were suitable for the post. Participants were told that the committee was trained to monitor non-verbal behaviour and the voice and video analyses would be conducted. After 5 minutes, the selection committee asked the participants to serially subtract the number 13 from 1,022 as fast and accurately as possible. Standard responses were followed where participants ended their speech before the 5-minute duration or failed in the subtraction task <xref rid="pone.0042593-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Twenty minutes after the TSST, participants in the stress condition were taken to a separate room, where they completed the measures described below along with additional scales included to mask the study's aims. This delay is known to coincide with the onset of peak cortisol response following an acute psychological stressor <xref rid="pone.0042593-Dickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. By contrast, participants in the control group were taken immediately to a room where they waited quietly for the same length of time as the TSST stress-induction procedure before they completed the measures described below. Once the measures had been completed, participants had their body mass (kg) and height (cm) directly measured to the nearest 0.5 kg and 0.5 cm, without shoes and in light clothing, using a standard tape measure and weighing scale. All testing sessions took place between 3.00pm and 5.00pm in order to control for diurnal variations in cortisol secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Materials</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Body size preferences</title><p>Participants completed an adapted version of the Photographic Figure Rating Scale <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami9" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, a figural rating scale that consists of 10 photographic and standardized images of women in front view. The women depicted in the PFRS represent the full range of established BMI categories, from emaciated to obese. Participants were first asked to rate each of the 10 images for physical attractiveness on a 9-point Likert-type scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>Very unattractive</italic>, 9&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>Very attractive</italic>). As in previous work <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami10" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, they were then asked to additionally rate the figure that they found most physically attractive (&#x02018;ideal&#x02019;), the largest figure they found physically attractive (&#x02018;largest&#x02019;), and the thinnest figure they found physically attractive (&#x02018;thinnest&#x02019;). Responses on the latter three items were made on a 10-point scale, with 1 representing the figure with the lowest BMI and 10 representing the figure with the highest BMI. &#x02018;Largest&#x02019; and &#x02018;thinnest&#x02019; ratings were used to calculate an &#x02018;attractiveness range&#x02019; (smallest figure that participants found attractive subtracted from the largest figure).

Participants were presented with 100 mm lines with words anchored at each end, describing extremes of hunger (<italic>I am not hungry at all</italic> versus <italic>I have never been more hungry</italic>) and satiety (<italic>I am completely empty</italic> versus <italic>I cannot eat another bite</italic>), fullness (<italic>Not at all full</italic> versus <italic>Totally full</italic>), and prospective food consumption (<italic>Nothing at all</italic> versus <italic>A lot</italic>). Participants were asked to mark across the line at the position on the scales corresponding to their feelings and quantification of the measurement was done by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the mark. For the present purposes, an overall score of satiety was computed as the mean of all four responses, following reverse-scoring of appropriate items.

By comparing the preferences of an experimental group with a matched control group, we were able to focus on the specific effects of stress, while discounting possible confounding effects of age, BMI, and hunger. As expected, and consistent with the Environmental Security Hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we found that the experience of stress shifted men's body size preferences, such that heavier female body sizes were rated more positively. Broadly speaking, the present results are consistent with the suggestion that individuals are more likely to idealise mature morphological traits, including a heavier body size, when they experience environmental threat, whether from economic <xref rid="pone.0042593-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, proprioceptive <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, or social sources <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>More specifically, the results of the present study showed that participants experiencing psychological stress selected a significantly heavier female body size as maximally attractive compared to the control group. Although the shift in preferences may appear small from a practical point-of-view, it should be noted that the effect size of the uncovered difference was moderate by conventional standards <xref rid="pone.0042593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Additionally, our results showed that men who were stressed rated female body sizes at higher BMI categories as more attractive than their control group counterparts. That is, men in the experimental condition rated women of normal weight, overweight, and, partially at least, obese BMI categories as more attractive than the control group. These results are consistent with previous experimental work indicating that the experience of stress leads participants to prefer more mature physical characteristics <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but extends earlier studies in showing that the stress also impacts on body size judgements.</p><p>Finally, the present results also showed that men in the experimental group idealised a wider range of female body sizes as being physically attractive compared to the control group. As before, the effect size of this between-group difference was moderate by Cohen's <xref rid="pone.0042593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> standards. It was notable that this difference was driven by the shift in the experimental group's upper limit of attractive female bodies. That is, while there was no significant difference in the lower end of the range, the experimental group appear to have shifted the maximum cut-off for attractive bodies at higher BMIs, which resulted in their wider attractiveness range. This has some similarities with the female attractiveness preferences of male and female Zulus living in rural South Africa <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, who also showed a tolerance of a heavier body relative to British observers, which may be linked to their more stressful environment.</p><p>Taken together, the present results provide support for the suggestion that human attractiveness judgements are sensitive to variations in local ecologies and may reflect adaptive strategies for dealing with experiences of threat <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Gangestad1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. That is, human mate choice preferences are likely context-specific and recalibrate as local conditions and experiences change, the end result being mate preferences that remain adaptive regardless of the environmental landscape <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Sugiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The experience of stress may lead to a general preference for more mature physical traits in a potential partner because such traits are associated with improved ability to handle environmental stress <xref rid="pone.0042593-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. More broadly, the present results may also help explain reported cross-cultural differences in ideal body size: in contexts marked by prolonged stress as a result of resource deprivation, individuals may idealise larger body sizes because such body types are associated with better ability to handle environmental threat <xref rid="pone.0042593-Tove2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Our results should be considered in the light of a number of limitations of our design. First, it is possible that having participants in the control group sit quietly without distractions impacted their levels of boredom, which in turn affected their body size judgments. It will, therefore, be important to replicate our findings using attention conditions that control for the task demands of the speech and math tasks, but that do not activate stress response systems <xref rid="pone.0042593-VonDawans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Second, although the TSST is known to induce acute psychological stress and increase levels of cortisol, our design could be improved through more comprehensive measures of the stress variable. For example, measuring stress-induced cortisol, a glucocorticoid that is known to be related to cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0042593-Clow1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> would allow for a more direct test of the associations between stress and body size preferences. At present, then, it cannot be fully established whether our stress procedure reliably activated stress response or sympathetic nervous systems (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure) in the intended manner. Future work could also manipulate when the body size judgements are collected: if stress-induced cortisol is indeed the mechanism that affects body size judgements, then collecting data on these judgements in the first three minutes post-TSST should produce no differential effects compared to collecting them 20 minutes post-TSST <xref rid="pone.0042593-deQuervain1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Second, it is possible that, in the present study, the experience of stress impacted on state self-esteem, empathy, or related constructs, which in turn may have impacted on body size perceptions. As such, in future work it may be necessary to control for these factors when examining the impact of stress on body size ideals. Third, because the PFRS currently only allows for the assessment of female body size judgements, we were not able to examine the effect of stress on women's judgements of male bodies. The available evidence from naturalistic designs would seem to point to a similar shift in preferences as a function of environmental threat <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami12" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Conversely, there is also evidence that hunger salience has differential effects on the preferences of women and men. Specifically, hunger state does not appear to alter female preferences for physical indicators of maturity (e.g., a heavier body size) to the same extent as it does for non-physical characteristics (e.g., more mature personalities) <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As such, future experimental research would do well to examine the effects of acute stress on female preferences for male body size. Finally, our reliance on a student sample means that our findings should only be generalised to the wider population with caution.</p><p>These limitations notwithstanding, the present results provide the first experimental evidence that the experience of psychological stress shapes men's judgements of female body size. Men experiencing stress not only perceive a heavier female body size as maximally attractive, but also more positively perceive heavier female body sizes and have a wider range of body sizes considered physically attractive. Although our work was focused on psychological stress, accumulating evidence suggests that different forms of stress (e.g., physiological, economic, social) have similar effects on physical attractiveness preferences <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042593-Pettijohn5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042593-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These results underline the malleability of physical attractiveness judgements and have important implications for scholarly understanding of reported cross-cultural differences in body size ideals. Further research may also help to better explain reported within-cultural differences in physical attractiveness ideals <xref rid="pone.0042593-Swami13" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, particularly if it can be established that chronic stress impacts upon such ideals.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0042593-Anderson1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
