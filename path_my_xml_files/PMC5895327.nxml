According to World Health Organization (WHO), the diabetes number increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, stroke, heart attack, blindness, and lower limb amputations, and when not properly managed, it will lead to higher health care cost, morbidity, and mortality, thereby creating greater financial burdens.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> With rapidly rising prevalence of diabetes, especially in the developing countries, it is projected to be the 7th leading cause of mortality in 2030.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Worldwide approximately 415 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), and the number is expected to increase to 642 million by 2040,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> making it one of the leading noncommunicable health problem worldwide.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Pakistan has been ranked 7th in diabetes disease burden in the world, it is projected to reach 15% by 2030, and if the present scenario continues, Pakistan is expected to move to top 4th place.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> According to the current statistics of International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in Pakistan there are 7.028 million cases of adults (20&#x02013;79 years) with diabetes, with 6.9% prevalence rate and 2.928 million undiagnosed adults with diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>T2DM is the most prevalent (&#x0003e;90%) type of diabetes,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> requiring patients to adopt specific life style modifications in addition to continued pharmacotherapy. Because of the chronic nature of T2DM, diabetes self-care activities have become an integral component of effective diabetes care around the globe.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Glycemic control, measured in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), has been associated with significant reduction in diabetes-related complications and economic burden.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>T2DM is a self-managed, chronic metabolic disorder, where patients has to take major responsibility to manage their condition by adopting healthy self-care behaviors. The consequences of these self-care behaviors can directly affect health. Managing T2DM requires a huge amount of time, modifications in lifestyle, and confidence to do this. Because of the high cost associated with controlling diabetes, health care providers are now taking an active role in the provision education for diabetes self-management.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>Educational interventions can play an important role to improve patients&#x02019; knowledge and skills regarding diabetes self-management. Systematic reviews of interventions addressing diabetes self-management indicate that the diabetes education courses enhance knowledge, self-care behaviors, and reduction in HbA1C.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Structured self-management education programmes can be delivered on a one-to-one basis or to groups of people with diabetes and should be facilitated by trained educators. The aim of the education is not only to improve knowledge and skills, but also to motivate a person to make and sustain lifestyle changes, by giving them the confidence to make their own treatment/lifestyle choices on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Educational intervention on self-management can be delivered as group education or individually as one-to-one approach. Sturt et al. reported that an individualized approach with the help of a diabetes guide and telephonic support has demonstrated clinically significant reductions in A1c levels, for T2DM patients with poor glycemic control.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Health literacy has been reported as a significant factor influencing the patients&#x02019; glycemic control.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Clinical outcome can be achieved by addressing patients&#x02019; literacy. Pharmacist-based educational interventions are associated with improved medication adherence and glycemic control.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> A review of 16 pharmacist-based interventions resulted in an absolute reduction of HbA1c with an average of 0.62%.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Similarly, in an another review, a reduction in A1c levels up to 2.1% was demonstrated by 20 pharmacist-based interventions.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> A study examining the effectiveness of a free rural clinic for diabetes patients managed by pharmacists found that patients who received education on diabetes, lifestyle modifications, and management of diabetes drug therapy had significant reductions in A1c (&#x02265; 1%) after 24 months.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>Keeping in view the importance educational interventions in diabetes self-care and clinical outcomes, we designed a face-to-face short-term (6 months) pharmacist-led educational intervention model in poorly controlled T2DM patient (HbA1c &#x0003e;7%) in Pakistan. In this study, we will investigate the mean change in HbA1C at 6 months after the baseline, and a comparison will be made with a similar comparator group of T2DM patients receiving standard diabetes care. In addition, comparison between self-care activities and disease knowledge between the groups will also be studied.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This is a 24-week open label, parallel group, prospective randomized controlled trial.

In addition to face-to-face educational intervention patients in the intervention group will also be provided informatory brochures about self-care activities, and a log book to keep record of their self-monitored blood glucose levels.

DMSQ was originally developed to evaluate diabetes self-care behaviors associated with glycemic control within common therapeutic options for adult patients of type 1 and type 2 DM.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Respondents will be asked to rate their specific self-care activities of last 3 months on a 16-item DSMQ. This questionnaire involves a four point likert scale (ranging from 0 &#x02013; &#x02018;does not apply to me&#x02019; to 3 &#x02013; &#x02018;applies to me very much&#x02019;). There are 4 subscales of this study tool; namely, &#x02018;Glucose Management&#x02019; (GM), which is comprised of 5 statements: 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, &#x02018;Dietary Control&#x02019; (DC): comprised of 4 statements: 2, 5, 9, 13, &#x02018;Physical Activity&#x02019; (PA): comprised of 3 statements: 8, 11, 15, and, &#x02018;Health-Care Use&#x02019; (HU): comprised of 3 statements: 3, 7, 14. The last item (item 16) asks the respondents to rate their overall diabetes self-care, hence its score is included only in the &#x02018;Sum Scale&#x02019; (summation of all of the 16 items).</p><p>The scoring process of the DSMQ involves, adding up the scores of all 16 items after reversing the scores of 9 negatively keyed statements. Higher scores will represent more effective self-care.

In 2010, Qayyum et al. observed a clinically significant effect of diabetes self-management education (DSME) on HbA1c reduction in type 1 diabetes children in Pakistan.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> To date, pharmacist-led educational intervention has not been formally tested in T2DM patients in Pakistan. Therefore, this study will provide valuable information on the effectiveness of this intervention in terms of HbA1c reduction, improvements in disease knowledge and self-care activities.</p><p>This study protocol addresses the need to investigate the impact of new educational approaches to deliver a regular diabetes self-management support program. The research will also demonstrate the practicality of such educational intervention on a larger scale. We hypothesized that intervention arm patients will exhibit improvements in HbA1c, self-care activities and disease knowledge in comparison to the control group participants. Thus, we can assume that if 6 months intervention can produce significant reduction in HbA1c, it will also result in beneficial effect on patients&#x02019; long-term outcomes.</p><p>A systematic review by Wubben et al. (2008) on impact of pharmacist 18 interventional studies on diabetes patients demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c, ranging from +0.2 to -2.1% in intervention group as compared to control group.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> A similar effect has also been reported in a recently published systematic review by Pousinho et al. (2016), where 24 studies out of 26 pharmacist-based interventions in the management of T2DM showed a greater reduction in HbA1c (difference ranging from -0.18% to -2.1%) in interventional group.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Improvement in self-care activities has been reported in several pharmacist-based RCT studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup></p><p>To date, limited studies have been conducted to address the association of self-care activities with glycemic control in T2DM patients in Pakistan. From a generalizability perspective, this study will recruit a diverse population across urban and rural Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and can be generalizable to other areas in Pakistan. If the study hypotheses are confirmed, the educational module and material could be applied in diabetes health care, resulting in reduction of diabetes related complications.</p><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This interventional study is first of its kind to be conducted in Pakistan involving randomized control design. This study outcome will help to demonstrate the value of implementing a pharmacist-led educational intervention at diabetes care settings to improve self-care practices and clinical outcomes among Pakistani T2DM patients. A possible limitation of the study is the short duration (6 months intervention), which may not make it possible to examine intervention influence on diabetes related complications. Additionally, a 6-months intervention may result in high drop-out rate. To reduce the chances of drop-out, the researcher will facilitate patients in making appointments for follow-up assessment, and an additional 25% sample population will be recruited to compensate the drop-out.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the colleagues from the CDA hospital for their efforts in designing of this project.
