The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of the neovascular form of AMD, wet AMD (wAMD), is well established (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Kliffen et al., 1997</xref>), and the efficacy of anti-VEGF molecules such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept in treating wAMD has been extensively studied (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Rosenfeld et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Erfurth et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, down-regulation of naturally occurring anti-angiogenic factors such as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) in wAMD has been found to exacerbate the degenerative process (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouck, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Ohno-Matsui et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The advent of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector gene-therapy has enabled exploration of treatments with the potential for longer-term control or reversal of pathogenic processes (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Naldini, 2015</xref>). rAAV vectors have been studied in individuals with monogenic conditions, such as choroideremia (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Vasireddy et al., 2013</xref>), Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Maguire et al., 2008</xref>), and X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS). Further, the potential to deliver long-term, stable protein expression via gene therapy intraocularly to treat a complex disease like wAMD creates the possibility of a paradigm shift in the delivery of ophthalmic healthcare.</p><p>sFLT-1 is a naturally occurring VEGF inhibitor that is a soluble variant of the full length membrane bound VEGFR-1 protein (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Kendall and Thomas, 1993</xref>). It has been reported that serum sFLT-1 is lower in wAMD patients (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Uehara et al., 2015</xref>) and that sFLT-1 alone is sufficient to confer protection against choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rodent and primate models (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>). Recombinant vector mediated gene delivery using subretinal injection of rAAV.sFLT-1 has been one approach used to demonstrate this (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>). This allows for the vector to be placed directly adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors, enabling uptake and transduction of the viral vector. The expression of sFLT-1 is then accomplished through the normal protein-producing machinery of the host cells.</p><p>We previously published our findings on the safety of rAAV.sFLT-1 administered subretinally to 6 patients with advanced wAMD in a Phase 1 trial (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUiSFAi2_EY" id="ir1000">www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUiSFAi2_EY</ext-link>).

Patients were assessed every 4&#x000a0;weeks to the week 52 primary endpoint, with long-term follow-up to continue through to 36&#x000a0;months. Any ocular or systemic adverse events (AEs) were reported to the principal investigator (IJC) who determined whether they were related to gene therapy, ranibizumab therapy, study procedures, or unrelated. Gene therapy patients had all AEs over the 52-week duration recorded in the case report form (CRF), whereas in control patients AEs were recorded in the CRF for up to 30&#x000a0;days after which only AEs deemed related to study procedures, including ranibizumab injections, were recorded. Serious AEs (SAEs) in both groups were reported for the duration of the study and followed up until resolution.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration.

Primary and secondary end points were preselected. The primary end point was measured using physical and ophthalmic examinations, vital signs and clinical laboratory testing. Study assessments included ophthalmic examination, BCVA, and SD-OCT every 4&#x000a0;weeks. FA was performed quarterly. Ranibizumab retreatment was indicated for worsening disease: &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter loss (from patient's previous visit) attributable to CNV or &#x0003e;&#x000a0;5 EDTRS letter loss if apparent to the patient, any increased, new or persistent subsensory, sub-RPE, or intraretinal fluid on SD-OCT &#x0003e;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m from previous visit, or signs of increased CNV leakage on FA. Laboratory tests included routine hematology, renal and hepatic function tests, urine protein, serum IgM, IgG, IgA levels and protein electrophoresis, and enumeration of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (B cells - CD19&#x000a0;+; T cells - CD3&#x000a0;+, CD4&#x000a0;+, CD8&#x000a0;+; and natural killer cells - CD3&#x000a0;&#x02212;, CD16&#x000a0;+, CD56&#x000a0;+). Biodistribution of rAAV.sFLT-1 was assessed by qPCR for rAAV.sFLT-1 DNA and AAV2 capsid detection by ELISA in tears from treated and fellow eye, serum, urine, and saliva. AAV2-specific immune responses assessed included neutralizing antibodies (nAb), total antibodies to AAV2 capsid proteins detected by ELISA and AAV2-specific T-cells detected by interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) ELISpot assay.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Outcomes</title><p>This study was primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of rAAV.sFLT-1 in patients with wAMD. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of rAAV.sFLT-1 using analysis of BCVA, number of ranibizumab retreatments received, and retinal thickness on SD-OCT. There were no specific data exclusion criteria used. Biodistribution of rAAV.sFLT-1 and the immune response to AAV2 were also assessed.

There were 51 ocular AEs in the rAAV.sFLT-1 group which included subconjunctival (10), minor subretinal (8) or vitreous hemorrhage (4) and anterior chamber inflammation/uveitis (3). Twenty-six (51&#x000b7;0%) of these AEs were related to the study procedure and occurred within 30&#x000a0;days post administration (Table S3). The majority of cases were deemed to be mild in nature, visually insignificant with no permanent sequelae. Two ocular AEs were considered possibly related to rAAV.sFLT-1 were eye inflammation, and anterior chamber inflammation, which were mild in nature and resolved without sequelae. As expected in this age group, visually significant nuclear cataract developed in all phakic patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11) following vitrectomy.

One case was attributed to endophthalmitis 3&#x000a0;days after an intravitreal ranibizumab injection, the second to a large submacular hemorrhage, and the third due to the progression of wAMD. The control group also reported one case each of posterior vitreous detachment, corneal opacities, and cataract (Table S3). Of the 11 controls, 7 were phakic.

None of the 7 SAEs in the gene therapy group were attributed to rAAV.sFLT-1 gene therapy (Table S2) and no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests values were reported. Two transient laboratory AEs normalized to within reference range by the following visit were deemed by the investigator (IJC) to be possibly but not likely related to gene therapy. Over the 52&#x000a0;weeks follow up, all other non-ocular AEs were classified as mild or moderate and were deemed unrelated to the study procedure (Table S3). The most commonly reported non-ocular AEs involved the respiratory system. In the gene therapy group there were 4 episodes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI, 2 undefined, 1 sinusitis and 1 nasopharyngitis) and 2 episodes of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). These respiratory tract infections were mild and self-limiting and occurred between 75 and 358&#x000a0;days post entering the trial, without any trend. One URTI and one LRTI were reported prior to receiving rAAV.sFLT-1 at baseline and at day 19 after gene therapy, respectively. In the control group there were 4 AEs with an infectious nature, including 2 URTI (1 undefined and 1 sinusitis). Other non-ocular adverse events in both groups were deemed unrelated to the study procedure (Table S3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3.4</label><title>Biodistribution</title><p>AAV2 capsid was not detected in samples collected at any time point. In the gene therapy group, rAAV.sFLT-1 DNA was detected transiently in the tears from the treated eye in a subset of patients (13/21), in the tears of the fellow eye in one patient, in the saliva in one patient, and in the urine in one patient. All these occurrences resolved prior to the week 4 visit and none of the patients had detectable vector DNA in blood (Table S4).

Excluding the initial 2 mandatory injections in both groups as per protocol at baseline and week 4, the median number of ranibizumab injections was 2.0 (IQR: 1.0 to 6.0) for the gene therapy group compared to 4.0 (IQR: 3.5 to 4.0) for the control group (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

The study also investigates the potential association between the safety and patient-focused efficacy of rAAV.sFLT-1 gene therapy delivered subretinally.</p><p>Results of the study showed no serious gene therapy-related ocular or systemic side effects. All AEs related to gene therapy or study procedure were mild or moderate and resolved without sequelae. These findings were consistent with the Phase 1 study (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>), as well as other AAV ocular studies (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Vasireddy et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Maguire et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Pierce and Bennett, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Simonelli et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Testa et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of mild and moderate ocular AEs were associated with the surgery involving vitrectomy and subretinal injection (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Maguire et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>). As these procedures were a necessary component of the AAV therapy, they are an important consideration for safety. A variety of ocular hemorrhages associated with the surgery were mild in nature without any visual significance and with no permanent sequelae. Cataracts are a known side effect of vitrectomy (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Blankenship and Machemer, 1985</xref>) and progression to visually significant nuclear cataract in all phakic gene therapy patients and in 1 control patient was noted. It is not yet clear if subretinal injection can be done safely without vitrectomy. A higher number of systemic AEs were reported in the gene therapy group compared to the control group, which we interpret as due to the reporting procedures described in the Methods section. Respiratory system-related AEs were reported more frequently in patients treated with rAAV.sFLT-1 (28%) compared to controls (18%). However, the infections were heterogeneous in character, and differences in frequency between the gene therapy group and control group were not statistically significant. Overall the incidence of respiratory system-related AEs in the gene therapy group was less frequent than rates published for existing anti-VEGF agents in late-stage wAMD trials, so an association with rAAV.sFLT-1 gene therapy seems unlikely.</p><p>Results of rAAV.sFLT-1 qPCR, AAV2 capsid ELISA, and sFLT-1 protein quantitation indicate that the biodistribution of rAAV.sFLT-1 outside the target tissue (retina) after subretinal injection is limited and transient. No rAAV.sFLT-1 DNA or AAV2 capsid were detected in any of the assessed samples at or after the week 4 visit. The measured systemic levels of sFLT-1 and VEGF in serum, urine, and saliva were highly variable, fluctuating and dependent on the individual and we could not identify any trend that would have suggested systemic effect. The only immune response to rAAV.sFLT-1 therapy detected was sero conversion of nAbs observed in 3 patients which is consistent with previously published reports showing that subretinal administration of AAV does not frequently induce humoral immune responses to the AAV capsid (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Recent reports show that subretinal delivery of rAAV does not affect the efficacy of rAAV.sFLT-1 therapy when subsequently administered to the fellow eye (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Amongst the patients who received the rAAV.sFLT-1 gene therapy, 12 (57&#x000b7;1%) had pre-existing nAbs to AAV2 and it seems that pre-existing nAbs to AAV2 do not necessarily decrease the efficacy of the gene therapy administered by subretinal injection. This study does not raise any new concerns for ocular gene therapy with respect to the variables of patient safety and immune response and confirms the published work of others (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Unlike many of the previously reported anti-VEGF trials (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">CATT Research Group et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">IVAN Study Investigators et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Heier et al., 2012</xref>) for wAMD, 29 of 32 (90&#x000b7;6%) recruited patients in this study were not treatment-na&#x000ef;ve, having received a median of 9.0 (IQR: 5.0 to 14.0) previous anti-VEGF injections. The chronic nature of baseline disease in the patients participating in this safety trial may have diminished the potential for large vision gains or fluid loss on SD-OCT. In addition the study was designed to assess the safety of rAAV.sFLT-1 delivered by subretinal injection and sought to provide PRN ranibizumab therapy in both arms. Therefore, no significant difference in BCVA and CPT between the gene therapy and control groups was expected. Nevertheless, the median change in BCVA for the gene therapy group was +&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x000a0;0 ETDRS letters at week 52, and for the control group was &#x02212;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x000a0;0 ETDRS letters confirming that rAAVsFLT-1 did not have a deleterious effect. In the control group, this loss of ETDRS letters potentially could suggest under-treatment of the wAMD with ranibizumab, greater intrinsic disease activity or a higher complication rate for intravitreal injections. However, closer examination reveals that this loss was due to 3 of 11 (27&#x000b7;3%) patients who lost in excess of 20 ETDRS letters caused by infrequent but well known complications of the natural history of wAMD and PRN intravitreal therapy. Once these 3 patients were removed from the analysis there was no statistically significant difference in BCVA improvement between the gene therapy and the control groups. The incidence of moderate vision loss was similar in the treatment and control groups suggesting that there might be a subgroup of patients who do not have the capacity to respond to anti-VEGF treatments. As all the phakic patients in the gene therapy group required cataract surgery presumed secondary to the initial vitrectomy, lens status and cataract removal were investigated as possible explanations for the median final BCVA of this group being higher than the control group. Although the numbers are small, post hoc analysis of initial lens status and need for cataract surgery was not found to drive the BCVA in the rAAV.sFLT-1-treated group and the control group at the week 52 time point.</p><p>This study found that the median CPT over time showed a greater decrease in the control group than the gene therapy group. While both groups were given ranibizumab injections at baseline and week 4, the gene therapy group patients received a core vitrectomy, associated with subretinal gene therapy, at day 7. This may have removed any remaining active ranibizumab from the first intravitreal injection, thus leading to a smaller initial response in the gene therapy group. In most studies (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">CATT Research Group et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Lalwani et al., 2009</xref>), the greatest decreases in CPT occurred in the first 2 months of the study.</p><p>The gene therapy group had a trend towards fewer ranibizumab retreatments than the control group, and in a post hoc analysis 11 (53%) gene therapy patients received &#x02264;&#x000a0;2 ranibizumab retreatments, with the majority having improved vision. A cohort of the gene therapy group received &#x000a0;&#x0003e;2 ranibizumab retreatments, but lost or gained &#x0003c;&#x000a0;5 letters, suggestive of either under treatment or a bimodal response alluding to either lack of gene therapy effect, less susceptibility to anti-VEGF therapy, or greater intrinsic disease activity. We were not able to identify any reliable indicators to suggest a cause for this potential divergent response such as pre-existing immunity to AAV, anti-VEGF resistance, under treatment, variability of successful delivery or the location of the delivery. Potential reasons for variability between this Phase 2a study and the previous Phase 1 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>) in BCVA and CPT outcomes were examined (Table S1). Product quality was evaluated and found to meet drug specifications in the lots used in both trials and showed no difference in biologic activity in vitro. Other possible causes include differing disease stage and anatomic appearance such as degree of subretinal fluid, geographic atrophy, subretinal fibrosis, pigment epithelial detachment, and CNV location. These variations in anatomic appearance and disease stage may also have impacted certain technical factors of therapy including diffusion in the retina and subretinal space. In the Phase 1 study, the baseline median BCVA in ETDRS letters was 40.0 (IQR: 33.0 to 54.0) versus 63.0 (IQR: 50.0 to 71.0) in the Phase 2a patients, while the median CPT was 549.0 (IQR: 268.0 657.0) compared to 332.5 (IQR: 295.5 to 459.8) &#x003bc;m, respectively. The difference in thickness could have had an impact on the mobility of sFLT-1 to the area of the subfoveal neovascularization via changing pharmacokinetic properties (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Holash et al., 2002</xref>). Other possibilities are difficult to quantify but may include intrinsic VEGF load or the degree of anti-VEGF responsiveness in this cohort of patients. Additional preclinical laboratory studies evaluating potential sources of variation in the apparent clinical effect between the patients in this study and our initial report (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Rakoczy et al., 2015</xref>) using this approach are underway. These include a determination of the optimal vector copy number to be injected, the impact of site of injection and the efficacy of alternative modified AAV vectors and cDNA constructs. There were several limitations to this study. These include the fact that this was an open label study as the gene therapy required a surgery (subretinal injection and vitrectomy) that could not be mimicked by a sham treatment due to the constraints of a clinical trial. Although the technicians measuring BCVA were masked, the open label study design allowed for potential patient or investigator bias. Also, the optimal method for subretinal administration has not been standardized relative to both safety and potential efficacy in this patient population with an anatomically abnormal macula due to intrinsic disease relative to the normal eye. The retreatment criteria differed slightly from other published studies (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">CATT Research Group et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Lalwani et al., 2009</xref>), but were designed to allow for assessment of gene therapy activity as evidenced by reduced need for ranibizumab retreatments. There exist a number of different and evolving community standards for anti-VEGF retreatment including programmed monthly injections, treat and extend regimens, and PRN regimens. Furthermore, this Phase 2a study only assessed 1 dose of gene therapy against control, which prevented an understanding of a possible dose-response effect. Finally, 29 of 32 patients had previously been treated to varying degrees for wAMD, in contrast to most wAMD studies that have enrolled only treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients and that decision may have also affected the results of the trial.</p><p>Based upon the results of this study, rAAV.sFLT-1 is safe when injected under the retina, but further clinical trials are needed to prove gene therapy is a viable option for wAMD. Although we performed several post hoc analyzes, the number of patients involved in the study was too small to make useful assessments of clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>CMP, MADE, MF, ILM have no conflict of interest.
