Docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered intravenously [IV] every 3 weeks) or paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV weekly) were administered for a minimum of six cycles (18 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Trastuzumab was administered at standard doses (with docetaxel: 8 mg/kg IV loading dose, 6 mg/kg IV for subsequent cycles; with paclitaxel: 4 mg/kg IV loading dose, 2 mg/kg IV in subsequent weeks). If taxane or trastuzumab were discontinued for toxicity, treatment with the remaining agent was permitted. T-DM1 and pertuzumab were administered at standard doses (T-DM1: 3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks; pertuzumab 840 mg IV loading dose, 420 mg IV every 3 weeks for subsequent cycles).

Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Assessment of the primary efficacy end point was planned when approximately 678 PFS events by independent review had occurred. A two-sided stratified log-rank test was used to compare PFS between treatment groups. PFS was also descriptively assessed in prespecified subgroups. Two prespecified interim OS analyses and a final OS analysis were planned, applying a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with Pocock stopping boundary. The first OS interim analysis was performed at the time of PFS analysis. Final analysis of OS is planned to occur at a minimum follow-up of 46 months after the last patient has been enrolled. If the OS analysis in the intention-to-treat population shows statistical significance, eligible patients would be permitted to switch from trastuzumab plus taxane to T-DM1 or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab.</p><p>A clinically meaningful difference in HRQOL was defined as a &#x02265; 5-point decrease from baseline FACT-B TOI-PFB score<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; a sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare overall results with the postamendment population. For analysis of time-to-event end points (PFS, OS, FACT-B), median time to event was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs were computed by using stratified and unstratified Cox proportional hazards regression models. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated descriptively.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted independently to compare each of the T-DM1&#x02212;containing arms with control. For each comparison, confirmatory hierarchical statistical testing was performed in a prespecified sequential order as long as statistical significance was obtained. Overall &#x003b1;-level of 5% was split, with 2.5% allocated to each comparison (Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Fig A1</xref>, online only). Confirmatory comparisons between T-DM1&#x02212;containing arms were to be conducted only if PFS superiority for T-DM1 plus pertuzumab versus control was demonstrated.</p><p>The study had 80% power for PFS noninferiority and superiority analyses. Noninferiority was established if the upper limit of the 97.5% CI for HR was below a prespecified noninferiority margin of HR, 1.1765. This noninferiority margin corresponds to a 15% reduction in median PFS, from 11 months assumed for the control arm to 9.35 months for T-DM1&#x02013;containing arms. Target HR for superiority was 0.75 (33.3% improvement in median PFS from 11 months to 14.7 months) for T-DM1&#x02013;containing regimens compared with control, and 0.73 for comparison between T-DM1&#x02013;containing regimens (37% improvement in median PFS from 14.7 months to 20.1 months).

Whereas the median PFS observed with T-DM1 (14.1 months) was similar to that observed in a previous phase II study,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> median PFS of 13.7 months in the trastuzumab plus taxane arm was somewhat longer than expected on the basis of reports of this regimen that were available at the time of study design (median PFS of approximately 9.5 months to 12.5 months).<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, the median PFS of control arm is consistent with results from more recent studies.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Addition of pertuzumab to T-DM1 did not improve PFS. Although preclinical data showed synergistic activity for the combination of T-DM1 and pertuzumab,<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> such activity was not substantiated in this trial. Thus, further study that includes ongoing biomarker research may help to better explain this unexpected result.</p><p>Whereas T-DM1&#x02013;containing treatments did not show a statistically significant improvement overall in PFS, data presented here suggest that some patients may derive more relative benefit from T-DM1 than do others. Subgroup analyses showed a numerical trend for an increased relative treatment effect with T-DM1 in patients who had received HER2-directed therapy or taxanes in the early breast cancer setting. This finding is consistent with prior trials in which T-DM1 improved clinical outcomes in patients who previously received treatment with trastuzumab and taxane.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Moreover, in patients who achieved response, duration of response was numerically longer in T-DM1&#x02212;treated patients compared with trastuzumab plus taxane&#x02212;treated patients. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether specific characteristics can define a subgroup of patients with a greater response to T-DM1 in this treatment setting.</p><p>Safety profiles of T-DM1 and pertuzumab in this study were consistent with previous reports.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Treatment with T-DM1 seemed to be more tolerable than that of the control regimen, as there were numerically fewer grade &#x02265; 3 AEs and fewer treatment discontinuations as a result of AEs observed with T-DM1 versus trastuzumab plus taxane. Of note, incidence of grade &#x02265; 3 AEs in the control arm (54.1%) was lower than that observed in other trials that used trastuzumab plus docetaxel in the first-line setting (63% to 91%).<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This may be explained, at least in part, by the observation that 27% of patients received paclitaxel instead of docetaxel in the control arm of this study. Nevertheless, T-DM1 also seemd to be more tolerable on the basis of a numerically lower incidence of certain clinically important AEs (febrile neutropenia, neuropathy, diarrhea, and alopecia) versus trastuzumab plus taxane. The most commonly reported high-grade AEs with T-DM1 were laboratory abnormalities, such as transaminase elevation and thrombocytopenia, as previously observed in other T-DM1 studies.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> T-DM1&#x02212;treated patients also had a longer time to a clinically meaningful decrease according to the FACT-B TOI-PFB scale, which indicated that they maintained baseline HRQOL longer than did trastuzumab plus taxane&#x02212;treated patients.</p><p>In conclusion, T-DM1&#x02212;containing regimens demonstrated noninferior&#x02014;but not superior&#x02014;PFS compared with treatment with trastuzumab plus taxane. On the basis of the improved tolerability and noninferior PFS observed with T-DM1, it may provide an alternate treatment option to trastuzumab plus taxane in patients HER2-positive MBC. Indeed, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has included T-DM1 in its breast cancer guidelines as a first-line treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC who are considered not suitable for treatment with the preferred regimen, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and a taxane.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by F.

Complete and partial responses determined by independent review were confirmed by consecutive tumor assessments at least 4 weeks apart on the basis of RECIST 1.1. A best response of stable disease was only made after the patient was on study for a minimum of 6 weeks after random assignment. If the patient was not on study within this minimal time period, any tumor assessment that indicated stable disease before 6 weeks had a best response of not evaluable unless disease progression was identified.
