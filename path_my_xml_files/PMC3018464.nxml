A program on the intervention of jump-landing technique is possibly an important preventative measure since it appeared to reduce the incidence of lower extremity injuries. In real life situations, amateur sports lack the infrastructure and funds to have a sports physician or therapist permanently supervising such a program.

An equal selection of female and male teams with allocation to intervention and control group is obtained. The program is a modification of other prevention programs previously proven to be effective. All exercises in the current program are adjusted so that a more progressive development in the exercise is presented. Both the control and intervention group continue with their normal training routine, while the intervention group carries out the program on jump-landing technique. The full intervention program has a duration of three months and is performed 2 times a week during warm-up (5-10 min). Injuries are registered during the entire season.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study can give valuable information on the effect of a coach supervised intervention program on jump-landing technique and injury occurrence.

In volleyball, gymnastics and basketball respectively, a total of 2.8 [CI 95%: 2.0 -3.6], 2.2 [CI 95%: 1.6 - 2.9] and 9.8 [CI 95%: 8.5 - 11.1] injuries per 1,000 exposure hours have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The majority of the injuries in these sports occur at the lower extremity, accounting for more than 60% of all injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both overuse (e.g. shin splints, stress fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], patellar tendinopathy (PT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], patellar femoral pain syndrome (PFPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and acute injuries (e.g. ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and ankle sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) often occur in jump-landing sports.</p><p>Sports injuries often are accompanied by pain or other physical discomforts, which in turn result in use of healthcare resources and possibly also in absenteeism from work. The severity of sports injuries can be described based on different criteria including sporting time lost, permanent damage and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In a study of Cumps et al. (2007) the number of basketball days for which the athlete was not able to play or train because of the injury sustained was set on 3 to 7 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This means that injury occurrence can put a stop to the athlete's participation in his sport for a long time. From the study of Cumps et al. (2008)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] it also can be concluded that the direct medical and the indirect costs in Flanders involved in acute injuries only, are respectively 15,027,423 &#x020ac; and 111,420,813 &#x020ac;. No information of the cost of overuse injuries was found, so it can be assumed that the actual cost of both acute and overuse injuries actually is much higher. Even more, important aspects of injury occurrence are the long term consequences. After, for example an ACL-injury or episodes of anterior knee pain, many athletes seem predisposed to osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This can already occur at an early age and result in lifelong constraint in sport participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In order to reduce short and long term consequences, there is a need for sports injury prevention.</p><p>Arguably the most important injury mechanism for these lower extremity acute and overuse injuries is the jump-landing maneuver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Proper jump-landing movement patterns are essential to absorb the generated impact forces efficiently, and are suggested to be strongly related to the athlete's risk for injuries to the lower extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consequently, various jump-landing related risk factors, such as increased knee valgus during jump-landing technique, ankle instability or a stiff landing technique, appear to be related with injury occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, a stiff landing strategy increases the risk of sustaining injuries due to higher ground reaction forces and decreased shock absorption during landing. Specific movement patterns such as dynamic valgus or stiff jump-landings technique can be a risk factor for respectively ACL injuries and PT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>With the relatively high rate of injuries of the lower extremity in jump-landing sports and the severity of these injuries, there is a need for practical preventive programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A program aiming at an improvement of jump-landing technique is potentially an important preventive measure while it is able to target a variety of risk factors for a variety of injuries. Previous attempts have been made to prevent specific injuries through improvement of jump-landing technique, e.g. recurrent ankle sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and ACL injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, most available prevention programs were supervised by sport physicians or physical therapists. This might work for (sub)elite sports were medical supervision is always available, but amateur sports lack the infrastructure and funds to have a sports physician or therapist permanently supervising such a program. Nevertheless, it is amateur sports where, in absolute sense, the injury burden is highest through high participation numbers. Therefore, the true effectiveness of available preventive programs in this important setting is questionable.</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a coach supervised intervention program targeting jump-landing technique on the incidence of lower extremity injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>- What is the effectiveness of a coach supervised jump landing intervention program on the incidence of acute and overuse injuries to the lower extremity?</p><p>- What is the effect of a coach supervised jump landing intervention program on jump landing technique of individual athletes?</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The CONSORT statement was followed to describe the design of this study.

Assuming a dropout rate of about 20% a total of 82 athletes are needed to detect a potentially clinically relevant effect of the intervention. However, as teams serve as unit of randomization, a cluster effect should be taken into account. Therefore, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 20% was considered, resulting in a total of 240 athletes from 24 teams is necessary at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Of the 110 Flemish teams of the elite division, 24 teams are included and equally randomized to two study groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Coaches note the total duration of each training session and match, and classify the level of participation of each player (that is, in terms of full, three quarters, one half, one quarter, or no participation). If the player does not participate fully, the coach note the reason--that is, being injured, ill, or absent for other reasons. Completed exposure forms are returned on a weekly basis. Every week trainers are contacted by phone and urged to fill out the exposure sheets, and, if necessary, the injury forms. In this, we followed the example of Verhagen et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] who applied the same method of exposure registration.</p></sec><sec><title>Injury definition</title><p>To determine the effectiveness of the program for the prevention of injuries, all injuries that occur during the entire season are registered in both the IG and CG. Injuries are divided into two main categories: acute or overuse injuries. An acute injury is defined as a sports accident, with a sudden, direct cause/onset, which requires at least minimal (medical) care (e.g. ice or taping) and which causes the injured subject to miss out on at least 1 training session. Exclusion criteria involve muscle cramps and mild bruises. A subject sustains an overuse injury if he or she experiences a physical discomfort, with an insidious onset, that caused pain and/or stiffness of the musculoskeletal system, and that is present before, during and/or after the sports activity. The overuse injury is only registered if present for at least three consecutive sessions. Illness and fatigue are not registered as overuse injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Injury registration</title><p>Coaches receive injury forms at the start of the study. In case of injury, the coach completes in concordance with the injured player injury registration forms, which have to be completed within one week after injury onset. On this form the player is asked to provide information on the injury location, injury type, diagnosis of the injury, direct cause of the injury, preventive measures used at the time of the injury, first aid given, and subsequent medical treatment. If an injury is noted on the exposure form and no injury registration form is received within two weeks after the injury is logged, the coach is contacted and urged to let the player complete the injury registration form.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Process evaluation &#x00026; Compliance</title><p>Coaches are contacted on a weekly basis by means of a telephone call. The goal of this call is to inquire about the ongoing of the study and to follow-up on any missing exposure or injury registration forms. In addition, IG coaches are asked whether they followed the prescribed exercises for that particular week. If not, the exercises that are carried are noted in order to gain insight into the compliance to the program.</p><p>At T1 coaches are required to complete a questionnaire inquiring on their opinion of the intervention program, their compliance to the prescribed exercises, and to inquire about any difficulties in executing the program.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The injury incidence density (IID) is calculated as the number of new injuries per 1,000 hours of participation, using exposure time of each individual participant until the first injury. The number of injuries divided by the total time at risk is the preferred measure of incidence because it can accommodate variations in the exposure time of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If an athlete suffers multiple injuries, only the first injury will be considered in the analysis.</p><p>Because the unit of allocation was teams, we perform a multilevel Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, using the computer based software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA), to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Teams will be used as cluster levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The difference between the CG and IG regarding the JLS-system is calculated using Repeated Measures ANOVA (p &#x0003c; 0.05) for normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney-<italic>U </italic>test (p &#x0003c; 0.05) for data which are not normally distributed.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of this study</title><p>This study evaluates the effect of a coach supervised injury prevention program. If successful this will provide valuable information for sports injury prevention practice. As the majority of injuries are sustained in amateur sports where medical guidance is limited, effective coach supervised prevention has a great potential impact on public health.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IA, EC, EV, RM were involved in the conception and design of the study.
