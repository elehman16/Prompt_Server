The children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group in equal numbers. First, the demographic information of participants was collected through a questionnaire containing components of perceived threat, health literacy, and oral health behaviors using a valid and reliable questionnaire. The ECC status of the children was established by a dentist. Control group received &#x0201c;standard well baby care&#x0201d;. The experimental group received standard well baby care in addition to educational interventions, including lecture and group discussion. After 6&#x000a0;months, the participant completed the questionnaire for the second time, and the children&#x02019;s teeth were reexamined.

The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) defines ECC as the presence of one or more decayed (non-cavitated or cavitated), missing (as a result of caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child 71&#x000a0;months of age or younger. AAPD also specifies that, in children younger than 3&#x000a0;years of age, any sign of smooth-surface caries is indicative of the severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A comprehensive review, including studies from Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and North America, showed that the prevalence of ECCs in socioeconomically-deprived groups could be as high as 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In an article by Tootooni et al. (2015) the prevalence of ECC among children between 2 and 3&#x000a0;years old was reported to be very high, with 61.1% of samples displaying pitted caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite the improvement in dentistry practice, ECC still remains as remains a serious challenge for health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Early caries in primary teeth causes many difficulties, including problems with chewing and speaking, pain, psychological problems, and negative effects on the child&#x02019;s growth, weight, and quality of life both within the family and in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ECC is preventable with appropriate educational interventions and health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a study conducted by Manchanda et al. at Oxford University, providing mothers with oral health education led to a reduction in dental caries in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Nutbeam (1998) believed that health promotion interventions are conducted on four levels. The first level includes health promotion activities, mainly consisting of health education. The second level includes discussing the health promotion outcomes and health literacy. The third level includes intermediate health outcomes or behavior. Finally, the fourth level involves examining health indicators, such as the prevalence of caries or dental plaque scores. Education provides opportunities for learning aimed at improving health literacy, and subsequent ability of individuals to improve their health behaviors. Doing so, individuals&#x02019; quality of life and health indicators will progress. It should be noted that there is not any linear relationship among these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Conducting theory-based interventions is among the preconditions for ensuring the effectiveness of an intervention. In this regard, the focus has recently moved from the individual behaviors toward multi-level behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Health promotion consists of two main parts: a change in environment or some regional policies, and health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Health education is still considered as a basic component of health promotion and is widely recognized as a tool for changing health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that people&#x02019;s behaviors are affected by factors such as a perceived susceptibility, diagnosis and estimation of each person&#x02019;s susceptibility to a disease and exposure to risk and perceived severity, and feelings about the seriousness of getting a disease or not treating it. More precisely, a perceived threat was more effective in the acquisition of oral health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; therefore, considering these theoretical structures can be important in oral care education. Education should be conducted in a way that individuals acquire knowledge, a positive attitude toward the particular health issue, health literacy, and the necessary skills to carry out the elements of the health program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These requirements ensure that people can process and understand basic health information properly and make correct decisions regarding their health; these behaviors are known as health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These desirable beliefs and decisions should lead to the adoption of healthy behaviors and should ultimately improve oral health-related indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite rigorous treatment and examination in pediatric dentistry practice, little attention has been paid to oral health education. Given the suggested deficiency in oral health, on one hand, and to fill this gap in pediatric dentistry, on the other, conducting a health promotion intervention seems to be necessary.</p><p id="Par13">Education is frequently the missing element in the care provided to a population. To accomplish the goal of educating a population about dental health care, we set up a final-year dentistry student to provide dental health education to women with children aged 12&#x02013;36&#x000a0;months old. Based on the previously defined issues, the most significant questions arose: Could health promotion intervention improve children&#x02019;s oral health and could oral health education consequently reduce ECC? Therefore, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a health promotion intervention aimed at ECC prevention in the west of Ahvaz (southwest Iran).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par14">This experimental study was carried out through a parallel-group design in the health care clinic of western Ahvaz, located in the southwest of Iran, from 25 April 2015 to 10 April 2016.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria for participants</title><p id="Par15">The study population included women with children aged 12&#x02013;36&#x000a0;months old without caries (caries-free children were selected to reduce any biases in relation to considering fluorosis or enamel hypoplasia as ECC) and 104 women with children with an age of 1 to 3&#x000a0;years old.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: proficiency in the Persian language, willingness to participate in the study, and having no history of disease in the mothers or the children (due to their effect on dental health, such as epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, use of anticholinergic drugs) according to health care records. Children must have at least 8 completely erupted teeth, 4 maxillary anteriors, and 4 mandibular anteriors. Women were excluded if they: 1. do not attend the educational session, 2. move to another city, and 3. got diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with education.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par16">Sample size was estimated by a statistical power analysis. The primary outcome of this study was to measure score changes that might be observed for perceived threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, to detect a 1.5-point increase in the baseline perceived threat score at 5% significance, the study would require a sample of 52 participants per each group (intervention and control groups); thus, the study would have a power of 90%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par17">The study was conducted in the maternal-child health wards of western Ahvaz, Iran. This center is a large comprehensive health that gives health services to a large number of people. The participants were recruited through local advertising.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par18">Based on information obtained from a pilot study performed by the authors, an educational intervention (consisting of one individual session and a group (4&#x02013;6 person) lasting for half an hour) was designed with the aid of women referring to the health center for monitoring their children&#x02019;s growth. To save time, sessions were conducted when mothers were waiting for their children&#x02019;s growth monitoring to be performed. Sessions were held based on question and answer, lectures, group discussions. Next, after in-person brief interventions, educational short message service (SMS) reminders were sent fortnightly for 6&#x000a0;months to the women to keep them motivated about their children&#x02019;s dental care. During the educational intervention, the women were supplied with basic information about observance of children&#x02019;s oral health (such as appropriate nutritional patterns, tips about how to breastfeed the child at night, and how to brush or clean children&#x02019;s teeth). By providing statistics on caries and their complications, we drew the women&#x02019;s attention to this issue. Next, the women were asked to evaluate whether prevention or treatment was considered as a better form of dental care. In addition, photos of children with either healthy or decayed tooth were showed to them and they were asked to evaluate, which child&#x02019;s smile is more beautiful. The costs of preventive behaviors versus dental treatments were explained in simple examples for the women and they were asked to evaluate which one is better: taking preventative care or treatment.</p><p id="Par19">The educational intervention was based on reliable materials and sources from the Ministry of Health, while prepared slides were confirmed by an expert in the area of educational technology. In addition, participants were given a pamphlet containing brief and important tips on the promotion of educational items, and the need for oral health care for their children. The cost of educational materials was $2 per person. Before the educational session, information about both groups was gathered, and education was delivered to the experimental group in addition to standard childcare procedures. The control group received standard care &#x0201c;well baby program&#x0201d;, which includes the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], child growth and development. Through this program, a health care provider measures child&#x02019;s height and weight and marks them on a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.parents.com/baby/growth-charts/">growth chart</ext-link>. The health care provider uses the chart to determine how the baby is growing compared with other children of the same age and gender. Also, she/he asks mothers questions about how her child is doing - whether she&#x02019;s hit typical milestones, is active, and is feeding and sleeping okay to screen some behavioral or intellectual problems. Well-baby visits are a chance for mothers to address their concerns.</p><p id="Par20">After 6&#x000a0;months, follow-up information was gathered from both the intervention and control groups using a questionnaire. Then, the children&#x02019;s teeth were examined by a dentist to check for ECC. We considered tracking time as 6&#x000a0;months, as a period of 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months is considered desirable in behavioral science studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study. Next, BR went through the clinical records of the remaining participants to assess their eligibility. At this stage, women with medical conditions affecting their probable oral health status were omitted. Participants eligible for participation were asked to provide informed consent and completed a questionnaire. After baseline measures were completed, BR introduced the participants to MA and left to ensure that she remained blind to the group allocation. A research nurse randomized participants into either the experimental or the control groups. BR presented the educational intervention to the experimental group in the waiting room. After 6&#x000a0;months, participants in both groups completed the questionnaires and were examined again, during the research follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par34">This study is a secondary data analysis obtained from an earlier research, confirmed by the Ethics Committee of Ahvaz Jundishupur University of Medical Sciences.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">This study is among few works investigating the effectiveness of health promotion interventions in preventing ECC at four recommended levels. The results of this study showed the effectiveness of the educational intervention on women&#x02019;s perceived threat regarding ECC. In line with our study, the theory-based studies by Shamsi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and Shhnazi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] proved the perceived threat (including perceived susceptibility and severity) of the need for oral care, specifically regarding dental care for women. However, a study by Moinie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] demonstrated that the educational program failed to improve perceived susceptibility scores in results that were not consistent with the results of this study. That difference may be explained by their use of peer education, specifically, child-to-child, which led to less effectiveness when compared to education by dentists; as a result, there was less susceptibility to perceiving a threat to oral health as compared to our study. Regarding the increased perceived threat for women with children younger than 3-years-old, family health personnel and dentists must act to increase the education of the women, by providing statistics on the prevalence of ECC in children younger than 36&#x000a0;months of age, their complications, and their effects on many aspects of general well-being.</p><p id="Par40">The second level of intervention evaluated the effect of specific education on oral health literacy. No other study was found that evaluated the impact of education on oral health literacy; however, a study by Meppelink revealed a positive impact of educational intervention on general health literacy and health behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this study, simple educational explanations of materials in words, and in educational pamphlets, along with the chance to interact with the dentist, helped participants promote their oral health literacy. Previous studies have reported that using simple and understandable materials also helps improve health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">This study identified the improved performance of oral health behaviors for children. The study of Hajimiri et al. revealed that education based on a health belief model improves the performance of women who brush teeth of their 3 to 6-year-old children; these findings are consistent with the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, Manchanda et al. argued that oral health education for women with children between 6 to 18&#x000a0;months old improved the performance of women brushing for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The results of a study by Huebner also showed that educational interventions increase brushing, which is consistent with the findings of this research. Although the study of Aljafari et al. highlighted that increasing information can improve oral health performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Glanz et al. emphasized that mere information is not enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition to providing education, improving clients&#x02019; beliefs and skills were important in adopting healthy behaviors. In this study, participants took advantage of health promotion approaches, such as improvement of their skills in oral health behaviors, including learning how to brush their babies&#x02019; teeth.</p><p id="Par42">Health promotion interventions should be effective in changing health-related consequences. In this study, less tooth caries was observed in the primary teeth of children within the educated participants in the experimental group. Clearly, oral health education given to women with children younger than 36&#x000a0;months of age can improve women&#x02019;s performance in brushing and cleaning their children&#x02019;s teeth, and reduce the incidence of early caries. In a study conducted by Medeiros et al., increasing information and motivation of women improved the oral health status of their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Reduction of ECC, as a result of the educational intervention, has been also reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The strengths of this study were comprised of forming a primary care intervention that can be generalized to similar primary care settings; besides, the interventions included are feasible and inexpensive. Since dental schools need to respond to epidemiological challenges with enhanced education methods, the results of the current study might help dental schools overcome the challenge of increasing ECCs. Regarding the lack of correlation between health behaviors and demographic variables, we can utilize the contents of the present intervention for the population, regardless of their demographic characteristics.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par44">Not measuring the impact of the intervention on reading and calculating other dimensions of health literacy are two main limitations of the present study. Considering that literacy is closely related to the level of education of individuals, this limitation cannot much affect the results. Another limitation was that we did not assess the babies&#x02019; feeding methods. However, since more than 80% of women in Ahvaz apply a mix of breastfeeding and bottle feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], this limitation might not affect the validity of the study very much. Another limitation of this work is not performing dental surfaces examination. Finally, the results of the current study might not be generalized to all pre-school children since we entered caries-free children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Direction for future research</title><p id="Par45">Further studies among all pre-school children including children with dental caries considering the above-mentioned limitations are recommended to confirm the results of the current study. Besides, applying a theory-based electronic health education to improve oral health should be considered for future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">The four-level evaluation of health promotion conducted in this work had a desired impact on the perceived threat, health literacy, and oral health behaviors and reduced the incidence of ECCs in children. Because many health problems have similar risk factors, promotion of oral health can improve the status of overall health and the quality of life for many individuals. The finding of this study provided a suggestion for evidence-based decision-making processes regarding ECCs prevention programs for future preventive and social dentistry interventions. Furthermore, it is suggested integrating children oral healthcare with well-baby care program.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CVI</term><def><p id="Par6">Content Validity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVR</term><def><p id="Par7">Content Validity Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECC</term><def><p id="Par8">Early Childhood Caries</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all women participated in this study.
