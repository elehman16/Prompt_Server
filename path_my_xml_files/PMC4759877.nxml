To the best of our knowledge, difference in pain after endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) and open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) has not been objectively documented in literature.

Thus, postoperative pain is frequently assessed in studies comparing the results of open and endoscopic release in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common peripheral nerve entrapment. While several parameters such as functional outcome, recovery time, scar sensitivity and complication rates are also addressed in these studies, none of them focused on a scheduled and periodical followup of pain intensity in the early postoperative period.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study was to compare the course of pain intensity in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) versus those undergoing endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>Eighty two patients, clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed with CTS, were included in this study. The study protocol was explained to patients who met the inclusion criteria. Fifty patients gave consent for participation. Informed consent was given by all participants. Approval of the Ethical Committee of the hospital was obtained. The type of surgery to be performed was decided using a &#x0201c;random number generator&#x0201d; software (Research Randomizer<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, version 3.0.

Patients were randomized into two groups; endoscopic surgery group [(21 female, 1 male; mean age 49 years (range 31&#x02013;64 years)] and open surgery group [(25 female, 3 male; mean age 45.1 years (range 29&#x02013;68 years)] and received carpal tunnel release [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics of study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-50-65-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Inclusion criteria were complaints of CTS for at least 3 months which did not respond to conservative treatment, electrophysiological findings of intermediate to advanced level of isolated median nerve involvement in the carpal tunnel, lack of motor deficit, absence of cervical disc pathology, absence of metabolic problem resulting in peripheral neuropathy, lack of previous upper extremity injury or surgery and lack of movement restriction in the wrist and hand.</p><p>Preoperative physical examination and Boston CTS scale of patients was performed by the same surgeon.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The preoperative electrophysiological assessment was repeated in accordance with the study protocol by the same neurologist.</p><p>The electrophysiological evaluation was conducted using a Nihon-Kohden MEB 5504 K device in the electromyography laboratory at the Department of Neurology in our hospital.

The superficial palmar fascia and the transverse carpal ligament was cut through the ulnar side while protecting the median nerve and its motor branch. The skin and subcutaneous tissue was released proximally and distally with a retractor, the opening of the tunnel was confirmed. The skin was closed with nonabsorbable sutures.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Endoscopic surgery</title><p>The surgery was performed under RIVA according to Chow's description. Two portals were needed to perform the surgery. A 1&#x02013;1.5 cm line from the proximal tip of the pisiform was drawn radially. A second line was drawn proximally from the end of this first line 0.5 cm. After that, a third line was drawn from the proximal end of the second line radially 1 cm which determined the entry portal. For exit portal; the thumb was brought to full abduction. A transverse line from the distal end of the abducted thumb and a longitudinal line between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> finger toward the proximally was drawn in the palm surface. This two line formed a right angle. A line bisecting this right angle was extended 1 cm from the vertex toward the ulna. It established the site of incision for the exit portal. The entry portal was opened and the fascia exposed with blunt dissection and cut. A gap was created between the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) and the ulnar bursa with the help of a curved dissector after the proximal border of the TCL was determined. Then, a slotted cannula was inserted through entry portal under TCL. Incision was made on exit portal and the cannula was extracted. TCL was visualized with an endoscope and divided with a retrograde knife (ECTRA 2; Smith and Nephew). The completion of the cut was checked with endoscope. The cannula was removed. Portals were closed with nonabsorbable sutures. A compression bandage was applied to control postoperative bleeding and released 30 min after surgery in all patients.</p><p>Patient's pain level was assessed on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> postoperative hours using visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Time of the first analgesic intake was recorded. Pain relief was achieved with orally administered paracetamol 500 mg tablets (Parol tb, Atabay &#x00130;la&#x000e7;). The total dose of postoperative medication in the first 24 h was noted.</p><p>Discharged patients were examined at weekly followups for carpal tunnel complaints and wound healing.

Categorical data were compared using the Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Repeated measures test was used to analyze the change of the VAS score according to followup time.
