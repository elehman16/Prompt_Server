Obesity is more prevalent among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups than the rest of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is common (27%) among patients presenting in Australian general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The &#x02018;5As&#x02019; model (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist and Arrange) provides a framework for preventive care in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Providing interventions across the 5As has been advocated in weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and has been shown to increase patient motivation to change their diet behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council&#x02019;s <italic>Clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults, adolescents and children in Australia</italic> (<italic>the Guidelines</italic>) make recommendations for obesity management in clinical practice across each of the 5As [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, there is evidence that general practitioners (GPs) do not adequately implement these recommendations: a pilot study assessing preventive care for primary care patients with low health literacy found only 15 and 7% of patients in the age group 40&#x02013;69 years with BMI and waist circumference recorded, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another study has found low rates of lifestyle advice and referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These gaps in performance have been attributed to a variety of patient, provider, practice and system factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Health literacy is the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. People with low health literacy are more likely to suffer higher chronic disease morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and less likely to receive preventive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Over 20% of the Australian population has very low health literacy and this is more prevalent among those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Nurses have potential to help adult patients improve health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and to deliver interventions for obesity management in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The feasibility of practice nurses (PNs) in obesity prevention and management has been demonstrated in Australian general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The objective of our trial is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of using PNs in the role of &#x02018;prevention navigators&#x02019; to support obese patients with low health literacy to better manage their weight.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary hypotheses</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>PNs acting as prevention navigators in intervention practices will demonstrate greater improvement in their self-reported behaviour and confidence in assessing obese patients with low health literacy and providing advice and referral to them for weight loss compared with PNs in the control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruited patients (obese patients with low health literacy) attending intervention practices will be, at six months, more likely to report having (i) received assessment, advice and referral for weight loss and (ii) attended/used community-based weight loss lifestyle modification programs to which they have been referred to compared with patients in control practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruited patients attending intervention practices will be, at 12&#x000a0;months, more likely to have improved their health literacy related to weight loss than patients in control practices.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary hypotheses</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Recruited patients attending intervention practices will be, at 12&#x000a0;months, more likely to have (i) increased intake of dietary portions of fruit and vegetables per day and minutes of moderate and/or vigorous intensity physical activity per week, (ii) reduced consumption of high fat food and hours of sedentary activity per day, and (iii) moderated alcohol consumption compared with patients attending control practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruited patients attending intervention practices will be, at 12&#x000a0;months, more likely to (i) have reduced their baseline weight by 5% or maintained it and (ii) report improvements in their health-related quality of life compared with patients attending control practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The total cost of health service use of patients in the intervention and control practices will not be different.</p></list-item><list-item><p>GPs in intervention practices will demonstrate greater improvement in their self-reported behaviour and confidence in assessing obese patients with low health literacy and providing advice and referral to them for weight loss compared with GPs in the control group.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Research design</title><p>A pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted with randomisation of practices to intervention and control groups.

Steps i-iv will be delivered at a health check visit about 2&#x000a0;weeks after the health literacy screening and enrollment of patients in the trial (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

In this regard two interactive face-to-face meetings will be held at individual practices. At the first meeting, reports which are based on a baseline clinical record audit will be discussed. The Chief Investigators will use the clinical audit data as a prompt to discuss strategies for improvements in primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor assessment and management specifically for obese patients based on <italic>the Guidelines</italic>. At another meeting, results from the health literacy screening will be discussed to raise the awareness of the health professionals of the prevalence of low health literacy amongst their patients and the need to pay special attention to these patients.</p><p>There will be a 3-hour interactive group training of GPs and PNs in providing weight management to obese patients with low health literacy. This session will include case scenario discussion and role plays. At this training, the intervention group will be provided with a copy of <italic>the Guidelines</italic>.</p><p>The other major component of the practice-level intervention is to develop the role of the PNs as prevention navigators. The principal role of a prevention navigator is to work with patients to set goals, provide information and support to choose appropriate referral options (including group programs and telephone coaching), overcome barriers to attendance at this referral and arrange follow up. This is a new potential role for PNs in Australian general practice although there have been some previous examples of the use of community navigators in screening and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We will train PNs in their role as prevention navigators and in the conduct of the health check visit. Training will focus on communication with patients with low health literacy and facilitating goal setting, referral navigation and arranging follow up visits.</p><p>Educational meetings will also be held for GPs in the control group. However, the educational messages delivered will not be in the same context of obesity management as for the intervention group. For example, at the clinical audit result discussion, emphasis will be on CVD risk factor recording and management.

This has the potential to address both the infrequency of referral for obese patients in Australian primary care and the barriers to preventive care experienced by patients with low health literacy through an intervention at both the clinical and practice levels. It also has significant implications for the role of PNs and other health professionals in preventive care in general practice and will inform current discussion of how this role needs to develop in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NF participated in review of the protocol, preparing the manuscript, incorporating editing suggestions from co-authors into the manuscript and giving the paper its final shape, coordinating the trial and will be involved in data acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the trial.
