Systemic drug treatment of these metastases is rarely effective, and where possible surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are the preferred treatment options. Treatment with adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) following neurosurgery and/or SRS is controversial. Proponents of WBRT report prolongation of intracranial control with reduced neurological events and better palliation. Opponents state melanoma is radioresistant; that WBRT yields no survival benefit and may impair neurocognitive function. These opinions are based largely on studies in other tumour types in which assessment of neurocognitive function has been incomplete.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This trial is an international, prospective multi-centre, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial comparing WBRT to observation following local treatment of intracranial melanoma metastases with surgery and/or SRS. Patients aged 18 years or older with 1-3 brain metastases excised and/or stereotactically irradiated and an ECOG status of 0-2 are eligible. Patients with leptomeningeal disease, or who have had previous WBRT or localised treatment for brain metastases are ineligible. WBRT prescription is at least 30 Gy in 10 fractions commenced within 8 weeks of surgery and/or SRS. Randomisation is stratified by the number of cerebral metastases, presence or absence of extracranial disease, treatment centre, sex, radiotherapy dose and patient age. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with distant intracranial failure as determined by MRI assessment at 12 months. Secondary end points include: survival, quality of life, performance status and neurocognitive function.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Accrual to previous trials for patients with brain metastases has been difficult, mainly due to referral bias for or against WBRT. This trial should provide the evidence that is currently lacking in treatment decision-making for patients with melanoma brain metastases. The trial is conducted by the Australia and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group (ANZMTG-study 01-07), and the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) but international participation is encouraged. Twelve sites are open to date with 43 patients randomised as of the 31st March 2011. The target accrual is 200 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12607000512426.aspx">ACTRN12607000512426</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases in patients with metastatic melanoma ranges from 10% to 40% in clinical studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is even higher in autopsy series, with as many as 72% of patients with metastatic melanoma having CNS involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Local control of brain metastases from melanoma is a significant problem. Sampson et al. reported an overall median survival time of 3.8 months in 702 patients with clinically significant melanoma brain metastases, treated with either palliative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These metastases contributed to the death of 94.5% of these patients.</p><p>As well as seeking to prolong survival, maintaining neurocognitive function in these patients is pivotal to their quality of life. The clinically apparent metastases can often be treated locally by neurosurgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), with the option of post-operative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The objective of WBRT in this setting is to treat clinically undetectable micrometastases elsewhere in the brain; these are considered likely to be present in many patients and, if not controlled, will later manifest as distant intracranial treatment failure. However the role of WBRT after local treatment is controversial. Proponents say that WBRT to prevent or delay intra-cranial disease recurrence provides worthwhile palliation. Opponents argue against WBRT as a survival benefit has never been demonstrated in this situation and there is a risk of neurotoxicity. These opinions are based on studies in other malignancies, predominantly non small-cell lung cancer and lymphoma, and retrospective analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There have been no randomised clinical trials (RCTs) for this specific scenario in patients with metastatic melanoma. A complicating factor is that there exists a strong anecdotal impression among some clinicians that melanoma is a uniformly radioresistant tumour, although there is no level 1 clinical evidence for this. As a result, current clinical practice varies widely, with some units actively encouraging WBRT while others rarely or never offer it.</p><p>In a randomised controlled trial of 95 patients with a variety of solid tumour types who received WBRT following surgical excision of brain metastases, those receiving WBRT (50.4 Gy over 5 weeks) had a 52% reduction in intracranial recurrence and a 30% reduction in death from neurological causes compared to those randomised to observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although the time to intracranial recurrence was substantially longer in the WBRT group (220 weeks versus 26 weeks, p = &#x0003c; 0.001), the median overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups (11 months versus 10 months, p = 0.39), probably because a high proportion of patients in both groups had extra-cranial disease.</p><p>A second randomised controlled trial comparing SRS plus WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) versus SRS alone in 132 patients with 1-4 brain metastases reported a 30% reduction in local intracranial recurrence and a 22% reduction in distant intracranial recurrence at 12 months in the WBRT group (p = 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There was no difference between the groups in overall survival (7.5 months versus 8 months) or neurological death. In a subset of patients neurological toxicity and neurological function were assessed radiologically and using the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). There were no significant differences in toxicity or function.</p><p>A more recent randomised trial undertaken by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) comparing adjuvant WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) to observation after surgery or radiosurgery of 1-3 brain metastases (predominantly from lung, breast and kidney cancer) assessed the time to functional decline (performance score &#x0003e; 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overall survival was similar in the WBRT and observation arms (median 10.9 versus 10.7 months), however WBRT reduced the 2-year relapse rate both at both initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, p = 0.001; SRS: 31% to 19%, p = 0.040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, p = 0.008; SRS 48% to 33%, p = 0.023).</p><p>There has been some recent controversy about whether WBRT affects neurocognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Assessment of neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are essential for the interpretation of WBRT in the context of the patient's experience. It is clear that tools such as the MMSE, whilst appealing in their simplicity, were developed to screen for dementia and show poor sensitivity in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with brain tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The ideal tool should be brief, simple, sensitive, inexpensive and, if administered repeatedly, should have alternative versions to reduce the effects of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A battery of tests which fit these criteria (including Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Controlled Oral Word Association of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Trail Making Test, Stroop Color-Word Test and the Digit Span test) have been shown to be feasible in previous clinical trials in patients with brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) has been validated in numerous malignancies including neurological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and measures five functional domains as well as global quality of life and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties. The EORTC BN-20 is a brain cancer-specific module that measures four multi-item domains (future uncertainty, visual disorder, communication deficit, and motor dysfunction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A change in scores of &#x02265; 10 on a scale of 0-100 persisting for 4 or more weeks has been shown to represent a clinically meaningful and subjectively significant change that is associated with change in disease status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These tools are considered appropriate, validated and sensitive in this population.</p><p>Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the primary means of assessment, the current trial will investigate whether WBRT following complete local treatment of intracranial melanoma metastases improves distant intracranial control and hence demonstrate whether radiotherapy in this scenario can control microscopic intracerebral melanoma. If so, then it may contribute to more clinically meaningful outcomes such as increased time to functional decline from further intracranial disease or neurological death, without causing excessive neurotoxicity. Trial recruitment will be supported through referrals from multi-disciplinary melanoma teams. The trial will be offered to all eligible patients in whom intracranial disease control has been obtained by complete surgical resection and/or SRS.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to assess the value of treating brain metastases in patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma using adjuvant post-operative WBRT in the hope of improving disease control, and quality of life, while maintaining satisfactory cognitive performance. The primary objective is to assess the effect of WBRT (after localised treatment for melanoma brain metastases) on distant intracranial control, as assessed by MRI scanning. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) Distant intracranial control is defined as control within the brain 1 cm or more from a previous metastasis. The primary hypothesis is that as a result of whole brain radiotherapy, there will be a 20% reduction in the rate (proportion) of distant intracranial metastases after at least 12 months of follow-up, compared to the control (observation only) arm.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Trial schema</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-11-142-1"/></fig><p>The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of WBRT on:</p><p>1.

Distant intracranial failure is defined as new lesions appearing 1 cm or more from a previous index metastasis. New onset leptomeningeal disease after the randomisation MRI will be recorded as new distant intracranial disease. Patients who fail locally only will not be considered as having an event and their time will be measured from randomisation to their last known follow-up date. Patients progressing or dying from extracranial disease or other causes will be considered as having a competing risk for distant intracranial failure.</p><p>The secondary endpoints include:</p><p>(i) Time to distant intracranial failure as determined by MRI. This is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to recurrence of disease at a distance of 1 cm or more from previously treated metastases. In the absence of distant intracranial failure (i.e. for patients censored before intracranial failure could be observed), time to failure will be measured from randomisation to date of last known contact (i.e. censoring time).</p><p>(ii) Time to local intracranial failure as determined by MRI. This is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to recurrence of disease within 1 cm of previously treated metastases.</p><p>(iii) Time to overall (distant + local) intracranial failure as determined by MRI.</p><p>(iv) Deterioration in neurocognitive function (NCF). This is measured by a battery of assessments including Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Stroop Color-Word Test (Adult Version), Digit Span (Forwards and Backwards). The proportion of patients completing neurocognitive function assessments at the baseline visit and at each 2-monthly follow up visit will be determined for each of the treatment groups (WBRT and Observation) together with a descriptive summary of Global Deficit Scores (GDS) scores. The main neurocognitive function endpoint will be defined as the proportion of patients who have deteriorated from the baseline visit at any time in the study period by at least 0.3 units on the GDS scale.</p><p>(v) Time to deterioration in health related quality of life. This is measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 with Brain module (EORTC BN-20) questionnaires. The completion rates for quality of life questionnaires at the baseline visit and at each 2-monthly follow-up visit will be determined for each treatment group together with descriptive summaries of scores. The primary QOL endpoint will be time to deterioration in role function from randomisation, with deterioration defined as a decrease of &#x02265; 10 points on a 0-100 scale persisting for at least 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints will be time to deterioration in global QOL, drowsiness, communication difficulties, motor dysfunction and social function items/domains.</p><p>(vi) Time to deterioration in performance status as measured by ECOG criteria. This is defined as the time that elapses between randomisation and the first recorded worsening (increase) in ECOG performance status.</p><p>(vii) Overall survival. This will include time to death due to any cause; time to death due to a neurological cause; cause of death (cancer related or not); and cause of death if cancer related, due to neurological progression or not. Overall survival will be assessed from date of randomisation to date of death from any cause. Patients remaining alive or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of last known contact.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>It has been assumed on the basis of previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] that the proportion of patients having distant intracranial metastases at 12 months post-randomisation will be 55% in the observation arm (surgery and/or SRS only) and 33% in the WBRT arm. With 200 patients and assuming 10% non-adherence, this study will have 80% power to detect an absolute risk reduction of 22% at the 5% significance level (two-tailed). To achieve a total sample of 200 patients, it is assumed that patients will be accrued over five years.

One formal efficacy analysis will be performed after 45 events have been observed (the expected number of events after 100 randomised patients have completed 12 months of follow-up). The events used for this formal interim analysis will be distant intracranial failure after 12 months of follow-up. The stopping rule for the study on the basis of efficacy will be a nominal significance level of p = 0.003 (3 standard deviations) to maintain an overall Type I error probability of 5%.</p><p>The DSMC will monitor the trial for safety outcomes including unacceptable acute radiotherapy toxicity (any Grade 4 toxicity); accrual less than 30% of the expected number of patients within the first 36 months; and the availability of a therapy that is clearly more effective.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><sec><title>Sequence generation and allocation concealment mechanism</title><p>Randomisation will be performed by a centralised trial coordinating centre using an interactive voice response system (IVRS).

The fields must cover the whole brain and include the cerebrum and cerebellum. The superior border of the field must be overshooting the skull by 2 cm to ensure adequate coverage. There must be adequate coverage of the intracranial contents by a margin of 1-2 cm. The caudal border needs to be angled to accomplish this and also avoid the eyes. The pituitary is usually included in the field by default. No effort should be made to cover it if it is not in field.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-11-142-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Radiological audit of MRI scans</title><p>At least 25% of the patients will be audited, including the first 5 patients from each centre and a randomly selected patient from each subsequent 5 patients. Auditing will include an evaluation of MRI technique. The audit will be performed by a central radiologist with specialisation in MRI neuroradiology, with reference to a second central radiologist, similarly qualified, at the central radiologist's discretion. This second central radiologist will be blinded to the local and central radiologists' reports.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Operational considerations</title><p>Patients who are randomised to the observation arm of the study and have a recurrence of brain metastases will be able to crossover to WBRT at the treating physician's discretion. All participants will be monitored to death or to the closure of the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Feasibility</title><p>The possibility of conducting this trial was first discussed at a multi-disciplinary melanoma meeting in Sydney in 2004. A previous trial of WBRT for solitary brain metastases from mixed tumour types was abandoned by another Australian/New Zealand study group due to failure to accrue sufficient participants (TROG 98.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Given this background and the concern from some investigators about future WBRT trials, a feasibility study was undertaken to assess not only the number of potentially eligible patients but also the willingness of surgical and medical oncologists to have their patients with melanoma randomised to WBRT or not. The trial protocol was presented and critiqued at numerous scientific meetings both nationally and internationally, to multi-disciplinary melanoma treatment centres, and to neuro-oncology groups. There was broad agreement that the trial was needed to answer several fundamental questions and international participation was deemed essential for recruitment success. At present there are three participating countries: Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. As of the 31st March 2011, 43 patients were randomised with 30 of these completing the neurocognitive function assessment.</p><sec><title>Registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) # ACTRN12607000512426</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>A full copy of the current protocol can be requested from the principal investigator: Dr Gerald Fogarty, email: <email>gerald.fogarty@cancer.com.au</email></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANZMTG: Australia and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group; CTCAE: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; EORTC: European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Data Center; Gy: Gray (unit of radiation); HREC: Human Research Ethics Committee; ICH GCP: International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; NCF: Neurocognitive function; NHMRC CTC: National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre; QoL: Qualify of Life; SAE: Serious Adverse Event; SRS: Stereotactic Radiosurgery; TMC: Trial Management Committee; TROG: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group; WBRT: Whole Brain Radiotherapy</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GF conceived of the study, participated in its design, coordination and recruitment and assisted in drafting the manuscript.
