In this setting tungiasis is associated with important morbidity. Hitherto, the only effective treatment is the surgical extraction of embedded sand fleas. In the endemic areas this is done using inappropriate sharp instruments and causes more harm than good. The prevention of the infestation is the only option to control morbidity. In this study we show that the twice daily application of a herbal repellent based on coconut-oil (Zanzarin), is highly effective in preventing sand flea disease in a heavily affected community in Madagascar. The attack rate became zero immediately after starting the application of the repellent. The degree of tungiasis associated morbidity approached zero within 10 weeks. In contrast, the availability of closed solid shoes had only a marginal protective effect; although shoes were requested by the villagers and wearing shoes was encouraged by the investigators at the beginning of the study. In a control group from the same village the attack rate, the intensity of infestation and of tungiasis-associated morbidity remained unchanged. Our study in rural Madagascar shows that effective und sustainable morbidity control is possible using a repellent derived from coconut oil.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was jointly funded by Engelhard Arzneimittel GmbH &#x00026; Co.

Local people consider sand fleas disease to be inevitable and remember that it always existed.</p><p>In the villages roads are not paved. The houses are made from wood and many are constructed on stilts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002426-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>). The houses possess a front court used for cooking, washing and drying clothes. Chicken, pigs, dogs and cats are kept as domestic animals and live inside the compound. Water for cooking is derived from public pumps, water for cleaning the body and washing clothes is taken from a river close to the villages. Rice, cassava and pineapples are the main crops. Children usually do not possess shoes. Adolescents and adults have shoes, but do not wear them regularly. Most sand flea lesions are manipulated. Extraction of embedded sand fleas is attempted as soon as the lesions become painful. This is done using non-sterile instruments, such as fixing pins or needles. Neither the instrument nor the skin is disinfected. Often, the extraction is performed by elder members of the household and not by the patient himself (M.

Inclusion criteria were: age &#x02265;5 years and at least one person in the household with &#x02265;7 lesions at both feet. The latter prerequisite was based on the rationale that, in this case, the average attack rate in household members should be high. Exclusion criteria were the presence of &#x02265;70 lesions (total number of viable or manipulated sand flea lesions), or the presence of severe acute morbidity necessitating immediate surgical or antibiotic treatment. Eligible individuals were only enrolled if they were permanent residents in the villages, intended to stay in the community for the next four months and provided an informed written consent. In total, 240 participants were recruited and 219 were randomized.</p><p>The major outcome measures were the intensity of infestation, i.e. the number of sand flea lesions present on both feet at the time of examination, the number of newly penetrated sand fleas since the last examination (considered as a proxy of the attack rate <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Heukelbach5" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>), and the severity of acute and chronic pathology as measured by the severity score for acute tungiasis (SSAT) and the severity score for chronic tungiasis (SSCT) <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Kehr1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Outcome measures were assessed every two weeks by the same investigator (M. T. and V. R.). No participant was missing on more than one consecutive follow-up examination.</p><p>To avoid that members of one and the same household would participate in different treatment arms, we randomized by household. Randomization into three groups was performed using a computer-generated random number table. Participants of group I received a pair of closed solid shoes. To the feet of the participants of group II the repellent was applied twice daily. Group III did not receive any intervention. 21 households belonged to the shoe group, 20 to the repellent group and 21 households to the control group. Households with study-participants were homogenously distributed across the village. The median number of household members was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2&#x02013;5) in the shoe, 4 (IQR 2&#x02013;5) in the repellent and 3 (IQR 2&#x02013;5) in the control group.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Shoe group</title><p>A pair of shoes was given to all members of this cohort by the research team.

In the morning (5:30&#x02013;7:30 a.m.) and in the evening (5:00&#x02013;7:00 p.m.), the repellent was applied by trained community health workers on the skin of both feet, up to the ankle including the interdigital areas, after washing the feet with water in a bowl. The average volume applied was 3 ml for 2 feet per person and day. The minimal volume was 2 ml (for children) and the maximal volume was 5 ml (for large adult feet). The procedure of applying the repellent was identical in children and adults. The application of the repellent was checked regularly by members of the team and had to be confirmed by the participant on a documentation sheet either by signing or by fingerprint. This ensured that the repellent was applied exactly as defined in the study protocol, not spilled or given away for money.

The median intensity of infestation was identical in the shoe and the control group (22 lesions), but slightly lower in the repellent group (16 lesions).</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0002426-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002426.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Demographic and clinical characteristic of the study population.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pntd-0002426-t001-1" xlink:href="pntd.0002426.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;70)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoe group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;77)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Repellent group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age in years, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.5 (5&#x02013;73)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7 (5&#x02013;93)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 (5&#x02013;80)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male-female ratio (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44/56</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39/61</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40/60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of household members, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (1&#x02013;6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (1&#x02013;7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (1&#x02013;6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of household members with tungiasis, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (1&#x02013;6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (1&#x02013;7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.5 (1&#x02013;6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensity of infestation in household members<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref>, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.5 (2.3&#x02013;33.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.8 (2.3&#x02013;40.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.2 (1.7&#x02013;27.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensity of infestation in participants<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">b</xref>, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (1&#x02013;99)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (1&#x02013;179)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (1&#x02013;91)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Manipulated lesions<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">c</xref>, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.2 (0&#x02013;100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.8 (0&#x02013;100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.4 (0&#x02013;100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSAT<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">d</xref>, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (0&#x02013;17)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (0&#x02013;19)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (0&#x02013;20)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSCT<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">e</xref>, median (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0&#x02013;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0&#x02013;8.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0&#x02013;11.5)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>a</label><p>total number of viable, dead and manipulated lesions; only individuals with tungiasis.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>b</label><p>total number of viable, dead and manipulated lesions.</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><label>c</label><p>the patient or a caretaker had attempted to take out the embedded sand flea; in percent of total lesions.</p></fn><fn id="nt104"><label>d</label><p>severity score for acute tungiasis (see material and methods).</p></fn><fn id="nt105"><label>e</label><p>severity score for chronic tungiasis (see material and methods).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Major outcome measures</title><p>

During the transmission season constant reinfestation is the rule and individuals frequently harbor dozens, sometimes hundreds of embedded parasites <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Previous studies showed that the intensity of infestation and the degree of tungiasis-associated morbidity are correlated <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Kehr1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Hence, even a partial reduction of the intensity of infestation would lower the risk for severe morbidity in an affected individual.</p><p>In the endemic areas people try to extract embedded sand fleas with kitchen utensils, sewing needles, safety pins, sharpened nails or even thorns, which usually causes more harm than good: either this induces a bacterial superinfection of the lesion or the parasite ruptures in situ, thereby, intensifying the existing inflammation <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Since the extraction of a burrowed sand flea with inappropriate instruments invariably causes a (micro) haemorrhage, traditional treatment may expose individuals with tungiasis at risk for transmission of viruses such as HCB and HCV in areas where the prevalence of these infections are high and non-sterile instruments are used in consecutive patients <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Since no drug treatment is at hand, the prevention of the infestation is the only means to control tungiasis-associated morbidity. Here we compare the efficacy of making closed shoes available by donation with the application of a repellent based on coconut oil to the feet. In previous studies in Northeast Brazil, we have demonstrated that the regular application of this repellent to the feet reversed tungiasis-associated clinical pathology to an insignificant level within four weeks <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Even if the repellent is only applied intermittently, e. g. daily every second week, its protective effect is remarkable <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Buckendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this study in rural Madagascar, the efficacy of the repellent to rapidly reduce the intensity of infestation and to resolve acute tungiasis-associated clinical pathology was also very high. This reflects the fact that the attack decreased to zero already after two weeks and remained so until the end of the study.</p><p>In tungiasis, acute clinical pathology is essentially inflammation-related, and can be measured by the SSAT <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier5" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Two explanations for the rapid resolution of inflammation and respectively the decrease of the SSAT in participants of the repellent group seem plausible. First, since intensity of inflammation correlates to the accumulation of penetrated sand fleas per unit of time <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier5" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, after a couple of weeks of the application of the repellent the number of remaining sand flea lesions had fallen below a threshold at which no significant acute clinical pathology develops. Second, jojoba oil and <italic>Aloe vera</italic>, in the concentrations present in the lotion, may have an anti-inflammatory effect and, thus, also may have contributed to the rapid decrease of inflammation-related pathology.</p><p>Within two weeks after the application of the repellent, the median attack rate was reduced to zero, and after 10 weeks even the interquartile range of this outcome measure was zero to zero. In previous studies in areas with different transmission dynamics, the twice daily application reduced the median attack rate by 92% <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Buckendahl1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The higher efficacy observed in this study might be explained by the moderate attack rate in the two Malagasy villages in contrast to an extremely high attack rate in the Brazilian populations.</p><p>Textbooks on tropical medicine suggest that wearing footgear protects against invading sand fleas <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Joyeux1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This assumption is supported by anecdotes from colonial times, indicating that in East and Central Africa local soldiers - which possessed no shoes at all - frequently developed a high intensity of infestation and severe morbidity, whereas European officers and sergeants equipped with solid footgear rarely were affected <xref rid="pntd.0002426-Heukelbach6" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, personal experience of two of the investigators confirms that wearing closed shoes - even with socks - does not completely protect against invading sand fleas (H. Feldmeier, unpublished observation 2004; M. Thielecke, unpublished observation 2011).</p><p>In this study, the availability of shoes had only a marginal protective effect which manifested with a delay of several weeks. At week 10, the attack rate, the intensity of infestation and the SSAT still were significantly different between the shoe group and the repellent group. Surprisingly, the compliance in the shoe group was rather low, and only 39% of group members wore the donated shoes regularly. This may have several reasons: First, in the villages wearing footwear is not a custom and people may find wearing solid closed shoes uncomfortable in comparison with flip-flops or walking barefoot. In fact, some people complained about perspiration and unpleasant odor when wearing the shoes (V. Raharimanga and M. Thielecke, unpublished observation 2011). Second, as a part of their daily routine, participants regularly came into contact with water or wet soil (e. g. when tilling their rice fields). Such work makes wearing shoes rather impracticable. Third, solid shoes are considered to be very valuable commodities in the villages, and are preferred to be used for special activities, such as going to church. Fourth, people care for their clothes very properly. Accordingly, when the donated shoes got dirty (which was almost inevitable when leaving the house), they washed and dried them. This means that shoes - even when a person was willing to wear protective footwear - were simply not available all the time. Fifth, some individuals did not wear the donated shoes in order not to be recognized as participants to avoid jealousy of other inhabitants of the village (V. Raharimanga and M. Thielecke, unpublished observation 2011). Sixth, individuals with many sand flea lesions felt pain when walking in solid shoes. This might explain why participants, never or only rarely wearing the donated shoes, were those with the highest intensity of infestation. Finally, when shoes are worn daily in rural Madagascar - where rough roads prevail and where paths are either dusty or muddy &#x02013; they get cracks and are worn out after a couple of months. Frequently, they are so holey, that they should have lost any protective effect (M. Thielecke, unpublished observation 2011).</p><p>The weakness of the study is obvious. Although the wearing of shoes was encouraged at the beginning of the study, compliance was not enforced. This means, the decision whether or not to wear solid footwear was reserved for each participant itself. In contrast, the application of the repellent was performed by community health workers and strictly executed as foreseen by the protocol. Hence, no personal initiative was required from the participants of the repellent group. We deliberately decided to apply the repellent in an active way, to get in an idea to which extent tungiasis-associated morbidity can be controlled if the repellent is applied in an optimal way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002426.s001"><label>Supporting Information S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol in French.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002426.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002426.s002"><label>Supporting Information S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002426.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the people of Tanambe II and Tanambaovao who participated in the study with a lot of good will.
