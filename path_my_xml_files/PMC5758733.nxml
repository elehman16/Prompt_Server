In this disease, abnormal accumulation of fat is created in the liver tissue, associated with metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and impaired fat metabolism (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The prevalence of this disease is approximately 25-45% in the general population (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Besides, the peak prevalence of NAFLD has been reported 50-65 years of age, and the spread of the disease is significantly higher in males than in females in the same age group (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). </p><p>Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions have a positive impact on NAFLD and are recommended as the first line of therapy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several studies have also shown that gradual weight loss along with regular physical activity can help to treat this disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, patients should be encouraged to have a proper diet along with increased physical activity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Generally, timely interventions and regular follow-up are essential in order to promote healthy behaviors. Patients with regular follow-up are more likely to change their unhealthy behaviors (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Some studies have shown that routine monitoring helps patients and families to actively participate in the healing process and be successful in controlling the disease (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On the other hand, modern technologies has provided the opportunity to shift treatments from hospitals and clinics to patients&#x02019; homes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). American Nursing Association has considered telenursing as a subset of telemedicine that focuses on providing specific nursing services (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Telenursing increases patients&#x02019; access to influential and effective nursing. Telephone, as an available means of communication, is increasingly used in telenursing. This method of care delivery not only reduces the costs and facilitates access to care services, but it also improves the relationship between patients and caregivers. Today, use of telenursing enables nurses to perform actions such as monitoring, training, collecting data, performing nursing interventions, controlling pain, and providing family support (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In general, patients&#x02019; self-care is affected by several factors, including self-efficacy, mood, obstacles, and the ability to perform self-care activities, with self-efficacy playing an important role in promoting self-care behaviors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), self-efficacy is considered to be an important prerequisite to behavior change. Studies have shown that individuals with high self-efficacy showed greater willingness to participate in challenging behaviors, and offered better interpretation about health and well-being (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Since nutritional behavior self-efficacy and physical activity are important factors in achieving the expected results by patients with NAFLD, designing self-care programs based on patients&#x02019; self-efficacy can have an impact on improving their conditions and preventing complications, and hospitalization (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In the studies conducted by Mohammadi et al. (2017) and Young et al. (2014 ) on patients with diabetes, telenursing follow-up was effective in improving self-efficacy in females with diabetes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Behzad et al. also investigated the effect of empowerment program regarding telenursing on self-care behaviors among hypertensive old adults. The results revealed that this program based on telenursing care was effective in promoting self-efficacy in self-care behavior of elderly patients with hypertension (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, due to continuing deterioration of NAFLD, by following treatment processes, patients can be treated at early stages and unpleasant complications can be prevented.</p><p>Up to now, few researches have evaluated the effect of exercise and diet in patients with NAFLD, and no study has been conducted on the impact of telenursing on nutritional behavior and physical activity self-efficacy in such patients. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the effect of telenursing on self-efficacy in patients with NAFLD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from May 2013 to December 2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Diagram 1</xref>).

In doing so, numbers 0-4 were assigned to the control group and numbers 5-9 to the intervention group. At first, the researcher explained about the nature of the disease, factors contributing to the disease, progression and prognosis, complications of the disease, and importance of treatment and follow-up. Then, the researcher asked the participants to complete the demographic information form. </p><p>To determine nutritional behavior self-efficacy, Sherer and Maddux&#x02019;s (1982) nutritional behavior self-efficacy questionnaire was used. The items of the questionnaire were scored based on a 5-point Likert scale. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum scores of nutritional behavior self-efficacy were 10 and 50, respectively. Then, the scores were divided into two groups of desirable self-efficacy (scores above 25) and undesirable self-efficacy (scores below 25). The reliability and validity of this questionnaire were determined by Hosseinzadeh et al. (2010) in patients with coronary artery disease using internal consistency and content validity methods, respectively. Based on the results, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient was 0.90 for the questionnaire (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). </p><p>Pender&#x02019;s 8-item questionnaire was used to determine the patients&#x02019; physical activity self-efficacy. The items of this questionnaire were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum scores of self-efficacy were 8 and 40, respectively, with higher scores representing greater self-efficacy. The reliability and validity of this questionnaire were determined by Aghamolaei et al. (2008) using content validity and internal consistency methods, respectively. Based on the results, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient was 0.87 for the questionnaire (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In this study, a nutritionist was hired to offer consultation to all participants. The participants received dietary advice in written. Then, they were asked to do moderate physical activities at least 30 minutes a day 4-5 times a week to raise their heart rate and respiration. Jogging, cycling, aerobic exercises, and any other activities with similar intensity were prescribed, as well. In addition to one-on-one consultation, all the participants received a training booklet. </p><p>In the intervention group, intervention by telephone lasted for 12 weeks in order for the participants to follow up the recommended diet and physical activity. The participants were given self-report forms designed by the researcher to register their daily diets and physical activities. This helped them easily report the items during the telephone follow-ups. The forms included evaluation of the participants&#x02019; adherence to diet and physical activities. In case a patient had not followed the diet and training program, the researcher attempted to recognize and analyze the reasons to provide a possible solution. It should be noted that the conversations were recorded by the researcher in each session. The researcher contacted all the patients between 8 AM to 8 PM twice a week during the first month and once a week during the second and third months. Averagely, each conversation lasted for 15-20 minutes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>The control group participants did not receive any interventions and were only followed up as usual by a specialist. It is worth mentioning that the control group participants received the educational booklet after the intervention. </p><p>At the end of the 12 weeks, the participants were asked to complete the related questionnaires again. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (version 16) and were analyzed using chi-square test, paired t-test, and independent t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study was performed on 60 patients (30 in each group).

In fact, various methods are used in the healthcare system to follow up patients&#x02019; status. Traditional follow-up methods included patients&#x02019; referral to care centers, home visits by healthcare providers, etc. In spite of their efficiency, these methods require human resources, time, and high expenses. Therefore, use of telephone follow&#x02013;up to track patients with chronic diseases has increased in the recent years (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Using telenursing, patients require continuous monitoring of their abilities to cope with their illnesses and learn how to change their lifestyle. In addition to education, telephone follow-up is established by creating an ongoing dynamic care relationship, which is followed by improving patients&#x02019; quality of life, reducing complications, increasing patient satisfaction, and promoting health and quality of services (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, it can be claimed that telephone follow-up is one of the most cost-effective and efficient follow-up methods in chronic diseases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). </p><p>Generally, telenursing refers to the implementation of nursing services to patients by telecommunication. By using telephone, nurses can understand patients&#x02019; needs and help them meet their demands. This method can reduce patients&#x02019; stress, anxiety, and depression, increase their self-esteem, and transfer patient care from clinics and hospitals to patients&#x02019; homes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Several studies have proved the effectiveness of nursing follow-up by phone in achieving the stated objectives. In this context, Zakerimoghadam et al. conducted a study on the impact of telenursing on adherence to diet in patients with type 2 diabetes. Their result showed that telenursing led to improvement of adherence to diet in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). </p><p>In another study, Borhani et al. investigated the effect of telenursing on glycemic control and BMI of patients with type 2 diabetes. They concluded that telenursing was able to improve the patients&#x02019; metabolic indices (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). </p><p>Surveying and following up patients&#x02019; behaviors by telephone at home helps to institutionalize healthy behaviors in the field of disease control by tracking and modification of training materials (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Evidence suggests that a managing program performed by a nurse along with phone follow-up could be used as a successful and practical treatment method to create changes in patients&#x02019; behaviors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Parchami Iraqi et al. conducted a study on the effect of telephone counselling on quality of life of patients with colostomy. Based on the results, telephone counselling was effective in the patients&#x02019; physical, mental, and social aspects (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Similar studies have also come to similar results about the positive impact of telenursing on adherence to diet (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>According to the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, the mean score of nutritional behavior self-efficacy and physical activity increased in the study groups after the intervention. However, the results of paired t-test showed that this increase was statistically significant only in the intervention group. In addition, the results of independent t-test presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> showed a significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean scores of nutritional behavior and physical activity self-efficacy. These results reflected the positive impact of telenursing on improving nutritional behavior and physical activity self-efficacy in the intervention group after the intervention. These results were in line with the study by Boroumand et al., which confirmed that telenursing was an appropriate method for promotion of cardiac self-efficacy in patients with coronary artery diseases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of the two groups&#x02019; mean differences of nutritional behavior and physical activity self-efficacy scores before and after the intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Self-efficacy<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Nutritional behavior</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Physical activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1; SD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1; SD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1; SD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000b1; SD</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.70&#x000b1;5.99</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.59&#x000b1;4.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.87&#x000b1;4.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.96&#x000b1;2.68</td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">P-value<bold>=</bold>&#x0003c;0.001</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">P-value<bold>=</bold>&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN2"><label>*</label><p> p&#x0003c;0.001</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>The desirability status of nutritional behavior self-efficacy scores in the study groups before and after the intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="2">Nutritional behavior self-efficacy</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before the intervention<hr/></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After the intervention<hr/></th><th align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">P-value</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency (percent)</th><th style=" color:#000000;" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency (percent)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Intervention group</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Desirable condition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24(80)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30(100)</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.031</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-desirable condition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6(20)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0(0)</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Control group</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Desirable condition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29(100)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28(96.55)</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">1.000</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-desirable condition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0(0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1(3.45)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN3"><label>*</label><p> (p&#x0003e;0.05)</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Self-efficacy is an important part of fundamental human behavior. Humans have little incentives to behave unless they believe that desirable results obtained by their actions will be achieved. Thus, it is imperative to point out that self-efficacy should be strengthened to increase the probability of healthy behaviors (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). On the other hand, understanding factors such as self-efficacy can prevent unhealthy habits and behaviors in the presence of other factors (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). According to Navidian et al. Bandura believed that individuals&#x02019; evaluation of their ability in a particular situation severely affected their decision on the type of activities, and insist on their continuation. Considering the fact that self-efficacy implies individuals&#x02019; beliefs and confidence about their own abilities in showcasing a specific behavior even in a tempting situation, it can be claimed that self-efficacy is effective in weight control by avoiding eating during positive and negative emotional situations, easy access to food, social pressures from others, and physical discomfort (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Bas et al. investigated the relationship between self-efficacy and weight loss in overweight men and women, and came up with the conclusion that high nutritional behavior self-efficacy scores were correlated to weight loss and weight control (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Similarly, Liou et al. evaluated the impact of self-efficacy on compliance with low-fat diet and showed that self-efficacy was significantly linked to a healthy diet (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Moreover, multiple studies have indicated that structures such as self-efficacy, benefits, perceived barriers, and interpersonal support, were effective in changing physical activity behaviors (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In this context, Rejeski et al. conducted a research on the relationship between weight loss and nutritional behavior self-efficacy, and reported that increasing physical activity could increase individuals&#x02019; self-efficacy in controlling nutritional behaviors. In addition to consuming energy, it could also help weight loss through strengthening the level of self-efficacy as a mediating variable (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Moreover, Didarlu et al. assessed physical activity in women with diabetes based on the theory of developed reasoned action. The results demonstrated that among the factors influencing physical activity such as awareness of the disease, personal beliefs, abstract norms, perceived self-efficacy, and behavioral intention, perceived self-efficacy was the strongest and most effective variable in the desire to do physical activities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, Roozbahani et al. carried out a research on the association between self-efficacy and stages of change and women&#x02019;s physical activity behavior after giving birth. They found that self-efficacy played an important role in physical activity behavior. They also argued that verbal encouragement from consultants and healthcare providers by providing appropriate feedback in the field of physical activity was effective in improving self-efficacy (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). </p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>, before the intervention, 24 patients in the intervention group had desirable conditions and 6 had undesirable conditions in terms of nutritional behavior self-efficacy. However, in the control group all the participants had desirable conditions in terms of nutritional behavior self-efficacy. After the intervention, the patients who had undesirable conditions in terms of nutritional behavior self-efficacy in the intervention group had developed desirable conditions. However, one patient in the control group shifted his nutritional behavior condition from desirable to undesirable. Based on the results of McNemar test, change from undesirable to desirable condition was statistically significant in the intervention group, but not in the control group. </p><p>It seems that in order to increase patients&#x02019; trust in following a healthy diet and improve nutritional changes in the long run, it is essential to understand the specific aspects of the disease, and its treatment methods. Hence, patients who believe that following a healthy diet will improve their conditions will have higher confidence in managing changes occurred in their diet. Hosseinzadeh et al. aimed to predict nutritional behavior self-efficacy in patients with coronary artery disease. Their results showed that increasing patients&#x02019; understanding of the disease led to a 1.05-fold increase in the chance of nutritional behavior self-efficacy. Therefore, they concluded that provision of appropriate training and continuous follow-up in the field of the disease and its treatment was effective in increasing disease awareness and promoting self-efficacy (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Overall, telenursing can be effective in improving patients&#x02019; self-efficacy by providing support, verbal encouragement, and giving proper feedback to patients in the field of physical activity and compliance to the diet. As mentioned previously, in order to increase the probability of healthy behaviors, self-efficacy must be strengthened. In order to do this in the long run, the training needs to be repeated by medical staff, especially nurses. </p><p>The study findings indicates that telenursing could improve the patients&#x02019; self-efficacy in adherence to diet, physical activity, and healthy behaviors associated with the disease by increasing their awareness. Essentially, regular follow-up and provision of consultation services by telephone after clinical consultation can maintain and complete the effect of the received training, stabilize healthy behaviors, and improve treatment outcomes. Further studies are recommended to investigate the effect of complementary medicine on improvement of patients with NAFLD. Conducting qualitative researches on these patients would be beneficial, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The present article was extracted from the M.Sc. thesis written by Sorur Javanmardi Fard and financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (grant No. 6602).
