A self-controlled pilot clinical trial (NCT01385332) was performed in an acute-care teaching hospital and in two private reproductive centers in Barcelona, Spain. Eleven egg donors participated in the study. Two random-start gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocols were assessed in which ganirelix was initiated on either day 10 (protocol B) or on day 20 (protocol C) of the menstrual cycle and was continued until estradiol levels were below 60 pg/dL. These protocols were compared with a standard protocol (protocol A). The main outcome of interest was the number of metaphase 2 oocytes retrieved. Results from this study show that the number of mature oocytes retrieved was comparable across the different protocols (14.3&#x000b1;4.6 in the standard protocol versus 13.0&#x000b1;9.1 and 13.2&#x000b1;5.2 in protocols B and C, respectively; values expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation). The mean number of days needed for a GnRH antagonist to lower estradiol levels, as well as the ongoing pregnancy rates, were also similar when protocols B (stimulation in follicular phase) and C (stimulation on luteal phase) were compared with protocol A (standard stimulation). GnRH antagonists can be effectively used for random-start controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with an ovarian response similar to that of standard protocols, and the antagonists appear suitable for emergency fertility preservation in cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>controlled ovarian hyperstimulation</kwd><kwd>GnRH antagonists</kwd><kwd>emergency fertility preservation</kwd><kwd>cancer patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproductive-age women who are diagnosed with a malignant disease face the potential risk of losing their fertility because of chemotherapy or radiation therapy and, therefore, they risk losing the opportunity to have children.<xref rid="b1-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2009, the American Cancer Society predicted more than 190,000 new cases of breast cancer in women.<xref rid="b2-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> They estimated that roughly 18,600 of these women would be younger than 45 years of age.<xref rid="b2-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In a study of 82,699 incident cases of breast cancer diagnosed in Spain during the period from 1980&#x02013;2004, breast cancer increased annually by 1.7% during that period for women younger than 45 years of age.<xref rid="b3-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Also, in a survey of 657 young women with a history of early-stage breast cancer, 57% recalled having substantial concerns at the time of diagnosis about becoming infertile with treatment.<xref rid="b4-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The best approach and treatment options for cancer patients who are concerned about preserving and managing their fertility are still matters of debate, albeit fertility preservation approaches should be considered as early as possible during treatment planning.<xref rid="b5-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For women whose cancer treatment cannot be delayed, there is a narrow window of opportunity for egg harvesting.<xref rid="b6-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Vitrification of oocytes is an efficient method for oocyte cryopreservation, although previous controlled ovarian stimulation is necessary.<xref rid="b7-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The conventional approach requires approximately 2 weeks of ovulation induction from the beginning of the menstrual cycle; this process could entail a delay by up to 6 weeks for starting cancer treatment, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the patient is referred.<xref rid="b6-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists has emerged as a convenient strategy to reduce the duration of the treatment cycle.<xref rid="b8-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, there is limited evidence regarding the feasibility of GnRH antagonist protocols to initiate controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) at a random date in the menstrual cycle.

Although this study was performed on egg donors, these new protocols are intended to be implemented on fertility preservation patients. All participants gave written informed consent for ovarian stimulation and egg donation. In addition, all recipients who received embryos obtained from these protocols also gave written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Spain.

Other inclusion criteria comprehended a body mass index (BMI) between 12 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and baseline follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels below 10 mIU/mL. Patients included were negative for hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis infection. In addition, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and gonadotropin allergies were excluded from this study.

A GnRH antagonist (ganirelix; Orgalutran<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merck and Co, Inc.) at a dose of 0.25 mg/dL per day was administered from day 6 of rFSH onwards to prevent LH surge.

Ganirelix treatment was given until serum estradiol levels were below 60 pg/dL. Then, the standard protocol was started with 225 IU/day of rFSH (Puregon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merck and Co, Inc.). As in protocol A, the dose of rFSH was adjusted depending on the individual ovarian response after the 5th day of treatment. A fixed dose of ganirelix, 0.25 mg/dL per day, was administered from day 6 of rFSH treatment onwards to prevent premature LH surges. When at least three follicles had reached at least 17 mm in diameter, 0.2 mL/IU of the GnRH agonist Procrin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Abbott Laboratories) was administered to induce ovulation.

In this regard, various case reports and series of short cases on random-start COH have been published with encouraging results.<xref rid="b6-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the study by S&#x000f6;nmezer et al,<xref rid="b6-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> random-start COH on three patients diagnosed with breast cancer commenced immediately on menstrual cycle days 11, 14, or 17 with the use of letrozole to suppress estradiol levels; between nine and 17 oocytes were harvested from each patient. Meanwhile, Ozkaya et al<xref rid="b13-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> initiated random-start COH on a patient, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, on day 11 of her menstrual cycle with the use of the GnRH antagonist ganirelix from day 1 of COH; from this patient, 17 mature oocytes were obtained. Similarly, in the study by Nayak and Wakim,<xref rid="b14-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a random-start GnRH antagonist cycle with cetrorelix from day 1 of COH was used on four patients, two of whom were on the 10th day of their menstrual cycles, one of whom was on the 17th day of her menstrual cycle, and one whose day of her menstrual cycle was unknown; between six and 30 mature oocytes were harvested from each of these patients. In addition, Kuang et al<xref rid="b15-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> described how luteal phase ovarian stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropin and letrozole after spontaneous ovulation was also a feasible option for producing high-quality oocytes and embryos (11.2&#x000b1;7.2 oocytes were harvested from the human menopausal gonadotropin group, and 4.8&#x000b1;4.1 oocytes from the letrozole group); optimal pregnancy outcomes after embryo transfer were achieved.<xref rid="b15-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, because of the nature of these study designs, no control group was used to compare the results; hence, the applicability of these results must be interpreted in this context.</p><p>Findings from our trial indicate that the duration of an ovarian stimulation cycle for egg retrieval can be shorter compared to that of the standard protocols of COH. According to the standard protocols, if a reproductive-age cancer patient is referred for emergency fertility preservation on day 10 of her menstrual cycle and has regular menses, clinicians should wait until day 2 of the following menstrual cycle to initiate COH (an approximately 20-day period). However, when the proposed GnRH antagonist ganirelix protocol was followed, ovarian stimulation was initiated 2.8&#x000b1;0.8 days after the mid-follicular phase started and was finished in 9.8&#x000b1;0.8 days. Similar results were obtained when the GnRH antagonist was used during the early luteal phase; these results allowed clinicians to initiate COH 3.6&#x000b1;1.6 days after the phase started and proceed to oocyte retrieval after 10.6&#x000b1;2.1 days. Surprisingly, the implementation of this protocol entailed shorter time intervals than those observed in fertility preservation programs through oocyte cryopreservation via vitrification.<xref rid="b16-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Interestingly, results from this trial did not show differences in terms of the mean numbers of immature oocytes retrieved among participants who underwent either the midfollicular phase or the early luteal phase protocols when compared to the mean number of oocytes obtained during the standard COH protocol (6.2&#x000b1;8.5 versus 8.6&#x000b1;10.6 in the midfollicular arm, and 5.2&#x000b1;5.5 versus 4.6&#x000b1;4.6 in the early luteal arm, respectively). The study showed no differences in either oocyte quality and maturation or pregnancy rates; this finding suggests that the fertility potential of the oocytes was not altered. Ongoing pregnancy rates were similar for the early luteal phase protocol and for the standard protocol (40% versus 40%, respectively). However, in the midfollicular arm, higher rates were observed with the midfollicular protocol compared to those with the standard protocol (83.3% versus 50%). However, these could be random differences due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, in a study by Budak et al<xref rid="b18-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> regarding the experience in oocyte donation cycles, the results showed an improvement in ongoing pregnancy rates, which increased from 31% to 44.3% over a period of 10 years.<xref rid="b18-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The latter results are consistent with the data obtained in our study.</p><p>The higher ovarian response obtained with the midfollicular phase protocol than with the early luteal phase protocol could be explained by differences in the baseline AFC between the two groups. Interestingly, differences in terms of AFC in the baseline characteristics comparison were not statistically significant; however, it would be reasonable to consider that the small sample size could interfere with the accuracy of these results. AFC is a well known marker of ovarian response for controlled ovarian stimulation in conventional IVF and ICSI.<xref rid="b19-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Finally, an additional advantage of applying a GnRH antagonist cycle with a GnRH agonist trigger is to prevent OHSS, whose incidence is reduced significantly by this type of treatment; thereby, this approach constitutes a safe strategy for egg donors.<xref rid="b10-ijwh-7-219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> None of our patients had OHSS, despite the large number of oocytes retrieved.</p><p>The main limitations of this study include the exploratory and pilot nature of the trial and the small sample size. However, this is the first trial to assess the efficacy and safety of two different random-start GnRH antagonist protocols in two different phases of the menstrual cycle. Results from this trial show that GnRH antagonists are an effective and safe strategy to initiate COH at a random date to achieve an ovarian response similar to that obtained with the standard COH protocol. This new approach of emergency fertility preservation overcomes the inconveniences of waiting for the menstrual period to initiate and responds to the urgent treatment needs of cancer patients. However, larger randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Marta Pulido, MD, for editing the manuscript
