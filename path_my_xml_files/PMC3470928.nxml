We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points: pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures; but these differences were not significant. Children who were younger, attended more intervention sessions, and had better initial receptive language skills made greater progress during the course of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A TA-delivered intervention produced improvements in the reading and language skills of children with Down syndrome.

Despite this, most individuals with DS can learn to read, though attainment levels vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Byrne, MacDonald, &#x00026; Buckley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Laws &#x00026; Gunn, 2002</xref>). There remains, however, limited evidence about how best to intervene to improve these children&#x02019;s reading and language skills. Although a great deal of evidence supports the use of phonics for the teaching of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">DCSF, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">National Reading Panel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rose, 2006</xref>), there is debate about the appropriateness of this approach for children with DS. Typically, children with DS show good visual skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fidler, Most, &#x00026; Guiberson, 2005</xref>), deficits in phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cossu, Rossini, &#x00026; Marshall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lemons &#x00026; Fuchs, 2010a</xref>) and a profile of stronger word recognition than decoding skills. This profile has led some to advocate the use of &#x02018;whole-word&#x02019; strategies for teaching these children to read. Within the &#x02018;Triangle Model&#x02019; of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Seidenberg &#x00026; McClelland, 1989</xref>), such an approach might be seen as fostering the use of the &#x02018;semantic&#x02019; pathway linking orthography with word meanings. Although this can undoubtedly increase the number of words children recognise, it does little to foster the development of a &#x02018;phonological&#x02019; pathway mapping orthography to phonology, which is fundamental to independent reading.</p><p>A small number of studies have demonstrated that children with DS benefit from reading instruction which targets phonological awareness and reading skills (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cologon, Cupples, &#x00026; Wyver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Goetz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lemons &#x00026; Fuchs, 2010b</xref>). However, the available evidence is limited by small samples (<italic>N</italic> = 7&#x02013;24), short training periods (10 hr to 16 weeks of daily 40-min intervention), a lack of appropriate comparison groups, and inclusion criteria which do not include the full range of abilities seen in individuals with DS. Furthermore, little is known about individual differences in response to intervention.</p><p>Among typically developing children, one of the main factors which affects response to intervention is oral language skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Vadasy, Sanders, &#x00026; Abbott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Whiteley, Smith, &#x00026; Connors, 2007</xref>). Other child-variables which affect response include (in order of effect size): rapid naming, behaviour, phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge, memory, IQ and demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nelson, Benner, &#x00026; Gonzalez, 2003</xref>) and extrinsic factors such as the length and quality of instruction are also important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Al Otaiba &#x00026; Fuchs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">National Reading Panel, 2000</xref>).</p><p>With these findings as a backdrop, we set out to evaluate a programme of intervention for children with DS which combined phonics-based reading instruction with vocabulary teaching. The rationale for the intervention was that language impairments are common in children with DS (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abbeduto, Warren, &#x00026; Conners, 2007</xref>) and if attenton is not paid to these they may compromise the development of phoneme awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Carroll, Snowling, Stevenson, &#x00026; Hulme, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Metsala &#x00026; Walley, 1998</xref>). Moreover, a previous study had shown that such an approach was effective for supporting the reading development of typically developing children who show poor response to intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Duff et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we report a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention for children with DS that targets both reading and language skills. The size and scope of our study enables us to investigate whether the intervention accelerates progress in reading and language when compared with &#x02018;teaching as usual&#x02019; and the factors that predict response to intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Trained TAs delivered a reading and language intervention to children on an individual basis in daily 40-min sessions in the children&#x02019;s schools. The performance of children who received the intervention for 40 weeks (intervention group) was compared to a waiting control group who continued with their regular education during the first 20 weeks (which included one-to-one support from a TA) before receiving the intervention in just the second 20-week period. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee, Department of Psychology, University of York; informed parental consent was obtained for all children. The trial was conducted within schools and hence was not registered. Details of participant recruitment, allocation and flow through the study are summarised in the CONSORT diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing participant recruitment and progress through the trial [in line with CONSORT recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b101">Schulz, Altman, &#x00026; Moher, 2010</xref>)]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0053-1044-f1"/></fig><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The project was advertised in Spring 2009 to parents and educators of children with DS attending primary schools in two UK locations: North (Yorkshire) and South (Hampshire). Fifty-eight children in 50 schools were identified; all children were in integrated classrooms with support from a TA for a large part of the school day. Fifty-seven children (one child was unavailable for testing) were visited in school for an initial assessment. The only eligibility criterion was that children should be in primary school Years 1&#x02013;5 at the start of the study so that they would remain in primary education for the duration of the project. The 57 children (28 boys) recruited were randomly allocated to either the intervention or waiting control group.</p><p>Children were aged between 5:02 and 10:00 at the start of the project. Children came from a range of SES backgrounds but were predominantly from white, English-speaking families; two children spoke an additional language (Cantonese, Russian). Parent-completed questionnaires (84% returned) indicated high rates of involvement in early services [portage (<italic>N</italic> = 40), occupational therapy (<italic>N</italic> = 21) and speech and language services (<italic>N</italic> = 42)] though the timing, frequency and duration of service involvement varied widely. Visual impairments were reported for 37 children; 23 children were reported as having a hearing impairment ranging from mild to severe loss in one or both ears. Most parents (96%) reported that they had read to their child regularly from an early age and had tried to teach their child to read.</p><p>Teacher ratings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Goodman, 1997</xref>) (82% returned) indicated significant behavioural problems (i.e. Total difficulties score 16&#x02013;40) for five children in the intervention group and seven children in the waiting control group.

Four sessions each week were dedicated to new teaching; the fifth session provided an opportunity to revise and consolidate learning. The intervention followed a prescribed programme in daily 40 min sessions with opportunities to tailor sessions according to the needs and abilities of the child (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for an overview of the structure of sessions and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S1</xref> for a detailed description). TAs received a comprehensive teaching manual, a set of finely graded reading books, a pack of phonics resources, and a copy of Letters and Sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">DfES, 2007</xref>) when they attended training.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Content and structure of the reading and language strand intervention sessions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Reading</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Language</th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Activity</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time (min)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Activity</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time (min)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Read &#x02018;easy&#x02019; book (&#x0003e;94% reading accuracy)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02013;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">New word introduced with written, spoken and pictorial examples.

The Language Strand aimed to teach new vocabulary and promote appropriate and accurate use of new words in expressive language (oral and written). Teaching was based on the multiple context approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beck, McKeown, &#x00026; Kucan, 2002</xref>) making use of visual supports throughout the activities and using simple games to reinforce learning (e.g. matching, sorting). Target words, taught in themes, were selected from a set of parent-completed vocabulary checklists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Down Syndrome Education International, 2000</xref>) identifying words which many children were not yet using or did not yet understand and which would be useful additions to children&#x02019;s vocabulary. (Further details of the intervention programme are given in the online supplementary material).</p><p>Two TAs from each school were invited to attend 2 days of training on the educational needs of children with DS. Specific intervention training was given 2 days shortly before the intervention began with a further day after 10 weeks of delivery. New TAs who joined the project part way through the intervention phases were trained in school. TAs were supported by regular telephone/email contact and observed at least once a term to assess fidelity of implementation and provide individualised feedback. Observations were also used to rate TAs according to their effectiveness in delivering the intervention using a scale of 1 (excellent) to 3 (poor). The average TA rating was 1.41 (0.64).</p><p>A questionnaire was used to assess children&#x02019;s participation in classroom literacy activities both prior to and in addition to the intervention. Questionnaires were returned for 36 children (intervention group <italic>N</italic> = 24; waiting group <italic>N</italic> = 12). Prior to starting the intervention, children were involved in book reading (64%; including independent, guided and class reading), phonics instruction (28%), sight word learning (25%) and making and reading personal books (31%). Literacy instruction provided in addition to the intervention included book reading (81%), phonics (28%) and sight word learning (14%). Eleven per cent of respondents indicated that intervention was the only literacy input children received.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> shows the means and standard deviations for all measures for each group at <italic>t</italic>1, <italic>t</italic>2 and <italic>t</italic>3 (pre-intervention, after the first 20-week intervention period and after the second 20-week intervention period).

Children who received the intervention during the first 20 weeks of the trial made significantly more progress on several key measures (single word reading, letter-sound knowledge and phoneme blending; with small to moderate effect sizes) than children receiving their typical instruction. All of these skills were directly targeted by the intervention; little generalization was observed to reading-related abilities which rely heavily upon phonological skills, namely nonword reading and spelling. The children&#x02019;s expressive knowledge of taught vocabulary had also improved. There were no gains in receptive vocabulary or on standardised tests of language (expressive and receptive vocabulary; expressive information and grammar).</p><p>The gains in single word reading were modest with an average gain of 4.5 words on the reading test per 20 weeks of intervention, compared to an average of two words when receiving typical literacy instruction. When interpreting these findings it is important to remember that these children have general learning difficulties. A similar intervention for DS by our group reported similar gains (two words per 8 weeks of phonics-based reading intervention), though with larger effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Goetz et al., 2008</xref>). That study pre-selected children with &#x02018;emergent reading skills&#x02019;, whereas no child in mainstream school was excluded from the present sample (indeed, some children had very poor oral language skills). Moreover, it needs to be noted that there was wide variation in the gains children made in reading, with some children making little or no progress and others making large and educationally significant gains. Importantly, 48/53 children were able to score on the reading test at <italic>t</italic>3 (compared with 32 at <italic>t</italic>1) and 10 children attained a standard score of 90 or above on the EWR reading measure at this time.</p><p>Another positive outcome of the present study was that improvements in reading continued for the group who received 40 weeks of instruction, and there was a dose-related relationship such that children who attended more sessions benefited more. Perhaps inevitably given a finite set of items to be taught, there was more limited growth in letter-sound knowledge during the second phase of intervention and gains in phoneme blending were also less good. However, it is not unusual for growth in word reading to be ahead of growth in phoneme awareness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baylis &#x00026; Snowling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Goetz et al., 2008</xref>) and even the modest improvement (<italic>d</italic> = 0.24) could be important in ensuring the future reading devleopment of these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Stuebing, Barth, Cirino, Francis, &#x00026; Flethcer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The intervention had less impact on language outcomes though it was encouraging to find evidence of gains on the measure of directly taught expressive vocabulary (though not on the equivalent receptive vocabulary measure). Moreover, children maintained the gains they made in taught vocabulary beyond the initial teaching of those words when instruction moved to a different set of words. We hypothesize that this unexpected pattern of better gains in expressive than receptive knowledge for taught words is likely due to the emphasis placed upon using these words in different contexts during the sessions, as well as the differing task demands of the two tests. Nonetheless, the relatively poor progress of the group in oral language skills speaks to the fact that these children have pervasive language learning difficulties.</p><p>Once age and attendance were controlled, receptive language accounted for a significant proportion of variance in growth in reading, though, in contrast to findings from typical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Muter, Hulme, Snowling, &#x00026; Stevenson, 2004</xref>), phoneme awareness did not. In the present study, our measure of receptive language was a composite of vocabulary and grammar; statistically vocabulary had the stronger effect. Consistent with this, a longitudinal study of reading in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hulme et al., 2012</xref>) also found that receptive vocabulary was a stronger predictor of reading skills than phoneme awareness. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the view that vocabulary knowledge places constraints on the development of segmental phonological representations in the absence of which, phoneme awareness is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Metsala &#x00026; Walley, 1998</xref>). Within the framework of the Triangle Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Seidenberg &#x00026; McClelland, 1989</xref>), the problems observed in the development of an efficient decoding system which can support nonword reading and phonetic spelling would be a natural consequence. Speculatively, our finding that younger children responded better to intervention may be explained by the fact that they were more likely to be exposed to phonics-based classroom literacy work which was reinforced by the current intervention but the optimal age for intervention in this population is an issue which deserves further research.</p><p>The intervention evaluated here was novel in its integrated approach to reading and language instruction for children with DS and is educationally realistic. Although the effect sizes obtained are modest and there was little evidence of transfer to broader measures of literacy or language the study does provide evidence to support the efficacy of the intervention. It is also worthy of note that the intervention was cost-effective since the TAs were already assigned to the children; furthermore, the control group could be considered conservative since all children worked with a dedicated TA delivering one-to-one instruction during the &#x02018;waiting&#x02019; period. Response to the intervention was variable with children who were younger, received more intervention, and had better receptive language skills making better progress. A potential avenue for future research is to consider how best to tailor intervention to meet the needs of individual children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This trial was funded by the Big Lottery Fund.
