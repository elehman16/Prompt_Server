Metformin is a well-established anti-hyperglycaemic agent in diabetes mellitus, possibly augmented with anti-inflammatory effects, but its effects in COPD are unknown. We investigated accelerated metformin therapy in severe COPD exacerbations, primarily to confirm or refute an anti-hyperglycaemic effect, and secondarily to explore its effects on inflammation and clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing accelerated metformin therapy in non-diabetic patients, aged &#x02265;35&#x02005;years, hospitalised for COPD exacerbations. Participants were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 1&#x02005;month of metformin therapy, escalated rapidly to 2&#x02005;g/day, or matched placebo. The primary end point was mean in-hospital blood glucose concentration. Secondary end points included the concentrations of fructosamine and C reactive protein (CRP), and scores on the COPD Assessment Test and Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>52 participants (mean (&#x000b1;SD) age 67&#x000b1;9&#x02005;years) were randomised (34 to metformin, 18 to placebo). All were included in the primary end point analysis. The mean blood glucose concentrations in the metformin and placebo groups were 7.1&#x000b1;0.9 and 8.0&#x000b1;3.3&#x02005;mmol/L, respectively (difference &#x02212;0.9&#x02005;mmol/L, 95% CI &#x02212;2.1 to +0.3; p=0.273). No significant between-group differences were observed on any of the secondary end points. Adverse reactions, particularly gastrointestinal effects, were more common in metformin-treated participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Metformin did not ameliorate elevations in blood glucose concentration among non-diabetic patients admitted to hospital for COPD exacerbations, and had no detectable effect on CRP or clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN66148745 and NCT01247870.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COPD Exacerbations</kwd><kwd>COPD Pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is the key question?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What are the effects of metformin in severe COPD exacerbations, particularly in relation to lowering blood glucose concentration?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What is the bottom line?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, metformin did not ameliorate in-hospital hyperglycaemia among non-diabetic patients admitted for COPD exacerbations nor did it affect the secondary end points of fructosamine, C reactive protein and patient-reported outcomes.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Why read on?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Randomised controlled trials testing novel treatments for severe COPD exacerbations are urgently needed but exceptionally difficult and, as a result, are few and far between; in this trial we explored the anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-inflammatory and clinical effects of metformin in an acutely ill, inpatient COPD population and demonstrated that it is unlikely to offer benefit.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exacerbations are major events for patients with COPD.

Metformin could fulfil these criteria, but its effects in acute medical illness, and COPD exacerbations in particular, are unknown. The present trial was conducted chiefly to test the anti-hyperglycaemic effects of metformin in severe COPD exacerbations, and secondarily to explore its safety, tolerability and effects on inflammation and clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at nine acute NHS hospitals in the UK. The trial was designed, led and implemented entirely by academic investigators and NHS clinicians. It was approved by the South East Research Ethics Committee (reference 10/H1102/62) and implemented in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. It was publicly registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01247870) and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry (ISRCTN66148745).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients were eligible to participate if they were aged &#x02265;35&#x02005;years, had COPD diagnosed by physician assessment and/or spirometry and were admitted to hospital for an acute exacerbation, with features as described by Anthonisen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> To facilitate supervised initiation of study treatment, patients were also required to have an expected inpatient stay of &#x02265;48&#x02005;h. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing, pharmacologically treated diabetes mellitus, respiratory or metabolic acidaemia, risk factors for hypoglycaemia or lactate accumulation and other factors, such as confusion, which precluded trial participation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2015208035F1">figure 1</xref>).

The random allocation sequence, with a block size of six, was generated by the manufacturer and implemented through sequentially numbered containers. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of treatment assignment until after data lock. Emergency code breaks were administered independently of the trial investigators by staff of the St George's Healthcare NHS Trust Clinical Trials Pharmacy.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to metformin 500&#x02005;mg capsules or matched placebo, starting at one capsule on day 1, incrementing to one capsule twice daily on day 2, two capsules in the morning and one in the evening on day 3 and two capsules twice daily from day 4 onwards. This was continued until a follow-up appointment at 1&#x02005;month. Initially, the trial was designed with an equal allocation ratio. This was modified early in the recruitment phase to an active:placebo ratio of 2:1 on recommendation of a panel of external experts, on the basis that increased exposure to metformin would permit a more informed assessment of safety and tolerability. This modification was performed without revealing the treatment assignment for enrolled participants, and with a commensurate increase in sample size to preserve statistical power.</p><p>The protocol recommended that participants should receive oral prednisolone 30&#x02005;mg/day for at least 7&#x02005;days. Open-label oral anti-hyperglycaemic therapy was prohibited. All other care was at the discretion of the treating physicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Assessments and end points</title><p>Scheduled study visits took place at baseline, hospital discharge and 1&#x02005;month and telephone and postal contact with participants was made at 3&#x02005;months. In addition, participants were reviewed regularly throughout the in-hospital phase to ascertain and encourage compliance with study procedures. They had access to 24&#x02005;h telephone support post discharge. Capillary blood glucose concentration was measured seven times per day (pre-mealtime and 2&#x02005;h post-mealtime and late evening) during the in-hospital phase, using point-of-care glucometers. Staff performing these measurements were blinded to treatment allocation but not necessarily to adverse events. Fructosamine and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations were measured at baseline, discharge and 1&#x02005;month. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was also administered at these time points, and again at 3&#x02005;months. The Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) was completed on paper every evening from randomisation for 1&#x02005;month. Recurrent healthcare-utilisation events (systemic antibiotic and corticosteroid prescriptions and unplanned hospital admissions) were ascertained at 1 and 3&#x02005;months. Plasma lactate concentration was monitored as a safety parameter, and details of adverse reactions and serious adverse events were sought at all contact opportunities.</p><p>The primary end point was mean in-hospital capillary glucose concentration, which has been found to be the most practical metric of hyperglycaemia-associated risk.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Prespecified secondary end points were selected to supplement assessment of anti-hyperglycaemic effects (fructosamine), inflammation (hsCRP) and clinical recovery (CAT, EXACT and recurrent healthcare-utilisation events). Operational definitions for all end points, including time points for comparisons, were specified prospectively in the trial protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated to provide at least 90% power at the 5% significance level to detect a 1.5&#x02005;mmol/L difference in the mean in-hospital capillary blood glucose concentration between groups, using an independent samples t test. This margin was selected to ensure the difference in blood glucose concentration observed between metformin and placebo in the settings of diabetes mellitus (1.9&#x02013;3.6&#x02005;mmol/L<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>) and burns injuries (2.3&#x02013;4.5&#x02005;mmol/L<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) would readily be captured. Based on local audit data, in which the SD of mean blood glucose concentration in inpatients with COPD was 1.5&#x02005;mmol/L, we calculated that with equal allocation, 22 participants per group would be required. An initial target sample size of 23 per group was set to allow for up to two non-analysable participants. With the amendment to 2:1 allocation, described above, a minimum of 32 metformin-treated and 18 placebo-treated participants was required to preserve the a priori power specification. An actual target sample size of 46 and 23 metformin-treated and placebo-treated participants, respectively, was set arbitrarily (the original active treatment group was doubled) so as to offer additional data on the safety and tolerability of metformin in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis was performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. No interim analyses were planned or conducted. The prospectively defined statistical analysis plan specified the independent samples t test for the primary analysis of blood glucose concentration. Fructosamine was analysed by calculating the changes between baseline and follow-up, and comparing these between groups with independent samples t tests. CRP data were transformed to a natural log scale for analysis, with comparisons made between groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, then anti-logged to permit the expression of changes over time as a percentage of the baseline value. Changes in CAT and EXACT scores were compared between groups with independent samples t tests. The prospectively defined time points for comparison were follow-up and 12&#x02005;weeks for the CAT, and days 5, 10 and 28 for the EXACT (day 1 was defined by the first dose of the study drug). The significance of within-group changes in fructosamine, CRP, CAT and EXACT over the various study time points were evaluated using paired-samples t tests. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings to alternative analytical approaches. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (V.21.0; IBM Corp.).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, we recruited 52 participants, all of whom were included in the primary analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2015208035F1">figure 1</xref>). This exceeded the minimum number required for the prospectively defined power specification, but did not reach the larger target sample size set to enhance assessment of safety and tolerability. A decision was taken by the trial steering committee at this point, without reference to study data, to stop recruitment due to time and funding constraints, and imminent expiry of study drugs.</p><p>The groups were similar in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015208035TB1">table 1</xref>) and concomitant treatment during the in-hospital phase (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table</xref> S1). Spirometry, performed where possible at discharge and 1&#x02005;month, was also similar between groups (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table</xref> S2). Patients with diabetes mellitus already established on treatment were not eligible for inclusion, and no participant had pre-existing untreated diabetes mellitus. However, baseline haemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) concentrations indicated a possible diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (&#x02265;48&#x02005;mmol/mol) in 7 (18%) of the 39 patients in whom this measurement was obtained (median (IQR) 42 (40&#x02013;44) and 42 (39&#x02013;44)&#x02005;mmol/mol in metformin and placebo groups, respectively). Moreover, 41 participants (79%) had a blood glucose &#x02265;10&#x02005;mmol/L at least once during the in-hospital phase; in 29 (56%) this was &#x02265;11.1&#x02005;mmol/L.</p><table-wrap

We found no difference in the primary end point of mean in-hospital capillary glucose concentration, despite participants having a clear tendency towards hyperglycaemia. There were no differences in any of the prespecified secondary end points, including fructosamine, hsCRP, patient-reported outcome measures (CAT and EXACT) and recurrent healthcare-utilisation events. Adverse reactions, particularly gastrointestinal effects, were more common in metformin-treated participants. Lactate concentration did not differ between groups and there were no cases of lactic acidosis.</p><p>Our finding that metformin did not ameliorate blood glucose elevations in COPD exacerbations contrasts with its well-established anti-hyperglycaemic effects in diabetes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This may be due to the differing pathophysiology of hyperglycaemia in COPD exacerbations. In this context it is notable that, despite metformin having been available for well over half a century, few studies have explored its glucose-lowering effect in acute illnesses. The only studies to address this question directly were two small trials in a burns unit,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> in which a glucose-lowering effect was observed, and an open-label study in critically ill patients,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> in which metformin appeared to be insulin-sparing. The present study differs from these in several important respects. First and foremost, it was conducted in the distinct context of COPD exacerbations, where the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia may be different to that in burn injuries and critical illness. Second, the sample size was larger, and with its multicentre, double-blind design, the methodology was arguably more robust. Third, the participants in the earlier trials had a greater propensity to hyperglycaemia than those in the present trial. Using the placebo groups as comparators, the mean glucose concentrations in the earlier trials were in the range of 10.2&#x02013;11.3&#x02005;mmol/L,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> as compared with 8.0&#x02005;mmol/L in the present study. Given that metformin acts to reduce blood glucose towards, but not below, the normal range,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> it is plausible that there was less scope in the present study for metformin to exert a detectable, clinically meaningful, glucose-lowering effect. Supporting this, a post hoc analysis suggested a trend towards a more pronounced glucose-lowering effect in participants with above-median baseline glucose concentrations.</p><p>Inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of COPD. It is evident both in the lungs and the serum, and markers of inflammation, notably CRP, rise during exacerbations and fall with recovery.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Studies in type 2 diabetes<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and polycystic ovarian syndrome<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> suggest that metformin may have anti-inflammatory effects, evident particularly as a fall in the serum CRP concentration. This finding was not reproduced in the present study. CRP was a secondary end point which did not contribute to the sample size determination and, as such, the negative results do not confirm the absence of an effect. It is also possible that a longer treatment period may be necessary, given that the positive studies lasted months to years, whereas this and other studies,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> of shorter duration, reported negative results.</p><p>The study was not powered to detect changes in clinical end points. However, these were explored to assist in planning future effectiveness studies, if indicated. Overall, scores on the patient-reported outcome instruments improved over the follow-up period, with the trends in favour of metformin, but no significant differences were identified between groups. Likewise, there were trends in favour of metformin, but no significant differences, in the risk of recurrent healthcare-utilisation events. Integrating these non-significant trends with the negative mechanistic findings on anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-inflammatory effects, our interpretation is that a meaningful short-term clinical benefit with metformin in this population is unlikely.</p><p>This study has some important limitations. Despite a recruitment period lasting over 3&#x02005;years and involving nine sites&#x02014;a considerable escalation over what had originally been envisaged&#x02014;we were unable to enrol as many participants as intended. In large part this was due to the high prevalence of serious acute and chronic comorbidities among the patients screened. Our experience illustrates the challenges faced when conducting research in this setting, as is reflected in the scarcity of clinical trials testing novel treatments for COPD exacerbations. However, the sample size was sufficient to meet the prospectively defined power specification; its main impact was in constraining our assessment of tolerability and safety. The study cohort was also highly selected, which inevitably brings into question the generalisability of the findings. However, the tendency to hyperglycaemia seen in the present study was similar to that observed in two other inpatient COPD cohorts,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and the mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (43&#x02005;mmol/mol or 6.1%) was the same as that seen in another similar cohort.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Capillary blood glucose concentration was selected as the primary outcome because it is the glycaemic metric most extensively studied in COPD exacerbations, and which has been clearly associated with adverse outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, point-of-care glucometers are subject to greater analytical error than laboratory analysis of venous blood, which may reduce measurement precision. This is mitigated by the fact that, being less burdensome and costly, capillary glucose can be measured more frequently and thus better capture biological fluctuations. Moreover, the negative primary end point data were supported by similar findings on the supplementary glycaemic metric of fructosamine, which reflects average blood glucose concentration over the preceding 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>In conclusion, in this randomised controlled trial conducted in non-diabetic patients admitted to hospital for COPD exacerbations, who were prone to elevated blood glucose concentrations, metformin had no detectable anti-hyperglycaemic effect and did not significantly alter CRP or clinical end points, although these secondary end points were not powered. Collectively, the findings suggest that as an acute treatment for COPD exacerbations in non-diabetic individuals, metformin is unlikely to be beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network Portfolio and the Comprehensive Local Research Networks (CLRNs) for their support in conducting this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Metformin in COPD Trial Team Members: Dr Srikanth Akunuri (Co-investigator), Mr Michael Tumilty (Research Coordinator) and Dr Jan Poloniecki (Statistician); Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London&#x02014;Dr Anjali Balasanthiran (Co-investigator), Ms Cielito Caneja (Co-investigator), Ms Kylie Norrie, Ms Theresa Weldring and Mr Jaime Carungcong (Research Nurses); University Hospital of North Tees&#x02014;Dr Richard Harrison (Principal Investigator), Ms Nicola Bateman and Ms June Battram (Research Nurses); Kings Mill Hospital&#x02014;Dr Sam Kemp (Principal Investigator), Ms Karen Whysall (Research Nurse); Royal Lancaster Infirmary&#x02014;Dr Mark Wilkinson (Principal Investigator), Ms Jayne Craig, Ms Clare Tibke and Ms Rebecca Jeffery (Research Nurses); Blackpool Victoria Hospital&#x02014;Dr Mohammed Paracha (Principal Investigator), Dr Tarek Saba (Co-investigator), Ms Gemma Swarbrick and Ms Judith Saba (Research Nurses); Royal Preston Hospital&#x02014;Dr Aashish Vyas (Principal Investigator), Ms Janet Mills and Ms Sarah Goddard (Research Nurses); Freeman Hospital, Newcastle&#x02014;Dr Anthony De Soyza (Principal Investigator); Ms Therese Small, Ms Ashley Dodds (Research Nurses); Conquest Hospital, Hastings&#x02014;Dr Umesh Dashora (Principal Investigator), Ms Rachael Golton (Research Nurse).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AWH wrote the study protocol and associated documents, coordinated the implementation of the study, collated and managed the study data, conducted data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
