Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease affecting the pilosebaceous follicles of the dermis. There are 4 pathogenic factors involved in the development of acne: increased sebum production, follicular hyper-keratinization, microbial colonization (<italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>) and the release of inflammatory mediators into the dermis [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sebum plays the key role in the development of acne. Acne begins just before puberty when the sebaceous glands enlarge and reaches maximum occurrence in early adolescence when sebum outputs reach the peak [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Acne vulgaris is characterized by formation of comedones, papules, pustules, cysts, nodules and often scars, primarily on the face and neck [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The common treatment of acne vulgaris includes oral and topical application of comedolytic agents like benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, retinoids and oral/topical antibiotics like tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These agents have several side effects [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to synthetic agents, natural products are safer and cheap so nowadays physicians prefer the formulations containing plant extracts [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Numerous plants are used in traditional medicine worldwide as treatment for acne. Some of these have been subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> screening but efficacy of such medicine has rarely been tested in targeted patients [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Preliminary phytochemical analysis of <italic>Cassia fistula</italic> (family: Leguminosae) seeds indicated the presence of relatively high levels of glycosides, anthraquinones, steroids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds like flavonoids, catechin, epicatechin, Kaempferol, Ellagic acid (EA) and Rhein. In the Indian literature, <italic>C. fistula</italic> has been described to be useful in skin diseases [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> has been used in modern science and technology for the last 30 years [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Increased desquamation of follicular keratinocytes and increased cohesiveness of the corneocytes is seen in follicles affected by acne. Increased sebum and desquamated epithelial cells results in follicular obstruction which causes the formation of a micro-comedone and leads to the lesion of acne. Increased sebum also provides a suitable environment for the propagation of <italic>P. acnes</italic> bacteria that settle in the sebum-rich follicles and utilize lipids of sebum as a nutrient source. Lipases released from <italic>P. acnes</italic> break sebum triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are an irritant to the follicular wall and the surrounding dermis after follicular rupture. <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> bacteria also release pro-inflammatory and chemotactic factors that contribute to the inflammatory response observed in acne [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is observed that both, the extracts alone and formulations containing extracts showed <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-bacterial activities. The patch (skin compatibility) test showed that there was no volunteer sensitive to the formulations. Clinically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) results were obtained both for F1 and F2 in the case of grade I and grade II acne.</p><p>In this study it has been noted that the F3 (placebo) significantly increased the sebum contents throughout the study period of 12 weeks. In the case of F1 and F2, a regular decline was observed in the sebum contents throughout the study period of 12 weeks.</p><p>5&#x003b1;-Reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone which is more potent and results in the enlargement of sebaceous gland secreting a high amount of sebum. It is thought that inhibiting 5&#x003b1;-reductase may be effective in lowering the sebum level. Many botanical compounds are considered to inhibit 5&#x003b1;-reductase. These include essential fatty acids (&#x003b3;-linolenic acid, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid, linoleic, and oleic acids) and phytosterols [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Polyphenols in <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> and <italic>C. fistula</italic> include flavonols, catechins, proanthocyanidins and chlorogenic acids while the main fatty acids of <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> and <italic>C. fistula</italic> are palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid and oleic acid. Due to the presence of these constituents, the formulations reduced sebum contents by possibly inhibiting 5&#x003b1;-reductase [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acne can produce negative psycho-social effects in affected individuals. These include diminished self-esteem, social withdrawal due to discomfiture and depression. Formulations containing plant extracts are believed to be cost effective and free from side effects such as local irritation, scaling, photosensitivity, itching, erythema and skin shedding. The good agreement between the results of <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in vivo</italic> analysis and those of clinical evaluation showed that the plant extracts possess efficacy in comparison to placebo in combating acne. The plant extracts, which demonstrated a significant anti-acne activity, were described for the first time to possess this biological property especially in the form of formulation development. Our study shows that formulations containing <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> and <italic>C. fistula</italic> extracts can be an effective therapy in grade I and II acne vulgaris.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank to the Higher Education Commission for financial support.</p></ack><sec id="S0022"><title>Conflict of
