This method of oxygen delivery is cheap, easy to administer and acceptable to both patients and anesthesiologists in routine cases.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hudson mask is a variable rate performance device which depends on the oxygen flow rate, reservoir effect size of the mask, peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), and respiratory rate (RR). The fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) varies depending on these factors, and there is always risk of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) rebreathing. Although there are different types of oxygen delivery devices available which perform predictably better, Hudson type mask is used most commonly.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The literature about the performance of Hudson type masks mentions about flow rates, FiO<sub>2</sub> and arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The data regarding the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing and oxygen flow rate through Hudson mask is limited. The recommended flow rate for Hudson face mask to avoid rebreathing is 4-10 L/min.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, in clinical practice use of 3 L/min of flow rate is frequently seen. The increase in flow rate does not improve oxygenation and performance can deteriorate with an increase in minute ventilation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hence, the flow rate at which no CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing is seen appears to be minimum mandatory flow for Hudson mask. The previous study done on healthy human volunteers with the help of plethysmography recommends minimum flow of 5 L/min to avoid rebreathing. CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing can lead to increase in work of breathing which cannot be detected by clinical signs or pulse oximetry.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Existing literature about required flow rates and rebreathing is based on plethysmography or oxygraphy and the amount of rebreathing is calculated based on various factors.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, studies using capnography to find out an actual fraction of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> (FiCO<sub>2</sub>) in spontaneously breathing patients are not available. In this study, we compared the effect of different flow rates through Hudson mask on CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing (FiCO<sub>2</sub>) with capnography.</p><p>The primary aim of our study was to find out the minimum flow rate at which no CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing is seen at any time during the study. The secondary aim of the study was to compare hemodynamic parameters, RR, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and integrated pulmonary index (IPI) between groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a prospective randomized double-blind study conducted over a period of 3 months from August 2016 to October 2016, after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC No. 2016/261). The trial was registered in clinical trial registry &#x02013; India, before starting enrollment of patients (CTRI/2017/02/007807). Patients between 18 and 40 years of age of physical status American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) class I, posted for elective surgeries under monitored anesthesia care were included in the study. Patients with physical status ASA class II and above, posted for emergency surgeries, pregnant patients and patients not willing to participate in the study were excluded from the study. The study protocol was explained to all patients and informed valid consent was obtained. No premedication was given to any patient. Patients were randomly divided into four groups by block randomization method with a block size of four depending on the flow rate they would receive. All the patients were monitored with Planet 60/Star 60 monitor, SANKRAY Technologies Pvt. Ltd., India. Before the start of the study, CO<sub>2</sub> calibration was done with manufacturer approved kit containing calibration gas from Scott medicals. The calibration gas contained 5% of CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% of oxygen and the balance amount of nitrogen gas. Autocalibration was done by the machine and its status was confirmed before connecting to each subject. After shifting the patient to the operation theater, the monitor was switched on. Monitor alarms for all the parameters were disabled. Once the autocalibration was over and CO<sub>2</sub> ready message was displayed, it was connected to the patient through nasal prongs of the disposable Adult CapnoLine (Microstream Technology). SpO<sub>2</sub> probe and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were connected. Pulse rate (PR)/min, NIBP, systolic/diastolic as mmHg, RR/min, EtCO<sub>2</sub> as mmHg, FiCO<sub>2</sub> as mmHg, IPI as number were noted at baseline before connecting to Hudson mask. Then the disposable adult Hudson mask (HUDSON RCI, Romsons) was applied with as much as possible seal. The mask was connected to the oxygen source behind workstation, which was out of the vision of monitoring anesthesiologist, through two-meter long tubing. The oxygen was given through flow meter with rotating type bobbin by operation theater assistant, who did not have visual access to the monitor facing opposite side. Oxygen flow rate was started depending on the group. Group I received flow of 3 L/min, Group II received flow of 4 L/min, Group III received 5 L/min of flow, and Group IV received 6 L/min of flow. After starting oxygen through Hudson mask, PR, NIBP, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, RR, FiCO<sub>2</sub>, and IPI were monitored every minute for 10 min. At the end of 10 min, oxygen mask was removed, and that point was taken as a study endpoint. The study protocol was handed back to the investigator in sealed envelope. After that scheduled surgical procedure was done as planned for each patient. All the patients were monitored with the same planet 60/star 60 machine by the consultant anesthesiologist assigned to the particular case.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size calculation was done with the primary aim of finding flow with zero inspired CO<sub>2,</sub> extrapolating the results from the previous study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Applying the effect size (es-1.98) to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) between four groups the sample size of 8 per group was needed with 1% of significance and power of 95%. Ten patients per group were included to allow possible dropouts. Statistical analysis was done with IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23 (SPSS, IBM Corporation, USA) for Windows (Microsoft Corporation, USA). Demographic characteristics were assessed with ANOVA and expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and frequency. Vital parameters and capnographic parameters were assessed by Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test to compare between the groups and expressed as median (range). All the parameters were compared as values noted each minute in between the groups. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 was considered statistically significant. The correlation between FiCO<sub>2</sub> and RR was established using Pearson correlation coefficient and was expressed as graphical presentation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the actual fraction of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> with the help of capnography, while breathing through Hudson mask. Hudson mask is a variable performance device; hence, FIO<sub>2</sub> varies based on RR and tidal volume (TV). Fresh gas flow (FGF) set as flow rate is delivered lesser than PIFR and so the atmospheric air drawn through the vents is must for adequate TV. This results in breath-to-breath variation in performance of Hudson mask. Our results show that at different flow rates given through Hudson mask, the hemodynamic parameters, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> are comparable.</p><p>Jensen <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of different oxygen flow rates on ventilation and concluded that at flow rates &#x0003c;5 L/min, there was an increase in TV which they attributed to CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing. However, they did not find a significant increase in RR at flow rates &#x0003c;5L/min.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We have studied the actual amount of CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing and found FiCO<sub>2</sub> and RR both were same at all flow rates. They also noted that rebreathing does not cause any change in hemodynamic parameters. In our study, we did not find any difference in hemodynamic variables as well as IPI. After studying the performance of Hudson type mask at two different flow rates, Leigh concluded that the total expiratory time which represents the O<sub>2</sub> wash in and CO<sub>2</sub> washout time would decide the composition of next breath.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, we found that at lower FGF of 3 L/min, increase in RR resulted into less time for exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> washout leading to increase in FiCO<sub>2</sub>. However, FGF of more than 4 L/min was sufficient to wash out CO<sub>2</sub> even with decrease in expiratory time. Campkin <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of rebreathing through Hudson mask with the help of capnometry. The load of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> was calculated based on the end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and the dead space.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Their observations showed that some amount of CO<sub>2</sub> was inspired even at FGF of 8 L/min, but it was significantly higher at FGF &#x0003c;4 L/min. In our study also FiCO<sub>2</sub> is seen at all flow rates and though it was higher at FGF &#x0003c;4 L/min it was not significant. However, Campkin <italic>et al</italic>. have calculated inspired CO<sub>2</sub> load based on EtCO<sub>2</sub> and dead space, while we have analyzed the actual amount of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> during each minute.</p><p>At FGF of 3 L/min, FiCO<sub>2</sub> was always above 1 mmHg and at FGF of more than 3 L/min it was always below 1 mmHg. CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing can stimulate cardiovascular responses but the previous study done on humans for the duration of 10 min has not shown any cardiovascular changes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study also FiCO<sub>2</sub> as high as 1 mmHg have not caused any change in hemodynamic parameters and IPI, which is composite index of different vital parameters (EtCO<sub>2</sub>, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, PR). CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance studies have shown that no disabling physiological or clinical symptoms are associated with breathing of 5% CO2, which is equivalent to a concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in expired gases.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Campkin <italic>et al</italic>. found no relation between FiCO<sub>2</sub> and duration of respiratory cycle and concluded that expiration time affecting FiCO<sub>2</sub> is a theoretical possibility.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, we found a strong correlation between these parameters. Study by Campkin <italic>et al</italic>. was done on mechanical lung model, and our study was on spontaneously breathing patients. The physiological variations seen in patients could be responsible for the difference in observations in our study. Previous studies on Hudson mask have mentioned about comparable PaCO<sub>2</sub> at different flow rates.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In our study, we did not analyze blood gases, instead measured the EtCO<sub>2</sub> which is a surrogate marker of PaCO<sub>2</sub> under normal physiological conditions and a noninvasive, simple method as well. There was no change in EtCO<sub>2</sub> at different flow rates in our study.</p><p>Wagstaff and Soni have concluded that increase in RR causes decrease in effectively inspired oxygen concentration (EIOC) while breathing through Hudson mask.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Patient factors such as RR and TV directly affect the EIOC and FiCO<sub>2</sub> irrespective of FGF. All the previous studies regarding performance and FGF in Hudson mask were done either on simulating models or on human volunteers and methods to alleviate patient factors which can affect performance have not been tried.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, that it was done on patients without anxiolysis. This could have affected the RR and FiCO<sub>2</sub>. Another limitation of our study is that only capnographic parameters were analyzed and breathing pattern was not evaluated. Further studies are needed on patients or human volunteers after adequate anxiolysis and sedation to minimize the interference of physiological variation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>FiCO<sub>2</sub>, the amount of rebreathing is similar at all flow rates while breathing through Hudson mask.</p><p>The flow of 3 L/min can be given through Hudson type face mask.
