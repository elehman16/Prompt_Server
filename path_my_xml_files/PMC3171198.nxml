Pocket-sized scanners can now easily be brought to the patient, so-called point-of-care ultrasonography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C1">1</xref></sup> The recently published recommendations for the use of pocket-sized echocardiography (POCKET) by the European Association of Echocardiography states that POCKET may serve as a tool for fast initial screening and as complement to the physical examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C2">2</xref></sup> Further, POCKET may be used for the triage of the patient in need of a complete echocardiographic examination and has the potential to rearrange inpatient workflow and diagnostics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Recent studies have shown good correlation between POCKET and high-end echocardiography (HIGH) in both outpatient cardiac clinics and echo-labs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C8">8</xref></sup> which offer optimal conditions for echocardiography. Even though the pocket-sized ultrasound devices are designed for point-of-care ultrasonography, it is not known whether bedside examinations with inferior conditions for echocardiography are feasible and reliable. Thus, we aimed to study the feasibility and reliability of POCKET as a bedside cardiovascular screening tool and adjunct to the physical examination in routine clinical ward rounds in patients admitted to a medical department.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>One hundred and ninety-six patients admitted to the medical department at Levanger Hospital, Norway between March and September 2010 were scanned with POCKET (Vscan; GE Vingmed, Horten, Norway) by one of the three experienced cardiologists on their regular on-call ward rounds. Selection was random, based solely on admission dates.</p><p>The specialist on call for general medicine at this hospital is either 1 of 3 cardiologists experienced in echocardiography or one of the 10 other specialists in internal medicine. Patients were only available for inclusion if one of the three cardiologists were on call the day the patients were admitted to hospital.</p><p>Patients admitted to the departments' cardiac unit (119 patients) were automatically referred to a subsequent HIGH examination. In addition, all patients from the non-cardiac units with standard indications for echocardiography were also referred and included in the analyses. Exclusion criteria included death or discharge before completed study protocol or withdrawal of consent. Patients were specifically not excluded due to poor image quality, previous illness or any other unspecified attribute. In total, 90 patients from the cardiac unit and 18 patients from the non-cardiac units underwent both POCKET and HIGH and these 108 patients are included in the analyses.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Pocket-sized echocardiographic screening</title><p>The ultrasound screening was performed at the bedside with a pocket-sized ultrasound device, Vscan (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway). The device weighs 390 g, including the phased-arrayed probe, which measures 135 &#x000d7; 73 &#x000d7; 28 mm. The device offers two-dimensional grey scale and live colour Doppler imaging. The image sector for echocardiographic imaging is 75&#x000b0;. The bandwidth ranges from 1.7 to 3.8 MHz and is automatically adjusted. An algorithm enables automatic storage and looping of a cardiac cycle without ECG signal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C9">9</xref></sup> The length of recordings of other structures is predefined and limited to 2s. Patient identification was performed by voice recording and the automatically assigned examination number. All images and recordings were saved on the device's micro-SD card and later transferred to a computer by commercial software (Gateway; GE Vingmed Ultrasound).</p><p>A standardized screening protocol was used. The cardiovascular screening by POCKET was performed at the bedside with patients in a left-lateral decubitus and supine position. Assessment of left ventricular (LV) global and regional function, right ventricular (RV) size and function, valvular anatomy and function, and the pericardium were done from parasternal long- and short-axis and apical four-chamber, two-chamber and long-axis views. Global LV and RV functions were classified online by visual assessment as: normal/near normal, moderate dysfunctional or severe dysfunctional, while regional LV function was classified as regional dysfunction present or not. Valvular pathology and dysfunction were classified as mild, moderate or severe by visual assessment from grey-scale and colour Doppler imaging. The area and intensity of the regurgitation jets assessed by colour Doppler were the most important for grading valvular regurgitations, while the grading of aortic stenosis was based on the degree of calcification and the movement of the cusps. Pericardial effusion was classified as present or not. The size of the left atrium was measured online on grey-scale parasternal long-axis images. An attempt was made in order to do the measurement at end systole. From the subxiphoid position, the abdominal aorta (AA) and inferior vena cava were assessed by grey-scale imaging. The AA was assessed distally to the bifurcation and classified as: no abdominal aortic aneurysm present or abdominal aortic aneurysm present, depending on whether the diameter exceeded 35 mm or not. In case of doubt by visual assessment, measurement was done by the device's calliper mode. The inferior vena cava diameter was measured end-expiratory within 2 cm from the right atrium orifice. All measurements of size were done on the POCKET. With patients in a supine position, the pleura was assessed by grey-scale imaging from left and right lateral views, and the amount of pleural effusion was classified as: no pleural effusion, small-to-moderate amounts of pleural effusion or significant pleural effusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C10">10</xref></sup> All recordings were saved on the POCKET and the time used for the screening was calculated as the time from start to end of the examination.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Validation of point-of-care pocket-sized echocardiography</title><p>HIGH was performed in the hospital's echo-lab, under optimal conditions, with a Vivid 7 scanner (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) using a 2.0-MHz phased-array transducer (M3S) with bandwidth 1.5&#x02013;3.6 MHz. The scanner weighs 190 kg. Second harmonic imaging was used and the sector angle set to 90&#x000b0; as default, but was adjusted when appropriate. Storage and looping of cardiac cycles were ECG triggered. HIGH examinations were performed independently by one of four experienced cardiologists blinded to the results of POCKET with a median time delay of 17.3 h. The same cardiovascular structures as described above were measured and classified according to the guidelines of the European Association of Echocardiography (EAE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C15">15</xref></sup> Ejection fraction was measured by Simpson's rule from apical four-chamber and two-chamber views.

The pocket-sized ultrasound examinations were highly feasible and the agreement with reference methods was excellent for most indices.</p><p>The presented findings are in line with recent publications from echo lab's and outpatient clinics with respect to feasibility and reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C8">8</xref></sup> However, direct comparisons between studies are difficult due to different populations and exclusion criteria. We excluded only patients who did not consent to participate or remain long enough in-hospital to have a reference echocardiography for comparison.</p><p>Furthermore, our study was conducted at the bedside by cardiologists, in sub-optimal examination conditions, on call during busy working hours, in a department where most admissions are on an emergency basis.</p><p>As shown by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ejechocard.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jer108/DC1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Figures S1 and S2</italic></ext-link> there was a modest underestimation of valvular pathology by POCKET compared with HIGH. This was most pronounced for classification of aortic stenosis. Visual detection of aortic stenosis by POCKET was inferior to high-end reference. This may be explained by the lack of spectral Doppler and the lower resolution (240 &#x000d7; 320 pixels) on the Vscan with inferior visualization of the valvular cusps. However, there was no misclassification of valvular dysfunction in those with severe aortic stenosis. Colour-coded images are limited by a low frame rate, but this is compensated for by the vendor by a high sensitivity. Very small or insignificant leakages may be bloomed and this may account for some of the overestimated pathology presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ejechocard.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jer108/DC1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Figures S1 and S2</italic></ext-link>. There were no misclassifications of severe aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. Thus, it does not seem to be any limitation for the clinical use of the colour mode.</p><p>The size of the left atrium and the inferior vena cava showed only substantial agreement between POCKET and HIGH. This may primarily be related to timing of the measurements in the cardiac or respiratory cycles and the time delay of median 17 h between POCKET and HIGH. As the POCKET device is not able to show the cyclicity of the cardiac or respiratory phases, timing of measurements is done by visual assessment only. As the dimension of the inferior vena cava is an indirect measure of right atrial filling pressure, the delay from POCKET to HIGH may bias the analyses of reliability, related both to physiologic conditions and any given treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C16">16</xref></sup> The lack of M-mode and ECG timing on the POCKET device may lead to inaccurate measurements.</p><p>The clinical implication of our study is that pocket-sized device can safely be implemented as a bedside screening device during ward rounds when operated by experienced users. Further work should address whether point-of-care POCKET influences workflow in hospitals and if our findings are reproducible by less-experienced users.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The applicability of this study may be limited in that all POCKET examinations were performed by experienced cardiologists with a special interest in echocardiography. How feasible and reliable the use of POCKET by non-experts is in similar situations remains uncertain.</p><p>The POCKET examinations were performed under non-optimal conditions at the bedside. Thus, the POCKET and the HIGH examinations were performed under different conditions and this may influence both feasibility and reliability. However, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and reliability of POCKET used as a bedside screening device and therefore this was necessary.</p><p>The time delay (median 17.3 h) between POCKET and HIGH examinations may bias the analyses of reliability, related both to physiologic conditions, disease progression or regression and any given treatment.</p><p>Lack of spectral Doppler capability makes assessment of valvular pathology according to recommended guidelines difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JER108C13">13</xref></sup> Instead the quantification of pathology was assessed based on colour Doppler, grey-scale images of leaflet thickening, calcification and mobility.</p><p>However, the high sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of POCKET with respect to detecting at least moderate pathology shows that POCKET may serve as an efficient tool for triage of the patient in need of a complete echocardiographic examination. Although POCKET quickly performs a limited semi-quantitative assessment well, it is not as accurate or reliable as the gold standard techniques. Pocket-sized echocardiography is as an adjunct to physical examination and a general screening tool. In settings where referral to formal imaging techniques is warranted POCKET is no substitute.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Focused point-of-care ultrasound examinations of 4 min duration with a pocket-sized device can offer high-quality semi-quantitative assessment of cardiac structures and function, as well as abdominal great vessels and the pleural space.
