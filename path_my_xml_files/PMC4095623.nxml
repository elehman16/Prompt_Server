These biofilms are extraordinarily persistent, difficult to maintain, and play a vital role in periodontal disease and its progression. Thus, elimination of these bacterial biofilms is the priority of periodontal therapy.</p><p>Non-surgical periodontal treatment remains the core component of successful periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Self-performed oral hygiene along with professional maintenance is the most effective method of prevention and maintenance of periodontal diseases. However, in reality, the degree of motivation and dexterity required for an optimal oral hygiene level may be beyond the ability of the majority of patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Chemical plaque control has been found to augment mechanical plaque control procedures. Mouthrinses provide a method of depositing an active material for slow release in the mouth. This helps in maintaining an effective concentration of the material in the mouth over a considerable period of time following its use. There are many such active materials which are conventionally administered by mouthrinses, for example, anti-inflammatories, fluorides, desensitizers, deodorants, and antimicrobials. Commercial interest in mouthrinses has been intense due to their effectiveness in reducing halitosis, build-up in dental plaque, and the associated severity of gingivitis, in addition to disinfecting the tongue. From this perspective, the utilization of antimicrobial mouthrinses, as antiplaque agents, has been considered a useful adjunct to oral hygiene.</p><p>Since 1970s, chlorhexidine digluconate has been considered to be the most effective plaque inhibitor against which other antiplaque agents are measured. But there are side-effects associated with chlorhexidine, such as staining of teeth, altered taste sensation, and supragingival calculus formation in some patients when used over a long period. As a result, there is an increased interest in research for newer formulations. The relative safe nature of herbal extracts has led to their use in several fields of medicine.</p><p>Herbal extracts and plant essential oils (EO) have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for chronic gingivitis and periodontitis conditions that have both bacterial and inflammatory components. These are useful as their long-term daily use has no adverse effects on the health of an individual. Also, these are more cost-effective and easily available as over-the-counter products. In lieu of this, extensive research is being carried out, successfully, for formulations of various herbal mouthrinses for their effective long-term use. Some of the several herbal extracts that have been assessed in dentistry are aloe vera,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] neem (<italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>),[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] basil (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] tea tree oil (TTO) (<italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>),[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] curcumin (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>),[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] clove,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] garlic,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] etc.</p><p>A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a newly formulated mouthrinse containing TTO, clove, and basil for its antiplaque and antigingivitis properties. Additionally, the effect of the mouthrinse on the plaque microbial load was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population and design</title><p>The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group design clinical trial. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee. The trial was a single-center study conducted in the Department of Periodontics. A written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the initiation of the study. A total of 50 patients were included in the study based on the statistical formula. Male or female non-smokers aged between 18 and 35 years with a Plaque Index (PI; Silness and Loe, 1964)[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Gingival Index (GI; Loe and Silness, 1963)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] score of &#x0003e;1.5 were included in the study. The subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two groups using a computer-generated number to receive one of the two mouthwashes. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: The test group (<italic>n</italic> = 25) in which patients were given the formulated coded herbal mouthrinse and the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 25) in which the patients were given a coded commercially available EO mouthrinse. The study duration was 21 days. The subjects had a minimum of 20 teeth and did not have diabetes, hepatic or kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or any other systemic condition contraindicating participation in the study. Exclusion criteria included individuals who had received chronic treatment with any medication like steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, or with a history of periodontal therapy in the last 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Preparation of mouthrinse</title><p>The active agents for the mouthrinse, namely TTO (0.2-0.3%), clove (0.2-0.3%), and basil (0.2-0.3%), were obtained from Suyash Herbs Exports Private Limited, Surat, Gujarat, India. The mouthrinse was formulated by Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt Ltd (Mumbai, India). A macro-broth dilution assay was performed to evaluate the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the mouthrinse against the oral pathogen, <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>.

Patients were instructed to use the respective mouthrinse for 21 days (10 ml twice daily for 30 s). Patients were instructed not to drink, eat, or rinse for 30 min after the use of mouthrinse. The following indices were measured at baseline, 14 days, and 21 days: PI,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] GI,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Papillary Marginal Attachment (PMA) Index.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] At each visit, each subject was also queried in a nonspecific manner to record any adverse events and the oral hygiene instruction was re-enforced.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Microbiological analysis</title><p>Plaque samples were collected at the baseline and at 21 days for microbiological evaluation. A sterile curette or a scaler was used to collect the plaque samples which were transported to the laboratory in thioglycollate broth for microbiological analysis.

One loopful of sample was then inoculated onto blood agar supplemented with Hemin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and Vitamin K (10 &#x003bc;g/ml). Blood agar plates used for anaerobic isolation were prepared with Brucella agar base. Plates were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 3-5 days at 37&#x000b0;C. The anaerobiosis was carried out in the jar with &#x0201c;Internal Gas Generating system.&#x0201d; After 72 h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the anaerobic jar was opened. The plates were examined for the presence of colonies.

The cost-effectiveness of these products, along with the non-significant side-effects, guarantees a safe option to the current load of medications available. The study attempted to demonstrate the antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy of a newly formulated herbal mouthrinse compared to the commercially available EO mouthrinse over a 21-day period. Findings in this study showed that the test group and control group had decreased PI, GI, and PMA scores, which can be attributed to the mouthrinses along with oral hygiene practices. No adverse effects were reported from subjects of both groups.</p><p>The control group (EO mouthrinse) also presented with reduction in GI, PI, and PMA scores. EO mouthrinse contains thymol and eucalyptol, mixed with menthol and methyl salicylate in a hydroalcoholic vehicle. The mechanisms of action of EO against bacteria are complex. The microbiological studies showed that EO killed a wide range of microorganisms within 30 s.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It penetrates the plaque biofilm and exerts a bactericidal activity to the embedded bacteria.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It kills microorganisms by disrupting their cell walls and inhibiting their enzyme activity.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Bacteria are prevented from aggregating with Gram-positive bacteria, and bacterial multiplication is slowed.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] As a result, the bacterial load is reduced with slower plaque maturation and a decrease in plaque mass and pathogenicity. The above mechanism of action of EO is also suggested in the present study with the reduction of the scores [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the efficacy of the herbal mouthrinse was highly significant in reducing the PI, GI, and PMA Index scores over the 21-day study period. The newly formulated mouthrinse contained a new combination of phytochemicals, namely TTO, clove, and basil. TTO (<italic>M. alternifolia</italic>) shares a similar range of antimicrobial activity with chlorhexidine, having antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Clove oil is known for its analgesic, local anesthetic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Scientific studies have established that compounds in basil oil (<italic>O. sanctum</italic>) have potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Both the groups showed antiplaque and anti-inflammatory property. In comparison, the scores of GI, PI, and PMA were non-significant and similar to each other. This indicates the similar effects of both the mouthrinses on the clinical parameters, with the added benefit of the alcohol-free formulation of mouthrinse in the test group. It has been observed that long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses can cause desiccation of oral mucosal membranes, increase subjective xerostomia, and few cases of burning sensation of gingival tissues have also been reported.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, the reduction in the microbial load with the test group mouthrinse was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) than the reduction observed with the control group mouthrinse.</p><p>Saxer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that TTO (<italic>M. alternifolia</italic>) results in reduction in inflammation due to the presence of 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol. TTO also results in less plaque formation as reported by Takarada <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who demonstrated that TTO is able to inhibit the adhesion of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>. Also, aqueous and methanol extracts of clove have been shown to inhibit adhesion of the bacteria to glass, reduce cell surface hydrophobicity, and inhibit the production of glucosyltransferase.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These properties of TTO and clove could account for the antiplaque and antigingivitis activities of the formulated mouthrinse.</p><p>TTO is efficacious against oral bacteria, with antiseptic, fungicidal, and bactericidal effects due to its active ingredients.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The other ingredient, clove oil, has been proven to have marked germicidal effect against various periodontal pathogens (<italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, <italic>Prevotella melaninogenica</italic>, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>Capnocytophaga gingivalis</italic>, and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>) and superinfectants (<italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The clove buds suppress the oral microorganisms to 70% and it is evident from the fact that many toothpastes contain clove oil as their major constituent. Basil (<italic>O. sanctum</italic>) was reported to possess antibacterial properties by Mondal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] These properties are due to the high percentage of eugenol (61.2%) and monoterpene components, mostly phenolic in nature, like methyl eugenol (1.8%) and carvacrol (30.4%), which exert membrane-damaging effects to microbial strains and stimulate leakage of cellular potassium ions which are responsible for a lethal action related to cytoplasmic membrane damage.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Basil extracts decrease plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and increase serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), resulting in an antioxidant effect.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proven to have a definite role in the progression of periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, this role of basil extracts has been proven in various animal models for peptic ulcers, with inconclusive evidence against oral pathogens.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Thus, the combined antibacterial effect of the three ingredients could have led to a superior reduction in the microbial load of the herbal mouthrinse as compared to the commercial one.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Thus, the positive results of the present study suggest that the newly formulated mouthrinse containing TTO, clove, and basil demonstrates antiplaque, antigingivitis, and antibacterial properties, which may be useful as an adjunctive to mechanical therapy in the prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases. It has the potential of becoming a commercial commodity by virtue of the harmonious properties of the individual ingredients. But additional long-term longitudinal trials are required to further assess the efficacy of the mouthrinse to be utilized as an adjuvant to periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We are thankful to Mr. M.
