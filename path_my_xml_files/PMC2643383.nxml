                        survival of parasites with minimal damage to the host. Some of these effects
                        "spill-over", altering responses to
                        non-helminth antigens or allergens. It is suggested that this may lead to
                        impaired responses to immunizations and infections, while conferring
                        benefits against inflammatory responses in allergic and autoimmune disease.
                        These effects might develop in utero, through exposure to maternal helminth
                        infections, or through direct exposure in later life.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To determine the effects of helminths and their treatment in pregnancy and in
                        young children on immunological and disease outcomes in childhood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
                        interventions at two times, in two people: a pregnant woman and her child.
                        Pregnant women are randomized to albendazole or placebo and praziquantel or
                        placebo. At age 15 months their children are randomized to three-monthly
                        albendazole or placebo, to continue to age five years. The proposed
                        designation for this sequence of interventions is a 2 X 2(x2) factorial
                        design.</p><p>Children are immunized with BCG and against polio, Diphtheria, tetanus,
                        Pertussis, Haemophilus, hepatitis B and measles. Primary immunological
                        outcomes are responses to BCG antigens and tetanus toxoid in whole blood
                        cytokine assays and antibody assays at one, three and five years of age.
                        Primary disease outcomes are incidence of malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea,
                        tuberculosis, measles, vertical HIV transmission, and atopic disease
                        episodes, measured at clinic visits and twice-monthly home visits. Effects
                        on anaemia, growth and intellectual development are also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This trial, with a novel design comprising related interventions in pregnant
                        women and their offspring, is the first to examine effects of helminths and
                        their treatment in pregnancy and early childhood on immunological,
                        infectious disease and allergic disease outcomes. The results will enhance

Concern regarding
                effects on anaemia, nutrition, growth and intellectual development, and specific
                disease syndromes, has led to increasing advocacy for mass deworming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with new recommendations for treatment in
                two special, relatively unstudied groups - pregnant women and preschool children
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our study addresses the effects of
                treatment in these two groups.</p><p>Most people with helminths are unaware of their infection, probably because
                helminth-induced immunomodulation reduces host responses, allowing parasite survival
                and minimizing tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This
                immunomodulation may &#x0201c;spill-over&#x0201d;, altering
                responses to unrelated organisms (viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>],
                bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) and vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]).</p><p>We aim to determine whether these immunomod-ulating effects are sufficient to reduce
                the efficacy of immunization and increase susceptibility to infectious diseases in
                childhood; and, if so, whether they can be removed by deworming. In particular, it
                is proposed that the high prevalence of helminth infections in the tropics
                contributes to the low efficacy of Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG)
                immunization and high incidence of tuberculosis in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. BCG is frequently given to neonates, before acquisition of helminth
                infection, so the finding that exposure to helminths <italic>in utero</italic> can
                influence the neonatal response to BCG may be particularly important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>],
                but the implications of observed changes in immune responses for vaccine efficacy
                are not known. We planned, therefore, to study both the effects of maternal
                helminths and of deworming during pregnancy, and the effects of acquisition of
                helminths and of deworming in early childhood, on responses to immunization and on
                disease incidence in childhood.</p><p>Helminth infections are generally considered detrimental. However, recent evidence
                suggests that they may have some benefits, protecting against abnormal immune
                responses associated with atopic and autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
                Indeed, trials to investigate the treatment of such conditions with helminths are in
                progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Helminths may also have a beneficial effect on the response to
                other pathogens, perhaps protecting against severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], or modulating the progression of HIV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>This trial is therefore designed to investigate the balance of detrimental and
                beneficial effects of early exposure to helminths and of their treatment. Here we
                describe how the design of the trial evolved in response to changes in policy
                regarding deworming in pregnancy, to preliminary findings, and to results from
                concurrent research. We show that the final protocol involves a novel factorial
                design, examining related interventions not in the same study subjects, but in
                pregnant women and their offspring. This design gives efficiency with regard to
                logistics, cost and trial burden in the community, but is also pertinent to policy,
                as interactions between the interventions, or additive effects would be important
                during implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Our initial hypothesis anticipated that maternal and childhood helminth infection
                would have detrimental effects on the response to childhood immunizations and to
                infectious diseases in infancy. However, our preliminary findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and results from concurrent research
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggested possible benefits in relation to disease
                mediated by poorly regulated inflammatory responses. Thus our current hypotheses,
                amended in response to preliminary findings, are that 1) maternal and childhood
                helminth infections reduce the effectiveness of childhood immunizations and increase
                susceptibility to viral and bacterial infectious diseases, while reducing the
                incidence of diseases mediated by poorly-regulated inflammatory responses; 2)
                treatment of maternal and childhood helminth infection improves the effectiveness of
                childhood immunizations and modulates disease incidence in childhood, with both
                beneficial and detrimental effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study was designed in 2000/2001 to evaluate presumptive treatment with
                albendazole in pregnancy and early childhood and commenced in June 2002. Results
                from 104 women enrolled using this design (the "preliminary
                study") have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In September 2002 the
                World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that pregnant and lactating women with
                schistosomiasis no longer be excluded from treatment, but be given praziquantel
                individually or during mass treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].
                Therefore, the study was discontinued and redesigned to include the use of
                praziquantel in pregnancy. The revised design is presented here. Recruitment using
                the revised design (the &#x0201c;main study&#x0201d;) ran from
                April 2003 to November 2005.</p><p>The study is a clinical trial with three randomised interventions at two times, two
                in pregnant women, and one in their children. For this we propose the designation, a

                    to women enrolling at the antenatal clinic and observe the treatment. Each woman

                    considered necessary, to avoid prolonged delay in treatment of women for
                    potentially damaging helminth infections. Of concern for interpretation of the
                    results of the trial is the possibility that there might be an effect on the
                    infant, mediated through breastfeeding, of treating the mother after delivery.
                    By treating all women after delivery, any such effects are kept as similar as
                    possible between the intervention groups (although, unavoidably, the reduction
                    in worm loads in those treated during pregnancy may mean that effects of the
                    second treatment are not identical between groups). A second option, treating
                    only those not treated during pregnancy, would have meant that any effect of
                    treatment during breastfeeding would be confined to the groups not treated
                    during pregnancy, creating uncertainty about whether treatment during pregnancy
                    or after delivery was more important in determining outcomes in the children.
                    The third option, not treating women after delivery, or waiting for, say, a
                    year, was not considered to be ethical, due to the resulting neglect of
                    treatment or prolonged delay.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Deworming children aged 15 months to five years</title><p>The intervention in childhood is albendazole or placebo given three-monthly.</p><p>A second randomization code, for treatment of children, was prepared by the trial

                    unlikely, since this depends on biting by infected mosquitoes. To make this
                    distinction, malaria parasitaemia will be determined at annual visits. In view
                    of the potential public health importance of understanding the effects of
                    helminths on malaria, measurement of anti-malarial antibody was added to the

                    acquisition of data from the preliminary part of the study, as outlined below.</p><p>A cohort of 2500 women has been recruited. This sample-size was planned for the
                    initial design (presumptive treatment with albendazole in pregnancy and early
                    childhood), as sufficient to detect effects on immunological outcomes and common
                    disease events, and with the hope of detecting an effect on incidence of
                    tuberculosis in children under five years old. No information was available for
                    incidence of tuberculosis in children in the study area. In a well-documented
                    community in South Africa the incidence in under-fives was 3588/100 000 p.a.;
                    3.5 times the incidence in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].
                    The estimated overall incidence in Uganda was 320/100 000 p.a. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], so a figure of 500/100 000 p.a. for
                    under-fives might be conservative. It was estimated that, for the effect of
                    albendazole in pregnancy, or for a binary, combined variable for exposure to
                    helminths <italic>in utero</italic> and/or in childhood (expected to be about
                    50%), a study with 1170 children in each arm and median follow-up of
                    three years would have 80% power with <italic>a
                    =</italic> 0.05 to detect a difference in incidence of
                    250/100 000 to 750/100 000 cases p.a. between groups. This estimate of effect
                    was large. However, the study seeks to examine the possibility that helminths
                    are crucial to the large difference observed in efficacy of BCG between
                    temperate regions (often above 70%) and the rural tropics (close to
                    0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. If this was so,
                    then a large effect was expected. It was noted that, for comparison of the
                    effects of three-monthly albendazole versus placebo in childhood, extension of
                    the follow-up period might be required.</p><p>Following the change in study design and acquisition of data from the preliminary
                    study the power of the study to detect important effects and interactions
                    between interventions was reviewed, assuming follow-up to age five years. In the
                    preliminary study, approximately 90% of enrolled mothers were seen
                    at delivery and 85% had live babies who entered follow-up. Of live
                    babies, 75% were seen at one year. Although follow-up in the main
                    study has been better than in the preliminary study, the figures from the
                    preliminary study (with an estimate of 10% loss to follow up per

                    included growth, anaemia and cognitive development. This study showed no

                    that mebendazole was associated with a reduction in wasting malnutrition in
                    children under 30 months, and in moderate anaemia for children under 24 months.
                    The observation of benefit principally in the youngest children, with the
                    lightest worm burdens, was the reverse of the result expected. The authors
                    suggest that the youngest children might be particularly vulnerable to the
                    effects of helminths, or that inflammatory processes during the response to
                    initial helminth infections might have a particularly severe effect. The
                    inconclusive and unexpected nature of these results, added to the possibility
                    that intensive deworming may have adverse effects on atopic disease and on
                    severity of malaria, suggests equipoise of potential beneficial and detrimental

                early childhood. Together with concern regarding effects on anaemia, nutrition,
                growth and development, there is intense interest in the hypothesis that helminths
                impair the response to vaccines and increase susceptibility to infectious diseases,
                while perhaps protecting against immunologically-mediated conditions such as atopic
                and autoimmune disease and severe malaria. There is increasing evidence of the
                importance of prenatal exposures (including exposure to helminth infection) for
                health outcomes in later life. Despite the potential importance of such effects for
                health policy, few investigations have been conducted to determine the magnitude of
                the proposed effects of helminths, or the ability of treatment to modify them.</p><p>Our study design has three aspects of particular note. First, is the intention to
                examine effects of helminths and of their treatment in the same study. Analysis of
                the effects of helminths is pertinent, because their magnitude is uncertain, but
                must take account of confounding with factors such as poverty and malnutrition.
                Examining the results of treatment in a randomized trial may provide more rigorous
                evidence of helminth-induced effects. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> by a detailed breakdown of results regarding the effects
                of maternal helminth infection on the incidence of infantile eczema from our
                preliminary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although based on
                small numbers, and given the proviso that the analysis of effects of helminths
                requires adjustment for confounders, the results seem to show, in the placebo group,
                the albendazole-treated group and overall, that the rate of eczema was about five
                times higher in infants whose mothers never had helminths (none-none) compared with
                those whose mothers had persistent helminths (any-any). In all helminth-status
                groups, the rate of eczema was higher in the albendazole-treated group than the
                placebo group (except none-any where both rates were zero and numbers small). A
                small effect of albendazole among those whose mothers never had helminths
                (none-none) may be attributed to clearing of infections not detected by the single
                stool examination; a large effect among those whose mothers cleared their infection
                (any-none) suggests that the risk of eczema was highest in infants of mothers who
                had helminths that were cleared by treatment. Thus data suggesting an effect of
                helminths can be supported by evidence suggesting a reversal of their effect by
                treatment. At the same time, the effects of a policy of presumptive treatment in
                pregnancy can be considered. <table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Associations between incidence of infantile eczema, maternal helminth

                                more detailed analysis, allowing for multiple episodes using a
                                random effects model, is presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
            </p><p>Second, we have chosen to examine effects of both albendazole and praziquantel during
                pregnancy in the same trial. This is relevant, since deworming policy is likely to
                recommend both in regions where geohelminths and schistosomiasis are coprevalent
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, there is increasing evidence that immunological effects vary
                between helminth genera. Studying these two treatments in a factorial design will
                allow us to examine their effects both separately and together.</p><p>Third, we have chosen to incorporate a trial of the effects of deworming in young
                children in the same cohort as a trial of deworming in pregnancy. This again
                reflects emerging policy. Some losses are inevitable between pregnancy and
                childhood, so the number of people randomized in the childhood component differs
                from the number randomized during pregnancy, and the people themselves, being mother
                and child are different. Despite this, the interventions are related and may have
                interacting or additive effects; hence the proposed, novel designation, a 2 X 2(x2)
                factorial design. This approach is, as far as we know, unprecedented, but is
                particularly relevant to the implementation of related interventions in mothers and
                children, when important interactions, such as potentiation of effects of
                interventions in pregnancy by intervention in childhood, may occur.</p><p>In addition to achieving scientific goals, the combining of objectives is a matter of
                expediency. Despite uncertainty regarding the benefits and risks of deworming in
                pregnancy and young children, enthusiasm for these policies means that the window of
                opportunity for conducting such studies is likely to be short. Indeed, our ability
                to detect effects of the acquisition and treatment of helminths in young children
                may be limited by the on-going provision of albendazole in Uganda by community-based
                distributors and on twice-yearly "child days";
                this extra treatment is, however, monitored in the study, and uptake is likely to be
                similar between the randomized groups.</p><p>The study has several potential limitations. First, the sample-size may be
                insufficient for evaluation of rare outcomes. Interpretation of the effects of
                helminths on the response to immunization depends, ultimately, on incidence of
                disease, thus rare outcomes of particular interest include tuberculosis and measles.
                The likely incidence of tuberculosis infection and disease in the cohort remains low
                and uncertain. The incidence of measles may increase in older children as
                vaccine-induced protection wanes, but depends, among other things, on vaccine
                coverage in the community. Similarly, while effects on infantile eczema are of
                interest, effects on long-term risk of asthma will be of greater importance.
                Follow-up is currently planned to age five years, but longer follow-up may be
                required to obtain conclusive results for such conditions.</p><p>Second, the results may not all be generalisable. Communities differ in important
                respects, such as species and intensity of helminth infection, nutritional status,
                and exposure to non-pathogenic mycobacteria that may influence immunity to
                tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], to pathogens (such as
                malaria and HIV), to allergens, and to pollutants that may influence responses to
                allergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Similar studies are needed in other
                settings.</p><p>Advocacy for deworming has created a climate in which delayed or infrequent deworming
                may be thought unethical. To our knowledge, the only clearly demonstrated benefit of
                deworming in pregnancy is a reduction in hookworm-associated anaemia and the
                benefits of frequent de-worming for children under five are uncertain. In the
                absence of proven benefit, and given the possibility of detrimental effects such as
                teratogenicity, promotion of atopic disease or increased severity of malaria,
                placebo-controlled trials remain appropriate. Safeguards to prevent neglect of
                severe anaemia, or of tissue-damaging infections, can be incorporated into the study
                design, as described.</p><p>This is the first trial undertaken to examine the effects of helminths, and of
                deworming in pregnancy and young children, on immunological, infectious disease and
                atopic disease outcomes in children. The design will allow the role of helminths and
                benefits of deworming to be elucidated in relation to the more conventional outcomes
                of anaemia, growth and development, also. The results are expected to inform policy
                and to enhance understanding of both detrimental and beneficial effects of helminth
                infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants and the staff of the study, the communities of Entebbe and
