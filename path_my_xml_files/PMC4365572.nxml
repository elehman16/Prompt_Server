We report the 24- to 36-month follow-up of one center's experience with the ProDisc-L artificial disc as part of a prospective, randomized trial comparing total disc arthroplasty to combined anterior&#x02013;posterior lumbar fusion.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study involved clinical results for 157 patients from a single center enrolled in the US Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;regulated trial comparing ProDisc-L to fusion. Only patients who had reached a minimum 24-month follow-up were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive total disc replacement or circumferential fusion at 1 or 2 lumbar disc levels from L3 to S1, with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

As with many spinal conditions, nonoperative management should be the first line of treatment. If this fails to provide adequate relief, operative intervention may be warranted in carefully selected patients. In a randomized study, the Swedish Lumbar Spine Study Group found that fusion yielded superior results to nonoperative care.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the results of fusion in general remain highly variable, and the conclusions of many studies are difficult to interpret or generalize because of the mix of diagnoses included within a study, the variation of graft materials, instrumentation, combinations of interbody and posterior procedures, and outcome measures used.</p><p>In a comprehensive review by Bono and Lee, it was reported that although there was a significant increase in the use of various instrumentation systems for spinal fusion surgery, no correlative improvements in fusion rates or clinical outcome was identified.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Potential problems with fusion include pseudoarthrosis and adjacent segment deterioration, although the incidence of clinically significant changes at adjacent segments is not well documented. Additionally, there is not a direct correlation between radiographic fusion and functional outcome. Radiographic fusion rates tend to be greater than the rate of favorable clinical outcome. This may suggest that the rate of fusion determined from radiographs is erroneously high or that clinical outcome may be poor even in patients in whom a technical success of bony union was achieved.</p><p>Joints should allow motion. Motion-retaining spinal implants are intuitively appealing because they provide the potential for motion at the operated segment. Total disc replacement (TDR) has been used in Europe since the mid-1980s<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and the results from the European experience have been favorable,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> even in long-term follow-up of 7 to 10 years.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, these European studies were not designed to be prospective trials using randomization to treatment and control groups. The results of a large prospective trial in the United States comparing the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc (DePuy Spine, Raynham, Mass) to anterior lumbar interbody fusion found that TDR was similar to, or better than, fusion.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Preliminary results with 6- month follow-up in a study comparing ProDisc-L (Synthes Spine, West Chester, Pa) to combined anterior&#x02013;posterior fusion had similar results.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The purpose of our study was to analyze results of TDR with ProDisc-L during 24- to 36-month followup in a prospective, randomized trial. This trial compared this treatment to combined anterior&#x02013;posterior fusion at 1 or 2 disc levels in the treatment of symptomatic disc degeneration unresponsive to nonoperative management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This report presents data from the largest-enrolling single center participating in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x02013;regulated investigational device exemption trial evaluating ProDisc-L. At each site, the first 3 patients enrolled received the ProDisc-L. Thereafter, patients were randomized to either ProDisc-L or a combined anterior&#x02013;posterior instrumented fusion. The randomization was performed according to a 2:1 ratio of ProDisc-L to fusion procedures. Separate randomization tables were used for the single- and double-level procedures. The study was approved by the governing institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>At the time of this report, 157 patients enrolled in the trial had completed 24- to 36-month follow-up. A description of the study population is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. This group included 3 training cases who received ProDisc-L, 89 randomized cases (59 to ProDisc-L, 30 to fusion), and 65 continued-access patients (continued access is a separate phase of the FDA investigational device exemption study that allows ongoing enrollment of patients to receive the investigational device after enrollment in the randomized phase has been completed). The continued-access patients were included in the current study because their selection criteria were identical to those of the randomized study. The data from 1 patient randomized to ProDisc-L were deleted from the analysis. In this patient with 2-level disease, a ProDisc-L was implanted at the L5&#x02013;S1 level. Upon preparing the L4&#x02013;L5 level, a large cyst was discovered in the L4 vertebral body. It was opted to do a circumferential fusion at this level. The number of levels operated, as well as the specific levels operated in the 2 surgery groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Thirty-six month follow-up data were available for a subgroup of 48 patients.

At no time were the mean scores worse for TDR than for fusion. The proportion of patients responding that they would have the same surgery again was significantly greater among the TDR patients at most of the follow-up periods.</p><p>The results of the VAS pain scores and ODI questionnaire in this study were very similar to those in the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc trial reported by Blumenthal et al. in the multicenter investigational device exemption trial for that device, which involved 304 patients with 24-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>Our study demonstrated that significant improvement was noted at the initial 6-week follow-up visit and was consistently maintained throughout the remainder of the 36-month followup. In a recent report by Tropiano et al. that investigated the 7- to 11-year outcome, mean 8.7 years, of TDR with the ProDisc-L device in France, significantly improved back pain, leg pain, and functional scores were found at the long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These authors reported that no device-related complications occurred during the study. In a study of minimum 10-year follow-up of the Charit&#x000e9; device, Lemaire et al. used a relative gain analysis from pre- to postoperative status to determine long-term outcome.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> They reported 62% of patients with an excellent result and an additional 28% of patients with good outcomes.</p><p>Blood loss, operating time, and length of hospital stay were all significantly less in the ProDisc-L group than in the fusion group. This is likely attributable to the inclusion of an instrumented posterior procedure in the fusion group. The fact that similarto- superior results were obtained in the TDR group without requiring a posterior procedure would appear to lend support to the use of these devices.</p><p>Our study was based on the 24- to 36-month follow-up of patients enrolled in a prospective, randomized study comparing TDR with ProDisc-L to combined anterior&#x02013;posterior fusion at 1 or 2 levels in the lumbar spine. The results of this noninferiority study found that TDR produced outcomes no worse than, and in some cases superior to, outcomes for fusion, the traditional treatment for symptomatic disc degeneration unresponsive to nonoperative management. Disc replacement was associated with significantly less blood loss, operative time, and hospital stay. During the long-term follow-up, there was no indication of results deteriorating. These findings suggest that TDR is a viable treatment for symptomatic disc degeneration and maintains acceptable results in multiyear follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><bio id="d35e68"><p>One or more of the authors or the institutions with which they are affiliated has the following disclosures: consulting agreement, funding for travel to lecture, and research and education support from the manufacturer of the ProDisc (Synthes, West Chester, Pa), and has received funding in excess of $1000.</p></bio><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fritzell</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagg</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Wessberg</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Lumbar fusion versus nonsurgical treatment for chronic low back pain: a multicenter randomized controlled trial from the Swedish Lumbar Spine Study Group</article-title><source>Spine.</source><year>2001</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>2521</fpage><lpage>2532</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11725230</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bono</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Critical analysis of trends in fusion for degenerative disc disease over the past 20 years: influence of technique on fusion rate and clinical outcome</article-title><source>Spine.</source><year>2004</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>455</fpage><lpage>463</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15094543</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>B&#x000fc;ttner-Janz</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><source>The Development of the Artificial Disc: SB Charit&#x000e9;</source><year>1992</year><publisher-loc>Dallas, Texas</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Hundley &#x00026;
