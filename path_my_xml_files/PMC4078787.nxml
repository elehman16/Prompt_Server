Disease progression, patterns of decline and death are somewhat predictable. Knowing one's life expectancy and planning care may afford opportunities to prepare for the end of life (EOL) and ensure care is consistent with patients&#x02019; values. Thus timely doctor/patient communication about prognosis and EOL issues is vital.</p><p>Advance Care Planning (ACP) can guide such communication. This process involves discussion between a patient, their family and clinicians to clarify and reflect on values, treatment preferences and goals to develop a shared understanding of how EOL care should proceed.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Discussing the patient's prognosis often forms a component of ACP. This can clarify the timing and progression of the patient's decline and focus communication on how to balance goals of care. Such discussions may reduce aggressive EOL medical care and associated costs,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> increase early hospice referral,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> increase patient and caregiver satisfaction with care and improve quality of life (QOL) and survival.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a nurse-led communication support programme (CSP) for patients with advanced cancer and their primary informal caregiver. It is structured around a purpose-designed Question Prompt List (QPL) highlighting the value of early discussion of prognosis and EOL care. The intervention seeks to improve communication between patients, caregivers and oncologists regarding these issues and open dialogue regarding ACP. This article describes the rationale, evidence base and theoretical foundations and structure of the CSP, together with details of study outcomes, hypotheses, measures and administration protocols. Planned analyses, ethical considerations and dissemination will also be discussed.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Communication about prognosis and EOL issues</title><p>Communicating about prognosis and EOL issues can be challenging for doctors and patients. Doctors&#x02019; avoidance of life-expectancy discussions is common,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> often for fear of destroying hope or the therapeutic relationship.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Patients&#x02019; readiness to discuss such issues is variable, and depends on factors including degree and length of exposure to their disease, having time to adjust to the cancer diagnosis, coping style and spirituality.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Death anxiety may also trigger defence mechanisms such as denial or avoidance to minimise anxiety and distance the mortality threat.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> Consequently, doctors and patients may &#x02018;collude&#x02019; to avoid these discussions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Communication about EOL care often first occurs near death during acute hospital admissions,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> when critical decisions about chemotherapy and aggressive life support may have been made. Research suggests as few as 14% of doctors know patients&#x02019; preferences regarding pain management or place of death,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and many patients receiving palliative chemotherapy do not understand its non-curative intent.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Hence, such discussions can be too late or of poor quality.</p><p>Evidence suggests that EOL discussions do not increase anxiety<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and a lack of information may heighten anxiety by raising patients&#x02019; suspicions that doctors are withholding potentially frightening information.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While the majority of patients with incurable cancer indicate they want prognostic and EOL care discussions,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> prognostic information is not universally desired. Eliciting preferences can be complex and may impact subsequent EOL care discussions although patients&#x02019; EOL priorities often relate to effective communication. One study found that patients&#x02019; highest ranked attributes of a good death included to &#x02018;have a nurse with whom one feels comfortable&#x02019;, &#x02018;know what to expect about one's physical condition&#x02019;, &#x02018;have someone who will listen&#x02019;, &#x02018;trust one's physician&#x02019;, &#x02018;have physician with whom one can discuss fears&#x02019;, &#x02018;know that one's physician is comfortable talking about death and dying&#x02019; and &#x02018;feel prepared to die&#x02019;.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Self-determination theory</title><p>An ethical imperative to open prognostic disclosure and early EOL discussions is the principle of patient autonomy; that patients have the right to information about their body and to contribute to decisions about their medical care if they wish.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The self-determination theory of health-related behaviour change<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> suggests that autonomy is not only a basic human right, but that meeting patients&#x02019; needs for autonomy, as well as for competence and relatedness, enhances engagement in care and maintenance of outcomes. Thus it is critical to address patient and health professional barriers to EOL communication, and to involve patients in tailoring communication to best suit their needs.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Caregiver involvement</title><p>Family caregivers play a crucial role in the EOL care of patients with advanced disease. Beyond providing physical support, caregivers may act as medical decision surrogates in a formal or informal capacity. Caregivers often do not receive sufficient information regarding patient disease status and prognosis from clinicians or discuss EOL care preferences with patients and adequately prepare for surrogate decision-making.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This may hinder their ability to make appropriate decisions regarding patient care. Patients and caregivers also have somewhat divergent information needs as the patient's illness progresses, with caregivers preferring more information and patients less.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Appropriate EOL communication has also been associated with better caregiver bereavement outcomes, less aggressive patient treatment patterns and better QOL.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Interventions to improve communication at the EOL</title><p>Evaluations of interventions to improve communication with patients with advanced cancer have focused on impacting patient or doctor behaviours separately or the shared health communication environment. Few have targeted or involved caregivers or family. Patient interventions have generally focused on providing tools, such as QPLs, or training to increase assertiveness in meeting communication needs. QPLs are evidence-based lists of questions grouped into themes, which patients and/or caregivers are encouraged to ask their clinician. QPLs are often valued for showing the range of topics for discussion, assisting with question formulation and highlighting clinicians&#x02019; willingness to discuss all subjects.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref></p><p>Our group evaluated the impact of giving patients a QPL in the first, second or third palliative care consultation in an RCT.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Compared with controls, patients and caregivers who received a QPL asked twice as many questions, particularly about prognosis and EOL issues, provided the doctor endorsed question asking. Intervention patients&#x02019; question asking increased by 1.6 times with any endorsement of question asking from the doctor, and by 5.8 times if there was more extensive endorsement. Fewer intervention patients had unmet information needs about the future, the area of greatest unmet information need. No intervention effect was observed for satisfaction with care or anxiety and outcomes such as patient QOL, actual care and caregiver outcomes were not assessed.</p><p>In another study, patients with a QPL endorsed by their clinician were significantly less anxious after the consultation and recalled significantly more information about treatment issues and side effects than patients with a QPL alone.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Notably, when physicians did not endorse the QPL, patients asked no more questions than controls highlighting the role of clinicians in determining the success of patient interventions.</p><p>Doctor interventions typically focus on communication skills training. Back <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> reported in a pre&#x02013;post study that communication skills training for oncology fellows improved skills in breaking bad news and discussing transitions to palliative care. The impact on patients of these changes was not assessed and the intervention was a 4-day residential workshop, which may not feasible for many busy clinicians.</p><p>Interventions targeting the shared health communication environment have evaluated the efficacy of a communication broker who, trusted by the oncologist and patient, can help both parties in clarifying and communicating assumptions and expectations. The seminal SUPPORT study<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> involved an RCT of a nurse-led intervention for hospitalised patients with life-limiting illnesses including advanced cancer. A trained nurse had several contacts with patients, family, physicians and hospital staff to elicit patient preferences, improve understanding of outcomes and facilitate ACP. No improvement in patient&#x02013;physician communication or outcomes including incidence or timing of DNR orders, physicians&#x02019; knowledge of patients&#x02019; resuscitation preferences, days in intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation receipt, use of hospital resources or patients being comatose before death was seen. Specific communication tools to assist patients were not utilised and physicians were not directly targeted with communication skills training or question-asking endorsement cues, which may have reduced its impact.</p><p>In summary, external prompts normalising and placing EOL issues on the consultation agenda may be beneficial, together with efforts to improve patients&#x02019; and caregivers&#x02019; self-efficacy in meeting their information and involvement needs. Providing patients with cancer and caregivers with a preconsultation QPL may be helpful, combined with improving doctors&#x02019; endorsement of question asking. An outside communication broker coaching patients and caregivers to clarify their questions and concerns, improving their skills in requesting information during consultations and empowering them to do so may further improve communication. Given time burdens inherent in residential training workshops for clinicians and the potential for QPLs with endorsement to improve patients&#x02019; ability to get their information needs met, a doctor-endorsed QPL amplified by nurse-led communication support and information about EOL issues has promise. This powerful combination has never previously been evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Current investigation</title><p>Building on this literature, an intervention targeting patients and caregivers with the aim to improve doctor&#x02013;patient&#x02013;caregiver communication about prognosis and EOL issues will be evaluated. The intervention targets patients and caregivers prior to patients becoming critically ill and unable to communicate their preferences and wishes. The intervention seeks to influence the three areas identified by self-determination theory as being crucial for patients to enact and maintain ACP behaviours<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

The intervention is intended for use when patients have a year or less to live.</p><p>Patients and caregivers participate as dyads. Patients can participate without a caregiver; however caregivers cannot participate without a corresponding patient participant. Patients and caregivers complete questionnaires following consent, are randomised and participate in intervention or control conditions, allow one regular oncology follow-up consultation to be audio recorded, and complete follow-up questionnaires at regular intervals until the patient's death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005745F1">figure 1</xref>). Additionally, patients&#x02019; medical records are reviewed and caregivers are invited to participate in a structured interview following the patient's death.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005745F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005745f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Currently practicing medical oncologists at participating hospitals are requested to refer consecutive eligible patients to the research team after briefly mentioning the goals of the study and seeking verbal approval to release their contact details.</p><p>Patients are eligible if they have been diagnosed with any type of cancer and their medical oncologist believes they have a life expectancy of between 2 and 12&#x02005;months. Caregivers are eligible if they are identified as the primary, informal providers of care to a patient participating in the trial. Patients and caregivers must read and speak English well enough to be interviewed and complete questionnaires without the aid of an interpreter, be over the age of 18&#x02005;years and be capable of giving informed consent. Patients and caregivers will be excluded if they do not speak English or have significant psychological morbidity or cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Oncologist referrers are informed about the study at departmental meetings or via a letter from the study investigators. Those who agree to refer are given all necessary information and consent forms, questionnaires and referral documents. Referrers identify patients who fit the study inclusion criteria, inform them about the study during a consultation, provide relevant study information and refer interested patients to a research nurse following the consultation. Referrers will receive regular prompts from study personnel to review their patient lists for potentially suitable participants and such opportunities will be used to discuss the ongoing challenges with referral and potential solutions. Regular study newsletters including updates on recruitment targets will also be sent to referrers to foster engagement in the study.</p><p>The research nurse explains the study in further detail and provides patients who agree to participate with information and consent forms, baseline questionnaires and a reply paid envelope to return completed study documents. If the research nurse is not present during consulting hours, the referrer sends the patient's contact details to the research team after obtaining verbal consent for the referral. A member of the research team then contacts the patient to explain the study and post the study documents to those willing to participate. The patient is requested to complete and return the forms as soon as possible by reply paid post.</p><p>Patients are told that caregivers are encouraged to participate and asked to identify the family member or friend who assists them most often with their healthcare. If a caregiver is present at the point of referral and the patient is willing for their caregiver to be involved, information about participation is provided. If no caregiver is present at the point of referral but a caregiver is nominated, a member of the research team contacts the caregiver by phone to explain the study, obtain consent and post questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients and caregivers are randomised as dyads, with the patient as the unit of randomisation, stratified by the oncologist. Patients are randomised alone if they do not nominate a caregiver or if their nominated caregiver declines. Patients and dyads are randomised immediately following receipt of consent and baseline data.</p><p>A computer-generated random number table&#x000a0;is used to generate 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 balanced randomisation code blocks for each referring oncologist. Odd numbers will indicate control arm assignment and even numbers will indicate intervention arm assignment. Each code is placed in an individual, sequentially numbered, opaque envelope. Once consent and baseline questionnaires are received, the research manager, blinded to participant identity, opens the next envelope in sequence for the referring oncologist to determine randomisation. The research staff member responsible for contacting the participant is informed of the outcome and initiates the next steps of participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Nurse role and training</title><p>The intervention places primary emphasis on communication about prognosis, general EOL issues and ACP. The programme is delivered by a senior nurse who has experience in cancer care and highly developed communication skills, affording them the best opportunity to understand and relate to the experiences of patients with advanced cancer. The role of the nurse is to assist and empower patients and their caregivers to communicate with their healthcare team regarding goals, wishes, needs, concerns and questions about life expectancy and EOL issues. The nurse will not answer questions about the patient's health or individual situation but will encourage them to direct those questions to their healthcare team.</p><p>The nurse receives specific training to deliver the programme. This training involves review of a standardised training manual describing the rationale, goals and specific tasks involved in completing the intervention, followed by role-play exercises conducted with a simulated patient and directed by a researcher well versed in such training methods. Role-play exercises aim to progressively build confidence and competence in delivery and adherence to the intervention protocol. Training takes approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;h per nurse, depending on the trainee's level of existing communication skills.</p><p>The study manager will regularly review recordings of sessions delivered by each trained nurse to ensure adherence to the programme delivery protocol. Any problems with adherence or programme delivery will be discussed at fortnightly meetings between the trained nurses and study manager. Nurses will also be offered the opportunity for debriefing and peer supervision with a senior psychologist as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Communication Support Programme</title><p>The CSP was informed by the self-determination theory of health-related behaviour change. In line with previous research describing ACP as a process of health behaviour change,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> discussion of prognosis, EOL care and ACP were characterised as health-related behaviours impacting EOL QOL. The intervention seeks to influence: (1) &#x02018;Autonomous Motivation&#x02019; to discuss prognosis and EOL care preferences&#x02014;by helping participants identify the value and importance of such discussions, (2) &#x02018;Competence&#x02019; to undertake such discussions&#x02014;by giving participants the skills and tools to engage in discussions and overcome barriers to planning care and (3) social support (relatedness) to participate in such discussions&#x02014;by cueing oncologists to endorse question asking and use of the QPL.</p><p>Two nurses have been trained to deliver the intervention, which consists of two sessions: (1) a face-to-face meeting and (2) a telephone booster session. Face-to-face meetings include a QPL designed for patients with advanced, incurable cancer and their primary informal caregivers.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This includes questions related to factors identified as important at EOL by patients, family, physicians and clinicians<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and suggested and developed by an expert panel.

The study will assess whether this intervention increases patients&#x02019; and caregivers&#x02019; self-efficacy in asserting their information needs, and whether this translates into increased expression of information needs and thus more information from their oncologist. Provision of tailored information may improve patient and caregiver understanding of prognosis,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and result in a greater likelihood of effective and timely ACP with corresponding improvements in QOL outcomes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref> Ultimately, it is hoped that this intervention will result in patients receiving EOL care that is more concordant with their preferences and values.</p><p>The brevity of the intervention, together with the incorporation of multiple previously successful intervention types are strengths that may yield a substantial impact. This study has the potential to provide a mechanism for assisting patients, health professionals and caregivers in communicating about, understanding and acting on patient preferences to ensure quality EOL care. We plan to publish the main trial outcomes related to communication and satisfaction in a single paper, with additional papers exploring the impact of the intervention and any changes in communication on care, QOL and quality of death. Further in-depth analyses of the implementation of this intervention and responses to its content will also be published and findings will be presented at various national and international conferences.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the input and support of our study nurses Frances Bellemore and Andrew Metcalfe.
