For the participants who demonstrated any compliance (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;133, 85%), the results were generally consistent with the fully compliant group at 3 months, but the treatment effect was smaller. The difference in mean change in RMDQ score between randomised groups was &#x02212;2.45 (95% CI &#x02212;3.67 to &#x02212;1.24) for CACE analysis, &#x02212;2.30 (95% CI &#x02212;3.43 to 1.17) for per-protocol analysis and &#x02212;2.15 (95% CI &#x02212;3.25 to &#x02212;1.06) for on-treatment analysis, which was slightly less than that for ITT analysis.

When examining compliance, CACE analysis is more rigorous than per-protocol and on-treatment analyses. Using CACE analysis, the treatment effect was larger in participants who complied with treatment compared with participants who were allocated to treatment, and the difference between ITT and CACE analyses for the fully compliant group at 3 months was small but clinically important. Per-protocol and on-treatment analyses may produce unreliable estimates when the effect of treatment is small.</p></sec><sec><title>International Standard Randomised Trial Number Register</title><p>ISRCTN 81079604.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Compliance effects</kwd><kwd>CACE analysis</kwd><kwd>Per-protocol analysis</kwd><kwd>On-treatment analysis</kwd><kwd>Yoga</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is widely recommended and the accepted method for analysing outcome data in randomised controlled trials. In ITT analysis, all patient data are analysed in the original group to which they were randomised, irrespective of whether or not they completed the full treatment or intervention on offer. ITT analysis therefore allows comparison of the effectiveness of treatment(s) offered rather than treatment(s) received, and is useful to policy makers who need to make a decision about whether to make a treatment available based on its effectiveness. ITT analysis reflects what would actually happen in clinical practice. However, if patients do not complete the full treatment, ITT analysis underestimates the treatment effect in patients who complied, and therefore does not answer the question &#x02018;What is the effect of the treatment in individuals who comply with treatment?&#x02019;. Other analyses may be considered to address the problem of non-compliance in trials <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Per-protocol analysis only compares the data for participants who complied with their randomised treatment (i.e. data for patients who did not comply are excluded). On-treatment analysis compares the data for participants by the treatment they received, regardless of the group to which they were randomised. In both these analyses, the effects of randomisation are lost, which can potentially introduce bias and consequently threaten the internal validity of the results. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> advises that, in cases where per-protocol analysis is reported, it should be described as a &#x02018;non-randomised, observational comparison&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0010 bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. On-treatment analysis is not discussed in CONSORT, but the present authors believe that the principles for per-protocol analysis should apply.</p><p>An alternative to per-protocol and on-treatment analyses, which respects randomisation, is complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis. CACE analysis is a measure of the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on the people who received it as intended by the original group allocation. In this analysis, compliers in the intervention group are compared with a like-for-like group in the control group. As CACE analysis retains the initial randomisation, it overcomes the problems faced by per-protocol and on-treatment analyses.</p><p>A recent randomised trial of yoga for chronic low back pain, conducted by the authors, compared 12 classes of a specialised programme of yoga plus usual general practitioner (GP) care with usual GP care <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. One hundred and fifty-six participants were randomised to yoga plus usual GP care and 157 participants were randomised to usual GP care alone. Full compliance was predefined as attendance of at least three of the first six classes and at least three other classes <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Ninety-three (60%) participants were fully compliant, 40 (26%) participants attended at least one class but did not meet the definition of full compliance, and 23 (15%) participants did not attend any classes. Outcomes were analysed and reported using ITT analysis <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but given that 40% of the participants did not comply with the intervention, it was considered that this approach provided a diluted estimate. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of non-compliance in the yoga trial, and compare the treatment effect using three different analyses: per-protocol, on-treatment and CACE analyses. Observational comparisons were included as recent trials have reported using per-protocol analysis <xref rid="bib0030 bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. The results of these analyses were compared with the results of the ITT analysis from the main trial to determine how much ITT analysis underestimated the treatment effect. The yoga trial data provided the opportunity to explore how the data responded under different analyses. It was predicted that CACE analysis would provide a more reliable and conservative estimate of treatment effect than per-protocol and on-treatment analyses, as random allocation is ignored in the latter two types of analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec0010"><title>Methods</title><p>Full details of the trial have been reported elsewhere <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Briefly, participants were recruited from primary care from five areas of the UK. Eligible participants were randomised equally to receive 12 classes of a specialised programme of yoga plus usual GP care or usual GP care alone. All participants remained under the care of their GP and received usual National Health Service treatments, such as GP consultations, prescribed painkillers and referral to physiotherapy <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Both groups received a copy of &#x02018;The back book&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Eligible participants completed postal questionnaires at baseline, 3 months (immediately post intervention), 6 months and 12 months. The main outcome was back function, measured using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> at 3-month follow-up. Data on class attendance were collected from class registers, and details of home practice were collected from the postal questionnaires. Allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up, the authors sought to recruit 262 participants (131 in each group) <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In total, 313 participants were recruited.</p><sec id="sec0015"><title>Definition of full compliance</title><p>Full compliance was predefined as attendance of at least three of the first six classes and at least three other classes <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. At the initial trial design phase, the designer of the &#x02018;Yoga for Healthy Lower Backs&#x02019; programme (AT) and the other yoga consultants (AS and JDA) estimated that if participants adhered to these minimum criteria, they could be said to have &#x02018;received sufficient yoga&#x02019; as a self-management toolkit that would be likely to show long-term improvements, rather than just having been &#x02018;offered some yoga&#x02019; for short-term relief. The course involved 12 classes that gradually and progressively introduced participants to more complex &#x02013; but nevertheless still gentle and suitable for beginners &#x02013; yoga by building on previous knowledge and skills. However, the definition was subjective and the exact level at which the programme might be effective could not be known. All participants allocated to the yoga group received a relaxation CD regardless of whether or not they attended a class. Participants who attended at least one class were given a yoga manual with details on how to practice the yoga and how to take care of their backs, and therefore had the opportunity to practice the yoga at home. Therefore, the analysis was re-run using &#x02018;any compliance&#x02019;, defined as attendance of one or more classes. It was estimated that this would provide a more conservative estimate of treatment effect compared with the participants who were fully compliant. The opportunity for contamination in this trial was minimised as the yoga programme was not available outside of the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="sec0025"><title>ITT analysis</title><p>The findings from the main trial using an ITT analysis, which are reported here for comparison with the results of the other analyses, were taken directly from the published paper <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Indeed, there was a pattern to suggest that, on average, there was an additional beneficial effect of yoga for each class attended. The randomisation process ensures balance across groups, and it was expected that there would be participants in both groups whose backs improved to a smaller or larger degree. In the on-treatment analysis, the data for the individuals who did not comply (i.e. did not attend any classes) were moved to the control group and therefore the balance achieved by the randomisation process was lost. ITT analysis suggests that the treatment effect would be at its greatest immediately after the intervention (3 months). There was a difference in the mean change score of &#x02212;1.13 between CACE and ITT analyses, favouring CACE analysis, for the participants who were fully compliant at 3 months, which is at the bottom of the range of what is recognised as clinically important <xref rid="bib0080 bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. No other comparisons with ITT analysis with 3- and 12-month data gave clinically important differences.</p><p>It was anticipated that the effect sizes calculated using per-protocol and on-treatment analyses would be larger than those using CACE and ITT analyses, as the former two analyses are likely to produce more biased estimates. However, this effect was only observed when the treatment effect was smaller (i.e. in the participants who demonstrated any compliance at 12 months). Indeed, on-treatment analysis was not as predicted for the participants who demonstrated any compliance at 3 months. Whilst the effect size was very close to the other estimates, it was slightly less than that for ITT analysis. Again, this might be explained by a smaller effect size producing a biased estimate.</p><p>Apart from the participants who demonstrated any compliance at 12 months, CACE analysis gave a larger treatment effect but the differences between CACE, per-protocol and on-treatment analyses were small. The largest difference in treatment effect was observed between ITT and CACE analyses in participants who were fully compliant, which indicates that ITT analysis estimated a smaller treatment effect in participants who comply and this was only clinically important at 3 months.</p><sec id="sec0095"><title>Comparison with other trials estimating compliance</title><p>A review of the literature revealed few trials evaluating musculoskeletal conditions that reported per-protocol analysis and none that reported CACE analysis. A trial of Iyengar yoga therapy for low back pain undertook a per-protocol analysis in addition to ITT analysis <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Per-protocol analysis showed greater improvements in back function, as measured by the Oswald Disability Index, compared with ITT analysis at both follow-ups. A trial of the Alexander technique reported no &#x02018;meaningful change in the results&#x02019; when only those participants who adhered were included, but this trial did not describe the analysis nor report the results <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A trial comparing manual therapy and exercise therapy in osteoarthritis of the hip or knee conducted per-protocol and ITT analyses. However, uncertainty about the accuracy of the data from the self-reported measure of compliance meant that the authors expressed caution in interpreting the results <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0100"><title>Strengths</title><p>This was a large trial, and by collecting data on compliance, it was possible to estimate the effect of the intervention for participants who were compliant using different approaches. The study found that the different approaches give different but similar results, and that ITT analysis generally provides a more conservative treatment effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec0105"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study definition of &#x02018;any compliance&#x02019; was subjective and very conservative. Participants were considered to be compliant if they had attended at least one session, as all participants attending at least one class would have had the opportunity to practice yoga at home. However, whilst some participants who had attended no sessions did practice yoga at home, the general finding was that the greater number of classes attended, with the exception of those attending 12 classes, the more likely participants were to report practising yoga at home. Therefore, whilst ITT analysis was found to estimate a slightly smaller treatment effect for yoga in participants who attended one or more sessions, the estimates produced by the other analyses varied according to the definition of compliance.</p><p>In future, in studies where non-compliance might be an issue, consideration should be given to include CACE analysis. In the present trial, measures were taken to reduce non-compliance, such as asking participants to indicate which classes and times they could attend. However, non-compliance was still observed for a variety of reasons. For future trials of group yoga sessions, trialists may also want to consider inflating power calculations to take account of low compliance, so that a more accurate estimate of treatment effect can be obtained by ITT analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0110"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>When examining the effect of treatment on participants who were compliant, CACE analysis is the only approach that respects randomisation. Per-protocol and on-treatment analyses are more likely to produce biased estimates than CACE analysis, and CACE analysis showed a larger beneficial treatment effect in all but one of the analyses. However, differences in treatment effect between CACE, per-protocol and on-treatment analyses were small. In CACE analysis, the treatment effect was larger in participants who complied with treatment compared with participants allocated to treatment; and the difference between ITT and CACE analyses at 3 months for participants who were fully compliant was clinically important, although small. Per-protocol and on-treatment analyses may produce unreliable estimates when the effect of treatment is small. CACE analysis could be considered in trials in which compliance with treatment is low. In anticipation of such cases, trialists should consider a definition of compliance at the start of the trial.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
