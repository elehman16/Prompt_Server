One or two additional doses of 0.5 mg/kg propofol were given if modified Ramsay Sedation Score (mRSS) was &#x0003c;5. Number of patients requiring additional doses were noted.

Various short-acting hypnotics such as methohexitone, diazepam, thiopentone, propofol, and etomidate have been used for this procedure, but side effects such as apnea, drowsiness, or excitation were often observed.</p><p>Propofol is one of the most commonly used drugs for sedation in patients requiring elective cardioversion.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, propofol may lead to patient recall and discomfort because it does not possess any analgesic property. Addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol may lead to a lesser incidence of patient recall. Besides, it may lead to more patient comfort due to some analgesic property. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine may have a propofol sparing effect. Dexmedetomidine has also been shown to have an antiarrhythmic effect in various studies,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which may lower the requirement of additional cardioversions.</p><p>Hence, the addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol for elective cardioversion could be advantageous to the patient in more ways than one and result in better patient outcome.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as an additive to propofol for sedation in cardiac patients undergoing elective cardioversion in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to assess whether addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol for sedation in elective cardioversion would have any additional benefit to the patient in terms of recall and discomfort, without having any respiratory or hemodynamic compromise.</p><p>The secondary objective of this study was to assess whether addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol for sedation in elective cardioversion would lead to a lesser requirement of subsequent cardioversions with a propofol sparing effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, this prospective double-blind randomized control study was conducted in a 650-bedded cardiac institute. Written informed consent was taken from 500 hemodynamically stable patients undergoing elective cardioversion for supraventricular arrhythmias in the Cardiac ICU over a period of 1 year. Patients presenting in emergency or in cardiac failure were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized into two groups on the basis of computer-generated randomization table:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 250): Patients in Group 1 were given dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg) over 10 min, before giving propofol (1 mg/kg)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 250): Patients in Group 2 were given saline over 10 min and then were given propofol (1 mg/kg).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A person unrelated to the study would prepare dexmedetomidine or saline as per computer-generated randomization table in an unlabeled syringe and would give the syringe to the anesthesiologist. Modified Ramsay Sedation Score (mRSS) was noted after 1 min of giving propofol in either group.</p><p>mRSS was assessed as follows:</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Grade Patient response</title><p>0 - Paralyzed, unable to evaluate</p><p>1 - Awake</p><p>2 - Lightly sedated</p><p>3 - Moderately sedated, follows simple commands</p><p>4 - Deeply sedated, responds to nonpainful stimuli</p><p>5 - Deeply sedated, responds only to painful stimuli</p><p>6 - Deeply sedated, unresponsive to painful stimuli.</p><p>An additional dose of 0.5 mg/kg propofol was given to the patient if mRSS was &#x0003c;5. After giving the additional dose of propofol, mRSS was again assessed after 1 min. A second additional dose of 0.5 mg/kg propofol was administered if mRSS was &#x0003c;5. The number of patients requiring one or two additional doses of propofol was noted in each group.</p><p>Hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure [MAP] &#x00026; heart rate [HR]), SpO<sub>2</sub>, and mRSS were monitored every 5 min till 2 h of giving cardioversion.</p><p>Any hemodynamic or respiratory compromise along with the mean time to recovery (mRSS = 1) was recorded. Hemodynamic compromise was defined as a fall in MAP &#x0003e;20% of the baseline. Respiratory compromise was defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;94%, which may or may not require assisted ventilation with bag and mask.</p><p>Patient recall and patient discomfort were noted. Patients were asked regarding recall and discomfort after full recovery to mRSS = 1. For assessing discomfort, the patient was asked to complete a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) in response to the question: &#x0201c;How much discomfort did you feel with the sedation?&#x0201d; with zero being the highest level of discomfort and 10 being completely comfortable.</p><p>For assessing recall, the patient was asked a validated awareness questionnaire[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which included the following questions:</p><p>
