It is caused by pollen dispersal in the early spring from Japanese cedar and cypress trees throughout Japan, which release a massive amount of pollen. In Japan, the prevalence of JC pollinosis increased by &#x0223c;10% over 10 years from 16.2% in 1998 to 26.5% in 2008<sup><xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In 2008, the prevalence of JC pollinosis was 33.1&#x02013;39.1% among adults in each decade from the 20s to the 50s, 31.4% in teenagers and 13.7% in children aged 5&#x02013;10 years<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The prevalence of JC pollinosis in children appears to be much higher than that of allergic rhinitis, which was reported as 10% or less in children aged 6&#x02013;7 and &#x0223c;15% in those aged 13&#x02013;14 years<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>In Japan, the pollen season usually starts in early February and ends between mid-March and early April. JC pollinosis causes nasal and ocular symptoms that can significantly influence the quality-of-life (QoL)<sup><xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and it is important to initiate treatment before or at the start of the pollen season to prevent the development of symptoms. Accordingly, the Japanese guideline for nasal allergy recommends initiation of prophylactic therapy before or early in the pollen season<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Leukotrienes dilate vessels in the nasal mucosa<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, increase vascular permeability<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and promote the migration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and macrophages<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></sup>. Thus, leukotrienes are important chemical mediators of allergic rhinitis, suggesting that usefulness of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></sup>. Clinical studies have shown that LTRAs are as effective as antihistamines for pollinosis<sup><xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that initiating prophylactic LTRA therapy before or early in the pollen season can prevent symptoms of pollinosis<sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref></sup>.</p><p>The LTRA pranlukast is effective for perennial allergic rhinitis in adults<sup><xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. It is also superior to placebo as prophylactic therapy for pollinosis<sup><xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, pranlukast has an immediate effect against exposure to pollen in an artificial exposure chamber (OHIO chamber), improving the early and late phases of nasal obstruction<sup><xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and inhibits priming for pollinosis<sup><xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, pranlukast dry syrup (PLK-DS) is more effective than placebo for preventing nasal obstruction in children with pollinosis tested in an OHIO chamber<sup><xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, this study was performed to determine the efficacy of prophylactic therapy with PLK-DS vs placebo for JC pollinosis in children by investigating the inhibitory effect on priming for pollinosis and on the response to pollen exposure (both controlled exposure in an OHIO chamber and natural exposure during the pollen season).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S8"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0008-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study enrolled 30 children with JC pollinosis who met the following inclusion criteria: aged from 10 years to younger than 15 years, class 2&#x02013;6 when multiple antigen testing was performed to detect specific IgE antibodies for JC pollen in serum, a history of nasal symptoms with nasal obstruction following exposure to JC pollen in an OHIO chamber, development and exacerbation of nasal symptoms with nasal obstruction during the annual JC pollen season, and those determined to be eligible by an investigator or sub-investigator when clinical examination was done before the start of the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: any lesion of the nasal or ocular mucosa, use of parenteral corticosteroids within 6 months before obtaining informed consent, nasal disease (deviation of the nasal septum, nasal polyps, etc.), systemic disease (asthma, tuberculosis, etc.), a history of anaphylaxis, a history of hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the test drug, current immunotherapy (hyposensitization therapy or allassotherapy), and any other reason that made patients ineligible for this study according to the investigator. We specified two persons who were responsible for patient enrollment (K.H. and S.M). It was also pre-determined that if they could not reach a consensus as to whether to include/exclude a child, an independent researcher (Dr Minoru Gotoh, Nippon Medical School Tama Nagayama Hospital, Tokyo, Japan) would be consulted to make the final decision.</p><p>The subjects received a detailed explanation of this study and possible adverse reactions to the test drug, and their parents or guardians provided informed consent. The study was performed at Medical Corporation Shinanokai Samoncho Clinic according to the ethical guidelines in the protocol and the Declaration of Helsinki (2000) after receiving approval from the ethics committee of the clinic.

The investigational drugs included PLK-DS (10% pranlukast) and placebo, which were confirmed to be indistinguishable from each other. In late January 2013, 30 participants were selected based on the results of skin tests with JC pollen. For the skin test, a skin prick test was performed. When &#x02018;the test site showed a wheal of at least 5&#x02009;mm surrounded by at least 10&#x02009;mm of erythema&#x02019;, the judgment was positive. According to the schedule shown in <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, the participants received PLK-DS or placebo twice a day (after breakfast and after dinner) for 2 months from February 1, which was expected to be before the start of the JC pollen season, through the peak pollen season until March 31.</p><fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study schedule.

In fact, a very low level of pollen dispersion occurs before the official start of the pollen season, and some patients develop symptoms before the starting date.</p><p>Early in the JC pollen season (February 10), subjects were exposed to JC pollen for 3&#x02009;h in an OHIO chamber (JC pollen count: 8000&#x02009;grains/m<sup>3</sup>)<sup><xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref></sup>. Before the JC pollen season (January 24) and during the pollen season (March 3), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) was measured in nasal discharge samples as an index of inflammation. Extraction of ECP from nasal discharge samples and measurement were done according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations (MESACUP ECP Test: Medical &#x00026; Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan)<sup><xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Concomitant use of the following drugs was not permitted during treatment with the investigational drug: corticosteroids (oral, inhaled, and topical), antihistamines (oral, inhaled, and topical), anti-allergic drugs, leukotriene antagonists, anti-prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>/thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> drugs, vasoconstrictors, anticholinergics, and other drugs that could affect evaluation of efficacy. However, if a patient developed severe symptoms following the start of the pollen season, rescue medications could be used to treat the symptoms (including Intal Nasal Spray 2%, Intal Ophthalmic Solution 2%, vasoconstrictors, and anticholinergics), provided that the total nasal symptoms score (<xref rid="TB1">Table 1</xref>) was &#x02265;4 points on the previous day. As rescue medication for severe symptoms while patients were in the OHIO chamber or after leaving the chamber, Intal Nasal Spray 2% and/or Intal Ophthalmic Solution 2% could be used if this was determined to be necessary by an investigator or sub-investigator.

Second, prophylaxis with PLK-DS reduced the symptoms caused by exposure to JC pollen in an OHIO chamber during the early part of the pollen season. In particular, PLK-DS prophylaxis reduced nasal discharge and nasal obstruction after controlled exposure to JC pollen in the OHIO chamber. Third, prophylaxis with PLK-DS inhibited an increase of ECP in nasal discharge specimens during the peak pollen season. These findings indicated that PLK-DS prophylaxis was effective for reducing symptoms of pollinosis and nasal inflammation in children with JC pollinosis.</p><p>We previously reported that PLK-DS was effective in children who were exposed to pollen using the OHIO chamber<sup><xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In that study, we measured ECP levels in nasal discharge specimens at the end of pollen exposure, and found that PLK-DS inhibited an increase of ECP<sup><xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Although we demonstrated that PLK-DS suppressed inflammation and pollinosis symptoms, that study was not performed during the pollen season and did not confirm the effect of the drug on natural exposure to pollen. Also, prophylactic therapy is important in children as well as in adults, hence we considered it important to determine the efficacy of PLK-DS prophylaxis in children with pollinosis.</p><p>The pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis is considered to involve minimal chronic inflammation<sup><xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. It is thought that repeated exposure to low levels of antigens causing no symptoms leads to chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. In fact, repeated out-of-season exposure of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis to 1/100 of the antigen dose causing symptoms has been shown to increase histamine and ECP levels in nasal discharge<sup><xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. It was also reported that symptom returned to baseline by 6 weeks after the pollen season, but the levels of interleukin-1, leukotriene, and ECP in nasal discharge remained high<sup><xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Assuming that patients have minimal chronic inflammation, we consider that initiation of prophylactic therapy with anti-inflammatory agents either before or early in the pollen season is a logical method to reduce the deterioration of symptoms and QoL during the pollen season.</p><p>The present placebo-controlled study demonstrated that PLK-DS prophylaxis is useful for children with pollinosis. As has been reported in adults<sup><xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref></sup>, the nasal symptoms scores (especially for nasal obstruction) of the PLK-DS group were significantly lower than those of the placebo group. Since use of PLK-DS as prophylactic therapy in children with pollinosis delays the onset of nasal symptoms as it does in adults<sup><xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and, thus, delays the deterioration of QoL and the need for symptomatic medication, this drug appears to be appropriate for prophylaxis because of its anti-inflammatory effect.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the small sample size, which was probably the reason for the few significant differences between the PLK-DS and placebo groups. Because the maximum number of patients who could fit in the pollen exposure chamber used in this study was 15 and it was important to test all subjects under similar conditions during the pollen season, we limited the number of subjects for this study. In the future, a larger multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study should be performed to confirm the usefulness of PLK-DS as prophylactic therapy for JC pollinosis in children. Another limitation was that the dropout rate was rather high. The five dropouts were due to insufficient entries in the nasal allergy diary. Patients were instructed to make daily entries in this diary before bedtime about the most serious symptoms of that day. The method of evaluation was to calculate the weekly mean score and determine the change from the mean score of the first week. If entries were missed, it could have been possible to calculate the mean value from the remaining data. However, the severity of pollinosis is highly dependent on the amount of pollen dispersed in the atmosphere, and this varies from day to day. We, therefore, considered it inappropriate to calculate the mean score when data were missing.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In children with JC pollinosis, we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of PLK-DS on priming in the early pollen season, as well as inhibition of symptoms caused by controlled exposure to pollen and symptoms during the pollen season. PLK-DS was also shown to suppress an increase of ECP in nasal discharge, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. The present findings suggested that pranlukast dry syrup may be useful for prophylaxis against pollinosis in children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="S12"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>There was no funding for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Declaration of financial/other relationships</title><p>The authors have no specific relationships to declare.
