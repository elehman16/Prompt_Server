Several human studies in patients with chronic HF have shown high levels of circulating cytokines and a clear association with severity (NYHA class) and prognosis of the disease <xref rid="pone.0112359-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-TorreAmione1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Deswal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The role of inflammation in acute HF syndromes is less clear, especially in patients with HF complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). De novo HF in STEMI patients is associated with large myocardial infarctions (MI) and persistent inflammation has been proposed to play a role in infarct expansion and adverse ventricular remodelling that may contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients <xref rid="pone.0112359-Heymans1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, data are lacking from clinical trials on the inflammatory response both regarding the time-course and possible associations to left ventricular function in patients with de novo HF after STEMI. A possible association between inflammation and recovery of myocardial function after a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treated STEMI is also unknown.</p><p>The LEAF (LEvosimendan in Acute heart Failure following myocardial infarction) trial was a randomized, placebo controlled study in patients with de novo HF following a PCI-treated STEMI <xref rid="pone.0112359-Husebye1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The endpoint of this study was improvement in contractility in post-ischemic myocardium, measured as change in wall motion score index (WMSI). Treatment with levosimendan in patients with decompensated HF has been shown to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0112359-Avgeropoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Parissis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Possible anti-inflammatory effects of levosimendan in de novo HF following acute mycordial infarction (AMI) has so far not been adressed in clinical trials.</p><p>The aims of the present substudy were to explore the time-course of the inflammatory response pattern and study possible associations between inflammation and impaired left ventricular (LV) function and myocardial injury. A secondary aim was to investigate wether levosimendan would influence levels of inflammatory markers in patients with acute HF following PCI-treated STEMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; se <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112359.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112359.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.

Patients were included between April 20, 2006 and December 13, 2010 with follow-up completed May 3, 2011. Due to technical reasons (a delay in the registration process with Oslo University Hospital as sponsor) 2 patients were included (April 20, April 25) before the trial was registered at the clinicaltrial.gov (May 10).

Details on study design and main results have recently been published <xref rid="pone.0112359-Husebye1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Briefly, patients were assigned to a 25 h infusion (0.2 &#x000b5;g/kg/min for one h followed by 0.1 &#x000b5;g/kg/min for 24 h) of levosimendan or placebo. Included in the study were patients with acute HF (including patients in cardiogenic shock) complicating a primary PCI treated STEMI. The inclusion criteria were: (1) opening of an occluded or dilation of a stenotic coronary artery presumed to be the infarct related artery, (2) signs of decreased wall-motion in at least three of 16 segments of the left ventricle with echocardiography, (3) clinical HF defined as dyspnoea at rest at screening and at least one of the following signs within 48 h after PCI: pulmonary oedema, signs of marked pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray, need for continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation, and need for i.v. diuretics due to symptoms of congestion or persistent oliguria (urine output &#x0003c;0.5 mL/kg/h) after volume therapy. Additional criteria in the cardiogenic shock subgroup: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003c;90 mmHg after 60 min of adequate volume therapy or SBP between 90 and 100 mmHg in spite of inotropic support by catecholamine infusion and (2) signs of organ hypo-perfusion such as oliguria, cold and clammy extremities or reduced consciousness.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: age&#x0003c;20 years, heart rate&#x0003e;120 beats per minute, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, creatinine&#x0003e;450 &#x000b5;mol/l, severe hepatic failure, significant mechanical outflow obstruction, allergy against study medication or one of its components, anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c;8 g/dl) or pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Blood samples were drawn at the time of inclusion, after 25 h, 2 days, 5 days and 6 weeks for routine analyses and for determination of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R), soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp130), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;). Serum was separated within 1 hour by centrifugation at 2500 g for 10 min and used for all analyses, except MCP-1, which was determined in citrated plasma, stored on ice and separated within 30 min by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C and 3000 g for 20 min to obtain platelet-poor plasma.

A 16-segment model was used where a normally or hyperkinetic contracting segment was assigned a score of 1, hypokinetic 2, akinetic 3 or dyskinetic 4. The WMSI was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of segments scored. Echocardiography was performed at inclusion, after 25 hours, 5 days and 6 weeks. Two experienced echo-cardiographers performed all examinations, and a single observer performed all analyses.

The main finding of the study was that circulating levels of IL-8, measured at the time of inclusion (median 22 h after PCI), were highly associated with improvement in LV function during the first 6 weeks after STEMI. High levels of IL-8 have recently been shown to be associated with adverse clinical outcome in patients with chronic HF <xref rid="pone.0112359-Nymo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We found that high levels of IL-8 were associated with less improvement in LV function during the first 6 weeks after STEMI. Interestingly, this association between IL-8 and recovery of LV function was present without any association to peak TnT or final infarct size after 6 weeks suggesting that IL-8 levels may reflect other aspects of myocardial injury than necrosis. IL-8 plays a fundamental role in regulating neutrophil infiltration in ischemic and reperfused myocardium <xref rid="pone.0112359-Frangogiannis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Activated neutrophils release several factors which can cause tissue and endothelial damage. Additionally, neutrophils can form aggregates that plug capillaries, contributing to microvascular obstruction (MVO) <xref rid="pone.0112359-Niccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. MVO was in an experimental animal model of reperfused infarcted myocardium found to be associated with adverse LV remodelling and segmental function, beyond and independent of infarct size <xref rid="pone.0112359-Gerber1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. MVO has been shown to be associated with reduced myocardial salvage after primary PCI in STEMI patients, and MVO was a stronger predictor of LV remodelling than peak creatine kinase and infarct size <xref rid="pone.0112359-Limalanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Bolognese1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Nijveldt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It therefore seems that MVO may be associated with LV remodelling and impaired function also by mechanisms not related to myocardial necrosis and infarct size alone. Hypothetically, IL-8 may, by its effects on neutrophils, be part of an inflammatory cascade that contributes to such injury of the reperfused myocardium. Although there were trends in differences in baseline characteristics between patients with high vs. low Il-8 levels, the data suggest that differences in IL-8 levels probably are more related to the acute MI and the accompanying degree of heart failure than the patients&#x02019; medical history before the index MI. Although mainly non-significant trends, due to the relatively low number of patients, more patients in the group with high levels of IL-8 were in cardiogenic shock or had an IABP inserted, and patients with high IL-8 levels had higher peak TnT levels and lower systolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112359-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The time courses of different markers like IL-6, CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; were consistent with previous studies on patients with either acute decompensated HF or acute MI <xref rid="pone.0112359-MiloCotter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Solheim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our data, however, is from a STEMI population with very large MIs and severe HF, including cardiogenic shock. Median infarct size was 45% of LV mass, while infarct size in STEMI patients reported from our institution in the same time period was 14% when unstable patients with HF were excluded <xref rid="pone.0112359-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Patients with severe HF and especially cardiogenic shock are usually excluded from MI studies and our data on the circulating levels and temporal profile of previously described as well as novel inflammatory markers provide new knowledge <xref rid="pone.0112359-Unverzagt1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Our data indicate that the initial powerful rise in IL-6 coincides with a consumption of both sIL-6R and sgp130. A decline in sIL6-R, as shown in our study, has previously been reported in a few, smaller studies in patients with acute MI <xref rid="pone.0112359-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Kanda1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recently, in a cross-sectional cohort study of 1028 STEMI patients we found no association between levels of IL-6, sgp130 and sIL-6R, measured median 18 hours after PCI, and myocardial injury measured as peak TnT <xref rid="pone.0112359-Ritschel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our data on STEMI patients with acute de novo HF are in accordance with these results.</p><p>We have previously shown that levosimendan improved LV function compared to placebo in post-ischemic myocardium in patients developing acute HF following a PCI-treated STEMI, however no significant effect on levels of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was found <xref rid="pone.0112359-Husebye1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The lack of significant between-group differences in changes of the measured markers during the study period between levosimendan and placebo differ from findings in previous studies on patients with HF <xref rid="pone.0112359-Avgeropoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Parissis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Trikas1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Parissis2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, patients in these studies had decompensated chronic HF with LV ejection fraction &#x0003c;35% and acute MI was an exclusion criterion. Our patients had rather low levels of NT-proBNP, consistent with absence of longstanding pressure or volume overload, factors that are believed to be important in the inflammatory response seen in patients with both chronic and acute decompensated HF <xref rid="pone.0112359-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The myocardial injury related to the PCI-treated STEMI was in our patients probably a more powerful stimulus to the inflammatory response than the acute development of HF <xref rid="pone.0112359-Frangogiannis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112359-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Due to the study design, the first blood sampling was performed median 22 hours after PCI. We were therefore not able to evaluate the levels of circulating inflammatory markers during the first hours after opening of the infarct related artery and may have missed the peak level of the different markers in relation to the STEMI. However, as the aim of the LEAF trial was to investigate the effect of levosimendan on STEMI patients with symptomatic HF, we could not include patients immediately after PCI, as many of the patients developed HF several hours after PCI.</p><p>The LEAF trial was not designed to evaluate possible associations between specific inflammatory markers and LV function or infarct size. The number of participants may have been too low to detect other possible associations between levels of inflammatory markers and impaired LV function. Possible association between inflammatory mediators and levosimendan treatment was a prespecified endpoint, but the analyses regarding LV function and infarct size were performed on a post-hoc basis and must be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>High levels of IL-8 in STEMI patients complicated with HF were associated with less improvement in LV function during the first 6 weeks after PCI, suggesting a possible role of IL-8 in the reperfusion-related injury and adverse LV remodelling of post-ischemic myocardium. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112359.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
