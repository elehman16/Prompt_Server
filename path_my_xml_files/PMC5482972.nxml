Up to 50% of these patients have an associated parapneumonic effusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most are small and uncomplicated and will resolve with antimicrobial treatment of the underlying infection. In some cases, however, a complicated effusion can develop, leading to respiratory compromise and/or extensive loculations. Such effusions, commonly referred to as pleural empyema, lead to substantial morbidity, including respiratory distress, pain, and prolonged hospitalization, as well as child school loss, parental work loss, and stress on families. Over the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase reported in the incidence of pediatric pleural empyema in multiple countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recent data from Scotland suggests that since 2010, the incidence of empyema may have begun to fall, possibly due to the introduction of a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Published clinical practice guidelines support the use of pleural drainage procedures in addition to antibiotics for the management of moderate to large empyemas in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These guidelines are based on reports suggesting longer hospital stays, duration of antibiotic therapy, and higher rate of progression to surgical intervention in children treated with antibiotics alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A variety of drainage procedures have been described, including chest tube placement with or without fibrinolytics, repeated ultrasound-guided thoracentesis in addition to surgical procedures such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and open thoracotomy with decortication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Systematic reviews and guidelines suggest that chest tube insertion with intrapleurally administered fibrinolytics and primary VATS are equally effective but fibrinolytics are more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Even with the use of fibrinolytics, pleural drainage can be challenging and lead to prolonged hospitalization. Associated morbidities include prolonged chest tube duration, which can be painful, and &#x0201c;treatment failure,&#x0201d; where undrained pleural disease necessitates salvage procedures such as additional chest tubes, VATS, or thoracotomy. The frequency and type of salvage procedures varies by center but is typically 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One potential explanation for inadequate drainage leading to treatment failure is the presence of extracellular uncoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) liberated from dead leukocytes and other bacterial components. Such residual material may increase viscosity, permit biofilm formation, and interfere with drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Recombinant human dornase (dornase alfa) has been shown in vitro to decrease viscosity by cleaving free DNA and liquefying parapneumonic pus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Subsequent animal studies have also demonstrated that the combined administration of the fibrinolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and dornase alfa is more effective than either agent alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Small case series in adult patients have also described benefit from the addition of dornase alfa to the treatment of empyema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Safety data on dornase alfa is primarily derived from its currently licensed indication, nebulization at a dose of 2.5 to 5&#x000a0;mg once or twice daily for the reduction of sputum viscosity in patients with cystic fibrosis. This formulation is generally well tolerated. Common side effects of inhaled dornase alfa include rash, voice alteration, chest pain, and laryngitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">A randomized controlled trial of adults with empyema recently demonstrated improved outcomes with dornase alfa and fibrinolytics compared to fibrinolytics alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This study used a blinded, 2-by-2 factorial design in which 210 adults with empyema were randomly assigned to one of four study treatments for 3&#x000a0;days: double placebo, intrapleurally administered tPA and dornase alfa, tPA and placebo, or dornase and placebo. The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion on chest radiography on day 7 compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay and adverse events. For the primary outcome, the authors found a significantly greater reduction in pleural opacity in the tPA-dornase alfa group compared with the placebo group (&#x02212;29.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23.3% versus &#x02212;17.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;19.6%; mean difference &#x02212;7.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI), &#x02212;13.4 to &#x02212;2.4; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005). The change in pleural opacity observed with tPA alone or dornase alfa alone was not statistically different from that observed with placebo. All secondary outcomes also pointed to superiority of tPA-dornase alfa compared with other study arms. Hospital stay for the tPA-dornase alfa group (11.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.4&#x000a0;days) was about 50% shorter compared with placebo (24.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;56.1&#x000a0;days), whereas in the dornase alfa-only group and the tPA-only group, length of stay was similar to placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3&#x000a0;months was lower in the tPA-dornase alfa group compared with placebo (4% versus 16%; odds ratio (OR), 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Surgical referrals were increased in the dornase alfa-only group (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30&#x02013;9.75, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), and were nonsignificantly reduced in the tPA-only group (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.29, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10). Mortality rates were 8% at 3&#x000a0;months and 12% at 12&#x000a0;months, but were similar across all study groups. Inflammatory measures (C-reactive protein, systemic white blood cell count, and odds of fever) were also assessed. Significant differences were found in mean white blood cell count on day 7 and fever on day 6 or day 7 between tPA-dornase alfa and placebo. The new treatment was not associated with any excess of adverse events. Serious adverse events described included intrapleural hemorrhage (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, both in the tPA-dornase alfa group), gastrointestinal bleeding (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, both in the dornase alfa group), hemoptysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, in the tPA-dornase alfa group, and clinical deterioration (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, in the placebo group).</p><p id="Par15">Applying the results of adult studies of pleural empyema to children is problematic as pediatric pleural empyema is a different disease for several reasons. First, the mortality rates in adult patients can be as high as 10-20%, since many patients have pre-existing comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Most children who develop pleural empyema, however,&#x000a0;are otherwise healthy and mortality is extremely rare. To date, no mortalities have been reported in any of the randomized controlled trials of children with empyema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Second, epidemiologic trends showing a rising incidence in empyema have been primarily demonstrated in children. Although microbiologic confirmation is often elusive, this does suggest that the microbial etiology of pediatric empyema (e.g., pneumococcal serotypes not covered by conventional vaccines) may differ from adult patients. Third, therapies that have been found to be ineffective in adult patients have been effective in children. Therefore, although there is a biological rationale and clinical efficacy data from adults, the evidence remains unclear whether the addition of dornase alfa to tPA will provide improvement in outcomes among children with empyema.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research question</title><p id="Par16">In previously well children who present with pleural empyema, does the administration of intrapleurally administered tPA and dornase alfa once daily for 3&#x000a0;days decrease the length of stay in hospital compared to tPA alone?

These medications will be administered through the chest tube once daily for a total of three doses. Weight-based dosing will not be used for tPA or dornase alfa as pleural concentrations are unpredictable and variable. Dornase alfa will be constituted by the research pharmacies in clear liquids in a polyethylene syringe. Since the stability of a tPA-dornase alfa admixture is unknown, the drugs will be administered sequentially with a 1-h indwelling time for each drug, as described in the trial of adults with empyema treated with dornase alfa and tPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">For tPA, the contents of the vial will be diluted to a total volume of 10&#x000a0;ml normal saline for children weighing less than or equal to 10&#x000a0;kg and 20&#x000a0;ml for children weighing more than 10&#x000a0;kg. A flush of 5&#x000a0;ml of normal saline will be instilled after drug administration.

The contents of the vials (tPA followed by dornase alfa or placebo) will be instilled into the chest drain by clinicians caring for the child. The first dose of tPA will be given immediately (within 1&#x000a0;h) after insertion of the chest drain by the interventional radiologist or surgeon in the procedure suite or by clinicians on the ward. Dornase alfa or placebo will be instilled on the ward. On the following day (day 1) and subsequent day (day 2), a dose of tPA followed by the study drug will be administered in the morning, between 9:00&#x000a0;a.m. and 10:00&#x000a0;a.m., in a similar fashion.

This includes time to meeting discharge criteria, defined as the number of days from insertion of the chest drain to meeting discharge criteria. This will be assessed by a research assistant on a twice-daily basis (9:00&#x000a0;a.m. and 4:00&#x000a0;p.m.) and defined as: no fever (temperature &#x0003c;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) for 24&#x000a0;h, normal respiratory rate for age (using the World Health Organization age-specific criteria: &#x0003c;50 breaths/min for 2&#x02013;12 months, &#x0003c;40 breaths/min for 1 to 5&#x000a0;years, and &#x0003c;20 breaths/min for &#x02265;5&#x000a0;years), no hypoxia (oxygen saturation greater than 92% on room air), and drinking fluids well. All values will be measured in hours and reported in days rounded to a single decimal point.

Dichotomous outcomes include in-hospital mortality due to any cause; need for ventilatory support or noninvasive ventilation following chest tube insertion; clinically significant bleeding (defined as intrapleural bleeding resulting in a drop in hemoglobin of greater than 20&#x000a0;g/L or requiring a transfusion of packed red blood cells); and the need for further pleural drainage procedures, including additional chest tube insertion, VATS, or thoracotomy. We will also document hospital readmissions within 3&#x000a0;months related to pleural empyema or its treatment.</p><p id="Par53">Previous studies have demonstrated that early pleural drainage (i.e., within 48&#x000a0;h of admission) is associated with decreased length of stay in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This finding has important implications regarding the timing of pleural drainage but does not help clinicians to determine which medications would be most beneficial (i.e., dornase and fibrinolytics versus fibrinolytics alone). As a result, we plan to report the timing of pleural drainage as a baseline variable to explore whether this is balanced between the two groups.</p><p id="Par54">An economic evaluation will compare the relative costs of dornase alfa and tPA with tPA alone using participant-level data from the trial. We will conduct the analysis from a hospital&#x02019;s perspective because hospital administrators will be making reimbursement decisions for this intervention. Since empyema is an acute condition, and the long-term consequences are negligible, the time horizon of the analysis will be the length of hospital stay. The cost for each patient includes the cost of intervention (dornase alfa and tPA or tPA alone) and costs incurred during the hospital stay (i.e., &#x0201c;hospitalization cost&#x0201d;). We will obtain hospitalization costs for each patient from case costing data from hospital finance departments.

We will also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results.</p><p id="Par56">We will not subject participants to standardized diagnostic assessments in follow-up. The long-term outcomes of pediatric empyema are almost universally positive. In our previous prospective cohort study of children with empyema, we found that by 6&#x000a0;months virtually all patients were asymptomatic, radiographs had normalized in 95% of patients, and pulmonary function tests were normal in 96% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Exploratory outcome</title><p id="Par57">In the trial of dornase alfa among adults with empyema, changes in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion on day 7 compared with day 1, was the primary outcome. In pediatric empyema, this outcome is problematic because: (1) some children will be discharged prior to day 7, (2) hemithorax size differs substantially across different-sized children, and (3) requiring an additional chest radiograph may be a substantial disincentive for a parental caregiver to provide consent given the rising concerns of ionizing radiation in developing children. Further, radiographic changes are considered surrogate measures of clinical changes as they often lag behind clinical improvement.</p><p id="Par58">Chest ultrasound is not used routinely or consistently to assess response to therapy following pleural drainage procedures. Thus, using this modality in a pragmatic trial has little relevance for clinicians who routinely care for children with empyema. Further, ultrasound is extremely user-dependent, resource-intensive, and precludes truly blinded assessment by external reviewers. The most objective and reproducible way to assess response to pleural drainage radiologically would be chest computed tomography (CT). Unfortunately, chest CT is associated with less interobserver agreement for pleural disease, substantial cost, and radiation exposure, and so its use is not recommended in the management of children with pleural empyema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">There is currently no standard as to the timing of chest radiographs in hospital, but in our experience, virtually all children will have a radiograph performed before and/or shortly after chest tube removal. The radiograph closest to the time of removal will be reviewed by a blinded study radiologist to determine the percentage of hemithorax occupied using a five-point ordinal scale utilized in previous studies ranging from no fluid present to fluid occupying more than 75% of the most affected hemithorax. Given that radiographic improvement is time-dependent, we do not have any a priori hypotheses about the results of this outcome across groups. Using a chest radiograph allows for a blinded assessment by an external reviewer and is the modality used in routine clinical practice, particularly to ensure that the patient does not develop a pneumothorax and/or that the chest tube does not become dislodged or kinked while in situ. Thus, the degree of resolution on chest radiograph post chest tube insertion is both meaningful to clinicians and more in keeping with the goals of a pragmatic trial.</p><p id="Par60">We are also collecting data on concomitant medication use, including analgesia. We did not include pain as a prespecified outcome measure as we did not hypothesize differences between treatment groups. We will explore these data in post hoc analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par61">The primary outcome in this trial is time to hospital discharge after chest tube insertion. In previous studies, the mean time to hospital discharge post insertion ranges from 6 to 15&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hospital length of stay tends to be shorter in published randomized controlled trials compared to observational studies of empyema, and a recent randomized controlled trial using an identical tPA dosing regimen to that which we are proposing described a mean of 6.8 (standard deviation (SD) 2.9) days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The desired power for the current proposal is 90% to detect a difference of 2&#x000a0;days in the mean time to hospital discharge between the treatment arms. Based on discussions with clinical experts, hospital administrators, and parents of children with pleural empyema, it is believed that a 2-day difference between treatment groups is a minimal clinically meaningful difference, and this has been used in previous trials on this topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The adult dornase alfa trial found a 50% difference in length of stay between treatment and placebo groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Assuming a type 1 error rate of 0.05 (two-sided), power (1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) of 90%, and a SD of 2.9&#x000a0;days for each group, our trial needs 46 participants in each group to detect a difference of 2&#x000a0;days in length of stay. Sample size would have to be 34 participants in each group to provide 80% power. Calculations were performed based on a <italic>t</italic> test of independent groups.

Physicians, radiologists, and surgeons at each site will be asked to notify the research assistant and/or site investigator of children admitted with pleural empyema who may be eligible for the study. Potential participants will be approached, eligibility criteria confirmed, consent obtained, and enrolled after the decision to proceed with pleural drainage but before chest tube insertion occurs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par64">After informed consent is obtained, participants will be randomized into treatment groups using a random allocation sequence created by the coordination and management center for this trial. Randomization will be stratified by center. Blocking will be used to ensure that the two comparison groups are approximately the same size throughout the trial for each center and for the trial as a whole. An allocation ratio of 1:1 with random block size will be used within each stratum (i.e., center). This will ensure that clinicians, investigators, and outcome assessors will not be able to decipher the block size. A computer-based pseudo-random number generator will be used to create treatment allocation tables for each study center.</p><p id="Par65">After patient eligibility has been confirmed, consent obtained, and just as the patient leaves the inpatient unit to the radiology suite or operating room for chest tube insertion, the site investigator (or delegate) will assign the patient a unique study identification number in sequential order.

Both arms will be constituted by the research pharmacies in clear liquids in a polyethylene container in a manner such that both are identical (packaging, color, volume, texture, and odor) to ensure blinding. After obtaining the treatment number from the central randomization center, the study pharmacist will retrieve the corresponding vial and one of its treatment number labels will be attached to the participant&#x02019;s Case Report Form. We do not anticipate any circumstances that would require unblinding as knowledge of the study arm is not anticipated to affect treatment for patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par67">Data collection for outcome measures will be collected in hospital by the research assistant at each center.

This problem is particularly relevant in pharmaceutical trials, and has undoubtedly led to the widespread use of pharmaceutical products in children without sufficient data on effectiveness or safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Despite some legislative initiatives in the United States and Europe to promote drug trials in children, extensive logistical and financial disincentives persist. Consequently, 79% of hospitalized children are treated with drugs for unapproved indications, otherwise known as &#x0201c;off-label&#x0201d; use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that using fibrinolytics is a safe and effective therapy for children with empyema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Despite this, many patients continue to experience significant short-term morbidity due to prolonged hospitalization, pain from indwelling chest tubes, and the need for additional drainage procedures. Data from a randomized controlled trial in adults with empyema suggests that adding dornase alfa may be superior to using fibrinolytics alone. This treatment strategy requires further study in a pediatric setting since differences in the underlying disease may affect response to treatment. As such, we are now conducting a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of dornase alfa and tPA in the management of empyema in children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par79">The DTPA trial started recruiting participants in December 2012 and is on track to complete enrollment of 92 participants by April 2018.
