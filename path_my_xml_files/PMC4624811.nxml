In the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, the administration of ticagrelor to patients with an acute coronary syndrome resulted in a striking reduction in the primary endpoint of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to clopidogrel [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, all cause mortality was reduced, and this was driven not only by vascular mortality, but also by fewer deaths attributed to sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, dyspnea and asymptomatic ventricular pauses were reported more often in the ticagrelor treated patients. These finding have instigated the search for pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor over and above the classical antiplatelet effect.</p><p>In the past years, evidence is accumulating that ticagrelor inhibits the cellular uptake of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine by blockade of the Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter (hENT1) [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Stimulation of membrane-bound adenosine receptors induces various beneficial cardiovascular effects, including vasodilation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, inhibition of inflammation, and increasing resistance against ischemia and reperfusion [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, intravenous administration of adenosine induces dyspnea and potently inhibits atrioventricular conductance [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Adenosine is mainly formed by intra- and extracellular dephosphorylation of AMP, which is catalyzed by 5&#x02019;-nucleotidase. In contrast, degradation of adenosine in humans is mainly confined to the intracellular compartment, by adenosine kinase and adenosine deaminase. Consequently, in normal situations, the intracellular concentration is lower than the extracellular concentration, and extracellular adenosine is rapidly taken up via the hENT1 by surrounding cells, mainly red blood cells and endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition of the hENT1 activity will increase the extracellular adenosine concentration, and this mechanism has been proposed to mediate the effects of ticagrelor observed in the PLATO study [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Most of the current evidence on the effect of ticagrelor on adenosine metabolism is derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, or from studies in patients in which the adenosine metabolism could be affected by other factors, such as co-medications. Therefore, in this study we aimed to test this hypothesis in healthy humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used the vasodilator response to the local administration of adenosine and to forearm ischemia as validated surrogates of adenosine uptake inhibition, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the vasodilator response to dipyridamole, a potent inhibitor of hENT1, was used as a validated surrogate marker of endogenous adenosine formation [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, the effect of ticagrelor on adenosine and uridine uptake was investigated directly in isolated red blood cells and whole blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

The experiments were performed two hours after the intake of the study medication. The two experiments were separated by at least 14 days.

All volunteers were asked to abstain from alcoholic drinks and caffeine-containing beverages for at least 24 hours before the experiments. We performed the experiment in a temperature-controlled room (24&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C). A 27-gauge needle was inserted into the brachial artery of the non-dominant arm for intra-arterial drug administration. We measured the forearm blood flow (FBF) in both forearms simultaneously with venous occlusion plethysmography, using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges and an occluded hand circulation as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The total intra-arterial infused volume was kept at a constant rate of 50 &#x003bc;L/min per dL of forearm volume. Thirty minutes after cannulation of the brachial artery, we started the infusion of normal saline at the calculated rate with concomitant measurement of the FBF. Normal saline (baseline) and the dosages of the intra-arterial administered drug were infused for 5 minutes. We performed four experiments, starting two hours after intake of the study medication, which were all separated by a wash-out period of 30 minutes to prevent any cross-over effects. <xref rid="pone.0137560.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> provides a schematic overview of the experiment.</p><fig id="pone.0137560.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137560.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Schematic flow chart of the experiment.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0137560.g002"/></fig><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We measured FBF during the administration of 4 incremental dosages of adenosine into the brachial artery.

We have previously demonstrated that dipyridamole potentiates the PORH response [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and that statins potentiate the PORH by an increase of the extracellular adenosine formation [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subsequently, FBF was measured during intra-arterial administration of dipyridamole (30 and 100 &#x003bc;l/min/dL forearm volume, which we also used in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]).

This measurement was repeated approximately 2 hours after the ingestion of the study medication and just before measurement of the vasodilator response to adenosine. Finally, the ticagrelor concentration was determined before intake of the ticagrelor dose, 2 hours after the intake, and subsequently before the start of each forearm blood flow experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Analytic procedures</title><p>We determined plasma caffeine concentrations using reversed-phase HPLC with ultraviolet detection set at 273 nm, according to Schreiber-Deturmeny and Bruguerolle [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In isolated red blood cells, the uptake of adenosine and uridine was determined as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to adenosine, uridine is not metabolized inside the cells, and therefore, uridine uptake is a more direct measure of ENT activity than adenosine uptake [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ticagrelor concentrations were determined by LC-MSMS. Liquid chromatographic separation was performed at a temperature of 30&#x000b0;C with a mobile phase, consisting of solvent A (10 mM ammonium acetate in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). For the mass spectrometric analysis, heated electrospray ionization (HESI) was operated at a spray voltage of -2.5kV, a capillary temperature of 225&#x000b0;C and a vaporizer temperature of 382&#x000b0;C. Argon was used as collision gas at a pressure of 1.5 mTorr. Negative ion mode was used with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the quantitative analysis of ticagrelor. The most abundant product ion was used for quantification. The quantification was performed using peak areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>In vitro experiments</title><p>In isolated red blood cells from healthy volunteers not taking any medication, the effect of ticagrelor on uridine uptake was measured as described previously (17). Briefly, uridine was added to washed red blood cells to obtain a final concentration of 1000 &#x003bc;M. The cells were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of ticagrelor for ten minutes before the addition of uridine. After 3 seconds, uridine uptake was completely blocked by the addition of 10 &#x003bc;M dipyridamole and the amount of uridine in the cell was determined using HPLC with UV detection set at 254 nm.</p><p>Because of the high protein binding of ticagrelor of 99.8%, we also performed whole blood experiments, in which ticagrelor was added to 1 ml of whole blood for 10 or 60 minutes. Next, the red blood cells were isolated by centrifugation and uridine was added as described above.</p><p>To measure the rate of disappearance of adenosine in the physiological situation, which is the overall result of uptake and intracellular degradation, we added 1 &#x003bc;M of adenosine to 1 ml of whole blood at 37&#x000b0;C, as previously described by Bonello et al [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. After 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 seconds, the transport, formation, and degradation of adenosine was completely blocked by a adding an equal volume of pharmacological blocking solution, including NaCl (118mM); KCl (5 mM); Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA (13.2 mM); dipyridamole (40 &#x003bc;M); iodotubercidin (ITU; 10&#x003bc;M); EHNA (10&#x003bc;M); forskolin (11.5&#x003bc;M), and IBMX (115&#x003bc;M). After centrifugation the adenosine concentration was measured in the supernatant using LC-MSMS. Separation was performed with a Acquity UPLC HSS column. The mobile phase, consisting of solvent A (1 mM ammonium fluoride in water) and solvent B (methanol). For the mass spectrometric analysis, heated electrospray ionization (HESI) was operated at a spray voltage of +3kV, the capillary temperature and the vaporizer temperature were set at 300&#x000b0;C. Argon was used as collision gas at a pressure of 1.5 mTorr. Positive ion mode was used with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the quantitation. The following SRM transitions were used: <italic>m/z</italic> 268.1(parent ion) to <italic>m/z</italic> 119.0 and 136.1 (both product ions).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study was powered to detect a difference in the primary endpoint of adenosine-induced vasodilation. The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: in previous studies from our own group, we found that the vasodilator response to the intrabrachial administration of adenosine averages 2.8&#x000b1;0.6, 4.4&#x000b1;1.0, 9.0&#x000b1;1.7 ml/min per dl of forearm volume for 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 &#x003bc;g/min/dl, respectively (mean&#x000b1;SEM, n = 8). The pooled CV is 0.6, so after log transformation the SD averaged 0.55. We expect that a (relative) difference between the treatments is independent of the adenosine dose. Hence, a linear mixed model will be used, with fixed factors treatment (ticagrelor vs placebo), adenosine dose, and period. Based on a correlation of 0.7 between the measurements for all doses and time points and an SD of 0.55, the SD of the contrast is 0.25. As a result, 13 evaluable subjects are needed to demonstrate an augmentation of adenosine-induced vasodilation with 1.25 (ie a 25% increase) with a power of 80% and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. To account for one drop-out, we aim to include 14 healthy volunteers.</p><p>FBF analyses were done offline before unblinding of the study. Mean FBF values were calculated from the FBF responses to the different stimuli. We calculated the average FBF during last 4 minutes of the baseline FBF (normal saline), the last 2 minutes of the FBF response to adenosine, dipyridamole and acetylcholine, and the first 3 minutes of the PORH. Results are expressed as the median absolute FBF (mL/dL/min) with interquartile range (25&#x02013;75%), unless otherwise stated.</p><p>A linear mixed model was used to compare the FBF results of both experiments, with the log FBF during placebo and ticagrelor treatment as the dependent variable, and treatment (ticagrelor versus placebo), adenosine dose, and period as fixed factors. We used a heterogeneous compound symmetry as the type of repeated covariance. A carry over effect was excluded calculating the interaction between &#x02018;sequence&#x02019; and the primary endpoint in the mixed model analysis. For uridine uptake experiments, sigmoidal dose response curves were constructed with a variable slope and IC<sub>50</sub> were calculated for each series of experiments, using GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Subjects</title><p>23 subjects were screened for eligibility.

Due to repeated dislocation of the intra-arterial needle, we had to discontinue the experiment after the infusion of dipyridamole during a single visit in another subject.

In addition, we observed no significant <italic>ex vivo</italic> nucleoside uptake inhibition in isolated red blood cells in these subjects after oral treatment with ticagrelor. These <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> findings are consistent with additional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in isolated red blood cells demonstrating that ticagrelor only inhibits nucleoside transport in concentrations that are considerably higher than those obtained after normal dosing. Together, our findings argue against a role for increased adenosine receptor stimulation as a relevant pleiotropic effect of ticagrelor.</p><p>In the last few years, several papers suggest that ticagrelor increases the extracellular concentration of endogenous adenosine and it is speculated that this contributes to the effects of ticagrelor that are observed in clinical studies that cannot easily be explained by platelet aggregation inhibition, including reduced mortality, dyspnea, ventricular pauses, limitation of myocardial infarct size, and effects on inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Adenosine induces various effects by stimulation of membrane-bound adenosine receptors, including direct vasodilation, platelet aggregation inhibition, modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity, modulation of inflammation, and limitation of (myocardial) ischemia and reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, the intravenous administration of adenosine has negative dromotropic effects on the heart, and induces a sensation of dyspnea [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated two different effects of ticagrelor on adenosine metabolism: first, ticagrelor augments the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as a precursor for extracellular adenosine formation, from isolated red blood cells, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 14 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Secondly, ticagrelor inhibits adenosine uptake via the ENT with a reported IC<sub>50</sub> value of 100&#x02013;260 nmol/l [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It needs to be emphasized, however, that these experiments were performed in isolated cells without plasma. Given the &#x0003e; 99% plasma protein binding of ticagrelor in human blood, these IC<sub>50</sub> values cannot easily be compared to the whole blood ticagrelor concentration of 0.5&#x02013;1.5 &#x003bc;M observed during normal dosing in patients. Ticagrelor does not have a direct effect on adenosine receptors itself, does not affect the breakdown of adenosine by adenosine deaminase, nor is it converted into adenosine [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our experiment was designed to investigate both the effect of ticagrelor on adenosine uptake as well as the effect of ticagrelor on extracellular adenosine formation (e.g. by increased ATP release). Direct measurement of the extracellular adenosine concentration is technically highly demanding given the extremely short half-life of adenosine and there is great controversy about the normal extracellular concentration in human plasma [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we used well-validated surrogates of extracellular adenosine formation and uptake. In the absence of any effects of ticagrelor on adenosine receptors or adenosine degradation, the vasodilator response to the intrabrachial administration of adenosine is a well-validated surrogate of adenosine transporter function, as we have previously described [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We also studied PORH because this is mediated, at least in part, by an increased endogenous formation of adenosine [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Dipyridamole is a potent hENT1 blocker and increases the extracellular adenosine concentration at a rate proportional to the extracellular formation of adenosine, as demonstrated previously [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We did not observe an effect of ticagrelor on any of these stimuli, demonstrating that there is no relevant increase in extracellular adenosine formation and adenosine transport. Nonspecific effects of ticagrelor on vascular reactivity were ruled out using acetylcholine-induced vasodilation. Consistent with these <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, there was no significant inhibition of <italic>ex vivo</italic> adenosine uptake in red blood cells, isolated before and after ticagrelor-intake. Uridine uptake was inhibited with 11%, but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.056). For the interpretation of these results, it is important to realize that after facilitated diffusion via the ENT, adenosine is rapidly metabolized, and that intracellular deamination of adenosine is rate limiting for adenosine uptake rather than ENT activity [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Only after pharmacological inhibition of &#x0003e;80% of ENT activity, the ENT transporter becomes rate limiting, and adenosine uptake is reduced [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As such, 11% ENT inhibition will not have any effect on extracellular adenosine concentration. Indeed, also in whole blood experiments, ticagrelor did not affect adenosine disappearance at relevant concentrations.</p><p>The results of our series of experiments contradict previous studies. <italic>In vitro</italic> Van Giezen et al reported in a canine model that ticagrelor augmented adenosine-induced vasodilation in the coronary artery [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, this effect was observed only at a ticagrelor plasma concentration of 13.4 &#x003bc;M and not with the lower concentration of 4.1 &#x003bc;M, which is still considerably higher than the plasma concentration in patients treated with ticagrelor. In contrast, in another in vitro study, the addition of 1 &#x003bc;M of ticagrelor to whole blood resulted in a slightly but significantly higher adenosine concentration 1 minute after the addition of 7.1 &#x003bc;M of adenosine [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In healthy subjects <italic>in vivo</italic> Wittfeldt et al showed that a single dose of 180 mg of ticagrelor augmented the coronary blood flow velocity after intravenous adenosine infusion, which was prevented by concomitant administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similar results were obtained by Alexopoulos et al in patients with a recent non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The route of administration in these studies is the major and important difference with our study: in our model adenosine is administered into the brachial artery, resulting in a high local arterial adenosine concentration, but without any systemic effects. Intravenous administration of adenosine, however, induces major systemic hemodynamic effects consisting of increased systolic blood pressure and heart rate and decrease of diastolic blood pressure by the combination of a direct vasodilator effect and a pronounced activation of sympathetic nervous system activity by stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the coronary blood flow response in the Wittfeldt and Alexopoulos papers is driven by different effects, whereas adenosine-induced vasodilation in our study was not confounded by systemic hemodynamic and nervous effects. Finally, the plasma concentration of ticagrelor in the study by Wittfeldt et al was slightly higher than in our study, despite the fact that in both studies the plasma concentration was determined 2 hours after intake of 180 mg ticagrelor in healthy subjects. Bonello et al measured plasma adenosine concentration in patients with an acute coronary syndrome who were randomized to either ticagrelor or clopidogrel at a time point of 6 hours after the loading dose [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They observed a significantly higher adenosine concentration in the patients treated with ticagrelor, and they observed a significant inhibition of <italic>ex vivo</italic> adenosine uptake in whole blood. It is likely that in the patients in this study, just as in the study by Alexopoulos et al, the adenosine metabolism is affected by the myocardial ischemia, the profound activation of the sympathetic nervous system by the coronary event, and by the comedication (e.g. statins that will increase the extracellular formation of adenosine by activation of the ecto-5&#x02019;-nucleotidase [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). In addition, the pharmacological blocking solution that is used to completely block adenosine metabolism in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> whole blood experiments differs from the solution that we previously have validated to result in a almost complete recovery of adenosine [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The inconsistent results of our study and the Bonello study might be caused, at least in part, by these differences.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Our study has several potential limitations. First, our experiments were performed in healthy subjects without cardiovascular disease and without concomitant cardiovascular drugs, such as in the study by Bonello et al [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, the results of our study do not exclude any effect of ticagrelor on the adenosine system in patients with acute coronary events. Secondly, we investigated adenosine formation and uptake in the forearm, in contrast to the coronary circulation that was studied by Wittfeldt et al [<xref rid="pone.0137560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, ENT is not known to differ between heart and forearm and therefore we believe that extrapolation from forearm to heart is valid for this particular research question.</p></sec><sec id="sec022" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ticagrelor dose-dependently inhibits nucleoside transporter activity in isolated red blood cells of healthy volunteers. However, the plasma concentration of ticagrelor after normal dosing in humans is too low to result in a significant increase in extracellular adenosine and adenosine receptor stimulation via this mechanism. In addition, the lack of any effect of ticagrelor on dipyridamole-induced vasodilation suggests that ticagrelor does not augment endogenous extracellular adenosine formation. Our findings, therefore, argue against a role these mechanisms as an explanation for the effects of ticagrelor, including lower mortality, dyspnea, ventricular pauses, and modulation of inflammation, as observed in recent clinical studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137560.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137560.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137560.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol: The effect of ticagrelor on the adenosine system.</title><p>Final version of the study protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137560.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Mrs. E.P.
