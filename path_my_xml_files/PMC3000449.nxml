Accordingly, the proportion of patients with obesity seen in primary care systems is also quite high. Despite the frequency of encounters between clinicians and patients who are obese, many providers hold negative attitudes toward these individuals<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In turn, a number of studies demonstrate that obese patients report negative clinical experiences, poor treatment, and stigmatizing behavior by health care providers<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. These experiences are posited to contribute to avoidance of cancer screening and other preventive health services among persons who are obese<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Health care providers' attitudes toward people who are obese are consistent with those of the general public. Indeed, research indicates that many physicians perceive individuals who are obese to be highly responsible for causing their condition<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and endorse stereotypes that they are lazy and lacking in self control<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. A corollary to these beliefs is providers' tendency to perceive obese patients as being unmotivated and non-compliant<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. These attitudes and beliefs can shape the clinical interaction making it more negative and uncomfortable for patients who are obese<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and decreasing patient-provider rapport. Negative attitudes can also be subtly conveyed in interpersonal behaviors<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The degree to which a provider makes eye contact with a patient, for example, can reflect the level of his or her regard for that patient. These nonverbal behaviors color the tone of the medical encounter and influence patient satisfaction<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p id="P8">Though provider attitudes and beliefs about patients with obesity can clearly be impactful in the clinical encounter, previous studies have largely been limited to surveys of general attitudes. Each interaction between a provider and a patient occurs in a complex clinical context with a multitude of clinical and interpersonal variations. Thus, there are numerous characteristics of the patient and aspects of the interaction aside from patient weight that could initiate or exacerbate negative attitudes. Many of these variables, however, can be confounded with a patient's weight, making it difficult to pinpoint the source of negative attitudes reported in surveys. For example, patients who are obese tend to have different co-morbidities or different health status than patients who are not obese<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Patients who are obese may also exhibit different interaction styles,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> developed through previous experiences with weight bias and negative treatment. Similarly, providers' expectations about patients who are obese may elicit negative interaction styles from these patients (i.e., self-fulfilling prophecies)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. General surveys do not account for these factors. Thus, there is little evidence on the extent to which bias against and negativity toward obese patients is activated by the patient's weight, as opposed to factors that arise during the medical encounter.</p><p id="P9">In addition to affecting rapport with patients, providers' attitudes toward obese patients might also influence their decisions about patient care. Indeed, individuals' biased attitudes are often linked to related behaviors<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Only two known studies have attempted to examine the link between provider attitudes and patient care behavior. Thus far, findings are mixed. Wigton and McGaghie found no differences in providers' psychiatric-related recommendations in response to viewing video tapes of actors playing obese or non-obese patients<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Hebl and Xu reported finding differences in providers' test ordering for obese versus non-obese patients based on hypothetical chart review<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. If provider biases about obese patients do lead to differences in clinical decision making, this could clearly have important implications for patient health. Gaining a clear understanding of the nature of weight bias in the clinical encounter is an important first step toward development of strategies to address it.</p><p id="P10">It is extremely difficult to examine the effect of a single clinical variable, like patient weight, in a real medical setting. Actual clinician-patient encounters are un-standardized and cannot be manipulated for experimental purposes. Even standardized patients or actors are unable to completely standardize their verbal and nonverbal behavior. There is therefore a need for a highly controlled examination of the effects of patient weight within the context of a medical encounter.</p><p id="P11">To accomplish this, we employed immersive virtual environment (IVE) technology (i.e., virtual reality) which allows experimental manipulation of clinical variables, while maintaining total patient standardization in a realistic clinical context<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. In IVEs, users are immersed in a digitally created environment. This is realized using a combination of graphics software and a carefully designed user interface to create three-dimensional environments that users can navigate in a natural way (e.g., by walking). This technology also allows tracking of users' visual gaze, which can serve as a subtle indicator of bias<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>.</p><p id="P12">To examine the effect of patient weight on provider attitudes, beliefs, and behavior, we immersed clinical-level medical students (in their third or fourth years of training) in an IVE interaction with a virtual female patient who was visibly either obese or non-obese. The patient presented with two potentially weight-related complaints, knee pain and shortness of breath, and one non-weight-related complaint, eczema. We chose to focus on a medical student population because they are a likely target of intervention or education efforts aimed at improving clinical interaction with obese patients.</p><p id="P13">We had three main hypotheses:</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P14">Students will exhibit more negative attitudes and have more negative beliefs about the obese patient than the non-obese patient (negative stereotyping, labeling her as less likely to be adherent, labeling her as less healthy, and assigning her more responsibility for causing her potentially weight-related presenting complaints).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P15">Students will exhibit less visual contact with the obese patient than the non-obese patient.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P16">Students who interact with the obese patient will exhibit more reliance on lifestyle-related clinical recommendations for her potentially weight-related concerns, and thus make fewer recommendations for diagnostic follow-up for her shortness of breath, and for symptom management for her knee pain.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Design</title><p id="P17">This study was an experiment in which students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: interaction with an obese or a non-obese version of the same digital patient (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Data for this study were obtained from a larger experimental project examining the impact of genetics information provision to medical students.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P18">Participants were recruited from the Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas. They included 76 third and fourth year medical students. Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to the obese patient, 39 to the non-obese patient condition. Because we used IVE technology, exclusion criteria included having a seizure or vestibular disorder, being highly prone to motion sickness, and having poor, uncorrected hearing or vision. Participants were compensated $100 for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Procedure</title><p id="P19">This study was approved by the governing Institutional Review Board. Each student completed one experimental session lasting approximately an hour. The study was described to students as an investigation of patient-provider interaction in virtual environments; we did not communicate any study aims related to obesity until debriefing. After students consented to participate in the study, they completed a task in which they were asked to read and describe a short article on a medical topic. The content of the article was unrelated to any other portion of the study. Following this task, students engaged in an IVE-based interaction with a virtual female patient who was either obese or not depending upon assigned condition. Students wore a head-mounted display to interface with the virtual environment. Their head and body movements were tracked using an optical and inertial tracking system to render the appropriate scene in real time. Scenes were rendered stereoscopically, producing a three-dimensional virtual world. Students' movements in the virtual environment were recorded for later analysis.</p><p id="P20">The virtual encounter with the patient was a primary care-type clinical encounter. We constrained communication and interaction so that each student would receive the same type and amount of information from the patient. All aspects of the virtual patient and her history were identical between the obese and non-obese versions with the exception of her reported body weight, her reported BMI, and her visible body size.</p><p id="P21">Students &#x02018;entered&#x02019; the virtual clinic room by wearing the head-mounted display and were directed to look at a virtual computer monitor within the environment. This monitor provided information and instructions to guide students though the interaction. The patient's chart information was then displayed on the computer monitor (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). All details were identical for the obese and non-obese patients (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, medications, etc.) with the exception of weight and BMI. The obese patient's weight was reported as 247 pounds with a BMI of 39.9, and the non-obese patient's weight was reported as 134 pounds (BMI=21.6). When students were finished reviewing the patient information, they saw the patient for the first time.</p><p id="P22">Next, a turn-taking clinical interaction between the student and the patient took place. The student introduced him or herself to the patient. The patient verbalized information about her current health symptoms and concerns. Specifically, the patient reported that she currently had a rash on her hand that she believed to be eczema, that she was experiencing knee pain previously diagnosed as osteoarthritis, and she had been experiencing some intermittent shortness of breath. After the patient finished speaking, the student had an opportunity to visually examine the patient (e.g., taking a closer look at the eczema rash on her hand). The student responded verbally to the patient with whatever content he or she felt was appropriate, and the interaction was ended.</p><p id="P23">Following the virtual encounter, students completed a battery of computerized questionnaires. Afterward they were weighed and measured for height. Finally, students were fully debriefed and dismissed.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Measures</title><p id="P24">Students completed several measures indicating their attitudes toward and beliefs about the patient following the interaction. All scale responses were collected using seven-point Likert-type scales. Attitude and belief measures are described in the order of presentation.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Beliefs about patient's health</title><p id="P25">We measured students' beliefs about how healthy the patient was with four items previously used by Hebl and Xu<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Originally, each was a single item that was part of a larger battery of assessments. We created a scale from the four items related to perceptions of the patients' health status. Items assessed beliefs about how healthy the patient is, how well the patient takes care of herself, the patient's self-discipline, and the seriousness of the patient's health condition. Scale endpoints included &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;extremely.&#x0201d; The scale we created from these items showed good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .76).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Perceptions of patient's adherence</title><p id="P26">We measured students' perceptions of the patient's likelihood to adhere to their advice with a single item taken from the same battery of items described above<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.

The scale consists of ten negative traits (e.g., laziness). Students were asked to indicate the extent to which each trait described the patient.

The IVE system recorded the direction of each student's gaze twice every second. These data were run through a computer program to determine the extent to which the patient's face was central in the participant's view over the course of the exam period.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Clinical recommendations</title><p id="P30">Prior to answering any of the attitude or belief items, students were asked to generate an open-ended list of the follow-up recommendations they would make after this initial visit for each of the patient's complaints (eczema, shortness of breath, and knee pain). Students were prompted with three broad categories: diagnostic tests, medication-related treatment, and non-medication-related treatment. Responses were tabulated. To capture the most common recommendations, we included recommendations in analyses only if at least 20% of students in either condition made a given recommendation.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Demographics</title><p id="P31">Demographic variables such as gender, age, race and ethnicity, year in medical school, and family history of obesity were collected last among the self-report measures.

Statistical significance was assessed at p&#x0003c;.05. Descriptive analyses of all variables were performed. For clinical recommendations, chi square analyses were used to assess differences between the two conditions. For all other attitude and behavior variables, comparisons between the two conditions were performed using 1-way ANOVAs. We included participant gender as a covariate in attitude and belief analyses as these can differ between male and female providers<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.

This pattern occurred in response to the size of the patient alone, as all other interaction variables and all potential confounders were held constant. Unlike previous studies that used videotaped actors or written vignettes<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, use of an IVE clinical &#x02018;simulation&#x02019; allowed us to disentangle the effect of patient weight from other factors while maintaining psychological realism and immersion in the experimental scenario. Previous research has shown that experiences in virtual environments are psychologically compelling<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Virtual patients generally elicit reactions similar to standardized patients in training scenarios<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Behavior in these simulations can also translate to behavior in real clinical interactions<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>.</p><p id="P40">The attitude and belief outcomes reported here are important in their own right and can have substantial impact on patients' experiences of the medical encounter. Furthermore, Epstein and Street<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> posit a model through which negative interpersonal interactions in the clinic can contribute to obese individuals' avoidance of preventive care, as demonstrated in the literature<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. In the model, factors like clinician-patient rapport and patient satisfaction are considered &#x02018;proximal outcomes&#x02019; of the clinical interaction. These proximal outcomes can influence health directly and also influence &#x02018;intermediate outcomes&#x02019; such as a patient's commitment to treatment, which impacts health. The current study demonstrated one concrete example of negative interpersonal behavior in that students exhibited decreased visual contact with the obese patient. Visual contact is a proxy for eye contact, a behavior that is linked to empathy expression by providers. Eye contact is part of a constellation of nonverbal behaviors that reflect providers' regard for patients and that are linked to patient satisfaction<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p id="P41">We anticipated that differences in beliefs and attitudes would affect students' clinical recommendations for the obese patient. Although there were some individual clinical recommendations that differed between the obese and non-obese versions of the patient in the current study, we did not find pervasive patterns indicative of bias. Though we found no clear evidence of bias, there were some differences in rates of individual recommendations that are of interest. The differences we found between conditions (e.g., for lifestyle-related treatment recommendations) were not inappropriate when the patient's body weight was used as clinical data in the decision-making process. It is worth noting, however, that some of the individual recommendations that differed between the obese and non-obese patient, weight loss and lipid profile in particular, though medically reasonable, may be less germane to short-term workup or symptom relief. Other recommendation differences (minimizing knee stress, heat and cold application, and bronchodilator prescription) might also indicate weight-related assumptions about factors causing the patient's symptoms. Such recommendations, therefore, may be indicative of an understanding that the obese patient is less healthy, less active, or should lose weight generally. Further research should explore beliefs and assumptions behind these subtle differences in recommendation patterns.</p><p id="P42">We did not find evidence to support our hypothesis that students would rely on lifestyle recommendations to address the obese patient's potentially weight-related symptoms and would thus be less thorough with respect to symptom management and diagnostics. There are several possible reasons for this. In general, diagnosis, treatment, and management of conditions like knee pain and shortness of breath involve protocols<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> that these students are likely to have recently learned. Behaviors that largely depend upon protocol and habit are less likely to be influenced by one's attitudes and beliefs<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Thus, it may be the case that the particular symptoms examined here did not leave students leeway to express their attitudes. Previous research has similarly shown little influence of patient characteristics on management plans for shortness of breath whereas these characteristics influenced recommendations for a different symptom<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Alternatively, some students in our sample may not yet have been well-versed in these protocols and thus may have made more recommendations across the board so as not miss anything. More research is warranted to disentangle these issues. Regardless, in this study, the attitudes and beliefs students reported toward obese patients seem to hold more implications for the quality of the clinical encounter than for care recommendations.</p><p id="P43">In examining these findings it is also of note that participant BMI was not a significant predictor in our analyses. Thus, students who had higher BMIs did not exhibit lower levels of bias. This finding extends the currently mixed literature<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> on whether providers' weight impacts their attitudes and/or beliefs about patients who are obese.</p><p id="P44">The current study has several limitations. This study focused on medical students. Although we chose this sample because students are a clear target for potential interventions, they are still in the midst of their clinical training. Thus, the current findings may be less generalizable to practicing physicians and other clinicians. Furthermore, although we were able to measure and report students' nonverbal visual contact during the clinical interaction, we did not include other measures of interpersonal behavior or interaction quality. This is in part because the communication between the students and the virtual patient was constrained to keep it constant between participants and between conditions. In the future, examining additional verbal and nonverbal behaviors could shed more light on how attitudes and beliefs impact interpersonal behavior during a medical encounter. In addition, several of our measures consisted of a single item. More in depth assessments may increase validity of belief and attitude measurement in future studies.</p><p id="P45">Another limitation was the fact that we did not include assessments of whether and the extent to which participants perceived the patient as being obese. The virtual patient did appear to have a somewhat smaller body type than would be typical of someone with a BMI of 39.9. Based on the fact that the vast majority of students recommended weight loss for the patient, however, it clear that the patient was generally perceived as being overweight or obese. Finally, we did not allow for a true physical examination or interview during the clinical interaction. We provided students with several pieces of clinical information (e.g., blood pressure, smoking status) and included a visual examination period in which students could take a closer look at the patient. However, students were not able to perform any other type of examination that might have informed their diagnostic and treatment recommendations. For this initial study we opted to keep the interaction simple. In the future, however, making the flow of the interaction more similar to reality may increase external validity.</p><p id="P46">Further exploration of the patient-provider relationship and how obesity stigma plays out in this complex interaction is warranted. Experimental work focusing on the patients' experiences in the interaction will aid in understanding processes at work when they report negative encounters with providers. In turn, explication of these processes will help to identify points of intervention where we might improve patient-provider interactions for patients who are obese.</p><p id="P47">The current findings demonstrate that patients who are obese can trigger negative, biased attitudes, beliefs, and differential interpersonal behavior based on their size alone, in the absence of particular interaction styles, health characteristics, or other differences. Even though these attitudes and beliefs did not translate into biases in patient care recommendations, they have important implications in their own right. Negative attitudes and biases can influence the tone of clinical encounters and rapport in the patient-provider relationship, both of which can have important downstream consequences. It is therefore important to develop strategies for mitigating the effects of these reactions to patients who are obese.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><p>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health.
