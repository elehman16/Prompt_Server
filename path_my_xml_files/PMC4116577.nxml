Although the benefits of this treatment have been well-established, the majority of patients experience toxicity (nausea, vomiting, and acute diarrhea) because of the effect of the radiation on the small and large intestine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Acute emesis is seen most commonly with radiotherapy lasting 30 min to 4 h.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although, the toxicity during radiotherapy is always self-limited but decreases patient compliance, increases the cost of care, and may alter therapeutic results by increasing generally treatment period.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Irradiation caused acute small bowel injury characterized by increased apoptosis of crypt epithelial cells and by lymphocyte infiltration of the underlying tissue.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Inflammatory changes lead to the acute diarrhea by different mechanisms, including the increase of gastrointestinal motility, reduced bile acid reabsorption, and the impaired maturation and depletion of villi with denudation of the mucosa.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Secondary to the inflammatory reaction there may be release of histamines, serotonin and other transmitters inducing emesis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Various treatment techniques may decrease small bowel injury associated with pelvic irradiation. Routine medical treatment, based on guideline has included nonspecific agents, such as loperamide, atropine-diphenoxylate, octreotide, and antibiotics.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Aside pharmacological therapy, other elements such as probiotic have been examined in order to decrease postradiation gastrointestinal side-effect.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this area, Green tea has attracted significant attention recently in the scientific communities for its health benefits for a variety of disorders, ranging from cancer to weight loss. Green tea contains relatively large amounts of catechins (a subclass of the flavonoid family). It has been shown that tea catechins could have diverse pharmacological activities included antioxidative activities,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] antibacterial,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] antiinflammatory[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and antiintestinal motility.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, no clinical trial study has been reported to evaluate the effect of green tea on prevention and treatment of the RT induced diarrhea. It is therefore logical to explore the use of green tea in prophylaxis for radiation-induced diarrhea. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of green tea tablet, 450 mg/day[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] administered orally throughout the irradiation period, to reduce acute diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in subjects receiving abdomen and pelvic irradiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled clinical trials (The registry code IRCT2013052213433N1) designed to determine whether the use of a green tea tablet would decrease the frequency and severity of radiation-induced diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.

Al-Shohada Hospital, which is the one of the referral center for cancer treatment and rehabilitation in Isfahan, Iran. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total number of 42 participants (21/group) were enrolled in the study. Patients receiving standardized abdomen and pelvic irradiation 5000 cGy (1000 cGy weekly) for prostate, uterus, cervix, bladder, rectum and colon, willing and able to provide written informed consent for study participation were included. Patients with past history of irradiation, diarrhea before the beginning of pelvic irradiation were ineligible for the study.

This study shows that irradiation procedure induced diarrhea in about 37% of the patients and induced vomiting in 42% of the patients receiving a standardized protocol for pelvic malignancies that this side-effect was rarely severe, and that green tea treatment was successful to decrease diarrhea. Patients who received green tea experienced fewer diarrheas than those who received placebo and reported having any severe diarrhea. Green tea 450 mg daily was found to be effective and well tolerated. As we mentioned, Gilinsky <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that diarrhea is a problem encountered in patients receiving abdomen and pelvic radiotherapy, occurs in approximately 75% of patients and usually begins in the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> week of RT.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as well as, some studies showed that the majority of patients having mild to moderate diarrhea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Studies reported radiotherapy has a direct effect on small bowel motility, and this change in motility in turn predisposes to bacterial overgrowth and in some patients episodic pseudo-obstruction.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>There is empirical evidence for the effectiveness of green tea in treating diarrhea in Asia since ancient times.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The health effects of green tea are attributed to its epigallocatechin-3-gallate content. Catechin inhibits the stimulation of nitric oxide (NO)-synthase. NO is a bioactive molecule that plays an essential role in inflammation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] some studies reported Rats and Mice with colitis similar to the condition found in humans improved when treated with a catechin-rich extract of green tea leaves.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] As well as, researchers found that a catechin from green tea could inhibit the bacterial toxic effect on the cells.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In their study Ikigai <italic>et al</italic>. they found that there is a strong antibacterial catechin in green tea.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Stryker <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of cholestyramine on treating diarrhea related radiotherapy and they reported cholestyramine may not be clinically useful because of its side effects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] While in our study, there was no reported side effect and all patients can successfully complete the study course. It is logical if we mentioned that an ideal treatment for any complication occurred during radiotherapy or chemotherapy in patients with cancer should have little or no toxicity, high efficacy, capability of oral consumption, a known mechanism for action, low cost, and acceptance.</p><p>Our study failed to show a significant effect on radiotherapy induced vomiting when the two groups were compared. When vomiting grade was evaluated, none of the patients in the green tea-treated group had severe vomiting, but in the placebo group, severe vomiting was seen in 14% of the patients. According to the antiemetic guidelines radiotherapy induced vomiting suggested that the 5-HT 3 antagonists had significantly greater protection than other treatment such as non-5-HT 3 antagonists and corticosteroids.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Our study, while having much strength, involved a limitation that should be considered. This study had a small sample size, which reduced the statistical power. Future research with larger sample size should compare the effect of green tea treatment with other traditional treatment on radiotherapy induced diarrhea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our detailed analysis of gastrointestinal toxicity of this randomized clinical trial suggests that green tea administration reduces the frequency and severity of acute radiation-induced diarrhea in patient with pelvic and abdomen malignancy.
