exercises on the Cobb angle and body weight distribution of patients with idiopathic
scoliosis. [Subjects] Twenty-four scoliosis patients with a Cobb angle of &#x02265;20&#x000b0; were
divided into the Schroth exercise group (SEG, n = 12) and the Pilates exercise group (PEG,
n = 12). [Methods] The SEG and PEG performed Schroth and Pilates exercises, respectively,
three times a week for 12 weeks. The Cobb angle was measured in the standing position with
a radiography apparatus, and weight load was measured with Gait View Pro 1.0. [Results] In
the intragroup comparison, both groups showed significant changes in the Cobb angle. For
weight distribution, the SEG showed significant differences in the total weight between
the concave and convex sides, but the PEG did not show significant differences.
Furthermore, in the intragroup comparison, the SEG showed significant differences in the
changes in the Cobb angle and weight distribution compared with the PEG. [Conclusion] Both
Schroth and Pilates exercises were effective in changing the Cobb angle and weight
distribution of scoliosis patients; however, the intergroup comparison showed that the
Schroth exercise was more effective than the Pilates exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Schroth exercise</kwd><kwd>Pilates exercise</kwd><kwd>Cobb angle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In modern society, abnormal bending of the spinal column is caused by sitting for long
periods<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and an unbalanced body shape
is caused by a lack of awareness about body imbalance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, although the causes are unclear, scoliosis is
associated with genetic factors, poor posture, and insufficient exercise<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical problems resulting from these
factors include deformation of the spinal column and structures<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and changed characteristics of the erector spinae muscle,
leading to low back pain, reduced flexibility of the spinal column, and degraded
cardiopulmonary function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are various therapeutic approaches to scoliosis from various perspectives, and the
basis for the effects of exercise therapy as a conservative treatment method has been
reported recently<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The goal of
conservative treatment is to stop the progress of bending<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The therapeutic effects of the Schroth exercise have been reported

the Pilates exercise on the improvement of the Cobb angle and flexibility of scoliosis

the Cobb angle in scoliosis patients; however, no study has compared these two exercises.
Therefore, the effects of these two exercise therapies on scoliosis patients were compared
in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 24 female students with scoliosis, who were then randomly

Each subject was given an explanation about the purpose of this study and
the exercise method, and voluntarily signed the informed consent form before participating
in this experiment. The experiment was conducted according to the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Participants who had neurological findings or an operation, those
who recently received surgical treatment, those who wore an orthosis, or those who were
periodically taking medicine were excluded.</p><p>Schroth exercises were performed three times a week for 12 weeks. Each 60-min session
consisted of preparation (cat walking and breathing exercise: 10&#x02005;min), stretching
(stretching the chest part: 5&#x02005;min), the main exercise (lying right click concave, lying
aside static postural control training, sitting posture adjustment exercise, and muscle
cylinder: 40&#x02005;min), and wrap-up (moving the ribs: 5&#x02005;min)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Schroth exercise was applied in accordance with the bending
shape of each subject, along with three-dimensional Schroth rotational breathing. In
everyday life, it is important to maintain a correct posture, and depending on the curve
type during daily life activities (such as sitting, standing, or walking), primarily for
students who sit for long periods in school, activities need to be detailed and
implemented<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Cobb angle was
measured in a standing-straight position with a radiography apparatus (CR 85-X, USA).</p><p>Each 60-min session of the Pilates exercise consisted of preparation (10&#x02005;min); the main
exercise divided into spinal correction exercises, core-strengthening exercises, and balance
exercises (40&#x02005;min); and wrap-up (5&#x02005;min). The Pilates exercise was applied along with Pilates
trunk breathing.</p><p>The Cobb angle was measured in the standing-straight position with a radiography apparatus
(CR 85-X). The weight distribution change was measured in the standing position for 8&#x02005;s in a
static condition by using the radiography apparatus (CR 85-X), and the average of the three
measurements was analyzed.</p><p>An intragroup comparison was conducted on the changes in the Cobb angle and weight

their effect on the change in the Cobb angle and weight distribution of scoliosis patients.
The exercises were performed three times a week, and the experiment was conducted for a
12-week period.</p><p>The Schroth three-dimensional exercise approach had significant effects on decreasing the
Cobb angle and pain in patients with scoliosis<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that scoliosis
decreases the bias of weight, considering that it affects the degree of lateral bending and
the imbalance of pressure on the soles, and that the difference in weight load decreases
with an improved angle<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Pilates
exercise has been reported to change the trunk flexibility through the backbone segmentation
movement<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to improve the lateral
bending of the spinal column and static balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the application of the Pilates exercise in women in
their 20s improved posture and caused significant differences in the sense of static feet
balance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the intragroup comparison, the Cobb angle showed significant changes in both groups. For
weight distribution, the SEG showed significant differences in the total weight between the
concave and convex sides but the PEG did not show significant differences (p &#x0003e; 0.05).
Also in the intragroup comparison, the SEG showed significant differences in the changes to
the Cobb angle and weight distribution compared with the PEG.</p><p>These results suggest that both the Schroth and Pilates exercises significantly improved
the Cobb angle; however, the Cobb angle decreased more effectively in the SEG than in the
PEG owing to the three-dimensional rotational breathing during Schroth exercises. For the
weight distribution changes, it has been reported in a previous study that the weight
loading position changed according to the level, degree, and shape of bending of the
scoliosis patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, in this
study, the SEG also showed significant effects on weight loading, as the Cobb angle was more
effectively improved in this group.</p><p>Therefore, in patients with scoliosis, the Schroth exercise is thought to be more effective
in improving the Cobb angle and weight distribution than the Pilates exercise.</p><p>Concerning the limitations of this study, the patients with scoliosis were limited to the
age of students, and these students had difficulty in finding time to participate in this
study owing to conflict with their class schedules. Furthermore, male scoliosis patients
were not included. Future studies need to investigate the differences in the effects of the
Schroth and Pilates exercises in relation to age or gender.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group>: A comparison on the influences of Schroth-based static scoliosis exercise
