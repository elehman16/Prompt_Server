Rectal NSAIDs have been shown in prospective studies to decrease the incidence of this complication, but the indication is not generalized in clinical practice.

The patients were determined to be at high risk based on validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. Post-ERCP pancreatitis was defined as the presence of new upper abdominal pain, hyperamylasemia/hyperlipasemia (at least three times the upper limit) 2&#x000a0;hours after the procedure and hospitalization at least 48&#x000a0;hours because of the complication.

Acute pancreatitis represents the most common and feared complication following ERCP. The reported incidence of this complication is 1&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% according to the presence of high-risk factors or the presence of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In most of the prospective series, the incidence reported ranged between 3.5&#x000a0;% and 20&#x000a0;% for nonselected and for high-risk patients, respectively. Independent risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) are either patient- or procedure-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Although most episodes of PEP are mild (80&#x02013;90&#x000a0;%), a small proportion of patients develop severe pancreatitis, resulting in prolonged hospitalization, a long stay in the Intensive Care Unit and utilization of major hospital resources. These patients have increased morbidity and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite technical improvements and increased skills for endoscopists, the incidence of PEP has not yet decreased substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>To date, pancreatic stent placement appears to be the best way to reduce the incidence of this complication in high-risk patients; it is currently recommended by some guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and is considered the standard of care for the prevention of PEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, pancreatic stenting is a difficult maneuver to perform and comes relatively late (at the end of the endoscopic procedure), mainly in patients with difficult cannulation of the biliary&#x02013;pancreatic ducts; in addition, many endoscopists are not familiar with this procedure. This unique maneuver may leave the patient worse off than if no attempt was made to perform the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is no gold standard to prevent this complication. For this reason, more than 35 pharmacologic agents have been studied in many prospective clinical trials. To date, no medication has proven to be consistently effective in preventing PEP and no pharmacological prophylaxis is in widespread clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potent inhibitors of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, cyclooxygenase and neutrophil&#x02013;endothelial interactions, all believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. NSAIDs are inexpensive and easily administered and have a favorable risk profile when given as a single dose, making them an attractive option in the prevention of PEP. Preliminary studies evaluating the protective effects of single-dose rectal indomethacin or diclofenac in PEP have been conducted, and meta-analyses suggest a benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Prophylaxis of PEP constitutes a continuous challenge. The ideal prophylactic agent should be a drug with a low cost, be easily administrated and with mild or no adverse effects. The identification of patients at a high risk of this complication is difficult before the endoscopic procedure because many risk factors are procedure-related. There is some evidence to suggest a beneficial effect from the use of NSAIDs applied rectally immediately after the conclusion of ERCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rectally administered indomethacin in reducing the incidence of PEP in high-risk patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This was a controlled clinical trial conducted between July 2012 and December 2013 in patients scheduled for ERCP at the Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Department of Gastroenterology of the Specialties Hospital of the Western Medical Center in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.</p><p>The inclusion criteria selected patients with an elevated baseline risk of PEP on the basis of prospectively validated patient- and procedure-related independent risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Patients were eligible if they met one or more of the following criteria: clinical suspicion of SOD, a history of PEP, pancreatic sphincterotomy, precut sphincterectomy, more than eight cannulation attempts, pneumatic dilatation of an intact biliary sphincter, or ampullectomy. In addition, they were also eligible for inclusion if they met at least two of the following criteria: age less than 50&#x000a0;years and female sex, a history of recurrent pancreatitis (&#x0003e; two episodes), three or more injections of contrast agent into the pancreatic duct with at least one injection to the tail of the pancreas, excessive injection of a contrast agent into the pancreatic duct resulting in opacification of pancreatic acini, or the acquisition of a cytologic specimen from the pancreatic duct with the use of a brush.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: unwillingness or inability to consent to the study, age less than 18&#x000a0;years, pregnancy, breastfeeding mother, standard contraindication for ERCP, hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs, previous use of NSAIDs within 1&#x000a0;week, creatinine level&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;mg/dl, active or recent (4&#x000a0;weeks) gastrointestinal hemorrhage, chronic calcified pancreatitis, pancreatic head malignancy, procedure performed on major papilla/ventral pancreatic duct in a patient with pancreas divisum, ERCP for biliary stent removal or exchange without anticipated pancreatogram, subjects with prior biliary sphincterotomy now scheduled for repeat biliary therapy without anticipated pancreatogram and anticipated inability to follow the study protocol.</p><p>The ERCP procedures were performed with the patient under topical pharyngeal anesthesia with 2&#x000a0;% lidocaine and after administration of sedation (midazolam) and analgesia (fentanyl) intravenously, with dosage at the discretion of the endoscopist. Patients received complementary oxygen (3 to 5&#x000a0;l/min) through a nasal external device and infusion of 200 to 500&#x000a0;ml of 0.9&#x000a0;% saline solution. The material used to perform ERCP consisted of a video duodenoscope model TJF-Q180V (Olympus&#x02122;), traction sphincterotome for selective cannulation of the bile duct, needle scalpel to perform the precut sphincterotomy, hydrophilic guide wire via the bile duct, Dormia basket and/or balloon catheter for stone extraction, and nonionic water-soluble contrast in concentration of 300&#x000a0;mg I/ml (Optiray&#x02122; 300) for opacification of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic stents were only used to treat pancreatic fistulas, not to prevent any pancreatitis events in any cases. All patients were monitored continuously during the procedure, with measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation.</p><p>Eligible patients provided written informed consent before ERCP and underwent randomization at the conclusion of the endoscopic procedure. Patients without risk factors were not included in the study, based on procedure-related factors alone. If patients met the inclusion criteria, they were randomly assigned to receive a 100&#x000a0;mg suppository of indomethacin or a 2.4&#x000a0;g glycerin suppository of identical appearance after ERCP while patients were under the effect of sedative medication. All patients were kept under surveillance until they became completely awake to prevent spontaneous expulsion of the suppository. The patients, staff endoscopists, residents and researchers were blinded to the treatment assigned to each participant.</p><p>The following information was collected. 1) Clinical history, particularly patient-related risk factors for PEP, blood exams for determination of basal amylase, liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as results of ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract. 2) All information generated during the ERCP was recorded, particularly parameters related to the procedure risk factors for developing acute pancreatitis. In addition, other nonpancreatic complications were recorded, such as perforation and bleeding. 3) Adverse events related to the rectally applied indomethacin or glycerin suppositories were recorded, such as expulsion, irritation and bleeding.</p><p>PEP was considered the main outcome variable and was defined as the development of new or increased abdominal pain consistent with pancreatitis, and elevated amylase or lipase greater than three times the normal upper limit until 24&#x000a0;hours after the procedure, and hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) for at least 2 nights. The severity was determined according to consensus guidelines, with mild PEP resulting in a hospitalization of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;days, moderate PEP resulting in a hospitalization of 4&#x02013;10 days, and severe PEP resulting in a hospitalization of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;days or leading to the development of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst, or requiring percutaneous or surgical intervention. Patients who presented acute pancreatitis after CPRE procedure, were followed up for 30&#x000a0;days after hospital discharge. Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia was defined as any amylase level at least three times above the normal serum level in the absence of abdominal pain, as defined by the consensus criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Patients were kept under surveillance in the endoscopy recovery area for 3&#x000a0;hours after ERCP. Measurement of serum amylase was performed at 2&#x000a0;hours after ERCP in all study patients. Outpatients who were asymptomatic after 4 to 6&#x000a0;hours of surveillance were discharged to home with monitoring for signs and symptoms of acute PEP by phone for 24&#x000a0;hours. Hospitalized patients who were asymptomatic after 4 to 6&#x000a0;hours of surveillance remained in their assigned bed where clinical surveillance was continued for up to 24&#x000a0;hours. If new abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatic origin appeared at any moment during the surveillance period, the 2-hour amylase level was noted and confirmed with serum lipase determination in the following hours. In addition, all usual laboratory exams were performed when acute pancreatitis of any etiology was established. All patients diagnosed with PEP were managed under the medical care of the Department of Gastroenterology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p>We evaluated if the application of rectal indomethacin had better results than placebo for the prophylaxis of PEP, with a known incidence of PEP of 25&#x000a0;% in high-risk patients and about 7.5&#x000a0;% in the study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

In this study, patients undergoing ERCP for suspected biliary obstruction were included (they were not considered at high risk of PEP). They found an incidence of pancreatitis in the placebo group of 16&#x000a0;% (12/75) and 5.3&#x000a0;% (4/75) in the indomethacin group; this difference was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034). All cases of pancreatitis were categorized as mild according to the consensus criteria, as occurred in our series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In 2007, Cheon et al. published the results of a clinical trial in the USA, including patients at high (179/207) and low (28/207) risk of developing PEP. They compared the administration of 50&#x000a0;mg of oral diclofenac against placebo, applied 30 to 90&#x000a0;minutes before and 4 to 6&#x000a0;hours after ERCP. The incidence of pancreatitis in high-risk patients in the placebo group was 18&#x000a0;% (16/89) and 17.8&#x000a0;% (16/90) in the diclofenac group. The difference in the incidence and severity of pancreatitis between the two treatment groups was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>More recently, Senol et al. assessed 80 patients and compared the administration of 75&#x000a0;mg of intramuscular diclofenac followed by infusion of 0.9&#x000a0;% NaCl for 4&#x000a0;hours (5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;ml/kg) versus placebo (infusion of 500&#x000a0;cc of 0.9&#x000a0;% NaCl for 4&#x000a0;hours). The intervention was performed immediately after ERCP. The incidence of pancreatitis in the placebo group was 17.5&#x000a0;% (7/40) and 7.5&#x000a0;% (3/40) in the diclofenac group. This difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.176), which may have been because of the small number of patients included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In the same context, Otsuka et al. compared the administration of 50&#x000a0;mg transrectal diclofenac against placebo (glycerin suppository) in 104 patients, applied 30&#x000a0;minutes before ERCP. They reported an incidence of pancreatitis of 3.9&#x000a0;% (2/51) for the diclofenac group and 18.9&#x000a0;% (10/53) in the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Elmunzer et al. conducted the most important controlled clinical trial, in which they enrolled 602 patients and compared 100&#x000a0;mg transrectal indomethacin against placebo (glycerin suppository) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The intervention was performed immediately after ERCP. The incidence of pancreatitis in the placebo group was 16.9&#x000a0;% (52/307) and 9.2&#x000a0;% (27/295) in the indomethacin group, which was a significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). It should be noted that in this study the authors placed a pancreatic stent in 246 patients in the indomethacin group (83.4&#x000a0;%) and 250 individuals in the placebo group (81.4&#x000a0;%). In addition, it should be highlighted that most of the patients were evaluated by clinical suspicion of SOD and over 15&#x000a0;% of cases and controls had a history of PEP.</p><p>D&#x000f6;br&#x000f6;nte et al. conducted a clinical trial that included 228 patients and evaluated the rectal application of 100&#x000a0;mg indomethacin against placebo (glycerin suppository), administered 10&#x000a0;minutes before performing ERCP. The incidence of pancreatitis in the indomethacin group was 8.4&#x000a0;% (11/130) and 11.2&#x000a0;% (11/98) for the control group, showing no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This controlled clinical trial had an imbalance in the number of controls with a difference of 32 patients at the time of publishing, so the authors&#x02019; conclusions are poorly supported.</p><p>Abu-Safieh et al. conducted a randomized double-blind controlled trial in Palestine, including a total of 182 patients and comparing the intramuscular administration of 75&#x000a0;mg diclofenac with 3&#x000a0;ml of isotonic saline as a placebo. They reported an overall incidence of PEP of 10&#x000a0;%, 6.9 (6/89) for the diclofenac group and 12.9&#x000a0;% (12/93) for the placebo group. There was no significance difference in the incidence of PEP between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.164) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>D&#x000f6;br&#x000f6;nte et al. recently published the results of a multicenter clinical trial in 665 standard-risk patients divided into 347 study patients that received 100&#x000a0;mg of indomethacin before ERCP and 318 controls that received a placebo. The incidence of PEP was 5.8&#x000a0;% and 6.9&#x000a0;% (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As in their previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], there was an imbalance in the number of controls with a difference of 29 patients at the time of publishing, so the authors&#x02019; conclusions may be insufficiently supported because of this difference.</p><p>From 2008 to the present, at least 10 meta-analyses have evaluated the results of the different clinical trials that have been reported. The results allow us to conclude that NSAIDs such as indomethacin or diclofenac used in the different routes of administration reduce the incidence of asymptomatic hyperamylasemia, pancreatitis and moderate to severe episodes of pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The results of our study are relevant because the drug was administrated immediately after completion of the endoscopic procedure, as was performed by Murray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Khoshbaten [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Elmunzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Only the study reported by Elmunzer used indomethacin; in the other two studies, diclofenac was preferred. The main difference between our study and that reported by Elmunzer was the combined use of pancreatic stenting in more than 80&#x000a0;% of patients in the latter. In our study, pancreatic stenting was only used to treat pancreatic fistulas.</p><p>Traditionally, it has been considered that the placement of a small caliber (5 Fr) stent in the pancreatic duct was the standard treatment to prevent this complication. It has also been recommended in the management guidelines for the prevention of pancreatitis in patients considered to be at high risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, Akbar and colleagues published the results of a meta-analysis in which a total of 29 studies were included (22 with pancreatic stent placement and 7 with the use of NSAIDs), showing that stenting or transrectal administration of NSAIDs was superior to placebo in the prevention of PEP. The combination of transrectal application of NSAIDs and the use of stents showed no greater effectiveness in the prevention of PEP when compared with that of each intervention alone. The results further demonstrated that transrectally administered NSAIDs alone were superior to pancreatic stenting in preventing PEP (OR 0.48, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.26 to 0.87) and must be regarded as the first-line preventive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the United States Cooperative for Outcomes Research in Endoscopy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] published a post hoc analysis of the randomized controlled trial published by Elmunzer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They found that the incidence of PEP in placebo patients who received a failed pancreatic stent (FPS) was 34.7&#x000a0;%, and in those patients in this group with a successful pancreatic stent (PS), the incidence was 16.2&#x000a0;% and in patients without a PS it was only 12.1&#x000a0;%. In contrast, in patients who received a suppository of 100&#x000a0;mg of indomethacin immediately after the ERCP, the incidence of PEP was 5.3&#x000a0;% in the FPS patients, 9.6&#x000a0;% in patients with a successful PS and 10.3&#x000a0;% in those patients without a PS. This study reveals the important and relevant results of prophylactic use of rectal NSAIDs.</p><p>However, to support the previous conclusion, a high-quality multicenter randomized clinical trial is required to better understand the efficacy of pancreatic stents with and without rectal NSAIDs and with rectal NSAIDs alone to prevent PEP in high-risk patients.</p><p>Another important issue to consider is the cost of prophylactic treatments. In the hospital where this study was conducted, the cost of a suppository of 100&#x000a0;mg of indomethacin was USD $0.08, the glycerin suppository had a cost of USD $0.20 and the pancreatic endoprothesis had a cost of USD $350.00.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that indomethacin administered rectally immediately after ERCP reduced the incidence of PEP in high-risk patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ERCP</term><def><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEP</term><def><p>Post-ERCP pancreatitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD</term><def><p>Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPS</term><def><p>Failed pancreatic stent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PS</term><def><p>Successful pancreatic stent</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p><sup>1</sup>ADVF, <sup>1</sup>DVC, <sup>1</sup>GCJ, <sup>1</sup>MLA, participated in the protocol design, identification and inclusion of candidates, performed the endoscopic interventions and were involved in the critical review of the results. <sup>2</sup>ChTM, <sup>2</sup>FOC, <sup>2</sup>MAMD, <sup>2</sup>GRJ, <sup>2</sup>RFJ, <sup>2</sup> CLJA, <sup>2</sup>COAO, <sup>3</sup>AGG, <sup>4</sup>AVAS and <sup>2</sup>GOA participated in the protocol design, patient follow-up, collection of clinical information and statistical analysis.
