Caudal anesthetics usually provide analgesia for approximately 4&#x02013;6 h.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Ketamine added to bupivacaine in caudal block (CB) was shown to increase the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The analgesic effect of caudal epidural ketamine is probably due to its interaction with the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or opioid receptors in the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>CB involves the introduction of a local anesthetic (LA) into caudal epidural space, requires the child to be positioned appropriately under deep sedation or general anesthesia, needs skill, and is operator dependent. The risk of technical failure exists and the use of sonography improved the precision of CB and increased success rate of caudal injection.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It can cause complications such as bone marrow puncture, intestinal damage, infection, hematoma, inadvertent subcutaneous, subarachnoid or intravascular injection of the LA, and systemic toxicity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Other associated adverse effects include urinary retention and possible motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The central nervous system disorders, spinal deformities, inflammation of the block site, and coagulation disorders are contra-indications for caudal anesthesia, so the search continues to find a less invasive substitute to control pain.</p><p>Compared with caudal analgesia, intraoperative wound instillation with an LA is a simple, effective, noninvasive and inexpensive means of providing postoperative analgesia that could offer the advantage of lower costs, time, and risks.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Topical approaches to analgesia have the potential to produce pain relief with minimal adverse systemic effects due to low plasma levels.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] NMDA and other glutamate receptors have been found to be located peripherally on sensory afferent nerve endings and on cells adjacent to the nerve endings (e.g., keratinocytes, immune cells).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This provided the initial impetus for exploring the peripheral and topical applications of ketamine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of low-dose ketamine/bupivacaine combination administered either caudally or topically in children undergoing day-case unilateral inguinal herniotomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind comparative study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Egypt, was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02462174) and followed Helsinki Declaration.

Excluded from the study were children with a history of developmental delay or mental retardation, clinically important renal, hepatic, cardiac, or neurological conditions, seizures, known or suspected coagulopathy, allergy to any LA, congenital anomaly of the spine, or infection at the sacral region.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anesthesia</title><p>After standard fasting times and without premedication, anesthesia was induced with 8% of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen. Standard monitoring included electrocardiography, end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial oxygen saturation continuously, and noninvasive blood pressure every 5 min (Cardiocap II, Datex-Ohmeda, Finland). The airway was established using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen/air mixture, and the depth of anesthesia was adjusted accordingly with a goal of 80&#x02013;120% baseline noninvasive mean arterial pressure. Spontaneous breathing was maintained during surgery. All patients received intravenous (IV) paracetamol 15 mg/kg. No sedatives or opioids were administered during operation. At the end of surgery, the LMA was removed, and the child was transferred to the Post-Anesthetic Care Unit so long as there was no postoperative compromise in the airway or hemodynamic instability. Pain intensity and Aldrete&#x02013;Krolik recovery score[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were recorded every 10 min until an Aldrete score &#x0003e;9 was achieved.

Fifteen minutes after performing CB, surgery was initiated. Cardioacceleration changes (increasing heart rate and noninvasive mean arterial pressure &#x0003e;15% in response to noxious surgical stimulation) and/or patient movement of his limbs were interpreted as insufficient analgesia. In such instances, CB was considered failed, then 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;g/kg IV fentanyl were administered, and the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>Topical ketamine group patients did not receive any caudal intervention. Otherwise, a mixture of 0.3 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was sprayed by the surgeon around the spermatic cord and upon the ilioinguinal nerve (running medially through the inguinal canal along with cord structures[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) and adjacent structures in a fan-shaped manner.

The decision to place a urinary catheter for urinary retention and evaluation of micturition were made by a urologist. Children were discharged from hospital 4 h after surgery if they were conscious, hemodynamically stable, pain-free, started oral intake, voiding, walking in an appropriate manner for age, with absence of retching, vomiting, or other side-effects.

Compared with the caudal route, the topical drug combination also provided lower postoperative NRS scores, reduced number for analgesic requests with no difference in total oral analgesic consumption in the 1<sup>st</sup> 48 h postoperative.</p><p>The key nerves in the inguinal region are the ilioinguinal nerve, iliohypogastric nerve, and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the current study, we could visualize the ilioinguinal nerve and spray our LA combination under direct vision. The other two nerves are difficult to directly visualize while lying within the spermatic cord. However, with spraying our LA generously along the spermatic cord and adjacent structures, we can suspect that those nerves were also anesthetized.</p><p>In the current study, postoperative pain during hospital stay was assessed with two types of pain scales for infants and children (CHIPPS and FLACC scales) to avoid inappropriate administration of IV analgesics. Except for CHIPPS score at 15 min, differences in pain scores were not clinically significant between the two groups for the first 3 h postoperative. Clinically relevant differences in pain scores between the two groups occurred after 12 h after surgery, and this is consistent with the end of analgesic duration of ketamine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The difference in early postoperative CHIPPS score at 15 min in the topical group is consistent with the time needed to reach a peak effect, compared with the preemptive caudal route. Postoperative agitation scores in the topical group were higher on recovery from anesthesia and lower from 15 min postoperative afterward, and as pain is an integral component in agitation assessment, this difference also may be attributed to the time needed to reach a peak effect.</p><p>The duration of postoperative analgesia in CK group is consistent with previous reports of CK in association with bupivacaine for intra- and post-operative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Despite the clinical effectiveness of CK/bupivacaine, four children were excluded from analysis because of failure of CB, another four suffered from retention of urine, and two developed residual postoperative motor weakness. The caudal epidural analgesia has two main drawbacks. First are the complications of the technique itself including failure, needle trauma, systemic toxicity, retention of urine, residual postoperative motor weakness, etc., Children are rarely subjected to detailed assessment after day-case surgery and there is a potential to underestimate the rate of complications.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This is particularly important in neonates and infants, who may not only be more susceptible to perturbations in neural development but who are also unable to report sensory symptoms and as they are not walking, subtle motor deficits may be missed. Second is the neurotoxic effect of caudally administered drugs. The neuraxial route of delivery exposes local tissues (meninges, roots, and spinal parenchyma) to extraordinary concentrations of an agent (mg/mL), which because of local restrictions in redistribution may persist for extended intervals. Clinical studies are well suited to assess tolerability and efficacy but cannot reliably confirm safety and absence of morphological or neurological effects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The neurotoxic effects of ketamine after intrathecal administration were observed in animal studies[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and after continuous intrathecal administration for the management of neuropathic cancer pain.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Consequently, its administration in the epidural space has been seriously questioned recently,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the use of neuraxial ketamine for pediatric postoperative analgesia is decreasing in some countries.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Although no major neurological complications after a single dose of 0.25&#x02013;0.5 mg/kg ketamine were observed,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] preclinical safety studies and larger long-term epidemiological trials investigating possible neurological complications after CK administration are warranted, and topical administration of ketamine could be a safe alternative.</p><p>Our aim is not to discourage the use of neuraxial anesthesia but rather to investigate for other effective yet less invasive substitutes for postoperative pain relief. The indications for caudal analgesia in pediatric day case surgeries should be reviewed, and anesthetists are required to evaluate the relative risks and benefits of techniques, interventions, and drugs for each individual patient on a daily basis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms the safety and analgesic effectiveness of precise administration of lower volumes of LAs (0.3 ml/kg) and ketamine 0.5 mg/kg through the local wound instillation.
