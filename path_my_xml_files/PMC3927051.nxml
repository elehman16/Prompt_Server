exercise according to the positions of the arms and the rotation of the humerus on the
subhumeral acromial space. [Subjects] The study subjects were 34 subjects without shoulder
pain. [Methods] Ultrasonographic measurements of the acromiohumeral distance of the
subjects were made at three shoulder positions: 90&#x000b0; flexion, scaption at 90&#x000b0; abduction,
and 90&#x000b0; abduction in an upright sitting position. The subjects were instructed to
vertically push against a table to the maximum level with the humerus in internal,
neutral, and external rotation. The measurements were made three times in each position.
[Results] There was a significant difference in acromiohuneral distance between neutral
and internal rotation of the humerus, and between external rotation and internal rotation
of the humerus. In the scaption position, there was a significant difference between
neutral and internal rotation of the humerus, and between external rotation and internal
rotation of the humerus. In the 90&#x000b0; flexion position, there was a significant difference
between neutral and internal rotation, and between neutral and external rotation. There
was a significant difference between the flexion position and the abduction position, and
between the flexion position and the scaption position. In terms of the internal rotation
of the humerus, there was a significant difference between 90&#x000b0; flexion and 90&#x000b0; abduction.
[Conclusion] These findings can be applied in exercises prescribed to increase the
acromiohumeral distance and to aid the treatment and evaluation of shoulder
dysfunctions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ultrasonographic</kwd><kwd>Acromiohumeral distance</kwd><kwd>Humeral rotation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stability of the glenohumeral joint is provided by static elements (articular surface and
ligament) and dynamic elements (muscles). The rotator cuff stabilizes the glenohumeral joint
in different shoulder positions and adjusts the translations of the humeral head<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most common cause of shoulder pain is rotator cuff disease. Rotator cuff tear reduces
stability and triggers superior migration of the humeral head in abduction, which may lead
to acromial impingement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Slight upward
translation occurs in the humeral head of normal shoulders, but severe rotator cuff tear
triggers major upward translation, which causes subacromial impingement. Superior migration
of the humeral head may be measured by the acromiohumeral distance. The cause of upward
displacement of the humeral head has not been clearly verified. Laceration of the tendon
structure that maintains the space and lack of stability of the rotator cuff are considered
to increase traction of the deltoid muscle<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Scapular dyskinesis refers to an abnormal position or movement of the scapula during active
motions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, The condition makes the
subacromial space smaller<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it

and functions of the shoulders. Desmeules and his co-researchers recommended ultrasonography
as a measurement tool for suspected when shoulder impingement syndrome, and reported that
there are changes in the subacromial space according to different positions of the
shoulders<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that
patients with rotator cuff disease have a small acromiohumeral distance compared with
healthy people<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that the
acromiohumeral distance is smaller in patients with impingement syndrome than in those with
healthy shoulders on magnetic resonance images (MRI)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultrasound is less expensive and more practical than MRI, and is a
valid radiographic examination method for the measurement of acromiohumeral distance
(r=0.77&#x02013;0.85)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinically, diagnoses of shoulder impingement and rotator cuff tear are common. The
subacromial space is smaller in patients with symptoms of scapular dykinesia or impingement
syndrome. Endo<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that impingement
occurs frequently at a humeral elevation of 90&#x000b0; and named it the impingement zone.</p><p>The hypothesis of this study was that resistance exercise will have different effects on
the subacromial space according to the location of the arms and the degree of rotation of
the humerus. This study performed a comparative analysis of the effects of resistance
exercise on the subhumeral acromial space according to the location of the arms and the
rotation of the humerus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 34 participants, 20 males and 14 females. The average age
of the participants was 29.5 (range 25&#x02013;39) years. The criteria for selection were: no
history of orthopedic surgery, no fracture, pain, or neurological damage to the shoulders,
and no limitation in the movement of the arms. The acromiohumeral distance of the right side
of healthy subjects without shoulder pain was measured with a diagnostic ultrasound system
according to the locations of the arms and humeral rotation during resistance exercise. The
purpose of this study was sufficiently explained to the subjects and their consent to
voluntarily participate in this study was obtained. This study was approved by the Hanmaeum
Hospital Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The ultrasound equipment used was a HDI 5000 of ALT-PHILPS machine, with a linear probe
transducer operated at a frequency at 7.5&#x02005;MHz<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. To determine the acromiohumeral distance, the shortest distance
between the humeral head and the subacromial area was measured using the Picture Archiving
and Communication System.</p><p>The participants were seated upright on a chair, with their hips and knees flexed to 90&#x000b0;
and their feet resting flat on the ground, looking forward (straight ahead). To measure the
acromiohumeral distance at rest, three ultrasound measurements were obtained of the subjects
with their upper limbs placed in a position of 0&#x000b0; abduction, with a neutral shoulder
rotation, 90&#x000b0; elbow flexion, and their forearms in a mid-prone position. The subjects
adopted three shoulder positions: 90&#x000b0; flexion, scaption with 90&#x000b0; abduction, and 90&#x000b0;
abduction in an upright sitting posture. Ultrasound images were obtained of the three
different humeral rotations, neutral rotation, external rotation, and internal rotation, in
the following three Shoulder positions, 90&#x000b0; flexion, scaption with 90&#x000b0; abduction, 90&#x000b0;
abduction, in an upright sitting posture. The subjects were instructed to vertically push
the table to the maximum level with the humerus in internal, neutral, and external rotation.
In each position, internal rotation of the humerus was measured with the thumb downward, and
external rotation of the humerus was measured with the thumb outward to the maximum level,
with the shoulder not elevated. Scaption was defined as 30&#x000b0; anterior to the frontal plane,
and the angle was verified with a goniometer.</p><p>The ultrasound transducer was placed parallel to the flat surface at the most anterior
aspect of the acromion, with the long axis of the probe in the plane of the scapula to scan
the shoulder. The acromiohumeral distance was defined as the shortest distance in a straight
line connecting the most inferior aspect of the acromion and the humeral head.</p><p>SPSS ver 12.0 statistical program was used for the analysis of the study data. Repeated
measures analysis of variance was employed to examine the significance of differences in the
subacromial space distance according to the locations of the arms of the subjects and the
degree of humeral rotation. A posthoc test (Bonferroni test) was conducted when of a
significant difference in the measured values of the different postures was found. To
analyze the intra-rater reliability of the ultrasonographic measurements, the intraclass
correlation coefficient for the measured values was calculated. A significance level of &#x003b1;

resulting from shoulder disease and pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Karduna and his co-researchers reported that there was a
correlation between abnormalities in the acromiohumeral distance and abnormal scapular
movement<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Others have reported a
correlation between the location and the movement of the humerus and rupture of the rotator

Ludewig and Cook<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that subacromial impingement is associated with a
decrease in upward rotation of the scapula.</p><p>Dewhurst asserted that muscular function changes in patients with impingement syndrome
aggravat the condition, and that the subacromial space is affected by shortened pectoral and
levator scapulae muscles, thoracic kyphosis, and bad posture<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. That study further noted that strengthening of the supraspinatus
muscle, glenohumeral joint, infraspinatus muscle, teres minor muscle, and subscapularis
muscle, in other words, muscles affecting the stability and mobility of the rotator cuff,
was required in addition to interactions among the serratus anterior muscle, upper trapezius
muscle, and lower trapezius muscle, for effective scapular rotation.</p><p>At 0&#x000b0; shoulder abduction, Liu and his co-researcher reported that the abductor role of the
deltoid did not affect<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to
Hughes and An<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> at 90&#x000b0; of shoulder
abduction, the deltoid plays a significant role in abduction. In general, muscle activities
of the anterior and middle part of the deltoid are high at scaptions of 60&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0;, and the
activities of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis are high between 30&#x000b0; and
60&#x000b0;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Jobe and Pink<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the
subacromial space became smaller during abduction and elevation of the arms, and that a
decreased subacromial space increased the load on the rotator cuff tendons, possibly
triggering impingement in tennis players. During the initial action of abduction, the
humeral cephalad moves toward the acromion process and the subscapularis forces the head of
the humerus downward<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The infraspinatus
and teres minor comprise the posterior cuff and provide posteroinferior force to the humeral
head, and resistance against superior and anterior translation of the humeral head<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Azzoni and Cabitza<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the
ultrasonographic method was easy and useful for diagnosing patients with musculoskeletal
damages, but it had disadvantages in that results depend on the skill of the measurer who
requires in its use. However, in the present study, the intraclass correlation coefficient
of the ultrasonographic method used to measure the acromiohumeral distance was high (0.88 to
0.97). This level of reliability is similar to that reported in other studies. In a study by
Cotty and his coresearcher<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
acromiohumeral distance of a normal shoulder was 10.5&#x02005;mm. In the present study, the
acromiohumeral distance while the subjects were at rest was 11.0&#x02005;mm. The average value for
females was 10.6&#x02005;mm and that of males was 11.3&#x02005;mm, and no significant difference between the
two groups was found by the independent t-test.</p><p>This study also applied isometric resistance exercise in a vertical downward direction in
90&#x000b0; abduction, 90&#x000b0; flexion and scaption with 90&#x000b0; abduction, in which impingement commonly
occurs. The acromiohumeral distances of the postures of the shoulders with the humerus in a
neutral position were significantly different, with the distance largest in 90&#x000b0; abduction.
The actions of the subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor may have caused inferior
translation of the humeral head, and decreased the acromiohumeral distance. According to a
study by Sharkey and Marder<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, When
isometric resistance exercise was conducted with the shoulder in a 90&#x000b0; shoulder abduction
position, the scapularis and infraspinatus were activated simultaneously. According to
Hughes and An<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> to resist superior
translation of the humeral head, abductor moments should be made in an inferior direction,
because the teres minor below the scapula and the humerus create weak adductor torque.</p><p>In addition, in each position, the acromiohumeral distance was significantly larger with
internal rotation of the humerus. As the subscapularis, an internal rotator, aids the
activities of the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, and the teres major, it provides
medial rotation of the humerus. This enhances, the activity of the anterior and posterior
fibers of the deltoid, the triceps long head, the teres major, and the pectoralis major and
triggers adduction, of the humerus, thereby increasing the acromiohumeral distance. The
increase in the acromiohumeral distance decreased pressure on the subhumeral acromial
space.</p><p>The amount of change in the acromiohumeral distance necessary to influence a patient&#x02019;s
symptom and shoulder function remains unclear. A limitation of this study was that it did
not monitor scapular motion or muscle activity. Research that complements the current work
is therefore considered necessary.</p><p>This study used a diagnostic ultrasound system to comparatively analyze the effects of
resistance exercise on the subhumeral acromial space according to the locations of the arms
and the rotation of the humerus. The subhumeral acromial space was largest in 90&#x000b0; abduction
with the humerus internally rotated, and smallest in 90&#x000b0; flexion without humeral rotation.
Overall, the subhumeral acromial space was large when the humerus was internally rotated.
Therefore, the subhumeral acromial space appears to differ according to the amount of
humeral rotation and the locations of the arms. The larger size of the subhumeral acromial
space during internal rotation is due to the internally rotated muscles triggering inferior
translation of the humerus increasing the space.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Driscoll</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dynamic glenohumeral stability provided by the rotator
