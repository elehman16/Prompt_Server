Although efficacious, a common and unpopular side effect of clozapine treatment is clozapine-induced hypersalivation (CIH), which can contribute to non-adherence. The standard treatment for CIH in the UK is hyoscine hydrobromide but this may aggravate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia while glycopyrrolate may be an effective alternative with a more tolerable side effect profile.

We aim to recruit 42 patients who have been prescribed clozapine and are experiencing hypersalivation, and randomise them to one of three study arms (either hyoscine, glycopyrrolate or placebo). The primary outcome measures will be the participant recruitment and attrition rates, and the secondary outcome will be the metrics of the daytime hypersalivation measure. After a 1-week washout period (discontinuing CIH medication, if any), there will be a 4-week treatment period where participants will be titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose of hyoscine, glycopyrrolate or placebo. Measurements of daytime salivation, nocturnal salivation, cognition and side effects will be taken during home visits in week 2 and week 5. Information on salivation and side effects will also be taken through telephone calls in week 3 and week 4. To gather information on the experience of study participants, exit interviews will also be requested with all participants who drop out of the study and a sample of participants who complete the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>There is currently no convincing evidence for hyoscine, or any other medication, as an effective treatment for CIH.

Approximately 20,000 patients are prescribed clozapine in the UK and, in almost all cases, it is a lifelong prescription. Clozapine-induced hypersalivation (CIH) is a common side effect of clozapine treatment and occurs in up to 80% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CIH may be the source of profound embarrassment and social stigma, lowering self-esteem, increasing social isolation and ultimately exacerbating psychological problems. CIH may also cause inflammation of the salivary glands, salivary calculi, and skin infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sleep quality may also be adversely affected, with some patients describing the sensation of choking on excessive saliva at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are accompanying practical and financial difficulties (e.g. the regular disposal of soaked pillows and clothing) and a recent survey of clozapine patients showed that hypersalivation is the most undesirable side effect of clozapine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Crucially, adverse side effects may eventually lead to patients discontinuing clozapine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], considerably increasing the risk of relapse and hospitalisation. The effective treatment of CIH is therefore vital to patient experience and continued wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current treatment and limitations</title><p>Because CIH is not dose-related, a reduction in clozapine dose is not an effective solution and non-pharmacological interventions such as sugarless gum also have very little effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result, CIH is invariably treated with medication. In the UK, the most commonly used medication for CIH is hyoscine hydrobromide (&#x02018;hyoscine&#x02019;), an anti-muscarinic licensed as a prophylactic for motion sickness and as a pre-operative drug to dry secretions. It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an effective bioavailability, for motion sickness, achieved 30&#x000a0;minutes after oral administration. Hyoscine can cause a wide range of side effects, most commonly drowsiness, dizziness and constipation (which can be a lethal side effect of clozapine treatment). In addition, hyoscine crosses the blood-brain barrier, so may cause or exacerbate cognitive deficits, including impairments of visual and verbal memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is clinically significant, as cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and associated with poor long-term outcomes.</p><p>Literature reviews have noted that the majority of studies in CIH provide no convincing evidence for any drug, including hyoscine, as an effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A Cochrane review of the evidence base for the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for CIH identified 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the literature, with 14 of these studies conducted in China, significantly limiting their generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The reviewers noted a number of significant problems with study design and data reporting, including the use of cross-over study designs so treatment carry-over effects could not be excluded; the use of unvalidated rating scales to measure hypersalivation; few reports of adverse effects; no reports on effects on general functioning or quality of life; poor quality of data reporting; and none of the studies included hyoscine. The Cochrane review concluded, &#x02018;there are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice, limitations of these studies are plentiful and the risk of bias high&#x02019; and &#x02018;it seems reasonable to study safe interventions for which there is a rationale&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Alternative treatment candidate</title><p>There is emerging evidence for glycopyrronium bromide (&#x02018;glycopyrrolate&#x02019;), for the treatment of CIH that may be more efficacious, more tolerable and may cause less cognitive impairment. Glycopyrrolate is an anti-muscarinic with weak blood-brain-barrier penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and is used widely in the UK as a pre-anaesthetic agent because of its ability to decrease salivary production and gastric acid. It is commonly prescribed by paediatricians in the treatment of drooling in children with neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is reported to be well tolerated and weak penetration of the blood-brain barrier suggests that side effects involving cognitive impairment are less likely to emerge. In trials of children and young people with a neurological condition the dosage of glycopyrrolate is titrated and dependent on weight, up to a maximum of 3&#x000a0;mg per dose given three times daily. In the only RCT of glycopyrrolate for CIH glycopyrrolate was dosed at 1&#x000a0;mg twice daily. After oral ingestion peak effect is seen at approximately 60&#x000a0;minutes post ingestion.</p><p>Three placebo-controlled RCTs of glycopyrrolate (two in children with neurological disorders, one in adults with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) have shown significant reductions in excess salivation as a result of glycopyrrolate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However the aetiology of drooling in children is likely to be different from drug-induced hypersalivation. Oral preparations of glycopyrrolate are not licensed in the UK for the treatment of CIH, but case reports have described the efficacy of glycopyrrolate in the treatment of CIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and a small (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) double-blind, randomised crossover study of glycopyrrolate and biperiden (a centrally acting anticholinergic similar to hyoscine) in CIH reported a significantly greater reduction in hypersalivation scores in patients receiving glycopyrrolate than those receiving biperiden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, participants receiving biperiden showed significantly reduced cognitive functioning in comparison to those receiving glycopyrrolate. The side effects of glycopyrrolate include dry mouth, vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, transient bradycardia, photophobia, flushing of skin and nasal congestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In one paediatric study, 20% of children who had been administered glycopyrrolate withdrew from the study owing to adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in the psychiatric population it appears to be well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The present study</title><p>Several parameters require clarification before a full efficacy trial may proceed. First, whether patients currently undergoing clozapine treatment would be willing to join a randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of hypersalivation medications, and if they are willing to be recruited, whether they will remain in the trial. A secondary issue is there is very little data on the parameters of the daytime hypersalivation measure, the Drooling Rating Scale (DRS), and preliminary work is needed to determine the standard deviation of this measure to inform a sample size calculation for a future RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Summary</title><p>CIH is a common and profoundly debilitating side effect of clozapine treatment that may contribute to non-adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Owing to a poor evidence base and the absence of a viable alternative, clinicians prescribe hyoscine, which may cause impairments in cognition, which in turn may worsen short- and long-term clinical outcomes. There is promising evidence that glycopyrrolate may be more successful in the treatment of CIH causing fewer cognitive side effects. There is a strong rationale for developing a study to compare these medications against each other and we propose to conduct a randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study of glycopyrrolate and hyoscine in the treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation to inform the design of a future efficacy trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To assess the feasibility of recruiting community patients from different centres, the feasibility study will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ascertain whether the study design is acceptable to participants, including randomisation and use of telephone interviews.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ascertain whether the interventions are acceptable to participants and indicate likely attrition rates and tolerability.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Identification, recruitment and consenting of participants</title><p>Participants will be recruited from outpatient clozapine clinics from two NHS mental health trusts. R&#x00026;D approval will be obtained from each mental health trust prior to start of the study. The study protocol and information sheets will be provided to clinical staff at each participating site who will be asked to identify potential participants who fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical staff will approach potential patients and seek their agreement for research staff to approach them about participation in the study.</p><p>After permission has been obtained to approach a potential participant, a researcher will write to them to send study information. The researcher will subsequently contact the patient by telephone and enquire if they are interested in participation. If the patient provisionally agrees, an appointment will be made for the researcher to visit the participant (either at the participant&#x02019;s home or at their next clinic appointment), in order to answer any further questions the participant may have and to obtain written informed consent.</p><p>Following recruitment and consent, the Responsible Clinician and the participant&#x02019;s GP will be informed in writing. The original, signed copy of the consent form will be retained in the Investigator site file with a copy in clinical notes and a copy provided to the participant. If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the Participant Information Sheet and associated consent form will be reviewed and updated if necessary. If the Participant Information Sheet and consent form are updated, all participants (including those already recruited), will be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised documents and asked to re-consent to continue in the trial. A screening log will be maintained for all individuals that are offered trial participation and reasons for non-recruitment and screen failures will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation will be coordinated by the Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre Trials Coordination Unit (MAHSC-CTU).

Blinding of participants and the research team to allocation status will be assured by identical capsule appearance and identical labelling on trial medication (apart from labels identifying the patient). Label randomisation was achieved by a computer-generated list compiled by a statistician at MAHSC-CTU for 42 allocations in two blocks of 21 and supplied to the pharmaceutical company responsible for packaging and labelling of the bottles. In the event a patient develops any side effects where drug unblinding is required, the treating physician will be made aware of the study drug, possible side effects and make the appropriate decision whether to continue or discontinue the drug.

A feasibility aim is to establish its metrics in a UK CIH population.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale (NHRS)</title><p>The NHRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is a validated single-item 5-point self-report scale for measuring the degree of nocturnal salivation that a respondent experiences. The NHRS is the only scale specifically mentioned in the Cochrane review for treatments for CIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that is recommended for inclusion in future studies of the efficacy of CIH interventions.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS)</title><p>The BACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] comprises a short battery of tests devised for easy administration and scoring which assess the extent of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The battery includes brief assessments of executive functions, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed and requires approximately 30&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS)</title><p>LUNSERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] is a 51-item checklist of side effects which assesses on a 5-point scale the degree to which respondents have experienced that side effect in the last month. It shows good reliability and validity, correlating well with other clinician-administered side effect scales. A modified LUNSERS will be used to assess side effects in the previous week (rather than month).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>Our intended sample size is based on recruiting sufficient numbers to fulfil the feasibility aims of the study. The intention is to recruit 14 patients to each of three study arms because recruitment for a total sample of 42 will allow a good estimate of recruitment and attrition rates and allows a conservative estimated recruitment rate of one participant per week over an 11-month period. We estimate an attrition rate of 20% (which is substantially higher than in previous studies) which implies nine dropouts and this allows clear differentiation from one criterion (40% drop-out, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) for future progression to a full efficacy trial, with more than 80% power to detect a difference of this size with alpha at 0.25 (one-tailed). This is consistent with the relaxed power and alpha criteria suitable for an early phase study of this type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] specifically the alpha 0.25 criterion advocated by Schoenfeld [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As a secondary consideration, this sample size also gives more than 80% power to detect a difference between arms of effect size 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with alpha 0.1 (two-tailed), assuming correlation between measures at each of five time points of r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 0.5. Furthermore, 14 in each arm will be sufficient to gain an indication of the metrics (standard deviation (SD), mean, sensitivity to change) for the putative primary outcome measure (DRS) in placebo and active treatment arms recruited from this population for a future efficacy study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Safety reporting procedures</title><p>All adverse events (AEs) suspected of having a causal relationship to either study drug will be captured in the participant&#x02019;s clinical notes and CRF from the start of treatment (week 2) until the end of the participant&#x02019;s involvement in the study. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will also be reported to the MAHSC-CTU within 24&#x000a0;hours of observing or learning about the event. The study manager will liaise with the Chief Investigator (CI) to evaluate the event for seriousness, causality and expectedness. All SAEs will be followed up until resolution and the participating site must provide follow-up reports if the SAE has not resolved at the time the initial report was submitted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial management and quality assurance</title><p>The study is managed through the Trial Management Group (TMG) which includes those individuals responsible for the day-to-day management of the study including the CI, co-investigators and the study manager. The TMG has operational responsibility for the conduct of the study including monitoring overall progress and taking appropriate action to safeguard participants and the quality of the study. The TMG meets at least quarterly once the study is actively recruiting. The study manager and CI will ensure that all relevant issues and actions discussed during the meeting are followed up and resolved. At least annually, the TMG will be extended to invite an independent chair (not involved directly in the study) and additional independent members, a service user representative, and the assembly will be conducted as a Trial Steering Committee (TSC) meeting. The TSC takes responsibility for the scientific integrity of the study, the scientific validity of the study protocol, assessment of the study quality and conduct as well as for the scientific quality of the final study report. Decisions about the continuation or termination of the study or substantial amendments to the protocol are the responsibility of the TSC. The Principal Investigators at the participating sites are responsible for the day-to-day running of the study at their site.</p><p>TSC meetings will be organised by the CI via the study manager. Minutes will be taken at TSC meetings and copies of the minutes will be filed in the Trial Master File. The study manager and CI will ensure that all relevant issues and actions discussed during the meeting are followed up and resolved. The committee&#x02019;s terms of reference, roles and responsibilities will be defined in a charter issued by the MAHSC-CTU.</p><p>No Data Monitoring Committee will be required for this study because the outcome measures do not require the review of study data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p>We aim to conduct a large-scale randomised placebo-controlled trial of hyoscine and glycopyrrolate in the treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation.
