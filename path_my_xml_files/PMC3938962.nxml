Diagnosis is based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels higher than 6.5%, or fasting plasma glucose levels higher than 126 mg/dL (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Prevalence and incidence varies by ethnicity: Hispanics have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The population age-adjusted incidence of diabetes in 2007&#x02013;2009 for people aged 20 years or older was 7.1% for non-Hispanic whites and 11.8% for Hispanics, corresponding to a 66% higher risk (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Prediabetes, characterized by higher-than-normal blood glucose and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, also disproportionately affects Hispanics (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Hispanics are more likely to have poor glycemic control (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), are less likely to use diabetes medical and self-management practices, such as obtaining regular medical check-ups and self-monitoring of glucose levels, and are more likely to experience complications (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Lifestyle interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in at-risk populations by improving glycemic control. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of people at high risk for diabetes, demonstrated that a behavioral lifestyle intervention to lose weight and increase physical activity (PA) reduced development of type 2 diabetes by 58% during a 3-year period (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although lifestyle interventions are more cost-effective than medications, reports identified difficulties in disseminating the original DPP intervention, including relatively high cost of one-on-one delivery by behavioral experts, challenges in implementing it in busy health care settings, and Medicare&#x02019;s lack of coverage for diet and exercise programs to prevent diabetes in people with prediabetes (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The DPP oversampled minorities, but only 16% of its participants were Hispanics, who were mostly well-educated and of higher socioeconomic status. However, interventions successful in one racial/ethnic group may not be generalizable to others because of specific cultural or economic barriers. For example, Hispanics are more likely than other groups to lack regular health care sources, to use hospital emergency departments or public health clinics (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and to experience cultural and economic barriers to care, including the inability to speak English and low rates of health insurance coverage. Thus, a 6-month intervention aimed at Hispanics and held exclusively in physicians&#x02019; offices may recruit too few members of vulnerable, underserved low-income groups (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an RCT of a home-based educational intervention administered by community health workers (CHW, or <italic>Promotores de Salud</italic> in Spanish) for Hispanic people with elevated HbA1c levels (&#x0003e;6%) in the Yakima Valley, a rural area where more than 60% of the population is Hispanic and low-income. Specific aims of the project were to compare the effects of the immediate intervention with those of the delayed intervention on changes in 1) HbA1c levels before and after the intervention; 2) fruit and vegetable consumption, assessed by self-reported questionnaire; and 3) frequency (times per week) of mild, moderate, or vigorous leisure-time PA assessed by self-reported questionnaire.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Recruitment of participants has been described previously (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Hispanic men and women aged 18 or older who lived in the Lower Yakima Valley, Washington, were recruited at health fairs and local community events held from 2008 through 2012. Sunnyside Community Hospital provided free blood glucose screening at these events. CHWs approached attendees to introduce the study and assess attendees&#x02019; interest in participating before giving the blood test. Although participation was not restricted to Hispanics of Mexican origin, 95.9% of Hispanics who live in the Yakima Valley report being of Mexican origin (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Interested people completed a screening survey and provided written informed consent to have blood glucose levels only measured via a fingerstick blood sample. People who received the free blood glucose test were not required to participate in the study. Fasting/nonfasting criteria based on participants&#x02019; self-report of food intake in the last 8 hours were used to interpret results. Those with abnormal glucose results (&#x0003e;110 mg/dL if fasting) were referred to local hospitals for free fasting blood glucose and HbA1c testing, which acted as the baseline HbA1c for study participants.</p><p>Interested participants provided a second written informed consent for study participation and completed a baseline questionnaire. Participants were randomly assigned to an immediate or a delayed intervention. CHWs were aware of participants&#x02019; arm; outcome analysts were blinded. </p><p>The number of Hispanics screened was 5,820; 17.7% (n = 1,031) had abnormal spot glucose results. Of these, 601 had normal HbA1c levels, were ineligible, refused participation, or were lost to follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The remaining 430 participants (intention-to-treat group) were randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (n = 219) or the delayed intervention (n = 211). Of these, 50 participants (28 immediate; 22 delayed) refused the intervention after randomization; 15 (3 immediate, 12 delayed) moved and could not participate; 33 (18 immediate, 15 delayed) were lost to follow-up; 5 (3 immediate, 2 delayed) were found to be ineligible after randomization; and 7 (1 immediate, 6 delayed) had significant missing data. Remaining participants (n = 320) represent the sample for whom the effectiveness of the intervention could be assessed (efficacy evaluable [EE] sample). A further 92 participants (28.8%) had a follow-up blood draw, but not within the scheduled time frame, and were thus excluded as part of a sensitivity analysis, leaving a total of 228 participants (n = 111 immediate; n = 117 delayed).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the process for the randomized-controlled prevention trial of the Partnership for a Hispanic Diabetes Prevention Program.</p></caption><long-desc>The number of people who received spot blood glucose tests was 5,820. Of these, 4,789 had normal blood glucose levels and were ineligible for participation. The remaining 1,031 were eligible for hemoglobin A1c testing (HbA1c). After testing, 601 people were excluded for the following reasons: HbA1c test results were normal (n = 189), the participant was lost to follow-up (n = 268), the participant declined to participate (n = 121), and other reasons (n = 23). The number randomly assigned to the trial arms was 430. Of these, 219 were assigned to the immediate intervention arm and 211 to the delayed intervention arm. A total of 53 people assigned to the immediate intervention were excluded for the following reasons: refused (n = 28), moved (n = 3), lost to follow-up (n = 18), ineligible (n = 3), missing data (n = 1). From the group assigned to the delayed intervention, 57 were excluded for the following reasons: refused (n = 22), moved (n = 12), lost to follow-up (n = 15), ineligible (n = 2), missing data (n = 6). One hundred and sixty-six participants in the immediate intervention and 154 in the delayed intervention were available for the efficacy evaluable analysis. Participants who were late giving a blood sample (55 in the immediate arm and 37 in the delayed arm) were excluded as part of a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was conducted on data from 111 people in the immediate intervention and 117 in the delayed intervention arm.</long-desc><graphic xlink:href="PCD-11-E28s01"/></fig><p>The intervention consisted of 5 guided educational sessions conducted in participants&#x02019; homes. Trained bilingual Hispanic CHWs employed at the Center for Community Health in Sunnyside, Washington, presented the sessions on diabetes over the course of 5 weeks at scheduled times (1 per week). Sessions were rescheduled occasionally to meet the participants&#x02019; requirements. Each session lasted approximately 1 hour. At each session, the CHW presented an educational curriculum involving diabetes education and awareness and methods to increase self-management of diabetes (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Participants were encouraged to invite family members and friends to participate, to educate them about the importance of healthy lifestyle in diabetes management so they could be supportive of the participants. Discussion was facilitated by a set of flip charts developed by investigators with input from the community, revised, and translated into Spanish. CHWs were trained in both diabetes education and in working with the community (100 hours of training, including CDC&#x02019;s Community Health Worker Evaluation Tool Kit, and training by a local diabetes specialist). They received twice-yearly refresher courses during the study. The intervention was offered in English or Spanish and was presented in easy-to-understand language. It was developed by using social cognitive theory constructs based on selected cultural symbols and themes, cultural patterns and concepts, values, norms, and relationships to promote healthy lifestyles. The intervention was developed via soliciting feedback from Hispanic participants in the Valley. The community advisory board, made up of members of the community, worked with investigators to select an appropriate intervention. They gave final approval for implementing the intervention in the community. In addition, we held numerous focus groups with Hispanic residents of this area to test the intervention for cultural relativity before it was finalized.</p><p>Session topics were 1) general diabetes (function of insulin, types of diabetes, symptoms and control of diabetes, risk, screening and diagnosis); 2) self-management (treatment, blood glucose monitoring, HbA1c test); 3) diet (carbohydrates and counting, healthy eating, serving sizes, food labels, nutrition facts); 4) physical activity (recommended levels, benefits, pedometers and steps per day); and 5) complications of diabetes. In sessions 2 through 4, presenters reviewed the main points from previous sessions before introducing a new topic. Each session ended with a summary of the presentation. Group discussion was encouraged. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions throughout the presentation. Participants were also given placemats that show portion sizes, measuring cups, a diabetes cookbook with recipes for Mexican cuisine, and various pictures and reminders about diabetes. Study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board (file number 6194).

Participants in the delayed intervention group were then given the intervention. A third blood sample was collected from all participants and a third questionnaire administered at the 6-month time point.</p><p>Primary outcomes of our study were 1) changes in serum levels of HbA1c from baseline to 3 months; 2) changes in fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 3 months assessed by self-report using the 5 A Day for Better Health Program, validated questionnaires (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) that asked about usual frequency of consumption (times per week) of fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages, and fresh fruit and vegetables and cooking habits (eg, frequency of eating out vs cooking at home and types of fats used in cooking); and 3) changes in frequency (times per week) of mild, moderate, or vigorous leisure-time PA from baseline to 3 months assessed by self-reported questionnaire adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), completed at baseline, and at 3-month and 6-month time points. The questionnaire also asked whether participants engaged in PA as part of paid employment.</p><p>Secondary outcomes compared changes in HbA1c levels in the delayed intervention arm, comparing changes at 3 months with baseline levels and levels at 6 months with 3-month levels. Participants in the delayed intervention (control) arm received the educational program 6 months following initiation of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

We observed a significant result for the sensitivity analysis group (n = 128) (<italic>P</italic> = .05; data not shown), because of a reduction in power caused by the smaller numbers analyzed (ie, analyzing only those participants whose data were collected within the specified time frame); mean changes in both groups were similar.</p><p>We evaluated changes in HbA1c levels for delayed intervention controls who received the intervention after the initial 3-month period had elapsed.

At the Texas&#x02013;Mexico border, a CHW-led program of culturally competent diabetes self-management education led to a nonsignificant reduction in HbA1c levels in 256 Mexican-Americans (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and another (N = 150, 80% Hispanic females) led to significant reductions in HbA1c levels and increased diabetes knowledge at 6 months; this intervention was culturally specific and consisted of participative group education, telephone contact, and follow-up (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Finally, 189 Hispanic patients, newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, were randomly assigned to a CHW-led intervention, case management, or standard provider care. After 6 months, participants in the CHW group had reduced use of emergency departments and greater improvements in health status, dietary habits, physical activity, and medication adherence (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>We found no significant changes in frequency of eating out or in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables or nonalcoholic beverages. This may be due to the self-reported nature of our measures. Furthermore, we did not capture serving sizes in the questionnaire, and our observed significant changes in HbA1c may be attributable to reduced serving sizes. Similarly, changes in frequency of leisure-time PA were not significant between the 2 groups but may have been underreported or misreported. In addition, we did not record the length of time that participants were involved in PA. However, we did observe a trend of a greater increase in moderate and vigorous PA and a smaller increase in mild PA in the immediate intervention group compared with the delayed intervention group from baseline to 3 months. Also, people who recorded performing vigorous PA at work were significantly more likely to increase the number of times per week they engaged in strenuous PA after the intervention than those who had more sedentary occupations.</p><p>Our intervention is appropriate for low-income minority groups. It is relatively short (5 weeks) and home-based, increasing the likelihood of participant adherence by removing barriers such as transportation. Bilingual CHWs removed linguistic barriers. Once the intervention was complete, we randomly selected 40 participants and conducted open-ended, structured interviews, and used qualitative methods to analyze transcripts. Participants showed high program satisfaction and interest, and almost all reported making at least 1 positive behavior change as a result of the intervention.</p><p>Previous research on education by CHWs in the Hispanic community has generally taken place in group or community settings, and few have been conducted in homes. Home-based education sessions are thought to be effective in reaching underserved individuals who may be unable to receive clinic-based services because of barriers such as lack of transportation, childcare, or language (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). One report of a home-based CHW intervention to promote healthy behaviors among Hispanic families (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) demonstrated significant increases in self-efficacy for changing food (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and PA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) behaviors.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the homogeneous population, which may limit generalizability of the study, and the use of self-reported questionnaires to measure change in diet and PA, which can be affected by recall bias and education level. The questionnaires did not capture food serving sizes, or the length of time PA was performed, so it is difficult to evaluate whether changes in these parameters are responsible for changes in HbA1c levels. However, as discussed earlier, we did see a change in the distribution of participants who performed moderate activity or vigorous activity from mild activity in the immediate compared with the delayed intervention, though this finding was not significant. We did not analyze the likelihood that participants who performed mild leisure-time activity transitioned to moderate or vigorous PA, for example, because an analysis of this complexity was outside the scope of this study. Strengths of the study include the randomized nature of the study; the relatively large sample size, and the adherence to the study: of the 430 participants randomized, 320 (74.4%) completed the study and gave a blood sample at all time points. The study also successfully focused on an underserved population. The results of this trial show that this intervention was successful in significantly reducing HbA1c levels in Hispanic Americans who live in the Yakima Valley.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01564797.
