These tools include computers, tablets, smartphones and wearable sensors, which can provide both accessible and cost-effective support, as well as the potential for more reliable and effective methods of assessment and monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For those with persisting mental health problems, such as psychosis, where access to support and self-management is often required on a day-to-day basis, these technologies may assist in overcoming existing barriers to effective treatment. In addition, they are usually accessed independently and on demand, and can therefore be empowering to users in self-managing their own condition, a key element of personal recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Digital technologies range in their features, designs and platforms, providing opportunities to target different needs associated with mental health conditions. Smartphones in particular have become a strong focus of digital health research due to their capabilities to provide in-situation support in daily life through specialised applications (&#x0201c;apps&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Smartphone apps are a booming area of both research and industry, with more empirical evaluations needed to help refine features to minimise risks and maximise benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">One promising use of smartphone apps is assisting with the self-management of psychotic experiences such as hearing voices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These experiences, commonly observed as persistent symptoms in psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, can be distressing and impairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Psychological intervention largely involves promoting the ability to adapt to and self-manage these experiences in a way that reduces the impact on the individual&#x02019;s daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given that voices may be experienced as frequent and unpredictable, the on-demand availability of smartphone apps suggests potential for assisting in this active self-management when it is needed.</p><p id="Par30">Several studies have examined the use of smartphone apps in people with persisting mental health problems, including psychotic conditions. A recent meta-analysis examined ownership of mobile devices and attitudes to their use in mental health care in psychiatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Across 15 studies including a total of 2129 patients with a psychotic disorder, 66.4% of patients owned a mobile phone, which had increased over time to 81.4% between 2013 and 2015; furthermore, the majority of patients reported interest in using mobile devices for health monitoring and tracking, access to information about their health, scheduling appointment reminders and facilitating contact with service providers. Indeed, recent research has shown patients are already frequently using mobile technology for these purposes, as well as assisting with coping with symptoms and connecting with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Initial trials have indicated evidence that online and mobile technologies are feasible and acceptable for people with psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">One important way in which people with psychotic experiences may benefit from smartphone apps is through their ability to prompt adaptive behaviours when they are needed in daily life. This application of mobile technology is termed &#x0201c;ecological momentary intervention&#x0201d; (EMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), involving the delivery of reminders or prompts to users via mobile devices. EMIs have received increased attention in recent years, with evidence for their benefit in a variety of mental and physical health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">A related use of smartphone technology is termed &#x0201c;ecological momentary assessment&#x0201d; (EMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). EMA is an assessment method involving the regular and frequent self-assessment of momentary experiences in the context of daily life. This method has been used extensively in psychosis research as a means of recording and examining momentary psychotic experiences and their relationship to internal and external variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As assessment is occurring repeatedly, in real time, and in natural environments, there is greater ecological validity, data is less subject to retrospective recall bias, and it is possible to examine the relationship between variables over time. EMA and EMI (EMA/I) can be combined to provide response-dependent intervention strategies via smartphone apps in daily life.</p><p id="Par33">A recent systematic review identified nine studies with broad application of EMA/I in the assessment and treatment of psychotic conditions, ranging from specialised smartphone apps based on cognitive behavioural therapy to remote assessment of symptom states to initiate early intervention for relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These studies found the applications to be feasible and acceptable for patients, and there was evidence that they can be used to promote self-management of symptoms and improve functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">EMA/I may be particularly suited to assisting with the self-management of voice hearing experiences, building on prior therapeutic approaches involving enhancement of coping strategies targeting voices and their triggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Improving coping with voices is a key component of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and has been formally operationalised in a therapeutic approach developed by Tarrier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] referred to as &#x0201c;Coping Strategy Enhancement&#x0201d; (CSE). CSE involves an initial functional analysis of antecedents and responses to psychotic experiences to inform the identification and implementation of coping strategies in daily life. Research trials and case studies have shown broad support for CSE approaches in treating psychotic experiences, although there are limited examinations of this approach in isolation and targeting voices specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">EMA/I might be used to augment such coping-focused approaches to voices in several ways. First, EMA provides a means of capturing more reliable information about the way in which symptoms interact and evolve over time, which has been shown to be superior to retrospective self-report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To aid functional analysis as the first stage of coping interventions for voices, EMA data could be collected, analysed and produced as in-session feedback to identify predictors of fluctuations in voices. Voice hearing has been shown to vary depending on the individual&#x02019;s internal states (e.g. mood) and external stimuli (e.g. social context) (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). With EMA, contextual variables can be assessed alongside features of the voices themselves, such as intensity/loudness, allowing for the examination of within-person predictors of voice fluctuations (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). Second, it is common for psychological interventions to require clients to recall the evolution of events, which can be challenging for those with psychosis who tend to display cognitive difficulties involving poor recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. EMA shares similarities to typical diary methods used in CBT for this purpose, involving recording of information in monitoring sheets outside of therapy to aid identification of patterns requiring intervention and also to foster self-awareness through self-monitoring. Electronic delivery of reminders and recording of information via EMA could be more convenient, increase likelihood of completion and provide more accurate and sensitive information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Third, EMI has shown to aid recall and promote the use of symptom self-management strategies in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], aligning with the primary aim of coping approaches to voices being to improve the use of more effective coping strategies in daily life.</p><p id="Par36">To summarise, interventions which make use of specialised smartphone capabilities such as EMA/I have shown promise in assisting with management of symptoms and improving recovery, and previous research has found EMA/I are feasible and acceptable to people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. A particular application is to facilitate self-management of persisting and distressing voices, where EMA/I may offer a means of augmenting the effects of these treatments to promote more consistent and adaptive coping. Given this, the main aim of the proposed study is to investigate the application of EMA/I in a coping-focused intervention for voices (Smartphone Assisted coping-focused interVention for Voices: SAVVy). This paper describes a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) with the following objectives.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par37">There are three main objectives in this trial. The first objective is to explore whether the intervention is feasible to deliver and acceptable to participants. Feasibility of smartphone-based EMA self-monitoring will be determined by the proportion of participants receiving the intervention who complete at least 33% of the total number of EMA surveys, allowing production of feedback in session. This cut-off was determined based on recommendations from the EMA literature which suggest that participants should complete at least 33% of the total number of EMA surveys to provide a sufficient number of data points for an analysis that is both reliable and representative of a person&#x02019;s daily experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The feasibility of the smartphone-based EMI will also be examined through the number of EMI reminders viewed over the course of the intervention and session attendance rates. Acceptability will be assessed by participant ratings of satisfactions with the intervention and its perceived credibility prior to commencing. The second objective is to examine the feasibility of a full-scale trial through recruitment and attrition rates. The third objective is to provide a preliminary estimation of the clinical impact of this intervention alongside treatment-as-usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on (1) overall severity of voices, (2) emotional and functional impact of voices and (3) overall emotional distress. As a preliminary examination of possible processes of change in these clinical outcomes, we will also examine changes on measures of the participant&#x02019;s awareness of factors that influence voices day-to-day and experiences of coping, as these are the primary intervention targets which may theoretically lead to a reduction in voice severity and impact.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par38">The SAVVy trial is a pilot randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded trial, with two parallel groups, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Each consenting participant will be randomised to either SAVVy + TAU or TAU alone, following the informed consent and baseline assessment session. TAU will involve continuation of standard treatment provided by the usual care team (usually consisting of medication and case management without psychological treatment). Baseline assessments will occur pre-randomisation (T0) and at a standard period of approximately 8&#x000a0;weeks following randomisation (T1). All participants will be invited to complete the outcome assessment regardless of whether they complete the full course of intervention.

Rather, a sufficient sample size is needed for estimating the standard deviation of the outcome measures to inform future power calculations, to determine recruitment and attrition rates, and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. There is variability across the literature regarding sample size recommendations for pilot RCTs, ranging from 24 to 70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

All clients from the Voices Clinic likely to meet inclusion criteria for the study will be informed of the trial following their initial consultation appointment, alongside other treatment options.</p><p id="Par43">Clients interested in taking part in the trial will then be contacted by a member of the research team independent from their clinical care who will explain the study in more detail and formally screen over the phone for eligibility. Potentially eligible and interested candidates will then be sent participant information consent forms and allowed at least 48&#x000a0;h to consider their participation. Those interested in participating will then be contacted to book a time for the first assessment session, during which eligibility is confirmed.

Randomisation using minimisation will be used as it allows for better balance of patient characteristics across groups, particularly in trials with small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In this trial, minimisation will balance whether voices are experienced as non-continuous or continuous (PSYRATS-AH item 1 score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3 versus 4), because this covariate is predicted to have an effect on treatment response and should therefore be balanced across groups. Allocation will occur within 2&#x000a0;days of the baseline assessment. Participants will then be contacted to alert them to their allocation, with those allocated to the treatment group commencing therapy within 2&#x000a0;weeks of the baseline assessment and those allocated to the control group confirming a date for the outcome assessment.</p><p id="Par47">All outcome assessments will be conducted by a researcher blind to treatment allocation throughout the study. It is not possible to blind participants to their allocation due to the nature of the trial design. Following allocation to the treatment or control arm, and prior to the outcome assessment, participants will be asked not to reveal their group allocation to the researcher conducting the outcome assessment. Outside of the assessments, researchers conducting the outcome assessments are shielded from discussion of participants, and assessments are conducted on different days to the therapy sessions. In the event of an unblinding during the assessment, this will be recorded and addressed by repeating the clinical interview as soon as possible by another blind assessor. Success of blinding will be assessed by asking the assessor to guess which condition the participant was allocated to and indicate their confidence.

CSE has recently been applied in a brief format targeting distressing voices specifically, supporting feasibility, acceptability and preliminary evidence for improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A panel of four individuals with lived experience of voice hearing based in Sussex, UK, were also consulted in the early stages of this research to provide feedback on the design of the intervention and trial, including the wording and schedule of EMA/I surveys.</p><p id="Par69">As an initial phase of the intervention across the first and second sessions, functional analysis will be used to formulate patterns in voice activity, focusing on identifying the antecedents and responses which may give insight into how voices are being maintained. Building from this understanding, the remainder of the intervention will focus on identifying and implementing alternative responses to the voices and their antecedents which may disrupt problematic maintenance cycles associated voice activity and related distress. The therapy can therefore be conceptualised as having two sequential stages: the first involving information gathering and building understanding of daily patterns in voices through functional analysis, and the second involving identification and implementation of individualised coping responses to voices based on the functional analysis.

The development of the EMA schedule and items involved several iterative stages, including comprehensive literature reviews, consultations with expert clinicians, researchers and lived experience consultants, piloting by researchers, and a small pilot of the intervention with three participants to refine protocols and confirm acceptability of the EMA/I procedure. The purpose of this EMA monitoring period is to provide data which can be analysed to identify potential predictors of voice intensity. In line with recommendations in the literature, at least 33% of the total number of EMA surveys will need to have been completed by the participant in order for analysis of feedback to be conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Analysis of the EMA data (produced for the purpose of feedback) will include within-person summary statistics and exploratory multiple regressions conducted on Stata Statistical Software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], allowing identification of items which predict the intensity of voices. Variables with a standardised beta co-efficient of greater than 0.3 were considered to justify the provision of feedback.</p><p id="Par71">If possible, a feedback sheet will be provided to participants in the second session which will contain the following information: (a) the number of survey responses entered during the monitoring period; (b) average voice intensity and distress scores over the monitoring period; (c) situations, triggers and responses which predicted increased or decreased voice intensity according to multiple regression analysis; and (d) a list of the specific responses to voices reported over the monitoring period and their average reported helpfulness. This feedback will be framed as a guide due to potential limitations in capturing sufficient voice hearing occasions to detect predictors and to avoid inferring causation from correlation data.

The latter information is then summarised as feedback and provided to the participant in the following session if possible, with the aim of tracking progress. Based on this discussion, there will be an option to create new coping statements following session 3 or keep the same for a second, identical EMI period. The fourth session will similarly involve reviewing progress and discussing feedback from the app if available, ending with a discussion of how to maintain gains following the end of the intervention.</p><p id="Par73">Fidelity to the intervention protocol will be supported through (a) use of an intervention manual clearly detailing the protocol for each session and procedures between sessions; (b) provision of a participant guide for use during the session which can be used to structure the content and record information; (c) regular supervision of the therapist by the PI, who has expertise in both interventions for voices and the use of digital interventions; and (d) completion of a fidelity checklist following each session by the therapist to record key components of the session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Smartphone application</title><p id="Par74">The movisensXS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] app will be used to facilitate EMA/I in the current study.

Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) are particularly promising given their ability to provide momentary assessment of relevant clinical processes and promote adaptive responses to symptoms in daily life. Few research trials have investigated the clinical utility of EMA/I in the form of specialised smartphone apps or mobile devices; however, the existing literature highlights the promise of this technology for promoting self-management of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">In the context of those with distressing voice hearing experiences, the use of smartphone-based EMA/I may build on existing therapeutic approaches to improving coping with voices. EMA/I may provide important linkages between traditional face-to-face therapy and daily life not only to establish more consistent application of coping strategies discussed in sessions, but also to capture important information often lost in the complexity of daily life. The proposed study is an investigation of such capabilities through evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary clinical outcomes of a novel intervention involving smartphone-based EMA/I to improve coping with distressing voices.</p><p id="Par82">There are currently strikingly few empirical evaluations of smartphone apps for mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is problematic given the number of apps readily available for use by consumers, without sufficient understanding of their potentially harmful effects. From another angle, it is critical to understand how these technologies should be designed to maximise their benefits and use across different contexts. The current study aims to evaluate EMA/I as specific smartphone technologies for promoting adaptation to distressing psychotic experiences. The focus on voice hearing experiences was chosen given the logical mapping of EMA/I onto existing therapeutic approaches to coping with voices; however, we hope these findings will provide insights into the use of EMA/I in clinical practice with broader clinical implications.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par83">The trial commenced recruitment with the first participant allocated in March 2017.
