Building upon findings from placebo and marketing research, we examined how perceived exertion is affected by expectations regarding a) the effects of exercise and b) the effects of the exercise product worn during the exercise. We also investigated whether these effects are moderated by physical self-concept. Seventy-eight participants conducted a moderate 30 min cycling exercise on an ergometer, with perceived exertion (RPE) measured every 5 minutes. Beforehand, each participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions and watched a corresponding film clip presenting &#x0201c;scientific evidence&#x0201d; that the exercise would or would not result in health benefits and that the exercise product they were wearing (compression garment) would additionally enhance exercise benefits or would only be worn for control purposes. Participants&#x02019; physical self-concept was assessed via questionnaire. Results partially demonstrated that participants with more positive expectations experienced reduced perceived exertion during the exercise. Furthermore, our results indicate a moderator effect of physical self-concept: Individuals with a high physical self-concept benefited (in terms of reduced perceived exertion levels) in particular from an induction of generally positive expectations. In contrast, individuals with a low physical self-concept benefited when positive expectations were related to the exercise product they were wearing. In sum, these results suggest that placebo expectations may be a further, previously neglected class of psychological factors that influence the perception of exertion.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004079</institution-id><institution>Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1784-6398</contrib-id><name><surname>Mothes</surname><given-names>Hendrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the University of Freiburg</institution></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Publishing</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant to H.

Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] propose that the degree to which people perceive their exercise as being arduous negatively influences how they respond affectively during the exercise. Negative affective responses, in turn, decrease long-term exercise motivation and participation [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. If one wishes to counteract the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle, it is thus important to understand factors that affect perceived exertion in exercising individuals.</p><p>While the experience of exertion clearly depends on exercise intensity [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and corresponding physiological cues (e.g., ventilation, oxygen uptake, skin temperature) [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it also involves psychological factors [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For instance, it has been shown that dispositional factors, such as anxiety, neuroticism, or self-efficacy, and situational factors, such as specific mood states (anxiety, depression), may influence perceived exertion [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, psychological influences on the perception of exertion are poorly understood so far. We propose in the present study that placebo-like beliefs and expectations may be a further, previously neglected yet powerful class of psychological factors influencing perceived exertion.</p><p>In medical placebo research, expectations that a certain behavior (e.g., taking a pill) will have positive or negative effects on health status (outcome expectations) are considered a key factor shaping not only various long-term diseases, but also certain underlying physical or mental processes [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In particular, substantial research demonstrates that expectations influence the detection of somatic sensations [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a process that also plays a fundamental role in the perception of exertion during physical exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, previous research has frequently linked the effects of placebo expectations to self-perception [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Individuals with positive self-related cognitions derive particular benefit from placebo expectations [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent evidence shows that individuals with a negative self-concept can also benefit from placebo expectations if they are associated with an external product that supposedly supports the individual [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we transferred current knowledge from placebo research to short-term (single session) physical exercise. We examined whether subtle manipulations of participants&#x02019; expectations (<italic>induced expectations</italic>) towards exercise-related health outcomes and the exercise product they were wearing might influence their perceived exertion. We expected that participants with positive induced expectations would experience less perceived exertion than participants without positive induced expectations. Further, we expected that physical self-concept would have a moderating effect [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: People with a higher physical self-concept should benefit more (decreased perceived exertion) from positive outcome expectations [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, participants with a low physical self-concept should benefit particularly from positive outcome expectations when they are related to an external supportive product [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 210 potential participants via advertisements in local newspapers and at two local universities (University of Freiburg and Freiburg University of Education, Germany) from November 2012 to February 2013. Following recruitment, we prescreened all potential participants during a telephone interview. For further participation in the study, we invited healthy individuals who were older than 18 years and fluent in German and who reported neither substantial current levels of physical exercise (defined as regular physical activity of more than 60 min/week during the previous 3 months) nor substantial past levels of physical exercise (defined as involvement in sports clubs or competitions). We selected low-active to sedentary individuals, because we assumed these individuals to be the most sensitive to inductions of positive outcome expectations towards physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180434.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To ensure sufficient naivety of participants, we selected only individuals who were not enrolled in psychology, medicine, biology, or sports science degree programs. Seventy-eight individuals (57 females, 21 males, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 21.9, age range: 18&#x02013;32 years) completed the study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180434.g001">Fig 1</xref> for the participant flow through the study). All participants gave their written informed consent, were debriefed after completion of the study, and were compensated for participation with 20 &#x020ac;. This study was part of a larger project examining acute psychological, physiological, and neurophysiological health-related effects of beliefs and expectations of single sessions of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

The two sessions were approximately one month apart (on average, 34 days). In the first session (lasting for 30 minutes), participants completed a set of questionnaires, which included scales for measuring their physical self-concept [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and habitual expectation towards the affective consequences of exercising (as well as other scales not relevant for this study) [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Afterwards, we had the participants take a standardized fitness test on a bicycle ergometer (Ergo-Bike Medical8i_2, Daum, Germany) to measure their individual physical fitness. Following the fitness testing, participants were randomly assigned (stratified by gender) to one of four groups.</p><p>In the second session (main experiment, lasting 2 hours), participants were first instructed to put on a sleeveless compression shirt from a well-known sports brand to be worn during the experimental session. Participants then completed several questionnaires as well as blood pressure and electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements not relevant for the current analyses. After viewing a 3 min multimedia film clip (Induced Expectation), participants were instructed to warm up for two minutes (resistance in watts: 0.5 &#x000d7; body weight) and then to exercise with moderate intensity for 30 minutes on the bicycle ergometer while their rate of perceived exertion (RPE; [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) was measured every five minutes. After finishing the exercise, participants again completed several questionnaires as well as blood pressure and EEG measurements not relevant for the present study. All study materials (instructions, measures, multimedia film clip) were provided in German to the participants and translated into English for this publication. The temperature in the laboratory was kept constant (20&#x000b0;C, 68&#x000b0;F) during all experimental sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Induced expectation</title><p>Participants were told that the purpose of the short multimedia film clip presented directly before the beginning of the physical exercise was to provide them more detailed information about the background of the study. Unknown to the participants, however, the film clip aimed to induce different placebo-like outcome expectations by presenting supposedly scientific information. According to his or her group assignment, each participant watched one of four 3-min multimedia presentations consisting of spoken words by a credible speaker with corresponding pictures (similar to those used in previous studies, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Two conditions aimed at inducing positive outcome expectations (<italic>Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic> and <italic>Shirt and Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic>, referred to as Experimental 1 and Experimental 2). In both conditions, the film clips indicated that the specific duration and intensity of the exercise the participants were about to engage in was optimized to maximize mental health and well-being according to scientific evidence; the clips differed only with respect to the information about the compression shirt that all participants were wearing. Whereas the <italic>Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic> video (along with the control condition videos) informed them that the shirt&#x02019;s function was to reduce body perspiration during the exercise for accurate EEG measurements, only the <italic>Shirt and Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic> video claimed that the compression shirt supported cardiovascular function and breathing during the exercise, thereby additionally increasing psychological well-being and the health effects of the exercise.</p><p>The two other conditions (<italic>No Expectation</italic> and <italic>No Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic>) served as control conditions. The <italic>No Expectation</italic> (referred to as Control 1) film clip was designed to not cause a particular outcome expectation regarding the upcoming exercise, as it only included information about the study that all participants had already received at the beginning of the experiment. Due to our concern that it would be difficult to rule out the influence of pre-existing positive expectations with the Control 1 condition, we introduced Control 2 as an additional control condition. We designed Control 2 as a <italic>No Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic>, that is, participants viewing the Control 2 film clip were not supposed to expect any immediate exercise benefit (&#x0201c;According to recent research, the upcoming exercise is too short and too weak to result in higher well-being and health benefits.&#x0201d;). This approach is in line with the hidden treatment paradigm frequently used in placebo research [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, none of the videos explicitly mentioned exertion during the exercise. Instead of creating exertion-specific expectations, the expectation manipulations aimed to induce global expectations regarding the consequences of the exercise. The reason for this was that the larger study aim was to investigate the effects of beliefs and expectations on acute exercise consequences (see also [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Nonetheless, there is also research indicating that vague information can be more beneficial than precise information in the process of expectation generation, because vagueness allows people to interpret the information the way they want [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We retrospectively double-checked via questionnaire whether our manipulation had successfully influenced the participants&#x02019; exercise experience. As our expectation manipulation was specifically focused on exercise duration and intensity, we assessed individual ratings of comfort with respect to duration and intensity in particular. Specifically, we asked the participants (a) how exhausting they had found the exercise (1 = very little exhausting; 7 = very exhausting) and how comfortable they had found (b) the intensity (1 = very uncomfortable; 10 = very comfortable), (c) the duration (1 = very uncomfortable; 10 = very comfortable), and (d) the exercise overall (1 = very comfortable; 5 = very uncomfortable).

Before each test, participants were instructed to adjust the saddle height for their comfort and to keep the cadence during the tests at approximately 75 pedal rotations per minute (RPM). In the initial fitness assessment, we used a standardized incremental exercise test: Participants started at 60 watts and continued with 20-watt increases every minute until volitional exhaustion. Maximal power output (P<sub>max</sub>) at volitional exhaustion relative to body weight was used as a measure for physical fitness (for financial reasons, as a substitute for a spiroergometry with lactate assessment). On the basis of the general linear relationship between oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) and power output on a bicycle ergometer [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], P<sub>max</sub> may be considered to be a valid and reliable estimate for VO<sub>2 max</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For the main experiment, we chose a 30-minute exercise session with moderate intensity, because previous research suggests that in such circumstances psychological influences such as expectations may be most influential in affecting exercise experience in terms of perceived exertion or affect [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moderate intensity was set to 40% of P<sub>max</sub> of participants&#x02019; individual fitness test results. We determined this level as a level just below lactate threshold on the basis of a comprehensive laboratory database with 2958 fitness assessments from trained and untrained individuals (Radlabor GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) showing that the 95% confidence interval of the lactate threshold ranged from 41.1% to 65.1% (on average, 53.1%). During the main experiment, in line with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we assessed the rate of perceived exertion (RPE; [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) every five minutes.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Perceived exertion</title><p>The RPE scale [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] measures the degree of subjective perception of physical exertion during exercise. It ranges from 6, &#x0201c;no exertion at all,&#x0201d; to 20, &#x0201c;maximal exertion.&#x0201d; Attached to the odd numbered categories of the RPE scale are verbal anchors (e.g., 11 = fairly light, 13 = somewhat hard, 15 = hard, 17 = very hard) that indicate the degree of perceived exertion. This widely used scale has been demonstrated to have adequate reliability and validity in adults [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Then we addressed specific hypotheses with hierarchical regression analyses, as they allowed us to both examine specific group-related hypotheses with regard to the expectation manipulation (similar to a set of planned contrasts in an ANOVA context) and test for an interaction between the grouping factor induced expectation and the continuous variable physical self-concept [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In these hierarchical regression analyses, we again controlled for the variables baseline perceived exertion and habitual expectation in Step 1.

Our first hypothesis, namely that placebo expectations predict perceived exertion during exercise, is partially supported by our results: Participants with positive outcome expectations showed lower perceived exertion during the activity on the ergometer than those without specific expectations in the Control 1 condition. In considering the Control 2 condition, however, we also found conflicting evidence that warrants further investigation. With respect to our second hypothesis, the results indicate that physical self-concept serves as a moderator: Participants with a high physical self-concept benefited particularly in terms of reduced perceived exertion levels from an induction of generally positive expectations compared to the induction of a <italic>No-Exercise Effect Expectation</italic> (Control 2). However, perceived exertion did not differ among those only expecting exercise benefits and those additionally expecting equipment benefits. In contrast, results regarding our third hypothesis revealed that only participants with a low physical self-concept were able to benefit in terms of their perceived exertion when additional attention was drawn to supposedly enhancing properties of the exercise equipment (compression shirt). The implications of these findings are discussed below.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Influence of expectations on perceived exertion</title><p>On the one hand, by showing that participants with generally positive outcome expectations reported less perceived exertion than participants without a particular outcome expectation (Control 1), our research suggests that individuals&#x02019; outcome expectations affect their perceptions of exertion during exercise. The suggested role of outcome expectations in perceived exertion is in line with previous research indicating that several other psychological variables influence exertional experience [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, our results are consistent with results demonstrating that different cognitive modes affect perceived exertion: For instance, people report reduced perceived exertion when they listen to music and watch associated music videos while exercising [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, individuals report increased perceived exertion when they believe that they have nearly completed their exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and when they believe that they are cycling up a steep hill (expectations induced by hypnotic suggestion) [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, however, and contradictory to our expectations, we did not observe differences in perceived exertion among participants expecting positive outcomes and those not expecting positive outcomes (Control 2). This discrepant finding clearly limits the interpretability of the aforementioned main effect. Indeed, one potential reason for these discrepant findings may well be that differences in perceived exertion found between the positive expectation and Control 1 conditions are the result of an artifact, that is, that a main effect of positive outcome expectations on perceived exertion does not exist. For instance, it is conceivable that the film clip in the Control 1 condition, which included more vivid information regarding the study, may have acutely resulted in more negative emotions such as anxiety, which in turn contributed to higher levels of perceived exertion [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, a second potential reason for the discrepancy may be that there still is a main effect of positive outcome expectations but this was not adequately captured with the Control 2 condition. This might have been the case, for instance, if the film clip in the Control 2 condition was not as effective as we intended. Our participants might not have fully believed in the story presented in the Control 2 condition (the present exercise is not long and vigorous enough to result in acute benefits) due to its counterintuitive message. Instead, the discussion of exercise health effects in the film clip may have primed the participants to believe in beneficial exercise aspects in the first place. In fact, on the basis of the perceived exertion and retrospective manipulation check data, it seems that participants in the Control 2 condition experienced the exercise similarly to the participants in positive expectation conditions. Unfortunately, because we did not collect further data on the acute effects of the film clips, such as subsequent expectations and emotions, the discrepancy between these two findings cannot be resolved in this study. Therefore, a potential effect of positive outcome expectations on perceived exertion must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In order to rule out potential alternative explanations (e.g., emotions elicited by the film clip instead of outcome expectations influenced perceived exertion during the exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), it will be necessary to conduct further experiments manipulating outcome expectations experimentally while controlling for emotions caused by the experimental manipulation [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Future research in this field would also benefit from an assessment of participants&#x02019; expectation directly after the experimental manipulation when one can assume that this assessment does not draw their attention to the true aim of the study [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180434.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, it would be helpful at the end of future experiments to include both suspicion checks to determine whether participants were skeptical about the cover story of the experiment and items assessing participants&#x02019; knowledge of placebo effects in order to additionally control for the influence of participants&#x02019; understanding of mind&#x02013;body effects [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>The moderating role of physical self-concept</title><p>This study indicated that physical self-concept plays a moderating role: Particularly for participants with a high physical self-concept, positive expectation induction resulted in reduced perceived exertion compared to the induction of the <italic>No Exercise-Effect Expectation</italic> (Control 2). This is consistent with the general notion that individuals with certain personality characteristics are more prone to placebo responses than others [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and more specifically, it is in line with findings showing that placebo interventions are more effective when individuals think positively about their own abilities [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Accordingly, physical self-concept may be an important variable to consider when one wants to take advantage of the role of expectations to reduce exertion levels in exercise contexts.</p><p>Our results also indicate that only participants who evaluated their physical abilities as being low (low physical self-concept) reported reduced perceived exertion when they were primed on potential positive aspects of the exercise product they were wearing (compression shirt). These results are in line with previous findings from marketing research suggesting that product-related beliefs can have a powerful effect on the actual effectiveness of a particular product, such as the compression shirt worn by the participants in our study (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Moreover, similar to the findings of Garvey and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our results suggest that individuals with rather negative attitudes regarding their own physical abilities derive particular benefit from positive expectations with respect to the beneficial qualities of an exercise product.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Unresolved issues</title><p>Several questions are left unanswered. First, how did positive expectations influence exertional experience? For instance, one potential psychological mechanism may be that individuals&#x02019; anticipation of exercise benefits resulted in increased attention towards body symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], leading them to identify more positive expectation-congruent sensations than expectation-incongruent exertional symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As identifying potential mechanisms of action was beyond the scope of the current study, future research should examine how expectations influence attentional processes and attributions of exertional symptoms. Second, what are the limitations of these expectation effects? We used a standardized moderate-intensity exercise to examine effects of expectations. However, by using a percentage (40%) of maximal power output relative to body weight instead of a more direct measure of aerobic/anaerobic metabolism at different exercise levels to standardize exercise intensity, we may have over- or underestimated intensity levels for certain individuals. Therefore, this study is limited with regard to the evaluation of expectation effects on perceived exertion at a specific intensity level. Nevertheless, previous research also suggests that cognitive influence on exercise experience, such as that of placebo expectations, may be largest at moderate intensities (dual mode theory, [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). Whether and how the effect of expectations on exertion may be generalized across different intensities has yet to be explored. Third, the generalizability across samples also remains open. This study used a sample of young and healthy sedentary individuals. Thus, future research should further investigate clinical samples as well as active and older individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Implications of the current findings</title><p>Despite these limiting aspects, our research has several implications. First, our approach provides insight into a new class of factors that potentially influence perceived exertion during exercise. Moreover, by indicating how expectations influence perceived exertion, these findings may have practical relevance for health-oriented exercisers. For instance, knowing about the role of expectations may help them to improve their exercise experience and long-term exercise adherence. Our research may also have implications for the marketing of exercise and sports equipment. The results imply that people with negative attitudes about their physical abilities in particular may &#x0201c;get what they pay for&#x0201d; when consuming sports products such as compression shirts. For instance, while there is only little evidence that the use of compression garments results in advantages for performance or well-being in general [<xref rid="pone.0180434.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180434.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], individuals with negative physical self-concepts may benefit from their use in the manner of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Last, our findings have more general implications for placebo research as they unravel another aspect of everyday life&#x02014;exertional experience during exercise&#x02014;in which the well-studied placebo-effect may play an important role.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180434.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180434.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180434.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Results of hierarchical regression analyses and simple slope analyses for the full sample (<italic>N</italic> = 78).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180434.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180434.s003"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Additional information on used survey questions and questionnaires.</title><p>Survey questions and questionnaires used in the study both in the original language (German) and in an English translation.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180434.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lena Molitor, Laura Thomas, Christian Heyde, Stefan Schmidt, and Berthold Krabbe for their assistance in conducting this study and Julia Herb, Mathis Trautwein, and Franz Koranyi for their comments on this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0180434.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tompkins</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Magnan</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Marcus</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hutchison</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name>. <article-title>The Big Picture of Individual Differences in Physical Activity Behavior Change: A Transdisciplinary Approach</article-title>. <source>Psychol Sport Exerc</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>12</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>20</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>6</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2010.05.002">10.1016/j.psychsport.2010.05.002</ext-link></comment> .<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21278837</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0180434.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ekkekakis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lind</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>Exercise does not feel the same when you are overweight: The impact of self-selected and imposed intensity on affect and exertion</article-title>. <source>Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>30</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>652</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>60</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.0803052">10.1038/sj.ijo.0803052</ext-link></comment> .<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16130028</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0180434.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sudeck</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Conzelmann</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Exercise Experiences and Changes in Affective Attitude: Direct and Indirect Effects of In Situ Measurements of Experiences</article-title>. <source>Front Psychol</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>7</volume>:<fpage>900</fpage>
