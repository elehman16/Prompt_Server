using different irrigants and intracanal medication on endotoxin levels found in
root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>Thirty root canals of teeth with pulpal necrosis associated with periapical
lesions were selected and randomly divided into groups according to the irrigants
used: GI - 2.5% NaOCl, GII - 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel, and GIII - saline
solution (SS) (all, n=10). Samples were collected with sterile/apyrogenic paper
points before (S1) and after root canal instrumentation (S2), after use of 17%
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (S3), and after 30 days of intracanal
medication (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>+SS) (S4). A turbidimetric kinetic Limulus Amebocyte
Lysate assay was used for endotoxin measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canals investigated (30/30), with a
median value of 18.70 EU/mL. After S2, significant median percentage reduction was
observed in all groups, irrespective of the irrigant tested: 2.5% NaOCl (99.65%)
(GI), 2% CHX (94.27%) (GII), and SS (96.79%) (GIII) (all p&#x0003c;0.05). Root canal
rinse with 17% EDTA (S3) for a 3-minute period failed to decrease endotoxin levels
in GI and a slight decrease was observed in GII (59%) and GIII (61.1%) (all
p&#x0003e;0.05). Intracanal medication for 30 days was able to significantly reduce
residual endotoxins: 2.5% NaOCl (90%) (GI), 2% CHX (88.8%) (GII), and SS (85.7%)
(GIII, p&#x0003c;0.05). No differences were found in the endotoxin reduction when
comparing s2 and s4 treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the mechanical action of the
instruments along with the flow and backflow of irrigant enduring root canal
instrumentation for the endotoxin removal from root canals of teeth with chronic
apical periodontitis. Moreover, the use of intracanal medication for 30 days
contributed for an improvement of endotoxin reduction.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endotoxins</kwd><kwd>EDTA</kwd><kwd>Chlorhexidine</kwd><kwd>Sodium hypochlorite</kwd><kwd>Root canal</kwd><kwd>Medications</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agencies S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>13/024029</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agencies S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>10/13743-3</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agencies S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>10/19136-1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agencies S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>10/17877-4</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agencies S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>11/09047-4</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Council for Scientific and Technological

features of endodontic disease<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>It has long been known that endotoxins found in pulp spaces and periapical areas are
highly immunostimulatory, even at low concentrations<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. This molecule is
recognized by the human host as a foreign<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
eliciting a potent immune response that results in the release of different
pro-inflammatory cytokines commonly involved in the pathogenesis of apical
periodontitis<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In the light of this antigenic activity,
detoxifying endotoxins from root canals during endodontic treatment may facilitate the
healing process of the periapical tissues<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>Considering that necrotic teeth associated with periapical lesions contain an increased
amount of endotoxins<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, there is a great effort in the search for
effective clinical procedures for their removal.</p><p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that chemomechanical preparation (CMP) using hand
K-files for apical preparation 1 mm from the radiographic apex together with either
sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) or chlorhexidine (CHX) used as auxiliary chemical substance,
has little or no effect on LPS present in root canals<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, thus contributing to a reduction of only 50% of
the LPS load. Conversely, root canal preparation with rotary instruments in the full
extension of the root canal was capable to achieve a removal of 90% of the LPS
content<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. However,
this virulence factor can still be detected in 100% of the root canal samples after
instrumentation.</p><p>Because of the detoxifying activity of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>], its use
as intracanal medication in infected root canals has been investigated<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Vianna, et al.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (2007) reported that root canal dressing for 7 days contributes to a
reduction of endotoxin in only 1.4% compared to the reduction observed after root canal
instrumentation. Furthermore, the application of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> for 14 days
contributed to improve the removal of endotoxins by 12%<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. This finding suggests that an extended period of intracanal medication
could contribute to a better removal of endotoxins from infected root canals. Recently,
Sousa, et al.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (2014) have demonstrated that
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>+2% CHX gel as root canal medicament for a 30-day period was able
to significantly reduce endotoxins from root canals associated with acute apical
abscesses. However, there is no currently published clinical study monitoring the
effectiveness of root canal procedures, involving both chemomechanical preparation with
different auxiliary chemical substances and the use of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> as root canal
medication for an extended period of 30 days, aiming at the reduction of endotoxins from
root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.</p><p>Therefore, this study was conducted to monitor the effectiveness of root canal
procedures by using different irrigants and intracanal medication on endotoxin removal
from root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Thirty patients who attended the Piracicaba Dental School (SP, Brazil) for primary
endodontic treatment were included in this study. A detailed dental history was
obtained from each patient. Patients who had received antibiotic treatment during the
previous 3 months or who had a general disease were excluded from the study. The
selected teeth showed absence of periodontal pockets deeper than 4 mm. Their pulp
chamber exhibited no visual communication with the oral fluid. The Human Research
Ethics Committee of the Piracicaba Dental School approved a protocol describing the
sample collection for this investigation, and all patients signed an informed consent
form for their participation in this research.</p><p>All the selected teeth were single-rooted showing the presence of one root canal with
pulp necrosis and radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis. A radiolucent area
&#x0003e;4 mm was present in 11/30 patients. None of the patients reported spontaneous
pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling procedure</title><p>For degradation of preexisting endotoxins, all the materials used in the experiment
were sterilized by gamma radiation with cobalt 60 (20 KGy for 6 hours)<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The method used for disinfecting the operative
field has been previously published<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Initially, the
teeth were isolated with a rubber dam. The crown and surrounding structures were
disinfected with 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (volume/volume [V/V]) for 30 seconds,
followed by 2.5% NaOCl for the same period of time and then inactivated with 5%
sodium thiosulphate.</p><p>With regard to the access cavity preparation, a sterile/apyrogenic high-speed diamond
bur (KG-Sorensen, Barueri, SP, Brazil) was used in conjunction with manual irrigation
with sterile saline. Before entering the pulp chamber, the access cavity was
disinfected according to the protocol described above. A new sterile/apyrogenic bur
was used to access the canal.</p><p>Root canal length was determined by preoperative radiograph and then, the first
endotoxin sample (s1) was taken by introducing a sterile/apyrogenic paper point #15
(Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) into the full length of the canal and
left there for 1 minute. Then, the sample was placed in an apyrogenic glass and
immediately suspended in 1 mL Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) water for further
quantification of endotoxins.</p><p>After the first endotoxin sampling (s1), root canal length was confirmed by apex
locator (Novapex; Forum Technologies, Rishon le-Zion, Israel) and the teeth were
randomly divided into 3 groups according to the irrigant used for CMP: GI - 2.5%
NaOCl (n=10), GII - 2% CHX gel (n=10), and GIII - saline solution (n=10).</p><p>The root canals were then prepared with Mtwo instruments (VDW, Munich, Germany) with
permanent rotation at a speed of 300 rpm<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.
Mtwo instruments (10/.04, 15/.05, 20/.06, 25/.06, 30/.05, 35/.04 and 40/.04) were
used up to full length of the root canal using a single-length technique, with gentle
in-and-out movements while gradually forcing apically<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The use of each instrument was followed by the selected irrigant used
for CMP.</p><p>In GI, root canal irrigation was performed with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl solution,
simultaneously removed by suction. In GII, 1 mL of 2% CHX gel was introduced into the
root canal with a 3 mL syringe and a 27-gauge needle (Ultradent Products, South
Jordan, UT, USA) and, immediately after the use of each instrument, 5 mL of
sterile/apyrogenic saline solution were used to wash the canal. In GIII, root canal
irrigation was performed with 5 mL of saline solution, simultaneously removed by
suction. All irrigation procedures were performed with a 27-gauge needle.</p><p>After root canal preparation, NaOCl was inactivated with 5 mL of sterile 5% sodium
thiosulphate for 1 minute, which then was removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic
saline solution. The chemical activity of CHX was inactivated with 5 mL of a solution
containing 5% Tween 80 and 0.07% (v/v) lecithin for 1 minute, which was then removed
with 5 mL sterile/apyrogenic saline solution.</p><p>After neutralization of the auxiliary chemical substances, a second endotoxin sample
(s2) was taken from the root canals. Removal of the smear layer was performed with 3
mL of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for 3 minutes, followed by
a final flush with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic saline solution. Next, the third
endotoxin sample (s3) was taken.</p><p>Subsequently, the canals were filled with freshly prepared paste of
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> in saline solution (1:1). The paste was inserted into the
canals by using a sterile/apyrogenic Lentulo bur (Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues,
Switzerland). Special attention was paid to complete fill the root canal with the
medication. A cotton pellet was used to condense the paste at the canal orifice level
and a periapical radiography was performed to ensure the quality of the root canal
fill. Next, the access cavities were sealed with light-cured resin composites (3M
Dental Products, St Paul, MN, USA). After 30 days of intracanal medication, the
canals were aseptically accessed under rubber dam isolation according to the protocol
for disinfection, as previously described. The medication was removed with a file
size 45, 0.02 taper against the lateral walls of the root canal and copious
irrigation with 10 mL of saline solution. Afterwards, a final root canal sampling
(s4) was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of endotoxin concentration</title><p>The turbidimetric test (Pyrogent 5000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Lonza, BioWhitaker, Inc,
Walkersville, MD, USA) was used to measure endotoxin concentrations in the root
canals according to the LAL technique, as previously published by the authors<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. As a parameter
for calculation of the amount of endotoxins in the root canal samples, a standard
curve was plotted by using the endotoxin of known concentration supplied by the kit
(100 EU/mL), with its dilutions reaching final concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10
EU/mL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firstly, the endotoxin samples
were suspended in 1 mL of LAL water supplied by the kit and agitated in vortex for 60
seconds. Next, 100 mL of the blank, followed by the same volume of the standard
endotoxin solutions (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 EU/mL) and 100 mL of the samples, were
immediately added in duplicate to a 96-well microplate with their respectively
positive controls. To avoid inhibition or enhancement of LAL, a known concentration
of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> endotoxin was added to the clinical samples, as
recommended in the manufacturer's instructions (spike procedure). Both unspiked and
spiked samples (positive control) had their endotoxin concentrations automatically
calculated. The amount of endotoxins recovered was equal to the known spike
concentration, ranging from 50% to 200%. A 96-well microplate (Corning Costar,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was placed on a heating block at 37&#x000ba;C and maintained there at
this temperature throughout the assay. The test procedure was performed according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance of endotoxins was individually
measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Ultramark,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA). During calculation of the endotoxin
concentration, the microplate reader monitors the absorbance of each well of the
microplate continuously at 340 nm by means of the WinKQCL software (BioWittaker,
Cambrex Co, Walkersville, MD, USA). The WinKQCL software automatically performs a
log/log linear correlation of the reaction time of each standard curve with its
corresponding endotoxin concentration, including printing the standard curve
parameters. If the absolute value of the correlation coefficient &#x000ae; is 0.980, a
polynomial model can be used to construct a standard curve and, in turn, predict
endotoxin concentrations of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data obtained with LAL assay were statistically analyzed using SAS Software,
version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The KolmogorovSmirnov's test showed that
the distributions of the studied variables deviated from normality. Friedman's test
was performed to compare the levels of endotoxin at different sampling times.
Wilcoxon's test was used when significant differences were found. Comparison between
the experimental groups (GI, GII and GIII) was performed by using the Kruskal-Wallis'
test. Significance level was set at 5% (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>

endodontic procedure, providing particular information on the effectiveness of every
phase of the root canal therapy. Furthermore, the results found will allow a further
development of clinical protocols to enhance detoxification.</p><p>For this purpose, LAL assay was used to measure the levels of endotoxins and to evaluate
the effect of root canal procedures on its removal. Among the LAL methods, the
turbidimetric method (Pyrogent-5000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), which presents a wide range of
detection (0.01 to 100 EU/mL), proved to be sensitive and effective in recovering
endotoxin from endodontic samples even at very low concentrations.</p><p>In our study, endotoxin was recovered from all root canal samples collected from
infected root canals, as reported in previous studies<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. At the baseline samples, endotoxin was detected
in a median value of 18.7 EU/mL. After chemomechanical preparation, statistically
significant percentage values of endotoxin reduction were achieved by the root canal
instrumentation with rotary Mtwo files accomplished by 2.5% NaOCl (99.65%), 2% CHX gel
(94.27%) as well as saline solution (96.79%). It must be highlighted that the root canal
preparation with an inert irrigant (saline solution) obtained a great percentage of
reduction with no differences among the antimicrobial substances tested. In the face
with the "no-detoxifying" ability of NaOCl and CHX, it seems reasonable to assume that
the chemical action of these irrigants is critical for the removal of intracanal
bacteria<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, but not a relevant factor regarding endotoxin removal. In

<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, our results showed
that the mechanical action of the endodontic instruments associated with the physical
action of the root canal irrigation seems to play a role in the endotoxin removal from
infected root canals.</p><p>It is worth to mention that the apical limit of the root canal instrumentation exerts a
direct influence in endotoxin removal<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.
Particularly in cases of pulpal necrosis associated with a periapical lesion, as
evaluated by this study, the establishment of the working length up to the full
extension of the root canal, rather than 1 mm from the apical foramen, might have
ensured a better debridement by the mechanical action of the instruments compared to
previous investigations<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>During and after root canal instrumentation it is necessary to remove both the organic
and inorganic remnants by the use of chelating agents [i.e., ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)]<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. EDTA strongly chelates with Ca2+
and other divalent cations<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, demineralizes dentin
and penetrates into deeper layers (130 &#x000b5;m) of dentin not prepared chemomechanically<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Due to its properties, we hypothesized that EDTA
might contribute for the endotoxin removal from root canal walls during endodontic
treatment. However, no significant differences were observed in the percentage values of
endotoxin reduction after the use of 17% EDTA when compared with the reduction obtained
after root canal instrumentation, agreeing with the findings of Sousa, et al.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (2014).</p><p>It is reported that the use of EDTA alone is not effective for complete removal of the
smear layer, in both young and old dentin, but the combination with NaOCl seems to be
the best cleansing approach<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Surprisingly, our
results showed that 17% EDTA failed to decrease endotoxin levels in the NaOCl group
after smear layer removal. It is known that the decalcifying efficacy of acids and
chelating agents depends largely on application time, the pH and concentration of the
solution, and the hardness of dentin<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In
addition, sclerosis of dentin is another important factor that affects the efficiency of
demineralizing agents<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p><p>In this study, root canal preparation was able to drastically reduce endotoxins, despite
not eliminating all content. It is known that minimal amounts of endotoxins can express
potent bioactivity and thus maintain an inflammatory process<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Calcium hydroxide is
arguably the most commonly used intracanal medication and seems to be clinically
beneficial when endotoxin is suspected in a canal<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Due to its very alkaline pH of 10-12, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> neutralizes LPS
by hydrolysis of ester bonds in the lipid A chains. The slightest variation of the fatty
acid chains of the bioactive molecule's lipid A portion renders the entire molecule
biologically inactive<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>The ability of calcium hydroxide medication for 30 days to improve the endotoxin
reduction from root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis was demonstrated
by the present study. After 30 days of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> medication, the levels of
endotoxins were reduced to a median percentage value of 99.9% (NaOCl and SS) and 99.4%
(CHX) with no differences between the endotoxin reduction achieved immediately after
root canal preparation. However, an extended use of the intracanal medication for 30
days in chronic cases, as shown by the present study and in acute cases as evaluated by
Sousa, et al.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (2014), compared with a 7-day
medication by Vianna, et al.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (2007), seemed to
be important for a better <italic>in vivo</italic> endotoxin reduction activity of
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the mechanical action of
instruments together with the flow and backflow of irrigant enduring root canal
instrumentation for endotoxin removal from root canals of teeth with chronic apical

improvement of the endotoxin reduction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEGDEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Ana Regina de Oliveira Polay for the technical support. This work
