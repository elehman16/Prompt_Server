Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) markedly enhances immune responses to H5N1 vaccine antigens, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective and Methods</title><p>We compared the safety (primary endpoint), immunogenicity (secondary), gene expression (tertiary) and cytokine responses (exploratory) between AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines. In a double-blinded clinical trial, we randomized twenty adults aged 18&#x02013;49 to receive two doses of either AS03-adjuvanted (n = 10) or unadjuvanted (n = 10) H5N1 vaccine 28 days apart. We used a systems biology approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer &#x0003e; 1:40) at day 56. Within 24 hours of AS03-adjuvanted vaccination, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upregulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and division was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after first vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using this cell-based systems approach, novel mechanisms of action for AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccination were observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01573312">NCT01573312</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract No. 272200800007C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Kathryn M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract No. 2722001300023I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Kathryn M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. GM64779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>Andrew J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007206</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR024975 (UL1TR000445)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Kathryn M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-AI095202-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4301-7235</contrib-id><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Leigh M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Vanderbilt University Medical Center (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Department of Pediatrics Turner-Hazinski Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4301-7235</contrib-id><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Leigh M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Merit Award No. BX001444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyce</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL069765-12</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award009"><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health Immunobiology of Blood and Vascular Systems Training</institution></funding-source><award-id>T32HL069765-12</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded in part with federal funds from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract Nos. 272200800007C and 2722001300023I and Grant No. GM64779; the Vanderbilt Clinical and Translational Science Award grant NIH RR024975 (UL1TR000445); the Childhood Infections Research Program grant T32-AI095202-01; the Vanderbilt Department of Pediatrics Turner-Hazinski Award, a VA Merit Award BX001444; and the Immunobiology of Blood and Vascular Systems Training Grant T32-HL069765-12.

Adjuvants, such as aluminum salts, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) with aluminum salt (AS04) [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167488.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and oil-in-water emulsion-based formulations (MF59, AF03, AS03) [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], have been shown to increase the immunogenicity of both seasonal and avian influenza vaccines and decrease the amount of antigen required (antigen-sparing) [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One such emulsion-based, TLR-independent adjuvant, Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], has been shown to markedly increase the immune response to avian influenza vaccines and to stimulate significantly higher antibody responses compared to MF59 when administered with H7N9 vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Initial studies of the mechanisms of action of AS03 in animal models suggest that the adjuvant enhances antigen delivery, immune cell recruitment, stimulation of local immune cells, and induction of complement and other stress signals [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. AS03 has also been shown to increase innate immune responses and promote recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (APC) to draining lymph nodes [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Transcriptomic analysis of mouse muscle cells at vaccine injection sites has demonstrated that other oil-in-water adjuvants also stimulate local expression of genes involved in innate immune responses including cytokine activity, leukocyte migration, and antigen presentation [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167488.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Finally, a recent AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 human vaccine study identified early cytokine responses and gene responses related to interferon signaling and antigen presentation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at day 1, as well as increased incidence of plasma cells and plasma cell-associated genes at day 7 [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our understanding of the molecular interactions by which AS03 enhances human immune responses to H5N1 vaccine is still incomplete.</p><p>Systems vaccinology offers a comprehensive approach to dissect the human immune response to vaccination by correlating traditional antibody and cell-mediated immune responses with changes in global molecular signatures of gene, protein, metabolite, and lipid expression [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We recently reported the use of a systems biology approach to study the immune responses in six individual immune cell types following vaccination with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. That study revealed that monocytes, neutrophils, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells showed unique transcriptomic profiles and changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. Such cell type-specific systems information provides a unique approach to monitor transcriptional responses after vaccination.</p><p>Using this approach, we conducted a small, single center study with the objectives to assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and molecular immune responses to intramuscular (IM) administration of an inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (Hemagglutinin [HA] of A/Indonesia/05/2005) split-virus vaccine given with or without the AS03 adjuvant. Our comprehensive cell-based systems analysis of human transcriptomic responses to H5N1 vaccine indicates that AS03 modulates early innate immune gene expression and increased serum cytokine responses, with the strongest effect for genes expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Potentially novel mechanisms of action for the AS03 adjuvant when administered with avian influenza vaccine were identified, including up-regulation of antigen processing and presentation genes in neutrophils and induction of cellular proliferation responses that correlated with serum IP-10 levels in NK cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Products</title><p>Inactivated monovalent influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 split-virus vaccine at a dosage of 3.75 mcg and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent were both manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.

Twenty subjects were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive either 3.75 mcg of H5 hemagglutinin + AS03 (n = 10) or 3.75 mcg of H5 hemagglutinin + PBS (n = 10). Permuted block randomization with random block sizes of 2 and 4 were applied to improve balance between vaccine groups. The treatment allocation sequence was generated by the study statistician using a random number generator. A secure web portal was used to assign treatment codes to subjects after verification of eligibility. An unblinded pharmacist prepared the treatment per the assigned code, which was then administered by an unblinded vaccine administrator who had no further contact with the subject. All subjects received two 0.5 mL intramuscular injections 28 days apart containing equal volumes of the inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 split-virus vaccine admixed by the study pharmacist prior to administration with either AS03 or PBS. As the adjuvant had a milky white appearance, the subject was asked to look away during injection.

LCPMs were used as input for multivariate analyses to detect outliers and to filter out lowly expressed genes (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). Log<sub>2</sub> fold changes from baseline (LFCPM) were calculated for each subject and immune cell type by subtracting the mean of the log<sub>2</sub> baseline values (days -28, -14, 0) from each of the subject&#x02019;s post-baseline days. Differentially expressed (DE) genes (SV-AS03 vs. SV-PBS) were identified for each post-vaccination day and immune cell type by fitting negative binomial generalized linear models as implemented in <italic>edgeR</italic> under the assumption that discrete fragment counts are negative binomial distributed. Models included fixed effects for subject, study visit day (baseline or post-vaccination day), and a study visit day x vaccine group interaction term (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). The subject effect for estimating subject-specific mean baseline levels was added to account for correlations between samples from the same subject. The interaction term represents the log<sub>2</sub> fold change difference (LFCD) between SV-AS03 and SV-PBS vaccine group responses. The statistical significance of the interaction term was evaluated for each gene using a likelihood ratio test.

Additionally, substantial overlap of our data with previously published immunological response gene sets, including vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines, infection (viral or bacterial), cytokine signaling, and LPS stimulation, suggests that the majority of genes differentially expressed in response to AS03-adjuvanted vaccine are also induced by other immunological events.</p><p>One explanation for the early transcriptional signatures that we observed could be that addition of AS03 to vaccine preparations results in a &#x0201c;pseudo-infection&#x0201d; in which induction of cytokine production at the injection site recruits and activates local immune cells. In support of this idea, comparative analysis of the gene sets published by Ramilo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. and Ioannidis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. in their studies of infections with influenza and other infectious agents, as well as other studies of live-virus vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] or stimulation of immune cells with live virus [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], revealed a strong overlap with genes identified in our study at day 1 in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and our 80 core AS03-responsive genes, and to a lesser extent with NK cells and T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s009">S8 Table</xref></bold>). Additionally, compared to the gene sets published by Nakaya <italic>et al</italic>. in their systems study of the response to seasonal influenza vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], our data set shows a stronger overlap with LAIV-induced genes compared to TIV-induced genes, most notably in neutrophils and monocytes at day 1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s009">S8 Table</xref></bold>). While we observed that AS03 modulated multiple interferon-inducible genes in all cell types, we did not observe a strong differential signal for the genes encoding &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; interferons themselves in any cell type, as has also been reported recently in a study with AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, genes encoding for the interferon receptor for interferon alpha/beta (IFNAR) were slightly upregulated in monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils from the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group at day 1 (<bold>Figs A118-A120 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). Additionally, differential results showed that many genes in the JAK/STAT pathway were upregulated in the adjuvanted group, resulting in an upregulation of clusters of interferon inducible genes, particularly in monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s005">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s006">S5</xref> Tables,</bold> and <bold>Figs A118-A120 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). Neutrophils showed a prolonged response up to day 3, with a cluster of interferon induced genes reaching their peak at this time (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). For monocytes and dendritic cells, but not neutrophils, SOCS3 [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167488.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], a negative regulator that inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by STAT genes, was significantly upregulated at day 1, potentially explaining the short-lived response in these cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s005">S4 Table</xref></bold> and <bold>Figs A118 and A119 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). Although our data do not indicate whether this activation is direct, indirect, or a combination of both, taken together, the data suggest that AS03 in combination with the split-virus avian vaccine acts to promote an early, innate response that may mimic infection, thus impacting activation and gene expression within neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells.</p><p>Our data indicate that AS03 induces class I antigen processing and presentation in multiple cell types after vaccination, as expected given that all cell types can potentially present antigen in the context of MHC class I. Additionally, we found that genes involved in controlling MHC class II-restricted antigen processing and presentation pathways were differentially expressed in monocytes and neutrophils following AS03-adjuvanted vaccination relative to unadjuvanted vaccination. Monocytes are known to function as APC under inflammatory conditions. However, our results show that neutrophils also increased expression of MHC class II (HLAs) genes and other molecules associated with antigen processing and presentation following vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>). Evidence is emerging that suggests neutrophils may participate in MHC class-II-restricted antigen processing and presentation; however, their ability to serve as APCs is currently debated [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Several previous studies administering adjuvanted vaccines in animal models have shown that although neutrophils are recruited to the site of vaccination, take up antigen, and subsequently traffic to the draining lymph nodes, they may be dispensable for generation of protective antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167488.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In fact, the study by Yang <italic>et al</italic>. suggests that neutrophils may act as a &#x0201c;rheostat&#x0201d; for antigen presentation and signaling after the delivery of adjuvanted vaccines by sequestering antigen away from professional APCs and thus dampening the level of antigen presentation. It is important to note that neither of these earlier studies utilized AS03 as an adjuvant, although Calabro <italic>et al</italic>. utilized MF59 [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], another oil-in-water adjuvant. Thus, increased MHC activity in neutrophils in response to AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination could function to either increase or decrease antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, depending on whether neutrophils play an active or regulatory role in MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. Additional studies are needed to determine the potential role that neutrophils may play in antigen presentation following AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination[<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>NK cells demonstrated increased expression of cell activation genes in the SV-AS03 vaccine group at day 3, which likely implies a more rapid expansion of these lymphocytes in response to the adjuvanted vaccine (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). These gene expression changes in NK cells were highly correlated with changes in serum IP-10 concentration, with the strongest correlations observed for <italic>CDC6</italic> and <italic>CDC45</italic>. <italic>CDC6</italic> expression is limited to proliferating cells and is regulated by <italic>E2F</italic> transcription factors, which were also upregulated and correlated with IP-10 [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. These results imply a causal relationship in which AS03 in combination with the split-virus triggers IP-10-mediated NK cell proliferation via upregulation of co-expressed gene modules. IP-10 is a known chemoattractant and activator of NK cells [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Accordingly, expression of the receptor for IP-10 (<italic>CXCR3</italic>) was increased in NK cells from the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group (<bold>Fig A216 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>). Additionally, while initially identified as MHC class-II related genes, the kinesins (<italic>Reactome</italic> pathway; <italic>KIF2C</italic>, <italic>KIF15</italic>, <italic>KIF18A</italic>, <italic>KIF20A</italic>, <italic>KIF23</italic>) modulated by AS03 at day 3 in NK more likely play a role in cell division, as multiple modules of proliferation- and cell division-related genes were identified in this cell type at this time point. These data suggest that NK cells were activated in response to SV-AS03 vaccination. However, NK cells typically function in the context of infection, where they are recruited to the site of infection and actively kill infected cells. The role that these cells might play in response to adjuvanted avian influenza vaccine remains to be determined.</p><p>NK cells from the SV-PBS group exhibited a significant increase in expression of MHC class-II related genes at day 28, the only significant increase in MHC class-II related genes in any cell type in the unadjuvanted vaccine group at any time point (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>). While not considered classical APC, NK cells have been previously reported to upregulate MHC class-II and present antigen to T cells [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Subjects receiving unadjuvanted vaccine did not achieve seroprotection; however, H5-specific antibody titers were increased relative to baseline, suggesting that low-level immune induction occurred. In support of this theory, Gillard <italic>et al</italic>. have previously shown that a 2-dose prime regimen with 3.75mcg of split-virus H5N1 vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) without adjuvants led to cross-reactive seroprotection following a second 2-dose boost regimen with a heterologous 3.75mcg split-virus unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccine (A/Indonesia/5/2005) administered 6 months later [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Accordingly, the monocyte and neutrophil time trend responses that we observed to accompany early upregulation of MHC class-II responses in those cell types in the SV-AS03 group were also increased slightly at day 28 in the unadjuvanted vaccine group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). These data suggest that following unadjuvanted low-dose H5N1 vaccine, the cell types and mechanisms utilized for class-II antigen presentation may be different, and the magnitude and kinetics of the immune response delayed, compared to that obtained following AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. These observations will need to be confirmed.</p><p>The cytokine findings, similar to transcriptomic data, indicate that AS03 modulated early innate responses (day 1 and day 3). IP-10 and IL-6 showed a significant differential response between vaccine groups, with both cytokines displaying higher responses for the SV-AS03 group at day 1, consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167488.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. IP-10 also sustained an increased, albeit a weaker, response at day 3 post-vaccination. Consistent with serum cytokine levels, monocytes and dendritic cells in the SV-AS03 group showed significant upregulation of <italic>CXCL10</italic>, the gene encoding IP-10, at day 1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s005">S4 Table</xref></bold>). The lack of a differential gene response in any cell type and the low concentration of IFN-&#x003b3; in serum cytokine measurements at days 1, 3, and 7 after vaccination implies that either this cytokine did not play a role in modulating early innate responses, that the IFN response was driven by type I IFNs, or, more likely, that the IFN response occurred transiently and/or locally and was not captured by our study time points/blood immune cell selection [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our immune cell-specific predictive models of seroprotection did show that an early upregulation of genes related to IFN signaling increased the likelihood of later seroprotection. In this regard, an increase in <italic>STAT1</italic> expression was predictive of seroprotection for all six immune cell types.</p><p>Additional studies will be required to confirm the observed immune cell responses, implicated pathways, and predictive ability of the presented models. Additionally, as both vaccine groups received the H5N1 split-virus, a distinction between immune responses against AS03 and split-virus antigens was not possible. The small sample size of 10 subjects in each group also limits the generalizability of our results. However, our study highlights the strengths of assessing transcriptomic responses of multiple individual immune cell types in parallel. By including additional baseline measurements, we increased the robustness of fold change estimates. The use of RNA-Seq enabled more sensitive determination of responses at the transcriptional level than is possible using microarrays. Furthermore, the granular information that we obtained might have been lost by an assessment of mixed populations of immune cells such as whole blood or PBMC. For example, our cell-based analysis clearly shows that SV-AS03 vaccination induced stronger MHC-II representation-related gene responses in neutrophils compared to DC and monocytes (<bold>Figs A106-108 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s012">S2 Text</xref></bold>), and NK cell-specific proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167488.g006">Fig 6</xref>)</bold>. Other than the absence of plasma cell-related gene signatures in our data, likely reflecting the lack of pre-exposure levels in our subjects to H5N1 influenza, which has not been detected in humans in the US [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], our findings generally overlap with the recently published study by Sobolev et al., which also noted an increase in blood monocytes, as well as interferon- and antigen presentation-related gene expression signals 24h after immunization with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0167488.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, by assaying individual cell types, our study identified more precisely the cellular sources of these and other gene signatures. In summary, our findings demonstrate that application of a cell-based systems approach reveals potentially novel mechanisms of action for the AS03 adjuvant, including up-regulation of antigen processing and presentation genes in neutrophils and induction of cellular proliferation processes that correlated with serum IP-10 levels in NK cells at early time points after vaccination, and provides a greater understanding of the biological functions underlying immune responses to vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167488.s001"><label>S1 Study Protocol</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167488.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167488.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Antibody, cytokine, and immune cell measures by subject and time point.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167488.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167488.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>RNA-Seq fragment counts for human genes (Ensembl, Version 63) by subject, immune cell type, and time point.</title><p>Exclusion of known ribosomal, transfer, and mitochondrial RNA genes and genes located on the X or Y chromosomes is indicated in the &#x02018;Excluded&#x02019; field. </p><p>(BZ2)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167488.s003.bz2"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167488.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>RNA-Seq moderated log<sub>2</sub> fragment counts per million (LCPM) for human genes (Ensembl, Version 63).</title><p>Known ribosomal, transfer, and mitochondrial RNA genes, genes located on the X or Y chromosomes (indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167488.s009"><bold>S8 </bold>Table</xref>), and genes that did not pass the low-expression cut-off by subject, immune cell, and time point, were excluded.
