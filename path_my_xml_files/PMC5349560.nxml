During this period, it has been popularized as a useful device to relieve the obstruction, divert urine, dilate ureter and allow faster tissue healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> But patients have experienced a variety of stent-related morbidities.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The most common complication is &#x0201c;stent syndrome,&#x0201d; for which patients experience symptoms like irritative urinary symptoms, flank pain, suprapubic discomfort and hematuria.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> To assess these symptoms in a systematized manner, for the first time, Joshi et al. developed and validated the USSQ and evaluated stent-related morbidity. They reported 80% urinary symptoms and pain and 40% sexual dysfunction in patients with a DJ ureteral stent.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Several attempts have been reported to minimize stent-related symptoms including changing stent material, application of appropriate stent length, periureteral injection of botulinum toxin A after stent insertion and pharmacological managements. A great effort has been made to improve ureteral stent characteristics in order to minimize morbidities. However, the ideal stent is not yet available.</p><p>There are few data about pharmaceutical treatment of these symptoms. Among the medications, alpha-1 antagonists have been the most valuable for the relief of stent-related symptoms and improving the QoL of these patients. However, anticholinergic agents have been prescribed anecdotally. The mechanism of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist involves the reduction of ureter and trigon smooth muscle activity and the mechanism of the anticholinergic drug involves relief of involuntary bladder contraction that is mediated with muscarinic receptors. Mokhtari et al. evaluated the effect of Terazosin for relief of urinary tract and flank pain in patients with DJS in comparison with placebo. They used IPSS questionnaire and VAS for evaluation and concluded that administration of Terazosin improves urinary tract symptoms and pain but has no effect on hematuria.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Dellis et al. in a prospective randomized control study compared Tamsulosin 0.4&#x02009;mg and Alfuzosin 10&#x02009;mg with placebo in 150 patients with a double-J ureteral stent. They used validated USSQ and concluded that simple medication, such as &#x003b1;-blockers, reduces stent-related symptoms and the negative impact of it on QoL and stent-related symptom improvement was independent of the type of &#x003b1;-blocker.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In other systematic review and network meta-analysis for Alfuzosin versus Tamsulosin versus placebo for ureteral stent-related discomfort, Kwon et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> observed that alpha-blockers significantly decrease urinary symptom score (USS) and body pain score (BPS) in comparison with placebo and Tamsulosin was more effective than Alfuzosin.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In another similar study, Valiere Vialeix et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> evaluated Tamsulosin versus placebo for management of ureteral stent discomfort.

A meta-analysis of 13 articles including 1408 patients from January 2000 to May 2014 showed the beneficial effect of &#x003b1;-blockers and antimuscarinics in reducing stent-related symptoms. Furthermore, it also showed the significant advantages of combination therapy of &#x003b1;-blocker and antimuscarinics compared with &#x003b1;-blocker monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117696436" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> El-Nahas et al. compared the effectiveness of Tamsulosin and Solifenacin in relieving ureteral stent&#x02013;related symptoms. The study included 131 patients. All baseline characteristics (age, sex, side, indication, length and duration of stent placement) were compared for all groups. Total USSQ score was 61 in Solifenacin group, 76 in Tamsulosin group and 83 in the control group (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Our patients experienced less urinary symptoms with Tolterodine, and both Tolterodine and Tamsulosin made a significant reduction in the symptoms in a chronological manner from the first week to the fourth week. All the patients in three groups had fewer pain scores in the fourth week than the first week. These effects in drug groups were more significant than placebo. Although this can be concluded as the placebo effect, the drugs made a really greater reduction in pain as time passed. Patients had better general health in the fourth week of Tolterodine consumption. This effect was not only better than placebo but also better than Tamsulosin. No other group made a significant difference even by time passage. Tamsulosin group had a worse quality of work in the first week than the two other groups. Although, only three patients reported significant side effects of Tamsulosin. Asthenia is a known side effect of it and can be responsible for the impairment of &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d;, job efficacy and regular hours of work.</p><p>Patients who had sex during the stent in situ did not experience significant improvement by drug consumption, but all groups had better sex after 4&#x02009;weeks. Although this can be interpreted as a placebo effect, drug groups had really greater improvement compared to placebo.</p><p>Neither drugs nor placebo resulted in any difference in QoL. Although time passage made some symptoms better, the patients did not experience prospered or deteriorated sense about having a stent again in the future. If they are not benefited from drugs or even placebo effect, they should have had a worse feeling about repeating this procedure. Overall, positive effects of Tolterodine were remarkable in the fourth week, and indeed, time passage itself had positive effect in some symptoms.</p><p>In the subgroup who had pain, there were some significant differences between drug groups and placebo: first, Tolterodine was more effective in pain index score in comparison with placebo, and second, Tolterodine improved symptoms in five-part USSQ questionnaire in the fourth week. The variations in these five parts have a logical correlation to each other; for example, the patients who had stent-related urinary symptoms have more chance for sexual dysfunction, and the patients who had urinary symptoms, pain and inappropriate general health had bad quality and quantity of job. Our study showed that anticholinergic and &#x003b1;-blockers are effective in improving stent-related urinary symptoms, body pain and general health; also, these drugs, especially Tolterodine, are effective in sexual function quality. The limitations of our study are small sample size specially for pain score index, and the 25 patients reduction in comparison to primary estimated sample size because of mentioned reasons in &#x02018;Results&#x02019; section maybe is a big bias, and it might be better to assess the effect of Tamsulosin and Tolterodine as combination so as to evaluate the prosperity of prescription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-2050312117696436"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In some stent-related symptoms between the groups, there was no significant difference, but in the case of drug groups, Tolterodine had higher general health score in the fourth week and less mean pain index score; the difference was significant in the subgroup who had pain, albeit our sample size must be large for such a precise result. All in mind we suggest Tolterodine to minimize stent-related symptoms however we need further studies with larger sample size to determine superior medicines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supplementary_file.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e774" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Author contribution:</bold> M.M. helped in project development and data collection; H.A. contributed by taking part in data collection, data analysis and manuscript writing; S.E. helped in data collection; H.R. helped in data analysis and manuscript editing and writing; K.K. contributed by helping in data analysis and manuscript editing and writing.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Consent to publish:</bold> Consent to publish has been obtained from all the participants.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Our research has been approved by Ethics Committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences (approval number: 54122).</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Informed consent:</bold> Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> IRCT: IRCT138812173509N1.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p><bold>Supplemental Material:</bold> Supplementary material for this paper can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2050312117696436">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2050312117696436</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2050312117696436"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
