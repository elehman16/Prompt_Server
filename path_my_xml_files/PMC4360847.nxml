The institute&#x02019;s internal review board approved the study protocol. The procedures to be performed were explained to the patients, and all their queries were clarified. All patients who agreed to take part in the study signed an informed consent form. It was conducted under the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>A detailed medical history was obtained, including information on the women&#x02019;s characteristics with respect to their menstrual cycle, parity, lactation, and their use of hormonal drugs. The diagnosis of benign breast lesion was reached by conducting a physical examination, breast ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration puncture.</p><p>To be included in the study, patients had to be between 15 and 40 years of age, with benign breast nodules and an indication or desire to have the lesion removed. In addition, the women&#x02019;s menstrual cycles had to have been regular (28 &#x000b1; 3 days) over the previous six months. Women in use of hormonal contraceptives, those who had been pregnant in the 12 months preceding the initial study visit, those with a known allergy to raloxifene or tamoxifen, those with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, and those who had undergone hormonal manipulation within the previous 12 months were excluded from participating in the study.</p><p>The drugs used in this study (tamoxifen 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg) were obtained through a partnership with the Federal University of Goi&#x000e1;s&#x02019; Foundation for the Support of Research (FUNAPE). A pharmacist was in charge of the randomization process and of masking the medication to be used in the study. The medication was distributed in identical, sealed, white, non-transparent vials, identified only by a number ranging from 1 to 48 affixed to the exterior surface of the vials, corresponding to the enrollment number of each of the patients participating in the study.</p><p>The randomization list containing the key to the code numbers was kept by the pharmacist responsible for the blinding procedure. This pharmacist had no contact whatsoever with the investigators or with the patients. The study was double-blind with respect to the medication (tamoxifen or raloxifene). The drugs were handed over to the patients in sequential order as they were admitted to the study. After receiving the vial of tablets, the patients initiated use of the medication assigned to them on the first day of their next menstrual cycle, taking one tablet per day for 22 days.</p><p>After concluding the course of medication prescribed in the study, the patients were operated on between the 23rd and 28th days of the menstrual cycle to resect the nodule. At the same time, a fragment of breast tissue measuring approximately 1 cm and with no macroscopic alterations was removed from a site 1 cm from the nodule. The surgical procedures were performed at the University Teaching Hospital.</p><p>On the day of surgery, a blood sample was collected to measure progesterone and estradiol levels. Progesterone levels &#x0003e;3.0 ng/mL were considered indicative of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.<xref rid="b16-cmo-9-2015-025" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>After the nodule and the fragment of normal breast tissue were excised, the specimens were appropriately identified, fixed in 10% formalin, and sent to the Department of Pathology and Imaging at the Goi&#x000e2;nia Teaching Hospital. Subsequently, these specimens were submitted to histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. First, the material was dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and immersed in liquid paraffin. The paraffin tissue blocks were cut in a microtome to obtain 3-&#x003bc;m-thick histological sections. These slides were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE).</p><p>Two pathologists evaluated the breast parenchyma to confirm normal histological findings, and only then was the specimen submitted to immunohistochemical evaluation.</p><p>The slides were deparaffinized in hot xylene (heated to 60 &#x000b0;C) for 15 minutes and then in xylene at the room temperature for a further 15 minutes. Next, the slides were progressively hydrated by immersing them in a series of decreasing concentrations of alcohol (100%, 95%, 80%, and 70%) for 30 seconds in each passage, after which the slides were washed in distilled running water.</p><p>In the following step, the antigen was retrieved by heating the slides in 10 mmol of sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker for five minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using hydrogen peroxide (6%) in three stages of 10 minutes each. Subsequently, the slides were incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with primary Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies (MIB-1 clone; DakoCytomation) at a dilution of 1:2,400. After this stage, the slides were washed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), incubated with the DakoCytomation LSAB+ System-HRP kit at the recommended dilution for 30 minutes, and washed in PBS.</p><p>The immunoexpression of the Ki-67/MIB-1 antibodies was quantified by determining the number of immunolabeled cells per 1,000 cells counted. Only epithelial cells were evaluated, with the stromal component being excluded from the analysis. Using a 40&#x000d7; objective lens (magnification 10&#x000d7;), cells with nuclei showing the characteristic chestnut-brown staining were considered positive. The slides were scanned in a zigzag pattern, from right to left and from bottom to top, until 1,000 cells had been assessed. The resulting ratio between the stained and unstained cells was then multiplied by 100.</p><p>The pathologist who quantified the immunoexpression of Ki-67/MIB-1 was blinded with respect to which drug was being evaluated. The randomization key was opened only after all slides had been assessed.</p><p>Overall, 62.5% of the 48 randomized women were included in the final analysis of the study. In all, 18 cases were excluded for the following reasons. One patient used the medication but failed to show up for surgery, one became pregnant and did not use the drug, two patients were lost after moving away, two patients stopped using the medication, and one patient was diagnosed with breast cancer. Additionally, in seven cases, the fragment of breast tissue resected was insufficient to allow immunohistochemistry to be performed, and in another four cases, it proved impossible to perform immunohistochemistry because of difficulties in fixing the histological material to the slide. The woman diagnosed with cancer presented with a ductal carcinoma in situ (13 mm) in association with a microinvasive ductal carcinoma (Bloom-Richardson Grade II) that was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and HER2++. She was referred for treatment at the breast clinic of the University Teaching Hospital, and subsequently, underwent quadrantectomy, axillary clearance, and radiotherapy.</p><p>The SPSS software program, version 11.0.1 for Windows, was used in the statistical analysis. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient were used to analyze the continuous variables, which were expressed as means and standard deviations (SDs). For all the tests, the level for rejection of the null hypothesis (<italic>P</italic>-value) was set at an alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The final analysis included 30 patients, 16 in the tamoxifen group and 14 in the raloxifene group.

Therefore, raloxifene may play a role in breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women.</p><p>Mean progesterone levels following use of the medication were 19.62 &#x000b1; 17.67 ng/mL and 14.59 &#x000b1; 8.98 ng/mL in Group I (tamoxifen) and Group II (raloxifene), respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.328). However, with regard to plasma estradiol levels, there was a tendency toward lower mean values in the women using raloxifene compared to those using tamoxifen, although this difference was not statistically significant. Two possible explanations for this are that tamoxifen is able to block ERs more effectively, thus increasing the release of estradiol, or that raloxifene tends to reduce circulating estradiol levels. Indeed, the latter possibility gains ground from the fact that estrogen acts as a breast cancer promotion factor. This leads us to speculate on the possibility of reducing the incidence of breast cancer by decreasing circulating estradiol levels. In addition, the effect resulting from the interaction between raloxifene and ERs should be taken into account.</p><p>The absence of a placebo control group may be considered a limitation of the present study; however, since the model used has been previously tested with success,<xref rid="b14-cmo-9-2015-025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-cmo-9-2015-025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a placebo group was not believed to be necessary in the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, there was no difference in the proliferative activity of the normal breast epithelium following the use of tamoxifen or raloxifene for a 22-day period. This finding suggests that raloxifene may play a role in breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women.
