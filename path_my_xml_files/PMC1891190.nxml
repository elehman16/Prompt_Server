CHOICE OF TOPIC AND RATIONALE</title><p>It has been estimated that, during 2005, 4400 new cases of melanoma will have been diagnosed in Canada and that, of 880 estimated deaths from the disease, 420 will have occurred in Ontario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co14_1p027">1</xref>. Primary surgical treatment cures most patients diagnosed with early-stage malignant melanoma. However, people with deeply invasive melanoma have a high probability of developing distant metastases. Adjuvant therapy has been found to be partially effective, but the currently available systemic treatments have yielded disappointing results.</p><p>Recently, temozolomide has emerged as a promising novel chemotherapy agent in malignant melanoma. Temozolomide acts through the same mechanism as dacarbazine; however, unlike dacarbazine, temozolomide has excellent oral bioavailability and possesses the ability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. These added benefits suggest that temozolomide may play a role in treating patients with metastases to the brain, a frequent metastatic site in melanoma.</p><p>To provide treatment recommendations for this new agent, the Melanoma Disease Site Group (<sc>dsg</sc>) decided to review the available literature on single-agent temozolomide and on temozolomide in combination with interferon-&#x003b1; or thalidomide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>3. METHODS</title><sec><title>3.1 Guideline Development</title><p>This practice guideline report was developed by Cancer Care Ontario&#x02019;s Program in Evidence-Based Care (<sc>pebc</sc>) using the methods of the practice guidelines development cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-co14_1p027">2</xref>. Evidence was selected and reviewed by two members of the Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> and by methodologists. Members of the Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> disclosed potential conflict of interest information.</p><p>The practice guideline is a convenient and up-to-date source of the best available evidence on single-agent temozolomide or temozolomide in combination with interferon-&#x003b1; or thalidomide in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The present report was developed through systematic reviews, evidence synthesis, and input from practitioners in Ontario. It is a companion piece to a systematic review which is currently under consideration for publication elsewhere. Both documents are intended to promote evidence-based practice in Ontario, Canada. The <sc>pebc</sc> is editorially independent of Cancer Care Ontario and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="background"><title>3.2 Literature Search Strategy</title><p>The <sc>medline</sc> [1966 to September (week 3) 2005], <sc>embase</sc> (1980 to week 40, 2005), and the Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005) were systematically searched using a combination of the following terms: &#x0201c;melanoma&#x0201d; [Medical Subject Heading, <italic>Excerpta Medica</italic> Tree (<sc>emtree</sc>) term, and text word], &#x0201c;temozolomide&#x0201d; (<sc>emtree</sc> term and text word), &#x0201c;temodal&#x0201d; (text word), and &#x0201c;temodar&#x0201d; (text word). Those terms were then combined with the search terms for the following publication types and study designs: practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and controlled trials.</p><p>In addition, the proceedings of the 1997&#x02013;2005 annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched for reports of newly completed trials. Relevant articles and abstracts were selected and reviewed by two reviewers, and the reference lists from those sources were searched for additional trials, as were the reference lists from relevant review articles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>4. RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="background"><title>4.1 Literature Search</title><p>The literature search identified two randomized phase <sc>iii</sc> trials and three randomized phase <sc>ii</sc> trials of single-agent temozolomide compared with either single-agent intravenous dacarbazine or combinations of temozolomide with cisplatin, interferon-&#x003b1; 2b (<sc>ifn</sc>), or thalidomide. Another nine phase <sc>ii</sc> and phase <sc>i</sc> trials investigating single-agent temozolomide, six trials investigating temozolomide plus interferon-&#x003b1;, and six trials investigating temozolomide plus thalidomide were reviewed. Sixteen of the trials were published as full reports; ten were available in abstract form only.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Outcomes</title><sec><title>4.2.1 Randomized Phase III Trials</title><p>Evidence from the two randomized trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co14_1p027">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co14_1p027">4</xref> shows that it is reasonable to use temozolomide as initial treatment for patients with unresectable metastatic malignant melanoma. The first trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co14_1p027">3</xref> compared single-agent temozolomide with single-agent intravenous dacarbazine in 305 patients. The second trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co14_1p027">4</xref> compared single-agent temozolomide with temozolomide combined with <sc>ifn</sc> in 294 patients.</p><p>Results from the first trial, by Middleton <italic>et al.,</italic> demonstrated that progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients treated with temozolomide, with a reported hazard ratio (<sc>hr</sc>) of 1.37 [95% confidence interval (<sc>ci</sc>): 1.07 to 1.75; <italic>p</italic> = 0.012]. Median survival for patients treated with temozolomide was 7.7 months versus 6.4 months for those treated with dacarbazine. However, the difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. Of the patients in the temozolomide arm, 21 (14%) showed an objective response to treatment; of patients in the dacarbazine arm, 18 (12%) showed an objective response. Grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were similar in the two treatment arms.</p><p>Kaufmann <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co14_1p027">4</xref> reported a significantly higher response rate for temozolomide combined with <sc>ifn</sc> as compared with single-agent temozolomide (24% vs. 13%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.036). In the combination arm, 11 patients (8%) achieved a complete response, and 22 patients (16%) showed a partial response, as compared with 3 patients (2%) and 15 patients (11%) respectively in the temozolomide group. The median overall survival was reported to be 8.4 months in the temozolomide group (95% <sc>ci</sc>: 7.07 to 9.72) and 9.7 months in the temozolomide plus <sc>ifn</sc> group (95% <sc>ci</sc>: 8.26 to 11.18); no statistical significance was detected.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2.2 Randomized Phase II Trials</title><p>The systematic review identified three randomized phase <sc>ii</sc> trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co14_1p027">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co14_1p027">7</xref>. In the first trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co14_1p027">5</xref>, 127 patients were randomized to receive temozolomide alone or in combination with cisplatin. The second trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co14_1p027">6</xref> randomized 181 patients to receive temozolomide alone or temozolomide combined with either <sc>ifn</sc> or thalidomide. The third trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co14_1p027">7</xref> randomized 47 patients to a treatment combination of temozolomide and <sc>ifn</sc>, the latter being administered in two different dosages. None of trials detected statistically significant differences in median overall survival, time to disease progression, or objective response.</p><p>Interestingly, the trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co14_1p027">5</xref> by Bafaloukos and colleagues detected some evidence of antitumour activity in the central nervous system, including 3 partial responses in brain metastases (1 in the temozolomide arm and 2 in the combination arm). Only 16% of patients receiving temozolomide alone and 18% of patients receiving temozolomide with cisplatin developed central nervous system metastases (median follow-up of 39.9 months and 37 months, respectively), further suggesting that treatment with temozolomide may reduce the occurrence of brain metastases.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2.3 Single-Arm Phase II and I Trials</title><p>Phase <sc>ii</sc> and <sc>i</sc> trials of single-agent temozolomide have demonstrated response rates that range from 0% to 29%, with complete responses observed in 0%&#x02013;17% of patients. Phase <sc>ii</sc> and <sc>i</sc> trials investigating temozolomide in combination with either <sc>ifn</sc> or thalidomide have reported response rates ranging from 13% to 23% and from 8% to 42% respectively. Although these response rates are encouraging, further evidence from randomized trials is required.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>5. DSG CONSENSUS PROCESS</title><p>The practice guideline recommendations were drafted by one member of the Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> and circulated to the entire <sc>dsg</sc> in February 2004 for review and consensus. The members of the Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> unanimously agreed with the draft recommendations. Before submitting the recommendations to the Report Approval Panel, the <sc>dsg</sc> members discussed adding a recommendation regarding the use of temozolomide for patients with brain metastases who require systemic treatment. However, after some debate, the members decided to address that issue in a qualifying statement.</p></sec><sec><title>6. PRACTITIONER FEEDBACK</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>6.1 Methods</title><p>Following discussion and consensus, the Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> circulated the clinical practice guideline and systematic review to clinicians in Ontario for review. Feedback was obtained through a mailed survey of 13 practitioners in Ontario (all medical oncologists). The survey consisted of items evaluating the methods, results, and interpretive summary used to inform the draft recommendations and asking whether the draft recommendations should be approved as a practice guideline. Written comments were invited. The survey was mailed on April 23, 2004. Follow-up reminders were sent at 2 weeks (post card) and 4 weeks (complete package mailed again). The Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> reviewed the results of the survey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>6.2 Results</title><p>Of the 13 practitioners surveyed, 8 (62%) responded. Responses include returned completed surveys and telephone, fax, and e-mail responses. Of the practitioners who responded, 6 indicated that the report was relevant to their clinical practice, and they completed the survey. All practitioners indicated that they agreed with the draft recommendations as stated, and most agreed that the document should be approved as a practice guideline. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tI-co14_1p027">Table I</xref> summarizes key results of the practitioner feedback survey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>6.3 Summary of Written Comments</title><p>Four respondents (67%) provided written comments. The main points contained in the written comments were these:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One practitioner commented that experience with the 6-week 50&#x02013;75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily regimen is adequate to include it as a reasonable treatment option.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Another practitioner commented that temozolomide is a reasonable choice of therapy only insofar as dacarbazine is reasonable. Dacarbazine should be the &#x0201c;default&#x0201d; option, and temozolomide should be used only under unusual circumstances&#x02014;for example, when patients live in remote areas or lack access to intravenous treatment&#x02014;and even then, monitoring the patient&#x02019;s counts is important.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, a practitioner commented that the roles of interferon and thalidomide should be revisited in a timely manner. Also, a need exists to address the funding of temozolomide in a timely manner so that it is accessible to patients.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>6.4 Modifications/Actions</title><p>The Melanoma <sc>dsg</sc> discussed the comments resulting from practitioner feedback survey and responded as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Although experience with the 6-week 50&#x02013;75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily regimen is growing, the evidence is currently insufficient to endorse or adopt this treatment regimen in metastatic melanoma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dacarbazine and temozolomide may both be considered reasonable therapeutic choices in patients. There is no reason to choose one over the other insofar as outcomes (overall survival, disease-free survival) are concerned. Patient preference and factors such as intravenous access, geographic location, and access to treatment facilities should be taken into consideration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As previously acknowledged in this document, the amount of high-quality evidence on the roles of <sc>ifn</sc> and thalidomide in combination with temozolomide is limited. To date, only one small <sc>rct</sc> has shown that the combination of temozolomide and <sc>ifn</sc> demonstrates a statistically significant difference in response rate. Perhaps the ongoing phase <sc>ii</sc> trial (Southwest Oncology Group S0508) comparing thalidomide and temozolomide in stage <sc>iv</sc> malignant melanoma will provide favourable results for this combination treatment. When larger confirmatory trials become available, the guideline will be updated and the recommendations revisited.
