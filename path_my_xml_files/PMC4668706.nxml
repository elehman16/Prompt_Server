Poor control is associated with complications including coronary heart disease (CHD). Effective self-management and engagement in health behaviours can reduce risks of complications. However, patients often struggle to adopt and maintain these behaviours. Self-management interventions have been found to be effective in improving glycaemic control. Recent developments in the field of genetics mean that patients can be given personalised information about genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk of developing CHD. Such information may increase patients&#x02019; motivation to engage in self-management. The Coronary Risk in Diabetes (CoRDia) trial will compare the effectiveness of a self-management intervention, with and without provision of personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information, with usual care, on clinical and behavioural outcomes, the cognitive predictors of behaviour, and psychological wellbeing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Participants will be adults aged 25&#x02013;74 years registered with general practices in the East of England, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with no history of heart disease, and with a glycated haemoglobin level of &#x02265;6.45&#x000a0;% (47&#x000a0;mmol/mol). Consenting participants will be randomised to one of three arms: usual care control, group self-management only, group self-management plus personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information. The self-management groups will receive four weekly 2-hour group sessions, focusing on knowledge and information sharing, problem solving, goal setting and action planning to promote medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity. Primary outcomes are glycaemic control and CHD risk. Clinical data will be collected from GP records, including HbA1c, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and HDL and total cholesterol. Self-reported health behaviours, including medication adherence, healthy eating and physical activity, and cognitive outcomes will be assessed by questionnaire. Measures will be taken at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months (questionnaire only), 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months post-baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will determine whether the addition of personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated CHD risk information to a group self-management intervention improves diabetes control and CHD risk compared with group self-management and usual care. Effectiveness of the combined intervention on health behaviours cognitions theorised to predict them, and psychological outcomes will also be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; registration identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01891786">NCT01891786</ext-link>, registered 28 June 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-1073-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RCT protocol</kwd><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Genetic testing</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Healthy eating</kwd><kwd>Medication adherence</kwd><kwd>UKPDS</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Approximately 2.3 million people in the UK aged over 17&#x000a0;years have diagnosed diabetes, of which 90&#x000a0;% are diagnosed with type 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This number is expected to rise to 4 million by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Complications in diabetes arise from poor glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and include renal disease, retinopathy, and peripheral vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. People with diabetes have two times the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and CHD is the cause of death in 52&#x000a0;% of people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Good glycaemic control has, however, been found to be associated with reductions in the complications associated with diabetes and the risk of developing CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Glycaemic control and the health risks associated with diabetes can be managed through appropriate self-management behaviours including taking medication appropriately, regular physical activity, following a healthy diet and checking feet. These behaviours are also established as important in the prevention of CHD risk in people with and without diabetes. Therefore, interventions to increase adherence to these behaviours in patients with type 2 diabetes will have the dual benefit of reducing both the risk of diabetes complications and CHD.</p><p>Many people with diabetes experience difficulties in consistently carrying out the recommended behaviours. To support patients with diabetes to achieve better glycaemic control, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) recommends that all patients with diabetes are referred to group educational intervention within 9&#x000a0;months of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In recognition that the provision of information is insufficient to achieve the required behaviour change, self-management interventions (SMIs) have been developed and recognised as a key part of the delivery of care for people with diabetes by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>SMIs for people with diabetes have been widely implemented both in the UK and elsewhere. Systematic and meta-analytic reviews indicate that they are effective in improving glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). However, few studies have investigated the effect of SMIs on other indicators of CHD risk, with the exception of body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A review of systematic reviews of diabetes SMIs found that fewer than half of included studies investigated outcomes associated with CHD risk, such as blood pressure and lipid profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thus investigation of intervention effects on clinical risk factors associated with CHD is warranted.</p><p>Reviews of the effect of SMIs for diabetes have indicated that the most effective interventions are those that target specific disease prevention behaviours such as healthy eating and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and those that use theory to specify the intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A systematic review has indicated that interventions employing techniques from social learning theory (SLT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] such as modelling, increasing self-efficacy and skills rehearsal were most effective for changing health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The University College London Diabetes Self-Management Programme (UCL-DSMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] is one such programme, based on SLT and employing these techniques. Compared with standard care, this intervention resulted in greater positive change in dietary behaviours and physical activity, and showed a trend towards significance in predicting greater improvements in HbA1c after 3&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Evaluations of SMI interventions can be enhanced by the measurement of their effects on the cognitive predictors of health behaviour, described in theories of behaviour. Investigating the effect of an intervention on cognitions can provide an explanation of intervention effects or null findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] integrates several theories describing the predictors of health behaviour, and states behavioural intention or motivation is a key determinant of it. Antecedents of intention include perceived risks, self-efficacy to perform, and expectancies about the outcomes of the behaviour. Planning, social support, and maintenance and recovery self-efficacy are specified as post-intentional cognitions that predict behaviour. The HAPA has been found to explain variance in intentions and behaviour for several behaviours including healthy eating in a healthy population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and physical activity in patients with heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivating engagement in self-management interventions: personalised risk estimates</title><p>Increasing motivation to engage in and maintain self-management behaviours may be one way to increase the effect of SMIs on glycaemic control and engagement in healthy behaviours. Current QOF guidance requires that patients receive information about their lifestyle-associated risk of CHD annually, using standardised risk calculators e.g. the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been put forward that the salience of this information about this modifiable risk may be increased by providing it alongside information about unmodifiable genetic risk of developing CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Recent developments in the field of genetics have provided the opportunity to investigate the behavioural and clinical effect of providing a personalised estimate of both genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk of CHD. A CHD genetic risk score based on 19 CHD risk loci has been evaluated and found to have potential clinical utility in addition to conventional risk factors in a group of UK middle-aged healthy men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This genetic risk score can then be combined with a conventional risk score from lifestyle risk calculators to give an overall estimate of 10-year CHD risk.</p><p>Currently there is no evidence to suggest individuals will perceive engaging in risk-reducing behaviours to be less beneficial should they receive a high risk result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and evidence indicates that participants are not likely to perceive genetics to be the sole cause of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence that provision of personalised risk information alone will effect behaviour change where support to change behaviour is not provided. A Cochrane Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] has identified a small number of clinical trials in which behavioural effects of genetic risk information have been examined, and found no effect of receiving a test result on smoking cessation, physical activity, taking medication and vitamin use. An effect on dietary changes was found in only one study. The review also found that while they aimed to change behaviour, these studies did not report the use of additional behaviour change techniques such as goal setting or coping planning. However, there is some evidence for an effect of receiving a genetic risk result on the cognitions that predict behaviour; an effect of receiving a test result on smoking cessation intentions was found for analogue studies in which behavioural outcomes were not investigated due to the absence of an available test. Furthermore, receiving a risk result has been found to predict change in other cognitions theorised to predict behaviour in clinical and analogue studies, including fear arousal, perceptions of risk of developing disease, and perceived effectiveness of the target behaviour in reducing risk. Further intervention may therefore be required to help translate these cognitive changes into behaviour change. Together these findings underline the potential utility of investigating the behavioural and clinical effects of providing personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information in conjunction with an SMI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aims</title><p>The Coronary Risk in Diabetes study (CoRDia) aims to investigate the effect of an SMI with and without personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information, compared with usual care. The primary outcomes are glycaemic control measured as HbA1c, and percentage CHD risk assessed using the UKPDS risk calculator.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are other indicators of CHD risk including total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, weight and BMI, and behaviours including adherence to medication, diet and physical activity. The effect of personalised risk information and the SMI on the theory-based cognitive predictors of behaviour, quality of life, psychological wellbeing, and emotional response to having a genetic test will also be examined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT).

To maximise patient participation in this study two models of recruitment and intervention delivery are proposed (i) standalone and (ii) hub and spoke. Standalone practices will recruit participants from their own patient lists and deliver the interventions in-house. In the hub and spoke model, one practice will act as the hub taking responsibility for recruitment and intervention delivery for smaller local spoke practices that identify eligible patients from their patient lists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical approval and trial registration</title><p>Ethical approval for this study has been granted by the East of England Research Ethics Committee (ref 12/EE/0437). Local governance and assurances were issued by Norfolk and Suffolk Primary and Community Care Research Office, Cambridgeshire Community Services National Health Service (NHS) Trust, and Essex and Hertfordshire Comprehensive Local Research Network (CLRN) Office. A Data Monitoring Committee will be convened to review interim data and monitor safety and overall conduct of the trial. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; registration identifier NCT01891786.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Primary care providers</title><p>The Eastern CRN will recruit suitable primary care providers. Participating GP surgeries or community diabetes clinics must be research active and demonstrate adequate numbers of eligible patients. Recruiting staff will need to have received Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training. Practices will be offered CRN research nurse support where they do not have sufficient resources to complete all study activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who are registered at a GP surgery within the East of England, and who are due an annual diabetes review within the recruitment window will be invited to participate. Eligible patients must be: aged between 25 and 74&#x000a0;years at the time of recruitment, of White, Afro-Caribbean or Asian-Indian ethnicity, be fluent in spoken English, and have had an HbA1c of &#x02265;6.45&#x000a0;% (47&#x000a0;mmol/mol) in the 6&#x000a0;months preceding recruitment. Patients will be excluded if they have: history or diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or peripheral vascular disease, current serious or enduring mental health problems that would prevent study participation, are currently undergoing treatment for a life-threatening condition or are in the terminal stages of a condition. Participants who do not fit the ethnicity requirements will be excluded; this is because the genetic test and a primary outcome measure (UKPDS Risk Engine) have not been validated outside of the described ethnic groups. Adults who cannot consent for themselves will also be excluded.</p><p>Patients due their annual diabetes review within the 8-week recruitment window will be assessed for eligibility and invited to participate in the study via letter of invitation or opportunistically at the time of an appointment. Each practice will recruit between one and three cohorts of 15 participants.</p><p>Eligible interested patients will be invited to a consenting appointment where they will have the opportunity to review the participant information sheet with the practice or research nurse and give written informed consent to participate in the study. Once participants have completed baseline questionnaires they will be randomised to study condition, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1073_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Participants will be randomised at the individual level using randomly permuted blocks. The randomisation sequence will be generated using a randomisation website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Blocks of 15 allocations will be generated with a 1:1:1 ratio of study arm allocations to ensure a balance of five participants per study arm for each cohort. Each cohort of 15 participants will comprise patients recruited from a single GP practice site, or a single hub and spoke site grouping. Randomisation allocation will be concealed in consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes. As with all studies of this type it is not possible to blind participants, the recruiting nurse, or intervention facilitators to group allocation once the envelope has been opened. The data will be analysed by a researcher blinded to the allocation of the groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study interventions</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Self-management intervention</title><p>Participants allocated to the SMI group and the SMI&#x02009;+&#x02009;RR group will attend group self-management sessions for 4 consecutive weeks, which will be held at a local GP surgery or community practice, in addition to their usual care. Each session will last approximately 2&#x000a0;hours, and will be facilitated by an SMI-trained practice or research nurse with experience of providing clinical care to patients with diabetes, paired with a health psychologist researcher or layperson. Ten participants will attend each SMI group (five SMI only, five SMI&#x02009;+&#x02009;RR). The facilitator will keep an attendance log. Intervention sessions will be audio recorded where participants provide permission, to investigate intervention fidelity.</p><p>All SMI facilitators will attend a 2-day self-management training course led by two experienced self-management practitioners and trainers. The training comprises teaching regarding theories of behaviour change and self-management. Facilitators will be taught how to use the SMI manual and will practice skills for managing groups. After training they will be supported to deliver the intervention through pre- and post-session briefing meetings each week within their facilitator pairings, and with the research team.</p><p>The SMI will be adapted from the UCL-DSMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for sample excerpts from the CoRDia SMI facilitator manual. For three of the four sessions the group will address specific target behaviours: medication adherence, healthy eating and physical activity respectively. For the fourth session, participants will be invited to identify additional target behaviours that they believe to be important in managing diabetes and/or CHD risk (e.g. foot care, smoking cessation). The following behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] will be delivered in each session:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Knowledge and information sharing</bold>: Each session will include brief didactic teaching to ensure that all participants have a clear understanding of the importance of, and how to manage, their diabetes in relation to the target behaviour.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Problem solving</bold>: Participants will be asked to brainstorm difficulties that they experience with \carrying out the target behaviour. Difficulties that several members of the group are experiencing, or would like to discuss, will be selected and strategies to overcome them elicited from the group. Strategies for several difficulties can be discussed, subject to the requirements of the group.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Action planning</bold>: In the first session, the principles of goal setting and action planning will be didactically presented. At the end of each session participants will be invited to set a goal and develop a detailed written action plan for the following week, targeting the behaviour in question. The action plan includes information about the target behaviour, the frequency and intensity with which it will be carried out, and any plans they need to make to overcome anticipated difficulties. Participants will rate their confidence to carry out the behaviour on a scale of 1&#x02013;10. Where participants wish to (e.g. if they do not have difficulties with taking medication), an alternative health behaviour can be targeted. The facilitator will provide support to write the action plan and then will model reporting their personal action plan to the group. The group will be invited to report their own.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Goal review and praise/reward</bold>: For the second and subsequent sessions, goal review is carried out, where participants report back to the group about their goal attempt. Where a goal has been partially achieved or not achieved, strategies to overcome experienced problems will be briefly brainstormed by the group. Participants who have been successful or partially successful in achieving their goal will be praised by the facilitator and encouraged to recognise their success.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Risk results intervention</title><p>Participants allocated to the SMI&#x02009;+&#x02009;RR group will be asked to review and sign the consent form specific to the genetic test and provide a saliva sample for analysis using the Oragene DNA Self-collection Kit (DNA Genotek Inc.,&#x000a0;Ontario, Canada). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) will be extracted according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and analysed as described below. Participants will be invited to attend a one-on-one appointment with the researcher in the week prior to the first SMI group session, where a trained researcher will present the results of the risk report to each participant using a script to ensure consistency in delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The risk report</title><p>Risk reports will be personalised to describe individual CHD risk, defined as risk of having a myocardial infarction (MI). There are three sections to the risk report, detailing (i) genetic lifetime CHD risk presented as a graph, with the patient&#x02019;s personal risk relative to average risk, (ii) 10-year lifestyle CHD risk presented as a graph, reporting absolute and relative risk to the average person&#x02019;s percentage risk. This is supported by text detailing the participant&#x02019;s estimated lifestyle risk, the risk for the average person of their age, ethnic group and gender, and risk relative to the average person, expressed as a percentage. (iii) Combined genetic and lifestyle overall 10-year CHD risk presented in the same manner as lifestyle risk. The report will state that it is possible to reduce lifestyle risk by engaging in health behaviours e.g., eating more healthily and becoming more physically active, all of which are addressed in the SMI. Participants will be given their printed personalised risk report to keep for their own records; copies of individual&#x02019;s risk reports will not be stored or made available to their care provider.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Genetic analysis and risk calculation</title><p>Genotypes for 19 CHD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be determined using the Randox Cardiac Risk Prediction Array (Randox Laboratories Ltd., Crumlin, UK). In the event of any discrepancies, genotypes will be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The number of risk alleles for each SNP carried by an individual will be multiplied by its reported meta-analysis effect size for CHD, for method see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to give an individual&#x02019;s genetic risk score. To put the genetic risk score into context, the individual genetic risk score will then be adjusted for the population average genetic risk score. The population average risk is calculated by multiplying the expected frequency of the three genotypes (based on the allele frequency determined in the source publications, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] for each SNP by the number of risk alleles corresponding to that genotype). These products are then summed for all the SNPs. The comparative average person is someone with type 2 diabetes of the same age, ethnicity and gender as the individual participant, with the average systolic blood pressure (BP) and lipid ratio determined using data from the University College Diabetes and Cardiovascular Study (UDACS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; data presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. An appropriate value for HbA1c has been set on advice from a group clinician. The 10-year lifestyle CHD risk will be estimated using the UKPDS risk engine v2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To give the combined 10-year CHD risk incorporating both lifestyle and genetic risk the population-adjusted genetic risk will be then added to the UKPDS risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Usual care control group</title><p>Those randomised to usual care will be advised to continue to manage their diabetes as they would normally. Usual care will be documented across practices and community services involved in the study using a checklist informed by the General Medical Services QOF 2014/15 and NICE clinical guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes (modified March 2014).

Motivation to engage in, and the effectiveness of, a self-management intervention may be increased by providing estimates of genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk of CHD. This study will use a novel genetic test to test the effects of an SMI with and without personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk estimates on clinical indicators of diabetes and CHD risk, health behaviours, cognitive predictors of behaviour and psychological outcomes in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment has been ongoing since December 2013 and is expected to end June 2015.
