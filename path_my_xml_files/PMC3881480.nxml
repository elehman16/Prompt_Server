balance of elderly adults. [Methods] Subjects (age range, 60&#x02013;70&#x02005;years) were randomly
assigned to an experimental (n=12) or control group (n=12). The experimental group
performed stretching and resistance exercises, and the control group performed stretching
exercises only. Before and after the 5-week intervention, the participants&#x02019; static and
dynamic balance were evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up &#x00026; Go Test,
and the Tetrax Portable Multiple System (Tetrax Ltd., Ramat Gan, Israel) after 5 weeks.
[Results] After the intervention, the values of the Tetrax in the weight distribution
index with eyes open and that with eyes closed and the stability test index with eyes open
were significantly lower in the resistance exercise group than in the control group, and
the pre-test values were was significantly higher than the post-test values. However,
there were no significant differences between groups in the values of the Berg Balance
Scale, the Timed Up &#x00026; Go Test, and the Tetrax stability test index with the eyes
closed. [Conclusion] The findings of this study indicate that resistance exercise using
the Thera-band is possible to improve the static and dynamic balance of elderly
adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stretching</kwd><kwd>Resistance exercise</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional ability and strength decreases with age because of a decrease in muscle fiber,

the frequency of falls increases with age and 50% adults &#x02265; 80&#x02005;years of age experience a fall
each year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increased risk of
fallings in the elderly is attributed to the decreased balance and strength of the elderly.
Therefore, lower-extremity resistance exercise is important for preventing falls in the
elderly. Moreover, the relapse rate of falling was found to decrease sufficiently with home
management<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is important
to devise a simple exercise program for improving the balance of the elderly adults.
Stretching and resistance exercises have been shown to improve the balance ability in
elderly adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Resistance exercise using the Thera-band is simple and economical, and has safety
advantages. It is generally used for rehabilitation purposes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, because training can be selected case by case through free control
of the loading intensity. Several studies have reported that strengthening exercise using
the Thera-band for the lower extremities improves balance ability. Therefore, strengthening
exercise with a Thera-band in the body; thus, this is a suitable home-based exercise program
for improving the balance in activities of daily living of elderly adults. We evaluated the
effects of stretching and resistance exercises on the static and dynamic balance of elderly
adults who had poor balance ability and did not perform exercises regularly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 24 elderly adults (12 each in the experimental and control groups),
60&#x02013;70&#x02005;years of age, and who attended an exercise class for fall prevention in N country, in

The criteria for subject selection were as follows: age &#x02265; 60&#x02005;years, no visual
or vestibular disorders, no pain limiting exercise performance, ability to walk
independently, no limitation of activities of daily living, and no regular exercise in the
previous 6 months. The subjects included in this study were randomly divided into the
experimental and control groups. They were given a complete explanation of the study and
were asked to voluntarily sign the participation consent forms before beginning the
exercises.</p><p>The experimental and control groups performed stretching exercises. Subjects in the
experimental group also performed resistance exercises. The following stretching exercises
were performed: knee flexion, hip flexion, hip abduction, and hip extension while standing;
standing on tip toes; and knee extension while sitting. The resistance exercises performed
using the Thera-band were as follows: knee flexion to extension while sitting, standing from
sitting, knee extension to flexion while sitting, hip flexion to extension while standing,
hip extension to flexion while standing, and hip adduction to abduction while standing. The
exercise intensity in this study was gradually increased from mild to moderate. The
exercises were performed 2 times for 1 set, 3 days per week for 5 weeks. A 1- to 2-s break
was given after each motion, and a 2-min break was given after each set to minimize muscle
fatigue.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a widely used clinical test used for determining an elderly
adults&#x02019; static and dynamic balance abilities, and it takes 15&#x02013;20&#x02005;min to complete. It is
comprised a set of 14 simple balance-related tasks, ranging from standing from a sitting
position to standing on 1 foot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Timed
Up &#x00026; Go Test (TUG) is a simple test used to evaluate an elderly adults&#x02019; mobility, which
requires both static and dynamic balance. It measures the time a subject takes to rise from
a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Tetrax Portable Multiple System (Tetrax
Ltd., Ramat Gan, Israel) is a balance evaluation device that uses visual and vestibular
feedback. The Tetrax system has 2 mobile force plates (12 &#x000d7; 30&#x02005;cm), and postural disturbance
is assessed by the change in weight on 4 points from which the stability test index and
static balance index are computed. Measurement is performed in the standing position without
speaking or moving for 32 s. The stability test index and weight distribution index are used
for the analysis of static balance. Balance was measured on a stable surface with the eyes
open and closed.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 software. The pre-intervention
and post- intervention data were examined using the paired t-test within each group of
subjects, and the independent <italic>t</italic>-test between the groups. The level of
significance was chosen as 5% for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in the BBS and TUG scores of subjects are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2. </label><caption><title> The comparison of dynamic and static balance</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2" colspan="2"/><td align="center" valign="bottom" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control (n=12)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Experimental (n=12)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2" rowspan="1">TUG (s)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.9 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.7 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.5 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.4 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2" rowspan="1">BBS (point)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.1 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.7 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.4 &#x000b1; 1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">EO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WDI</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.5 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.8 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.8 &#x000b1; 5.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.3 &#x000b1; 1.8<sup>ab</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ST</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.7 &#x000b1; 7.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.9 &#x000b1; 10.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 &#x000b1; 8.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.2 &#x000b1; 6.3<sup>ab</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">EC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WDI</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.2 &#x000b1; 3.4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.6 &#x000b1; 3.6<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.2 &#x000b1; 2.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 &#x000b1; 3.0<sup>ab</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ST</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.7&#x000b1; 12.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.1 &#x000b1; 15.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.9 &#x000b1; 10.0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.8 &#x000b1; 7.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; SD, EO, eye open; EC, eye close; WDI, weight distribution index;

dynamic balance of elderly adults who lacked exercise and had poor balance ability. Aging is
a physical and psychological process that results in a decrease in balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, a continuous decrease in balance ability starts in adults
in their forties because of muscle weakening, slow movement, increased fatigue causing gait
problems, and functional defects in balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can also be caused by decreased lower-body strength,
coordination, flexibility, or proprioception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, strengthening exercises are necessary for the recovery
of balance ability. A previous study reported that resistance exercise using the Thera-band
strengthened the lower limbs of elderly adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of easy and simple
stretching and resistance exercises on the static and dynamic balance of elderly adults.</p><p>In an evaluation of dynamic balance using the TUG, it was reported that a time &#x0003e;14&#x02005;s
indicates a high risk of falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The TUG
scores in this study were not significantly different between the groups, or between pre-
and post-test. These results corroborate the findings of a previous study indicating that
stretching does not improve balance ability of elderly adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these results do not agree with those of a previous study
that showed that exercise using the Thera-band significantly improved the TUG score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our simple program consisting of
stretching and resistance exercises was not sufficient to influence the TUG time, because of
the program composition and the lack of time.</p><p>The BBS scores were not significant between the groups, or between pre- and post-test,
indicating our simple tests. As a result, a single stretching and resistance exercise should
be performed over the long term or be accompanied by other routines in order to have an
effect on enhancing the dynamic balance performance of elderly subjects. The abnormally high
results in the weight distribution index were related to orthopedic and neurological
problems. A previous study reported that weight distribution indices of elderly adults were
higher than those of young adults, because of poorer integration of visual and somatosensory
information due to by aging-induced unstable balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The weight distribution index with eyes open was significantly lower in the resistance
exercise group than in the control group, and the pre-test value was significantly higher
than the post-test value. We conclude that an exercise program using elastic resistance
improves the static balance of both limbs while maintaining a normal weight range and also
improves suitable weight distribution. Our results support existing research claiming that
regular training and increase of muscle strength enhance postural control by improving the
sensory reactions in the nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. We were considered that muscular training enhanced balance ability
by improving the visual system and somatosensory senses.</p><p>The stability index is proportional to instability. The stability test index with eyes open
was significantly lower in the resistance exercise group than in the control group, and the
pre-test value was significantly higher than the post-test value. These results show that
resistance exercise performed by elderly adults improved balance better than stretching.
Alfieri et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the center
of gravity of subjects was maintained after trunk and lower-extremity strengthening
exercises. Improved stability while performing resistance exercise in the standing position
may cause overall strengthening.</p><p>Our study was limited by the relatively short period and the use of only 1 exercise among
the numerous available methods. Thus, these findings cannot be generalized to all elderly
adults. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effects of balance
improvement programs using various enjoyable exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Seidler</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Burutolu</surname><given-names>TB</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Motor control and aging: links to age-related brain
