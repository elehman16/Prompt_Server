A <italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm revealed that, after 4 weeks of treatment, 42% of the patients moved from the arachnophobic to the nonarachnophobic cluster. Six months after 
concluding the treatment, a follow-up study showed a substantial consolidation of the recovery process where 92% of the arachnophobic patients moved to the nonarachnophobic cluster.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. INTRODUCTION</title><p>
According to the DSM-IV manual (American Psychiatric Association 
[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), specific phobias are anxiety disorders that are 
characterized by an excessive, unreasonable, and persistent fear 
that is manifested by the presence or expectation of an object or 
feared situation (phobic situation). The manual states that 
9% of the population suffers from specific phobias.</p><p>Spider phobia is one of the most common specific phobias (Bourdon 
et al. [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Arachnophobic individuals develop an avoidance 
behavior for all contexts related to the animal (APA [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). 
Many patients are so afraid of being confronted by the phobic 
object that they refuse to undergo any kind of therapy (Marks 
[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).</p><p>Existing therapies range from those that confront the patient with 
the real spider, such as &#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d; exposure therapy (Ost 
[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), to those that avoid this confrontation by requiring 
the patient to imagine situations involving spiders (Hecker 
[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). In between, several therapies try to minimize the 
anxiety of the direct exposure by using computer simulations in 
which either the patient himself (Garcia-Palacios et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) or a &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; person guided by the patient (Gilroy et al. [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) interacts with a &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; spider.</p><p>The treatment proposed here (SLAT: spiderless arachnophobia 
therapy) does not use any spider, neither real nor virtual or 
imaginary. It is specifically oriented to those patients with 
severe arachnophobia that would not undergo any kind of therapy 
involving a spider. This treatment makes use of the idea that 
aversive information does not need to be perceived consciously to 
trigger an emotional response. Nonconscious processing mechanisms 
of emotionally relevant stimuli are sufficient to activate the 
autonomic components of a phobic reaction (&#x000d6;hman and Soares 
[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). From the neural point of view, fearful information 
does not need to reach cortical levels to generate the typical 
fear response. Individuals with bilateral destruction of the 
visual cortices exhibit amygdala responses to emotional faces even 
when brain damage is recent so that cortical networks have had too 
short time to reorganize (Pegna et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In this case, 
the amygdala activation requires mediation by thalamic 
(pulvinar nucleus) or tectal (superior colliculus) areas (Morris 
et al. [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; Pegna et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p><p>
The thalamus and amygdala are, according to LeDoux et al., 
responsible for recognizing fearful stimuli and triggering 
subsequent autonomic responses such as increased heart rate, 
respiration, and sweating (LeDoux [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; Doy&#x000e9;re et al. 
[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). According to these authors, when an aversive stimulus 
arrives at the thalamus, it passes rough, almost archetypal 
information, directly to the amygdala, producing a rapid response 
to the possible danger.</p><p>The therapy proposed in this paper makes use of these ideas by 
presenting to the patient a collection of images that contain a 
reduced subset of the features of a spider. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>
shows some of these images: the Atomium of Brussels in which the 
spheres resembles the spider's body, a carousel in which the seats 
hang like the preys of a spider, a tripod whose legs are 
articulated like spider's legs, and so forth. These images, 
sharing a limited subset of features of a spider, were called SLAT 
images. After a preliminary presentation, only the images in which 
the features of the spider appear in a subtler way are kept in the 
final presentation. The images that evoke spider-related feelings 
above a certain degree are discarded from the final therapeutic 
set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsubsec2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</xref>). To avoid the patient's 
thoughts related to spiders while seeing the treatment 
presentation, the patient is given a question that should be 
answered at the end of the run, like &#x0201c;In how many images there is 
a rounded object?&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Patients were recruited by means of advertisements in several 
newspapers and on television. Of the 160 volunteers that made 
contact with us, 36 with symptoms of severe arachnophobia that 
were reluctant to undergo other types of treatments were 
personally interviewed. They were then included in the study if 
they (1) met DSM-IV criteria of specific phobia (APA [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) 
assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I 
Disorders (SCID), (2) had been phobic for at least ten 
years,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="N1">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> (3) did not have any neurological or psychiatric 
problems, and (4) were classified as arachnophobes according to a 
<italic>k</italic>-means multivariate analysis.</p><p>Four volunteers were excluded because of the three first criteria. 
A further 6 were excluded because they had difficulty in coming on 
a regular basis to the university to participate in the 
experiments.</p><p>Regarding the last criterion, the <italic>k</italic>-means multivariate analysis 
was conducted using as inputs the five measurements obtained from 
a behavioral avoidance test (BAT) and from the fear of spider 
questionaire (FSQ); see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3">Section 3</xref>. These instruments 
were applied to the remaining 26 volunteers, and to 29 nonphobic 
control subjects recruited among the personnel and students of 
S&#x000e3;o Paulo University, so that the algorithm could establish 
two well-defined clusters: the arachnophobic and the 
nonarachnophobic cluster. After applying the <italic>k</italic>-means 
multivariate analysis, the 29 control subjects were classified as 
nonphobic. One of the 26 volunteers was characterized as nonphobic 
by the <italic>k</italic>-means analysis and was eliminated from the study 
leaving 25 arachnophobic patients. The mean age and standard 
deviation of the arachnophobic patients and controls were 
31.3 &#x000b1; 7.4 and 32.6 &#x000b1; 8.2 years, respectively. The 
duration of phobia among the patients was 23.0 &#x000b1; 8.6 years. 
The five measurements (see the following section) that were used 
as inputs in the <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm were (a) the distance 
tolerated to a real tarantula in a BAT; (b) the distance tolerated 
to a photo of a tarantula in a BAT; (c) the subjective percentage 
of anxiety according to the subjective units of disconfort scale 
(SUDS), using a real tarantula; (d) the percentage of anxiety with 
a photo of a spider; (e) the numerical result of the FSQ test.</p><p>The chief advantage of the <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm is that it uses a multivariate
approach (here, 5 measurements) in order to separate phobic from nonphobic
subjects. This procedure is more robust than adopting only one measurement,
such as the BAT or the result of the FSQ, as conventionally used for separating
phobic from nonphobic subjects. It is also important to remark that the <italic>k</italic>-means
algorithm does not use any arbitrary parameter that can bias the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Spider phobia assessment techniques</title><p>
To assess the degree of spider phobia, three different instruments 
were used. As described, the SCID (First et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) was 
used to produce a preliminary selection of participants. 
Afterwards, the BAT and the FSQ provided the 5 measurements used 
to evaluate if participants showed improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="subsubsec2.2.1"><title>2.2.1. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis I 
Disoders (SCID)</title><p>To verify that patients met DSM-IV criteria for specific phobias 
(300.29), all of them underwent an SCID (First et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="subsubsec2.2.2"><title>2.2.2. Behavioral assessment test (BAT)</title><p>
The BAT is a widely used measurement of clinical improvement in 
specific phobias (Lang and Lazovick [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; Lang et al. 
[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). It consists of an artificial situation in which the 
subject approaches the phobic object until discomfort sets in. The 
experimenter measures the distance from the subject to the object 
and assesses the subject's anxiety level using, in our case, the 
SUDS scale (Wolpe [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). These tests usually start at 5 
meters from the real spider, but in this study the initial 
distance was established as 25 meters because of the severity of 
arachnophobia in our patients.</p><p>
The BAT was performed in two stages: first with a photo of a 
tarantula (Grammostola acteon, 20 cm) and afterwards with a real 
tarantula. In both cases the phobic object was placed at the end 
of a 25-meter long corridor. Before beginning the test, an 
assistant read the instructions to the subject: &#x0201c;This is a 
behavioral assessment test and is not part of the therapy. You are 
free to refuse my suggestions. Walk the farthest you are able to 
approximate to the spider at the end of the corridor without 
forcing yourself. I will remain at this point until you stop.&#x0201d; 
When the subject stops less than one meter from the object, the 
assistant says: &#x0201c;Touch the photo&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Touch the cage&#x0201d; in the 
case of the real tarantula.</p><p>
Note that instead of asking the patient to approach as much as 
possible to the spider, the patient is asked to approach to the 
spider as much as possible without forcing himself. This kind of 
suggestion guaranteed complying with the desire of patients of not 
confronting in any way the phobic object.</p><p>
The BAT was rated by measuring the distance from the subject to 
the phobic object, starting at 25 meters. The BAT score ranged 
from 26 if the subject refused to do the test, to &#x02212;1, if the 
subject opened the lid of the cage. When subjects stopped, the 
assistant applies the SUDS by saying: &#x0201c;Please, rate you anxiety 
from 0% to 100%, 100% being the greatest fear you 
have had in your life.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="subsubsec2.2.3"><title>2.2.3. Fear of spider questionnaire (FSQ)</title><p>The fear of spiders questionnaire (FSQ) assesses the subjective 
perception of spider fear (Szymanski and O'Donohue [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). It 
is composed of 18 questions rated on a 1&#x02013;7 Likert scale (1 = I 
strongly disagree, 7 = I strongly agree). The FSQ was able to 
discriminate between phobics and nonphobics, F(1.111) = 5.99, 
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01, F(1.76) = 13.28, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01, respectively (Szymanski and O'Donohue [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). It also provided evidence for the 
improvement of phobic patients following a cognitive restructuring 
treatment (comparing pretest to posttest: <italic>t</italic>(37) = 4.38, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01, 
<italic>t</italic>(79) = 5.09, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01, resp.). When applied to nontreated 
subjects, the instrument did not show improvement from pretest to 
posttest. This instrument has an internal consistency of 0.92 with 
a split half reliability of 0.89.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.3"><title>2.3. Presentation of &#x0201c;SLAT&#x0201d; figures</title><p>
The presentation used in the SLAT consists of an initial set of 
165 images, 124 of them having some features that resemble any of 
the characteristics (color, shape, texture, etc.) of a spider and 
were selected as explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsubsec2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</xref>. 
Examples include the image of a person with a Rastafarian hair style, the 
Atomium of Brussels, a carousel, and so forth.</p><p>
The remaining 41 images were neutral and were selected with the 
purpose of making it more difficult for the subject to realize 
there were SLAT images in the presentation.</p><p>
The placebo group presentation consisted of a sequence of images 
without arachniform features. Among the selected figures, there 
were abstract or surreal paintings that might induce placebo 
subjects to think there was something hidden in the figures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="subsubsec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Selection of figures</title><p>
The images were selected from the Internet. We chose 132 images 
with spider features and 44 neutral images. The features that were 
selected in the images were related, for example, to the radial 
symmetry of spiders, the design of their webs, their texture, the 
way they articulate their legs, the hook-like shape of their 
extremities, or the fact that they hang from a string.</p><p>
For validating our selection, 43 nonarachnophobic persons were 
asked to rate, on a 0 to 10 scale, the content of spider features 
in all the images. Not to bias the process of rating the images, 
no instructions related to what features to consider in rating the 
images were given to these persons.</p><p>
It was necessary to establish a threshold in this scale for 
separating SLAT images from neutral images. This threshold was 
obtained by means of the Bayes decision rule that yields a 
threshold of 0.92. Images with a greater rate were classified as 
SLAT images, and images with a lower rate were classified as 
neutral. According to this rule, 8 of the figures initially 
classified as SLAT images were neutral, and 3 neutral figures were 
SLAT images. Therefore, a total of 11 images were excluded from 
the final therapeutic repertoire. To apply the Bayes decision 
rule, a histogram was created giving the probability of finding a 
SLAT image inside intervals of 0.6 unit length in the 0 to 10 
&#x0201c;arachniform scale.&#x0201d; The same was done with neutral images. We 
replaced both histograms by two curves after smoothing the 
histograms by using interpolation by splines. The intersection of 
the two curves yielded the value of 0.92 that served to 
discriminate between SLAT and neutral images.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="subsubsec2.3.2"><title>2.3.2. Adjustment of presentation intervals</title><p>One of the assumptions that served to delineate the SLAT (see 
assumption (a) in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec4.1">Section 4.1</xref>) deals with avoiding a 
high activation in the neural circuits involved in fear. For this 
reason, we elaborated a procedure to exclude from the final 
therapeutic presentation those images that might produce 
discomfort in the patients, keeping only the more comfortable 
images that would probably not produce a high degree of activation 
in these neural circuits.</p><p>We adopted the following procedure.</p><p>(a) Once the entire set of figures had been shown to the patient in a preparatory
presentation, we asked the patient to see the figures once more and collaborate
with us to determine the adjusted duration, <italic>T</italic>
<sub>ad</sub>, of each one of the
images. The patient was instructed as follows: &#x0201c;Each one of the following
images will be presented by default for 5 seconds. If you do not like the
image, press the &#x0201c;Enter&#x0201d; button to pass
to the following image sooner. The sooner you press the button, the more
fearful we will understand the image to be for you.&#x0201d;</p><p>(b) After seeing all images the subjects were asked:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Which images, if any, are intolerable?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which images are tolerable?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which images are so nice that you might place them in your bedroom?</p></list-item></list>
</p><p> With all this information, nine rules were applied to obtain the 
final duration of each image, <italic>T</italic>
<sub>ad</sub>, in the 
presentation. As some patients were faster than others in pressing 
the &#x0201c;Enter&#x0201d; button, the average time <italic>T</italic>
<sub>m</sub> for each 
subject served as the patient's unit of time.</p><p>In the following rules, times <italic>T</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, <italic>T</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, and so on were set as arbitrary multiples of <italic>T</italic>
<sub>m</sub>. The adjusted 
duration of each image, <italic>T</italic>
<sub>ad</sub>, was obtained by 
multiplying the duration chosen by the subject in the preparatory 
presentation, <italic>T</italic>, by a coefficient calculated as follows.</p><p>
We defined three thresholds: <italic>T</italic>

the Institute of Psychology of the University S&#x000e3;o Paulo.</p><p>
As mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec2.1">Section 2.1</xref>, of the 160 patients that 
contacted us, 36 were interviewed and 25 were included in the 
experiment. These patients signed forms, agreeing to participate 
in either the placebo or treatment group, and allow the use of 
collected data for research. Patients were randomly divided into 
two groups: treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 12).</p><p>
After adjusting the timing of the presentation, a personalized CD 
was prepared for each patient. In the following session, this CD 
was given to the patient. The patient was then instructed to run 
the presentation twice a day at home preferably during moments in 
which she/he was not tired or under stress. Prior to each 
presentation run, the patient was given one question to answer at 
the end of the run. These questions were intended to 
distract the patient from arachniform features in the images. 
Examples include: &#x0201c;In how many images there is an animal?&#x0201d; or 
&#x0201c;In how many images there is a rounded object?&#x0201d; When answering 
the question, the patient was instructed to write, beside the 
answer, the date and time she/he ran the presentation. Every week 
these data were checked out in order to verify the rate of 
cooperation of patients and to encourage noncooperative patients, 
if any. In all subjects, the cooperation was satisfactory and no 
statistics were deemed necessary to measure the rate of 
cooperation.</p><p>To assess progress during the treatment, placebo and treatment 
subjects underwent the BAT (including the SUDS) each week. In the 
last week, the FSQ was also applied. Experiments were carried out 
in three stages. In stage 1, data collected during these first 
four weeks were used to compare placebo and treatment groups. A 
period of four weeks was established prior to the experiment with 
the intention of minimizing the duration of the experiment in 
order to avoid drop out. In stage 2, the treatment group (but not 
the placebo) was asked (and luckily agreed) to continue for two 
more weeks to assess if this additional time might help the 
treated group to achieve a more substantial recovery. They were 
evaluated at the end of the 6th week.</p><p>
In stage 3, after the fourth week, placebo subjects were invited 
to receive the SLAT. The ten subjects that were accepted were 
treated for 6 weeks and evaluated after the 4th and 6th weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.1"><title>3.1. Comparison between placebo and control groups at the beginning of the study</title><p>

Of the 13 treatment subjects, 3 refused to stay at any distance 
from the real spider if the spider was visible. They received an 
arbitrary score of 26, one meter more than the maximum score of 25 
meters used in the BAT test. Regarding the test with the spider 
photo, one subject refused to stay at any distance in which he 
could see the photo. Analogously, we assigned a score of 26 meters 
in the BAT test to this subject. We emphasize that, different from 
previous studies in which the initial distance of the BAT test was 
standardized to 5 meters, this distance was augmented to 25 meters 
because of the desire of the patients not to confront the spider 
in anyway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Comparative evolution of placebo and treated groups</title><p>

A 2 (group) &#x000d7; 5 (times) repeated measure multivariate

the differences between placebo and treated groups were

multivariate ANOVA, we conclude that the significant time effect

In order to evaluate how the test with the real spider and the

the BAT and SUDS of the real spider and then with the BAT and SUDS

A <italic>k</italic>-means multivariate cluster analysis was used to assess the

each subject: BAT and SUDS with real spider, BAT and SUDS with

five variables gathered from the 25 arachnophobes at the beginning 
of treatment, and from 29 normal subjects recruited in the

eliminate nonphobic subjects from the group of volunteers, as 
explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec2.1">Section 2.1</xref>. To calculate the percentages 
of patients that migrated from arachnophobic to normal 
along the different stages of the experimental procedure (see

Hypothetical assumptions for elaborating the SLAT</title><p>Two hypothetical assumptions that are consistent with neurological 
findings served to delineate the methodology of SLAT. The results 
of the therapy, however, are not intended to assess the validity 
of these preliminary assumptions, which would require much further 
confirmation.</p><p> (a) The first assumption is that some connections from thalamus to 
amygdala are abnormally potentiated in phobic patients, possibly 
because of a process in which a conditioned stimulus (CS), the 
phobic object, is associated with an unconditioned stimulus (US) 
such as a loud sound or an acute pain. The possibility of plastic 
changes taking place in the thalamo-amygdala pathway is supported 
by the work of Doy&#x000e9;re et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in which they were 
able to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in thalamic and 
cortical inputs to the amygdala in freely moving rats, 
demonstrating that LTP in thalamic inputs is much more persistent 
and long-lasting than LTP in cortical inputs. LeDoux, Schafe et 
al. (Apergis-Schoute et al. [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) have further shown that 
intralaminar thalamic neurons contribute to presynaptic plasticity 
in the thalamo-amigdaloid pathway during fear conditioning. 
Thalamic intralaminar neurons are also described as a locus of 
functional CS-US convergence for fear conditioning to acoustic 
stimuli (Cruikshank et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). The possibility of altering 
these circuits by means of either habituation to the spider or by 
cognitive-behavioral therapy is also mentioned, for example, by 
Veltman et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]
and Paquette et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>
Regarding the degree to which plastic changes would take place in 
the thalamo-amygdaloid pathway, it is worth mentioning that 
postsynaptic voltage value is critical to determining whether a 
synapse is reinforced or depressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). 
According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, postsynaptic 
depolarization determines the potentiation or depression of a 
given synapse. If the value of postsynaptic depolarization is 
greater than a threshold, called the LTP threshold, active 
synapses are potentiated (i.e., increment their synaptic 
connectivity or synaptic weight); below this threshold they 
are depressed (Artola and Singer [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; 
Bear et al. [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) (these synapses experiment a decrement of 
their synaptic connectivity or synaptic weight). If the 
postsynaptic depolarization is very low, synaptic depression is 
small or null.</p><p>
We conjectured that the effectiveness of SLAT depends on 
activating neurons that project from thalamus to amygdala in such 
a way that they are inside the depression interval. Unfortunately, 
depression intervals vary for each synapse according to a synaptic 
property called metaplasticity. The same postsynaptic activity may 
produce potentiation in one synapse and depression in another 
while leaving a third unaltered. We were also unable to directly 
evaluate the postsynaptic activity that a given SLAT figure 
produced in these neurons.</p><p>
Despite all these difficulties, we conjectured that the fear 
reaction produced by SLAT figures was correlated to the 
postsynaptic activity in neurons in the thalamo-amygdaloid 
pathway. To avoid potentiation and favor depression, fearful 
images were omitted from the presentation (see 
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsubsec2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</xref>). The duration of the remaining images 
were adjusted so that comfortable images were exhibited during a 
longer time and less comfortable images during a shorter 
interval.</p><p>(b) The second hypothetical assumption that served to delineate 
SLAT is related to the nature of the archetypal information that, 
according to LeDoux, is relayed from the thalamus to the amygdala. 
Morris et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]
found that the amygdala appears to sum, in 
a nonlinear manner, individual responses to specific facial 
features. A two-stage theory for facial perception of emotions was 
proposed by De Bonis et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]
and tested by Morris et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>],
who concluded that &#x0201c;the perception of emotional 
expressions depends on an initial processing of individual facial 
features followed by a nonlinear association of the different 
components.&#x0201d; According to Weinberger and collaborators (Lennart 
and Weinberger [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>];
Edeline and Weinberger [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), the 
thalamus is able to recognize features, augmenting its response to 
a specific feature that was previously paired to a US.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.2"><title>4.2. Neurocomputational foundations</title><p>
Neurocomputational models (Pel&#x000e1;ez [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) are 
consistent with the two-stage theory, conjecturing that the first 
stage of the process, the preliminary processing of individual 
features, is performed in the thalamus. According to these models, 
in the thalamus each sensory pattern is represented as a vector 
with components in a coordinate frame in which each axis 
corresponds to a specific feature of the pattern. Each one of 
these axes/features corresponds to the output of a thalamic 
reticular neuron. The output of these reticular neurons (Crabtree 
and Isaac [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) is nonlinearly summed by intralaminar neurons 
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and if this sum exceeds a threshold, the 
result is relayed to the amygdala. According to the computational 
model, the set of axes/features created by the firing of reticular 
neurons in the thalamus, constitute a code that identifies, in a 
rough way, each input pattern. This code would correspond to the 
rough, almost archetypal description of the aversive stimuli, 
that, according to LeDoux and colleagues (LeDoux [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; 
Doy&#x000e9;re et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), is passed from the thalamus to the 
amygdala.</p><p>
According to the first assumption, a way of depressing 
thalamo-amygdaloid synapses would be by avoiding high 
post-synaptic potentials in thalamo-amygdaloid neurons by means of 
reducing the intensity of phobic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). A 
possible way of reducing this intensity would be by masking 
or obscuring the phobic object. However, a masked or obscured 
phobic object is still intense enough to fire the amygdala (Whalen 
et al. [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) and aversive for patients.</p><p>
Instead of reducing the duration or intensity of spider images, we 
propose to reduce the number of arachnoid features present in each 
image. According to the second assumption, when the number of 
arachniform features in the input pattern is reduced, the 
activation of intralaminar neurons (computing the sum of these 
features) is also reduced. This lower activation of intralaminar 
neurons contributes to reduce the activation of the neurons in the 
thalamo-amigdaloid axis, so that their synapses would undergo 
depression instead of potentiation. Therefore, when, instead of 
the spider code, a code with a smaller repertoire of arachniform 
features is relayed, neurons in the thalamo-amigdaloid pathway are 
hypothetically less activated, their synapses more prompted to 
undergo depression rather than potentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.3"><title>4.3. Influence of the BAT assessment test in the efficacy of the SLAT</title><p>Both treatment and placebo groups underwent BAT and SUDS 
assessment test weekly. Volunteers were told to approach the 
spider without forcing themselves. The purpose of this instruction 
was to adhere, during the BAT and SUDS tests, to the principles 
that inspired the therapy, that is, to avoid any stimuli that 
could contribute to enhance thalamo-amygdala connectivity.</p><p>It could be argued that the BAT assessment test could, by itself, 
have a therapeutical effect over arachnophobia. This effect might 
be thought to be responsible for the improvement observed in the 
placebo group. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec3.2">Section 3.2</xref>, 
improvement of patients in the treatment group was significantly 
better than that of patients in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.4"><title>4.4. The delay of improvement in the FSQ</title><p>Many patients reported that they did not realize that they had 
lost their fear of spiders until they were confronted to a real 
spider during their daily life. They had the strange sensation of 
not reacting with fear when, for the first time after treatment, 
they saw a real spider. Since during daily life, a real 
confrontation with a spider is an unpredictable event, the 
realization of having lost the fear varies from individual to 
individual. The BAT assessment test, independently of its possible 
placebo effect, could contribute to accelerate this process of 
realization.</p><p>Related to this, we observed that the improvement in the FSQ was 
delayed in comparison to the improvement in the automatic 
responses measured by the BAT and SUDS. This is consistent with 
the reasonable supposition that patients did not realize that they 
had lost their fear until they actually confronted a real spider 
during their daily life situations. Depending on the frequency 
with which they actually confronted a spider in their daily lives, 
the realization of recovery took a shorter or longer time in the 
different patients. This fact was reflected in the follow-up study 
that was carried out six months after the conclusion of the 
treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.5"><title>4.5. Therapeutical limitations</title><p>Although the 25 subjects that took part in the experiment came 
from a very large sample of 160 arachnophobic volunteers, there 
were no volunteers above the age of 46. Taking into account that 
neural plasticity depends on age (Burke and Barnes 
[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) and 
that our experiments were not able to assess the therapeutic 
effect of SLAT in elderly people, we suggest to apply the SLAT to 
patients below the age of 46, until performing an assessment with 
older volunteers in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.6"><title>4.6. Suggestions for further studies</title><p>The 160 arachnophobic patients that contacted us were classified 
in terms of their degree of arachnophobia. Among the six with the 
highest scores, three of them suffered thyroid hormone impairment. 
We wondered whether this coincidence might be a possible 
psycho-somatic effect produced in the long run by arachnophobia. A 
similar case of thyroid hormone alteration was found in the 
literature (Friedman et al. [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]
) among women with 
posttraumatic stress disorders. These considerations motivate a 
study to assess the relationship between thyroid hormone 
alteration and phobias.</p><p>
According to our theoretical assumptions, the SLAT acts at 
subcortical levels. Neuroimaging studies could help to evaluate 
this assumption by comparing the brain activation before and after 
the SLAT. A similar comparison was done by Paquette et al. 
[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in which arachnophobic patients were treated with 
cognitive behavioral therapy. This study concluded that the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parahippocampal 
gyrus diminished their activation significantly after 
treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy. In the case 
of the SLAT, we expect that reduction of activity in the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parahippocampal 
gyrus will be preceded by reduced activity of amygdala 
and superior colliculus. This sequence would be consistent with 
the fact that during the SLAT, improvement in the BAT test 
(measuring automatic responses) proceeded the improvement in the 
FSQ tests (measuring cognitive variables related to fear of 
spiders).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>
A novel technique for treating spider phobia, that does not 
require any use of spiders, was described and tested. In the SLAT, 
here described, each patient is given a personalized presentation 
in a compact disk, containing a set of images that, although not 
containing spiders, present subsets of spider characteristics. The 
degree to which each image evokes a spider in different patients 
is different. The most evocative images are excluded from the 
personalized presentation whereas the less evocative images are 
presented to the patient during a longer interval (see 
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsubsec2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</xref>). Regarding the subtlety of the images, 
two treatment group patients declared that they thought they were 
in the placebo group because their presentation caused no 
discomfort at all.</p><p>
To compare the evolution of the placebo and treatment groups, a 
four-week experiment was designed. Treatment and placebo groups 
went through their corresponding presentation twice a day and came 
once a week to the university to apply the BAT and SUDS tests. To 
carry out these tests, instead of encouraging the subjects to 
approach as much as possible to a spider, they were told to 
approach the spider, but without forcing themselves. They could 
also refuse to do the test, which was the case of three treatment 
subjects in their initial evaluation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec3.1">Section 3.1</xref>). 
This kind of suggestion respects the desire of the subjects of not 
confronting the spider in any way, and is coherent with the main 
philosophy of the procedure, according to which the subtler the 
better. The improvement in every measure of phobia was higher for 
the treatment group than in the placebo group (see Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Moreover, the repeated measures 
multivariate ANOVA showed that the patients' improvement was not 
due to a placebo effect (group &#x000d7; time interaction: 
F(1,23) = 7.98, <italic>P</italic> = .0096).</p><p>
In the follow-up study performed after six months, 91.7% of 
the patients in the treatment group were classified as 
nonarachnophobes by the <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm, six patients of this 
group opened the lid of the tarantula cage, and, of these, three 
touched the tarantula.</p><p>
The therapy proposed here was aimed at subconscious, automatic 
responses, while behavioral or psychoanalytic therapies emphasize 
the rational control of fear reactions. According to LeDoux 
[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the alteration of fear behavior can be produced by the 
cortical control of fear reactions without the actual deletion of 
what LeDoux calls &#x0201c;fear memories,&#x0201d; that once established become 
relatively permanent. These &#x0201c;fear memories&#x0201d; were intentionally 
the targets of the therapy proposed in this paper.</p><p>
SLAT is particularly appropriate for, but not exclusive to, those 
patients who, because of the severity of their arachnophobia or 
whatever other reason, are unwilling to undergo therapies that 
involve any real, imagined or virtual spider. The theoretical 
basis of the therapeutic strategy was aiming to produce plastic 
changes in the thalamo-amygdaloid circuit responsible for the 
subconscious, automatic reactions triggered when the subject sees 
a spider. The therapy might have been effective for other, 
fortuitous, reasons, but the consistency with the theoretical 
basis that motivated it (Sections <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec4.1">4.1</xref>
and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="subsec4.2">4.2</xref>) 
is very encouraging, both from a practical point of view, 
providing an additional strategy to deal with certain phobias, and 
from a theoretical point of view, motivating further studies to 
test these ideas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank David Vogel for

here described (SLAT). R: thalamic reticular neurons; I: thalamic intralaminar
neurons; L: lateral nucleus of the amygdale; C: central nucleus of the
amygdala. Due to a competitive process performed between reticular neurons in
the model, each one of them responds to a specific feature of a sensory pattern
(Pel&#x000e1;ez [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). A similar competitive process takes place between
intralaminar neurons, each one responding to a specific combination of
features. Therefore, a certain number of features, that is, reticular neurons,
are necessary for firing a specific intralaminar neuron. When this number is
