AO is defined as postoperative pain inside and around the extraction site, which increases in severity at any time between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> day after the extraction, accompanied by a partial or total disintegrated blood clot within the alveolar socket with or without halitosis. In dry socket, the alveolar osseous walls are exposed, with total or partial clot loss, dark coloration, and a fetid odor. Continuous, intense, and frequently radiating pain is present that is not relieved by analgesics. Local hyperthermia and lymphadenopathy can also occur with this type of alveolitis. It is suggested that AO is the result of either bacterial infection or by the release of tissue factors leading to the activation of plasminogen and the subsequent fibrinolysis of the blood clot.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The increase in recovery period translates into increased cost to the surgeon and patients who develop AO typically require multiple postoperative visits to manage this condition.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Many suggested methods exist for the prevention of AO including topical and systemic steroids, topical and systemic antibiotics, matrix forming resorbable materials, antifibrinolytic agents, and various combinations of the above. No single method has gained universal success or acceptance although a large number of practitioners continue to use &#x0201c;their method&#x0201d; often without controlled studies to support its use.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>It is now well known that platelets have many functions beyond that of hemostasis. Platelets contain important growth factors that, when secreted, are responsible for increasing cell mitosis, increasing collagen production, recruiting other cells to the site of injury, initiating vascular ingrowth, and inducing cell differentiation. These are all crucial steps in early wound healing. Using the concept that if a few are good, then a lot may be better, increasing the concentration of platelets at a wound may promote more rapid healing. It seems very logical that increasing the concentration of platelets in a bone graft and therefore increasing the concentration of growth factors may lead to a more rapid and denser regenerate.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous concentration of human platelets in a small volume of plasma. Because it is a concentration of platelets, it is also a concentration of the seven fundamental protein growth factors proved to be actively secreted by platelets to initiate all wound healing. These growth factors include three isomers of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFaa, PDGFpp, and PDGFap), two of the numerous transforming growth factors-p (TGFp1 and TGFp2), vascular endothelial growth factor, and epithelial growth factor. All these growth factors have been documented to exist in platelets. As these concentrated platelets are suspended in a small volume of plasma, PRP is more than just a platelets concentrate; it also contains the three proteins in blood known to act as cell adhesion molecules for osteoconduction and as a matrix for bone, connective tissue, and epithelial migration. These cell adhesion molecules are fibrin itself, fibronectin, and vitronectin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of PRP on the incidence of AO in patients with potential risk factors for the development of AO; this study also aimed to examine the incidence of AO formation and its association with immediate placement of PRP gel in the extraction alveolus socket.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>These study participants involved a total of 150 patients, both female and male patients, who were referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery for the removal of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> mandibular molar. After obtaining the complete history, patients were examined clinically and were explained about the procedure, its complication, and the follow-up period involved in the study. The patients who were willing were enrolled for the study. Informed consent was taken and ethical clearance was obtained; patients of age between 30 and 60 years and with potential risk factors for the development of AO which included smokers, alcoholics (ALC), postmenopausal women (PML), patients on oral contraceptives (OC); pericoronitis (PC), and bruxism (BM) were selected for the study. All mandibular molar teeth irrespective of its position and eruptive status (erupted, partially erupted, and complete bone impaction) were included in the study. Patients below 30 years and above 60 years, pregnant and lactating mothers, patients having bleeding disorders, on antiplatelet drugs, undergoing chemotherapy, and patients with acute phase of PC were excluded from the study.</p><p>Study participants were randomly divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 75 patients, in whom PRP was placed in the socket after extraction. Group B consisted of 75 patients in them the sockets were left for normal healing without the placement of PRP. The patients were assessed for pain and dry socket on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Protocol for obtaining platelet-rich plasma in an autologous fibrin clot</title><p>Under all aseptic techniques, 8 ml of blood was drawn intravenously from the antecubital region of the patient's forearm using Vacutainer needle and BD Vacutainers (each 4.5 ml) containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose with adenine (0.5 ml each). The Vacutainers were thoroughly shaken to ensure mixture of anticoagulant with the drawn blood. The whole blood is then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatant formed is platelet-poor plasma and buffy coat. Platelet-poor plasma and buffy coat and upper 1 mm red blood cell layer are collected in a fresh Vacutainer and again centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The upper half of the supernatant is discarded and the lower half is mixed thoroughly to yield PRP. The lower half is then mixed with 0.5&#x02013;1 cc of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and kept undisturbed for 2&#x02013;3 min to yield PRP gel.

It is defined as postoperative pain inside and around the extraction site, which increases in severity at any time between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> day after the extraction, accompanied by a partial or total disintegrated blood clot within the alveolar socket with or without halitosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The cause of AO is poorly understood. It is suggested that AO is the result of either bacterial infection or by the release of tissue factors leading to the activation of plasminogen and the subsequent fibrinolysis of the blood clot.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Normally, blood clot initiates the healing and regeneration of hard and soft tissue postoperatively. PRP is a way to enhance the body's natural wound healing mechanisms. A natural blood clot contains mainly red blood cells, approximately 5% platelets and &#x0003c;1% white blood cells. Using PRP involves taking a sample of a patient's blood postoperatively, concentrating autologous platelets, and applying the resultant gel to the surgical site. This technique produces a blood clot that has nearly a reverse ratio of red blood cells and platelets compared to with a natural blood clot. Platelets are primarily involved in wound healing through clot formation and the release of growth factors that initiate and support wound healing.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Surgical sites enhanced with PRP have been shown to heal at 2&#x02013;3 times that of normal surgical sites. Thus, PRP can be great adjunct to many surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, PRP was prepared from 8 cc of patient's blood and centrifuging the blood twice in a clinical centrifuge as advocated by many authors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>According to Okuda <italic>et al</italic>., the concentration of platelets in PRP gel was measured by a platelet cell counter and was consistently found to be 3.5&#x02013;4 times greater than the whole blood platelet count. This assures a therapeutic concentration of growth factors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Plasma-rich protein is activated to form PRP gel, thus causing degranulation of &#x003b1;-granules present in the platelets and releasing the growth factors. The various agents for the activation reported in literature include CaCl<sub>2</sub> alone, CaCl<sub>2</sub> plus bovine thrombin, human thrombin, autologous bone, and whole blood which contains thrombin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Landesburg in 1998 had demonstrated antibodies to clotting factors V, XI and thrombin when bovine thrombin was used to activate. This resulted in risk of life-threatening coagulopathies. Hence, bovine thrombin was not used to activate PRP gel in the present study.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, CaCl<sub>2</sub> alone was mixed with PRP to form an autologous platelet gel. This platelet gel was free of eliciting any antigen&#x02013;antibody as it was prepared from patient's own blood.</p><p>In a study by Marx, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as anticoagulant is not recommended because it fragments platelets. Citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) is preferred and is the anticoagulant used by the blood bank for platelet transfusion because it can preserve the integrity of the platelet membrane.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The importance of this relates to the fact that growth factors are extruded from platelets during exocytosis. During this process, completion of protein molecule and formation of the tertiary structure occur. Fragmented platelets may spill more growth factors into the solution, providing for higher levels, but their tertiary structure is altered, and therefore, their activity and effectiveness are reduced.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In our study, CPD was used to preserve the platelet membrane integrity.</p><p>The beneficial effects of PRP for decreasing the incidence of AO may be related to a number of signaling proteins found in the platelets, including multiple growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2, platelet-derived growth factors, and cytokines such as angiopoietin-2 and interleukin-1. These factors stimulate cell mitosis and differentiation, increase collagen production, recruit leukocytes and other cells to the surgical site, and initiate vascular ingrowth. Growth factors promote both soft and hard tissue healing and angiogenesis. In addition, platelets promote clot formation, which is beneficial in healing. Aside from platelets, PRP also contains white blood cells that can inhibit bacterial growth. Therefore, PRP application mitigates the currently accepted causes of AO by facilitation of clot and soft-tissue formation and inhibition of bacterial colonization.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the inclusion criteria were patients who are aged between 30 and 60 years with potential risk factors for the development of AO which included smokers, ALC, PC, postmenopausal ladies, TXN, BM, and OC. Factors that have been shown to negatively influence the outcome of the study were eliminated while formulating the exclusion criteria of patients since they may alter the treatment plan and influence the result in an aberrant manner.</p><p>In the present study, we also found that PRP when activated formed a gelatinous mass. Whitman <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that the adhesive nature of the gel also enables predictable flap adhesion and hemostasis. As the gel consolidates, a more definite seal is obtained than with primary closure alone.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, pain was measured using visual analog scale[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. Mean value for pain was more in Group B on both the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. Postoperative pain was less in the Group A, and statistically significant difference was observed in the mean score for pain between Group A and Group B on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. Soft-tissue healing was evaluated postoperatively on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 7<sup>th</sup> day. Mean soft-tissue healing on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day for Group A is 1.87 and for Group B is 1.32, 5<sup>th</sup> day for Group A is 2.79 and for Group B is 2.04, and 7<sup>th</sup> day for Group A is 3.57 and for Group B is 2.88. This statistically significant result indicates a better soft-tissue healing of extraction sockets treated with PRP as compared to the non-PRP sockets. Our finding is supported by the similar study where the authors reported that soft-tissue healing was significantly better in the cases where extraction sockets were treated with PRP. Similarly, positive effect was demonstrated by PRP to enhance soft-tissue healing in postrhytidectomy wounds as was evidenced by less edema and ecchymosis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In Group B, AO formation was seen highest in the 3<sup>rd</sup> molar extraction site (17.64%) followed by the first molar extraction site (7.69%) and least in the second molar extraction site (6.66%). The percentage of AO formation in Group A was reduced to 2.43% in the third molar extraction site, and 100% reduction of AO was achieved in the first and second molar extraction sites. In a review of literature published on 2010, it is shown that AO is more common following the extraction of mandibular third molars. It is believed that increased bone density, decreased vascularity, and a reduced capacity of producing granulation tissue are responsible for the site specificity. The area specificity is probably due to the large percentage of surgically extracted mandibular molars and may reflect the effect of surgical trauma rather than the anatomical site.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, OC was one of the potential risk factors that were associated with highest number (25%) of AO, followed by ALC (20%), TXN (16.67%), smokers (10%), and PML (9.10%). In Group A, the chance for AO for patients on OC was reduced by 20%, and for others, it was reduced by 100%.</p><p>OC is the only medication associated with developing AO. OC became popular in the 1960s, and studies conducted after 1970s show a significantly higher incidence of AO in females. Sweet and Butler found that this increase in the use of OC positively correlates with the incidence of AO. Estrogen has been proposed to play a significant role in the fibrinolytic process. It is believed to indirectly activate the fibrinolytic system (increasing factors II, VII, VIII, X, and plasminogen) and therefore increase lysis of the blood clot. Freymiller EG, Aghaloo TL further concluded that the probability of developing AO increases with increased estrogen dose in the OC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In this study, 12.5% of males were prone to AO when compared to 11.42% of females. In a review of literature published by Kolokythas <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010, it is given that female gender regardless of OC use is a predisposition for the development of AO, MacGregor reported a 50% greater incidence of AO in women than that in men in a series of 4000 extractions, while Colby reported no difference in the incidence of AO associated with gender.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>According to findings from this study, those patients aged between 50 and 60 years and those females on OC are at high risk for the formation of AO, followed by TXN, ALC, smokers, and PML. Our result with regard to less pain and enhanced soft-tissue healing may be attributed to the above-mentioned advantages that PRP possesses.</p><p>The limitation of the present study was that the sample size was small consisting of just 150 patients and a short follow-up duration of 7 days. Many literatures have been reported in, where long-term follow-up of 2&#x02013;5 years has been done. Densitometric analysis evaluating postoperative bone formation was not done in the study as comparison between two independent individuals is not possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In this study, autologous PRP was used as adjunct to enhance soft-tissue healing and to reduce the incidence of AO in a group of patients who have the potential risk factors for the development of AO. The study clearly indicates a definite improvement in the soft-tissue healing and significantly reduced the number of AO in patients, with potential risk factors for the development AO as compared to the other group in which extraction sockets were not treated with PRP. This improvement in the wound healing, decrease in pain, and reduction in the number of dry sockets signifies and highlights the use of PRP, certainly as a valid method in inducing and accelerating wound healing and as a method to prevent the formation of AO in patients who are more prone to for the development of AO. Moreover, the preparation of PRP by collecting the blood in the immediate preoperative period avoids a time-consuming visit to the blood bank for the patient. An added benefit for PRP noted in the present study is its ability to form a biological gel that provided clot stability and function as an adhesive.
