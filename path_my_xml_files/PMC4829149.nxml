Here we assessed the biological processes undertaken in-vivo by microbes and the host in the intestinal tract by conducting a metaproteome analysis from a total of 48 faecal samples of 16 healthy adults participating in a placebo-controlled probiotic intervention trial. Half of the subjects received placebo and the other half consumed <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG for three weeks (10<sup>10</sup> cfu per day). Faecal samples were collected just before and at the end of the consumption phase as well as after a three-week follow-up period, and were processed for microbial composition and metaproteome analysis. A common core of shared microbial protein functions could be identified in all subjects. Furthermore, we observed marked differences in expressed proteins between subjects that resulted in the definition of a stable and personalized microbiome both at the mass-spectrometry-based proteome level and the functional level based on the KEGG pathway analysis. No significant changes in the metaproteome were attributable to the probiotic intervention. A detailed taxonomic assignment of peptides and comparison to phylogenetic microarray data made it possible to evaluate the activity of the main phyla as well as key species, including <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>. Several correlations were identified between human and bacterial proteins. Proteins of the human host accounted for approximately 14% of the identified metaproteome and displayed variations both between and within individuals. The individually different human intestinal proteomes point to personalized host-microbiota interactions. Our findings indicate that analysis of the intestinal metaproteome can complement gene-based analysis and contributes to a thorough understanding of the activities of the microbiome and the relevant pathways in health and disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Doctoral Programme in Food Chain and Health</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolmeder</surname><given-names>Carolin Adriane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia</institution></funding-source><award-id>141130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Vos</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002342</institution-id><institution>Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>137389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Vos</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002342</institution-id><institution>Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>141140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Vos</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>European Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>250172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Vos</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Support was provided by: Doctoral Programme in Food Chain and Health (to CK); Academy of Finland [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/">http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/</ext-link>] (141130 to WdV, 137389 to WdV, 141140 to WdV); European Research Council [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://erc.europa.eu/">http://erc.europa.eu/</ext-link>] (250172 to WdV); FP7 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html</ext-link>]; Spinoza award of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize">http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize</ext-link>] (to WdV); METACARDIS HEALTH-F4-2012- 305312 (to J.

We all harbour hundreds of microbial species, each carrying several thousands of genes and hence the intestinal microbiome enhances our own coding capacity by at least a hundred fold. Intestinal microbes are involved in many crucial functions, such as metabolizing food components that escape uptake by the host, contributing to the degradation of mucus, and producing vitamins and a variety of metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids and other important signalling molecules. Overall, the interactions taking place between the host and intestinal microbes, as well as between the different species of microbes, may exert a profound impact on the host&#x02019;s health [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The type and amount of microbes contributing to these actions differ substantially between individuals which means that the phylogenetic composition can be considered as kind of a subjective fingerprint [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, metagenomic studies have shown only limited differences between subjects. Strikingly, while our microbiota varies phylogenetically, metagenomic analyses have revealed that at the highest functional level, such as in KEGG pathway maps, the functional potential of the microbiome of healthy individuals remains very similar [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, this does not imply that there is a similarity in the actual activity of the microbiota in vivo, because this is affected by a variety of factors, including diet, host genetics, and health status.</p><p>Two well-established functional approaches have been exploited to extend the genome-scale analysis to activity based profiling: metatranscriptome and metaproteome analyses. Recent faecal and ileal metatranscriptomic investigations have indicated that there are pronounced differences at the gene expression level in subjects with comparable metagenomes [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, bacterial and archaeal transcripts have short half-lives, in the order of seconds to minutes and hence faecal RNA may not accurately capture the biological processes taking place in the intestinal tract. In contrast to mRNA, proteins are more stable and may provide an interpretation of activities along the whole digestive tract. In the absence of global enzymatic or physiological approaches, metaproteomics, the study of all proteins in an ecosystem, has been applied to elucidate the actual function of the intestinal microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This technique makes it possible to monitor the activities of the host and microbes at the same time, and thus to study their mutualistic interactions [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>So far, intestinal metaproteomic studies have been carried out with 20 healthy individuals at a maximum of two time points [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Functional differences based on proteins have been studied in a dozen patients with strong perturbing factors such as Crohn&#x02019;s disease or antibiotic treatment, but no functional baseline for healthy subjects has ever been established [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In general, functional differences between healthy individuals and their variation over time have only been studied to a limited extent.</p><p>Here, we expand these earlier studies with a cohort of 16 healthy subjects who took part in a placebo-controlled probiotic intervention trial and characterized the dominant functionalities by conducting a comprehensive faecal metaproteome analysis. In this longitudinal trial, these subjects were followed for six weeks and a total of 48 different faecal samples were taken; before, during and after the placebo or probiotic intervention, resulting in three analysis time points. These were used to identify the temporally stable proteins in each subject, i.e. the individual core, as well as the shared functions, i.e. the common core, to define a metaproteomic baseline in healthy subjects. Moreover, we addressed the question of whether the microbial composition can explain the microbial activities i.e. converging vs. diverging in terms of composition and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the trial and its protocol (Ethical protocol no HUS 3577E0/05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153294.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Faecal samples at the end of each period were collected and stored at -20&#x000b0;C at home before transferring them within 24 hours to -80&#x000b0;C at the study centre. In this article, the sample collected at the end of the run-in period is called time point (TP) 1, the sample at the end of the intervention period is TP2, and the sample at the end of the wash-out period is designated TP3.

Fungal peptides were identified at a similarly low level and around 4 out of 1000 spectra with taxonomic information were found to derive from plants (data not shown).</p><p>Plotting the COG assignments per phylum revealed a similar pattern as that previously observed with a smaller set of samples (S8 Fig) [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More than 59% of the Actinobacteria spectra were grouped to the category of Carbohydrate Metabolism, highlighting the impact of that phylum on sugar utilization and transport. Almost 50% of the Bacteroidetes spectra had no assigned function, emphasizing the further need for bacterial physiological studies to explore these unknown encoded functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Pathways of prominent and distinct gut microbes</title><p>The most prominent microbial species in general (on average constituting 15% of the microbiota measured by 16S rRNA gene analysis) was <italic>Ruminococcus obeum</italic>, a well-known representative of the largest phylum Firmicutes.

Bacteria related to <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> showed substantial variation across subjects and time points at the 16S rRNA gene level (S9 Fig). For some subjects, 16S rRNA gene and proteomics measurement displayed essentially the same trend (e.g. samples of subjects 104, 106, 112) but for some samples, the 16S rRNA gene and peptide measurements developed in the opposite directions. In particular, subject 137 was a standout example where <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> was found to contribute less than 5% to the overall community, whereas its metaproteome exceeded more than 10% of all proteins, indicative of the very high gene expression activity of this bacterial group.

Obviously, by analysing the metaproteome of 16 subjects there is not yet a saturation of identified functions but by adding more individuals more functions will still be identified. The identification of several sugar-converting enzymes in the core metaproteome is indicative of the microbiome&#x02019;s ability to exploit glycans as a rapidly available energy supply. The observation that the arabinose module was found to be enriched in all individuals might be attributable to the fact that Finnish subjects are known to consume large amounts of fibres, specifically those derived from rye, which also contains arabinose [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the microbial core functions, also a core of the host functions could be detected. The most prominent biological activities found in the host core were proteinases and peptidases, indicative of high intestinal proteolytic activity or the high stability of these proteins, since only free amino acids and di- and tri-peptides are transmitted to the blood stream in the intestine. However, these proteinases and peptidases may also be acting on different routes and may possess signalling activities.</p><p>Other host core proteins included important functions such as the starch-degrading enzyme alpha-amylase (average 11.7%), the serpin alpha 1 antitrypsin (10%) and the hydrolase alkaline phosphatase (6.1%); these enzymes displayed differences not only between but also within the same individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153294.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Personalized and stable functional intestinal microbiome</title><p>We found that each adult contained a unique faecal metaproteome that was stable over the analysed period of six weeks. Therefore, compositional individuality was conserved at the functional level, suggesting that a distinctive set of microbes may be responsible for a specific distribution of functions. Further studies will be required to identify the factors involved. Most likely, host genes together with environmental factors (diet, drugs, hygiene setting) may prime the ecosystem to develop its individuality. The presence of a personalized functional microbiome was suspected based on peptide assignments and KO abundances. Thus, there seems to be a functional stable metaproteome and sequence differences (as detected at the peptide level) due to different microbial communities may not solely explain the clustering of the subjects. A comparison of the clustering at the oligonucleotide and peptide level could suggest that there is stronger individuality at the phylogenetic level in comparison to the metaproteomic data. However, this observation can be partly explained by the difference in the type of measurement and the subsequent difference in the applied distance measure (Jaccard similarity for peptide measurements versus Pearson&#x02019;s correlation for microarray data). The developed metaproteomics approach is an a-priori non-defined approach i.e. identified peptides depend on sample (and not each time the very same peptides in one protein get analysed) whereas the microarray is an a-priori defined approach: i.e. each sample is tested against a fixed set of oligonucleotides.</p><p>Individual differences in functions can be very important for the intestinal ecosystem such as the observed large variations in butyrate production or flagellin generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153294.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Notably, one subject (155) had low spectral counts for both butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and flagellin, both assigned to the Firmicutes. Higher gene counts for flagellar assembly in combination with a higher abundance of members of the phylum Firmicutes were found in a Russian cohort when compared to a Western cohort [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The authors concluded that differences in diet i.e. a higher consumption of resistant starch in rural Russian areas, might account for these results. Glucuronate isomerase was among the most abundant 25 functional classes and showed variance between the individuals in this study; an earlier study described that the gene for this enzyme was present in similar amounts but differed highly in its expression levels across individuals [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>We detected variations in the levels of an enzyme (sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase) involved in the anaerobic synthesis of vitamin B12. An accumulation of the genes involved in B12 cobalamin synthesis has been found in the intestinal microbiota of adults compared to infants [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our data suggest that there might be factors other than age influencing vitamin B12 synthesis.</p><p>The observed differences in sugar metabolism, such as the absence of xylose isomerase derived from Actinobacteria in some subjects, may point to a diet lacking the respective substrates. However, as we do not have dietary records of the study participants, causal explanations for the individual as well as temporal differences between the faecal metaproteomes cannot be provided.</p><p>We did not detect any obvious functional differences in the faecal metaproteome following the probiotic intervention as compared to the placebo. This is in line with our previous results from the same cohort i.e. the LGG intervention did not change the overall composition of the faecal microbiota; only the amount of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> (reflecting the ingested strain) differed significantly after the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. With LGG representing only up to 0.1% of the total faecal community in the post-intervention samples, it is not surprising that LGG-specific proteins were hardly detected. However, immunological differences between the two groups have been detected [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], evidence that the probiotic product did exert some effects. Rather than colon that represents the predominant source of faecal material, it is more likely that differential protein expression after LGG intake takes place in the ileum which is a region of the gut less densely populated with bacteria and a more active site of signaling. It remains possible that the changes at the protein level in the gut lumen (versus intra-mucosal) are too subtle to be measured with the MS approach used here: i.e. data dependent MS analysis. However, there was a trend that the ratio of bacterial/eukaryotic peptides was increased in the LGG group.</p><p>Previously, comparative studies on faecal metaproteomes have been conducted between healthy and diseased subjects. These kind of studies in which an intact and pathologically perturbed intestinal ecosystems have been compared to each other represent much more drastic phenotypic differences than present in our study and may explain the lack of clear differences observed in our cohort [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a comparison of the microbial profiles and metaproteomes of healthy and Crohn&#x02019;s Disease (CD) patients, CD patients could be distinguished from the healthy controls based on their 2-DE proteome profiles [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Human-bacterial interactions as assessed by metaproteomics</title><p>We were especially interested in intestinal proteins which could serve as a strong indication for the presence of host-microbiota crosstalk. Therefore, we correlated the spectral counts of human and bacteria derived KOs and identified several significant associations. These protein families included the pair of human derived receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 and the bacterial flagellar hook protein FlgE. This could be one example of a human-microbe interaction in the gut as the human kinase is involved in signalling to elicit an inflammatory response for which flagellins, via TLR5 signalling, could be the stimulus. Human alpha-amylase correlated significantly with the functional families of bacterial putative ABC transport system substrate-binding protein, propionate CoA-transferase, ATP-dependent Clp protease and cytidylate kinase. These correlations could reflect the interdependence regarding nutrient resorption and utilization between host and microbes. Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between the antimicrobial protein DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 protein) also termed SALSA and known to be present in large amounts in faeces already in early life [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and a bacterial, amino-peptidase (bleomycin hydrolase). This finding may point to a physical human-bacterial-protein interaction or to an indirect interaction as agglutination of some other molecule to DMBT1 may suppress the expression of the aminopeptidase.</p><p>In addition to the identified correlations, we observed relatively high levels of L-fucose isomerase. As fucose is a typical component of many O- and N-linked glycans produced by mammalian species rather than by plants, its use by the intestinal microbiota is a further indication for a mutualistic interaction between host and microbes. Recently, modulation of the fucosylation of mucus proteins was claimed to act as a physiological mechanism to provide the microbiota with substrates in case of disease [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and an absence of fucosyl transferase as is the case in non-secretor subjects, was associated with a distinctive intestinal microbiota composition with reduced levels of mucus-degrading bacteria, including <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here, we could not identify any association between the abundance of L-fucose isomerase and any specific microbial groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Activity of specific microbial groups</title><p>The rationale behind studying the metaproteome is that microbial composition and their gene content alone may not be sufficient to explain a certain phenotype. Therefore, we compared the metaproteomic data with the phylogenetic data generated from a microarray. In general, the observations based on the 16S rRNA gene and organism-origin of peptides were often in agreement. However, in some instances, this was not the case and this may reflect the level of biological activity of the specific microbial group. These detected differences between the microbial composition and protein-makeup add further evidence to earlier findings that phylogenetic profiles alone cannot reflect changes in the functions being expressed by the microbiome. In a study where metaproteomic profiles of healthy and CD patients were compared, differences in the amounts of certain proteins were observed although the abundance of corresponding species behaved in a different manner [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we found the amount of Firmicutes in our microarray data to be 1.2 times higher than that inferred from the metaproteomic data, even though the phylogenetic and proteomic measurements for the prominent representative species <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> were in good agreement. These findings could indicate that Firmicutes proteins may be under-represented in the protein sequence database, so that they get relatively less identified, but <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> is at least biologically as active as its presence would indicate. In our earlier study, the abundances for Firmicutes were the same but in contrast to the current findings we identified less Bacteroidetes at the peptide level than with the microarray [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The difference might be explained by the higher amount of samples. The ratios obtained for Bacteroidetes differ widely between studies partly due to different extraction efficiencies of the DNA extraction protocols being used [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The average relative abundance of 10% found here is at the lower end of the range reported for Bacteroidetes [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] but in the same range as in another Finnish cohort [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and in a Chinese cohort [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We cannot exclude the possibility that the &#x0201c;overrepresentation&#x0201d; of Bacteroidetes peptides may reflect their potential underrepresentation in the DNA preparations as in our earlier study where we found relatively less Bacteroidetes peptides compared to the microarray data a different DNA extraction method, i.e. repeated bead beating, was applied. However, as the fluctuations seen at the microarray level were not observed at the peptide level, it might well be that we detected an actual difference in presence and protein production in Bacteroidetes. On the other hand, the observation may also be explained by the fact that extensive DNA transfer has been found in Bacteroidales species leading to a homogenous gene content across species [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that may facilitate the identification of Bacteroidetes peptides in comparison to the more heterogeneous Firmicutes peptides. As the Bacteroidetes qPCR results corresponded well to the microarray measurements, a bias due to underrepresentation of certain taxa on the microarray seems unlikely.</p><p>The lower relative proportion of Verrucomicrobia in the MS/MS data versus 16S rRNA gene data may be due to an abundance issue, limiting the analysis of proteins of a phylum which contributed only around 1% to the overall microbiota. In an earlier study, we found a high number of Verrucomicrobia peptides but then also the measured DNA reads were well above 1% [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The peptide and qPCR results for Methanobrevibacter were also in good agreement with each other. The high correlation of the levels of 16S rRNA gene and protein measurement for Actinobacteria gave an indication for an association between the abundance and biological activity of corresponding taxa and also provided an assurance of the reliability of these measurements.</p><p>In summary, on one hand, our data allows us to conclude that proteomic data in general reflects phylogenetic composition but on the other hand, it highlights distinct activities and possibly to some extent, analytical bias such as cross-hybridisation and DNA extraction bias. Although today the taxonomic assignment of peptides is possible, due to the far from complete coverage in databases, the assignment is not perfect. Therefore, the technical and annotation issues noted here may explain the results to some extent; this is a limitation of all other meta-omics studies [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Human proteins in faecal samples&#x02014;relation to health</title><p>Specific human proteins in faeces have been used as markers for certain physiological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] but from a metaproteomic perspective, differences in gut-derived host proteins have not been studied extensively. Therefore, we also studied the variations in the proteins of the host as the applied approach identifies both microbial and eukaryotic peptides at the same time. We did not fractionate samples to yield a bacterial pellet, as that would selectively detect only those human proteins that are bound to bacterial cells [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Since changes of the host and microbiome proteome are being examined at the same time, in theory our approach makes it possible to investigate the mutualistic microbiome host relationship. Overall, the human KOs identified mostly involved in nutrient digestion and the immune response, a result in agreement with earlier metaproteomic studies [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. On average, alpha-amylase, alkaline phosphatase and alpha 1 antitrypsin were the three top human proteins although there were extensive variations between subjects and time points. All of these three proteins have been linked to intestinal or extra-intestinal physiological conditions and they may also be one factor contributing to the individuality of the microbiota as discussed below.</p><p>The levels of alpha-amylase may have an effect on the substrate availability for certain microbial species living in the intestine. Recently, alpha-amylase was suggested to stimulate the growth of vaginal <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] by breaking down glycogen. In contrast, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains from baby faeces have been found to exert inhibitory effects upon alpha-amylase and other carbohydrate hydrolases [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, differences in alpha-amylase levels may be reflections of different ecological niches favouring certain microbes. Alpha-amylase may also have a protective effect in the intestine in the same way as has been observed in the mouth where the enzyme inhibits the glucosyltransferase of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As observed in this study, the amounts of alpha-amylase have been found to vary with time but also to be consistently non-detectable in some individuals [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a study of patients with diarrhea-type irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), elevated levels of tryptic activity and amylase were found [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Possibly there are higher levels of amylase during and after diarrhea as the rapid transit of chyme might lead to a decreased (bacterial) degradation of this enzyme. The finding that individual 104 had high levels of alpha-amylase after an episode of diarrhea is support for that hypothesis. In addition, other factors, such as diet, may have a role, since high alpha-amylase levels were also observed in other individuals who did not report any intestinal symptoms.</p><p>Tryptic activity in faecal samples has been associated with intestinal disorders such as IBD [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In general, proteinases have been intensively studied in the context of IBD and IBS [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The alpha 1 antitrypsin identified here may be involved in regulating the proteinase activities and maintaining a balance of protein degradation in the intestine.</p><p>In faeces of mice fed a high fat diet, the levels of several mouse proteins such as alpha 1 antitrypsin were higher in parallel with less identified microbial proteins in comparison to mice consuming a carbohydrate diet [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, the same study also detected higher levels of chymotrypsin B and there was speculation that the proteinase inhibitors may act also through supplementary routes in addition to inhibiting proteinase activity. Therefore, the changes and differences in the human proteins observed here might be due to a certain diet on a specific day [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Alpha 1 antitrypsin has been associated with the treatment success of graft-vs.-host disease in GI transplantation in humans [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase is a versatile enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; in the gut it has been found to combat pathogen invasion into the intestinal epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In a mouse study, the presence of intestinal alkaline phosphatase promoted the growth of a variety of intestinal bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Variations between individuals in the levels of alkaline phosphatase have been detected previously [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; here very high levels in one individual were found, and high levels of alkaline phosphatase were mostly identified in those subjects who reported intestinal symptoms. Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase might be one way that compromised intestine attempts to restore equilibrium. It is tempting to speculate that the levels of this enzyme could be a marker of the &#x0201c;quality&#x0201d; (intact, perturbed or somewhere in-between) of the host-microbe interaction.</p><p>DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumor) was also one of the top 15 human KOs, its levels were quite abundant in most individuals. As this is a healthy cohort, this result is not unexpected since it has been hypothesized that this protein, which is involved in host defence mechanisms, is indicative of a healthy intestine [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Many of the human KOs identified here including alpha 1 antitrypsin, carboxypeptidase A1 and B, and alkaline phosphatase have been found previously to be equally abundant throughout the intestinal tract when proteins at the luminal interface were analysed [<xref rid="pone.0153294.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], reflecting their crucial roles in intestinal activity.</p><p>Our results suggest that although over time variations in human KOs may be due to pathology, diet and other environmental factors may also contribute to these variations. Inter-individual differences may be influenced by different genetic backgrounds, both human and microbial. It is evident that both human and bacterial proteins need to be studied to fully reveal the mechanisms in the complex ecosystem of the intestine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>By analysing the proteins from faecal samples of 16 healthy individuals at three measurement time points, the obtained metaproteome was found to contain a functional core but also to show variation across individuals and with time.

Very few studies have compared the composition of the microbiota and its actual functions being carried out, but there is growing evidence that accessing the composition alone is not enough.

This indicates that with a stable proportion of main functionalities, there is a &#x0201c;healthy balance&#x0201d;, e.g. in protein turnover and replication, in the intestinal ecosystem. Individual differences are more likely to be detected as one moves further down in the functional hierarchy.</p><p>This study is one step in the gradual exploration of the biological activity of our gut symbionts. However, before we have a fundamental understanding of the crucial mechanisms present in the intestine, it will be essential to clarify the functions of the many so far unidentified proteins. In addition, functional classification systems have to be optimized for the human microbiome. Overall, metaproteomics is still in its infancy and improvements, especially regarding analytical depth and data analysis, are needed (e.g. in assigning peptides to protein groups for quantitative comparisons) to fill in the large knowledge gaps which are an inherent limitation of functional meta-omic analyses.</p><p>The combination of phylogenetic and metaproteomic data helps to gain a better understanding of the intestinal microbiota. For example, it reveals which microbes are living in the intestine and how they contribute to the host&#x02019;s metabolism including signalling to other bacteria and signalling to the host. In the future, longitudinal studies will be required to clarify the normal flux both in composition and biological activity of our microbes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153294.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Rarefaction and core analysis of identified bacterial KOs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153294.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153294.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation of human and bacterial KOs (Spearman).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153294.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153294.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Hierarchical clustering of KO abundances.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153294.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153294.s004"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>This file contains S4 Fig Hierarchical clustering of oligoprofiles, S5 Fig Distribution of butyrate and propionate synthesis, S6 Fig Clustering of Pearson correlations of bacterial/eukaryotic assignment ratios, S7 Fig A) Distribution of the 5 most abundant phyla for 16S rRNA gene and spectra per sample.
