Serious AEs were followed until the event resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline, even in patients who had completed or discontinued the study. Investigators assessed AE severity (mild, moderate, severe), whether AEs and serious AEs were or were not related to study treatment, and whether an AE met the criteria for a serious AE based on guidance in the protocol (please see Table S1 in the supplementary material for details). A serious AE was an AE that resulted in hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or death, or in the opinion of the investigator was life-threatening. Medical history of rash, dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis was derived from a search of patients&#x02019; medical history obtained at enrollment.</p><p>An independent central dermatologist blinded to study treatment reviewed and provided assessments of clinically significant events and the overall pattern of cutaneous AEs to the study&#x02019;s data safety monitoring board.

The patient was treated with short tapers of betamethasone (maximum dose of 2.5&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mg [equivalent to 21&#x02013;42&#x000a0;mg of prednisone]) or betamethasone 0.5&#x000a0;mg (4-mg prednisone equivalent) before being hospitalized for a worsening rash. In the hospital, the patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and one course of plasma exchange consisting of one treatment. The event resolved. The blinded independent central dermatologist considered the event to more likely represent a grade 2 delayed-type hypersensitivity cutaneous reaction based on the available information. A broad search of the clinical database was conducted, and no additional cases were found that met the RegiSCAR criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] for DRESS based on medical review of the cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Adjudication by Blinded Dermatologist</title><p>Based on the evaluation of cutaneous AEs in DECIDE, the central dermatologist concluded that daclizumab HYP was associated with an increased risk of cutaneous AEs. The central dermatologist reviewed and provided assessments for all cutaneous AEs considered clinically significant by the investigators. Over the course of the study, the central dermatologist reviewed case reports for 42% (284/670) of all cutaneous AEs in the daclizumab HYP group and 28% (70/247) of all cutaneous AEs in the IM IFN beta-1a group. The overall subjective impression of the central dermatologist was that cutaneous AEs in DECIDE resembled eczematous or psoriasis-like events or were typical of skin conditions commonly encountered in a dermatology clinic. In addition, there were a small number of cases that were classified as delayed-type drug hypersensitivity, most of which were mild-to-moderate in severity. In the opinion of the blinded central dermatologist, there were no cases that represented life-threatening events. There were no reported cases of Stevens&#x02013;Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>In DECIDE, daclizumab HYP was associated with a higher risk of cutaneous AEs over 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years of treatment compared with IM IFN beta-1a in patients with RRMS. Relevant medical history of dermatological conditions exacerbated this risk to a similar degree in both treatment groups. Consistent with these observations, the incidence of cutaneous AEs was higher with daclizumab HYP 150 mg SC (18%) than placebo (13%) in the 1-year SELECT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cutaneous AEs reported here are distinct from injection site reactions, which are localized and temporally linked to the injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with these findings, a recent open-label, prospective study has demonstrated a high frequency of new-onset cutaneous events associated with daclizumab HYP administration in patients with RRMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The majority of cutaneous findings in this study were consistent both clinically and histologically with an eczematous dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In biopsies, cellular infiltrates in the epidermis and dermis consisted of abundant T cells, and immunohistochemistry revealed increased expression of CD56, highlighting either NK cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells amongst them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The authors suggested that cutaneous events represent pharmacologic (mechanistic) immune modulation by daclizumab HYP, rather than typical drug hypersensitivity-type reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A previous chart review study identified a case of alopecia following the development of a severe exfoliative rash in a patient treated with intravenous daclizumab (Zenapax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both the rash and alopecia resolved following discontinuation of daclizumab and corticosteroid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the DECIDE study, alopecia was reported in 16 (2%) patients in the daclizumab HYP group (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All of these cases of alopecia were mild or moderate in severity; no cases of severe alopecia were reported (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>A strength of DECIDE was the inclusion of a blinded central dermatologist, which allowed for accurate monitoring and assessment of cutaneous AEs. One limitation of this study was that very few biopsies were performed on cutaneous lesions. Results from biopsies may have provided valuable information to better understand the nature of the cutaneous AEs. In addition, photographs of cutaneous AEs were limited in number and some were of insufficient quality to be useful. Interpretation of the rates of resolution of cutaneous AEs in both treatment groups may be limited by the background rate of chronic dermatologic conditions known to occur in both the general population and in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and by incomplete data in patients who withdrew from the study with an ongoing non-serious AE. Because investigators were provided with cutaneous event guidelines and were made aware of this type of AE, a higher treatment rate with corticosteroids may have resulted from the distribution of these guidelines.</p><p>The potential link between the underlying mechanisms of daclizumab HYP and cutaneous AEs is unclear. Skin-resident regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells may counteract inflammatory T cell responses, and alterations in T<sub>reg</sub> cell function in the skin have been observed in psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CD25 blockade results in both expansion of CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and reversible declines in the number of circulating T<sub>reg</sub> cells in patients with RRMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. T<sub>reg</sub> cells remaining in circulation during CD25 blockade appeared to preserve the T<sub>reg</sub> phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], although reductions in suppressive capacity have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As such, the relationship between reductions in T<sub>reg</sub> cells and cutaneous AEs during CD25 blockade is currently inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additional work is required to determine whether compartmental differences exist in the maintenance of organ-specific self-tolerance by T<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Early recognition and treatment of inflammatory skin conditions offers the best chance for reversing or limiting flares of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Dermatologic treatment guidelines recommend topical agents, including moisturizers and topical corticosteroids, for psoriasis and eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moisturizers maintain skin hydration and can reduce itching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Topical corticosteroids are recommended to decrease inflammation, and numerous formulations are available that range in relative potency (see Table S2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Higher-potency topical corticosteroids are generally recommended as the initial therapy for acute flares on most body parts in adults, and lower-potency agents for maintenance therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Topical treatments, including corticosteroids, are also recommended for use with systemic treatments in more extensive eczema or psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Systemic corticosteroids are only recommended for acute severe exacerbations of eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and are generally contraindicated in psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The overall pattern of corticosteroid treatment for cutaneous AEs in DECIDE was generally consistent with these treatment guidelines, wherein topical corticosteroids were more frequently used for mild and moderate cutaneous AEs and systemic corticosteroids for severe or serious events.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Dermatologic Perspectives of Daclizumab HYP-Related Cutaneous AEs</title><p>For the range of cutaneous AEs observed in both treatment groups in DECIDE, one must have an understanding of the overall frequency of skin diseases across world populations and the function of skin as an immunologic organ in both health and disease. Surveys have shown that eight of the most common medical problems in humans are skin conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], including eczema, which was a frequent investigator-reported diagnosis in DECIDE. Atopic eczema is also a common skin condition in up to 30% of children, where the majority outgrow eczema by early adulthood but there is also an increasing frequency of adult-onset atopic eczema across world populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Hence, one perspective is that a large range of common skin conditions are also seen in the DECIDE study population. Within the spectrum of cutaneous AEs in DECIDE, there was a large representation of eczema and eczema-spectrum conditions (i.e., allergic dermatitis, eczema, nummular dermatitis, and hand dermatitis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which may be classified as inflammatory skin diseases. Among patients with cutaneous AEs, more than one-third (133/344 [39%]) had investigator-reported AEs coded to the MedDRA High Level Term dermatitis and eczema (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although eczematous events are a nuisance, they typically tend to be reversible and do not result in skin damage or organ failure even if present for extended periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Chronic rashes are likely driven by the interplay between genetic predisposition, immune response, and environmental factors (e.g., tendency for re-emergence of eczema in humans) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Importantly, daclizumab HYP did not lead to cutaneous AEs that resulted in loss of skin structure or function. Most cutaneous AEs during daclizumab HYP treatment were not allergic reactions. However, a small number of drug-type hypersensitivity reactions were identified; these reactions need to be distinguished from inflammatory diseases, as it may be necessary to discontinue drugs that drive drug-type hypersensitivity reactions. Overall, early diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous AEs following established dermatologic management guidelines offer the best opportunity for resolution.</p><p>We speculate that many of the inflammatory skin conditions noted in DECIDE relate mechanistically to the function of skin as an immune organ and to mechanistic effects on T<sub>reg</sub> cells or other regulatory immune mechanisms. Skin contains resident dendritic antigen-presenting cells and skin-homing resident memory T cells; therefore, immune reactions confined only to the skin are possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The range of commonly encountered skin diseases, such as atopic eczema and psoriasis, represent excessive activation of T cells in the skin, and skin inflammation is produced by effects of T cell-derived cytokines on resident skin cells, in part enabled by the reduced function of T<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Targeted removal of cutaneous T<sub>reg</sub> cells in model systems produces skin inflammation and excess production of cytokines that typify atopic eczema and related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, the decrease in T<sub>reg</sub> cells noted in circulating T cells during daclizumab HYP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] may well extend to diminished function of these cells with the cutaneous compartment, leading to unmasking or activation of resident T cell populations that mediate psoriasis or eczema-spectrum conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, cutaneous AEs in daclizumab HYP-treated patients were predominantly mild-to-moderate in severity, treated with topical corticosteroids or did not require treatment with a corticosteroid, and resolved. More severe or serious cutaneous AEs frequently required treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Some patients received multiple courses of corticosteroids when the cutaneous AE was of longer duration. Most importantly, the cutaneous AEs observed with daclizumab HYP were manageable with standard interventions and, even in the smaller number of serious cases, did not lead to any life-threatening conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
