However, most US residency training programs outside primary care do not include formal communication training in their curricula (<xref rid="bibr2-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, the methods and tools used to assess the effectiveness of formal communication training for medical house staff that an institution may choose to implement are heterogeneous at best, with little consensus among educators (<xref rid="bibr3-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Despite the increasing importance of these patient experience surveys and emerging evidence that implementing communication training for attending physicians may improve patient experience scores (<xref rid="bibr7-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), few studies have examined the impact that formal communication training for house staff may have on responses to standard experience surveys completed by patients who have received care directly from teaching services and clinics. We thus conducted a study with the primary aim to examine the direct impact that a communication training program, specifically for house staff&#x02014;based on a previously published, widely accepted 5-step strategy for opening patient-centered interviews (<xref rid="bibr8-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)&#x02014;would have on the patient experience in resident clinic, as formally assessed by questions pertinent to physician communication from the Clinician and Group CAHPS (CG-CAHPS) Adult Visit survey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2374373517694533"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-2374373517694533"><title>Overview</title><p>We conducted a prospective preintervention and postintervention study in which each member of the house staff within the departments of neurology, neurosurgery, and urology at a single US academic medical center participated in an intensive, small-group educational session led by a trained faculty preceptor that reviewed a previously published 5-step strategy for opening patient-centered medical interviews. All resident training sessions occurred within February and May 2014. House staff completed posttraining questionnaires. For the preintervention and postintervention comparison, patient experience surveys based on physician communication questions from the CG-CAHPS Adult Visit 2.0 survey were collected from consecutive adult patients seen in the resident-staffed clinics of these 3 hospital departments, both 1 month prior to the initiation of the training (January 2014) and 1 month after all house staff had completed the training (June 2014).</p></sec><sec id="section4-2374373517694533"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This work was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).

The scheduled small-group sessions themselves were each 2 hours and consisted of (1) a didactic lecture from the faculty preceptor on the importance of communication and details of the 5-step method for opening interviews, (2) a viewing of the aforementioned AACH video, with opportunity for group feedback, and (3) 90 minutes of structured role-playing exercises, where each participant in the small group practiced the 5-step strategy with constructive feedback from his or her peers and preceptor.</p><p>Role-playing is a widely accepted effective method for communication skills training in clinical medicine (<xref rid="bibr4-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For our role-playing exercises, we developed case scenarios specific to our participating hospital departments, with each scenario providing instructions for 1 resident who was assuming the role of the &#x0201c;doctor&#x0201d; in the role play and another resident playing the role of the &#x0201c;patient.&#x0201d; Doctors were instructed to open medical interviews with the 5-step method, whereas patients were given specific instructions on information that could be disclosed during open-ended questions from the doctors. For any given scenario, the resident who was neither the doctor nor the patient was given a checklist with key components of the 5-step strategy to assess, as a guide to give feedback along with the preceptor after each role-play scenario was completed. Several scenarios were created for each department, so that after each scenario, the participating residents in a small group could rotate roles for a new scenario, and each participant would ideally have a chance to experience each role (ie, doctor, patient, and evaluator). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2374373517694533">Figure 2</xref> shows excerpts from instructions given to a doctor and a patient for an example clinical neuroscience scenario.</p><fig id="fig2-2374373517694533" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A sample case from the role-playing exercises that house staff participated during the study.

Inherent differences in the preintervention and postintervention patient cohorts did not appear to play a role in this finding, as the 2 groups were well matched with regard to demographics. Although top-box responses from our patients who took the patient experience survey preintervention were higher than what had been projected during study design&#x02014;with nearly all percentages higher than 90%&#x02014;comparison of the scores with normative data from the national US CG-CAHPS database nevertheless argued against an unsurmountable ceiling effect in our data and suggested that there was room for improvement in our house staff clinic patient experience performance, in which a future effective training initiative could potentially play a role. Of note, the vast majority of residents participating in the training did indicate on a simple posttraining questionnaire that the role-playing educational activity that we had designed did increase their perception of the highlighted patient-centered communication strategy.</p><p>We selected CG-CAHPS questions related to doctor communication as our outcome instrument for this study because of the reality in the United States that the CG-CAHPS survey will likely soon become a required outcome measure for most outpatient practices receiving government reimbursements (<xref rid="bibr14-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

Whether the CG-CAHPS questions are indeed the appropriate outcome measure for assessing the impact of house staff&#x02019;s use of a step-by-step protocol for opening medical interviews is debatable (<xref rid="bibr4-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, given the now ubiquitous nature of the CAHPS surveys in the United States, understanding how communication training may or may not impact CAHPS scores in house staff clinics and other teaching services will likely be important moving forward (<xref rid="bibr2-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) with other measures for assessing the value of training initiatives and giving direct feedback to trainees on communication skills being collected in parallel (<xref rid="bibr15-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

First, as with many studies of medical education initiatives, it was conducted at a single center with a pre&#x02013;post study design; it did not include a control group. Although we note that our preintervention and postintervention groups were matched with regard to basic patient demographics, it is possible that other changes between the preintervention and postintervention periods could have impacted the results. However, we note that the residents staffing our clinics in the study were the same group both before and after the educational initiative, without any turnover in the participating house staff during the study period.</p><p>Second, our training initiative largely consisted of a single 2-hour role-playing session for each resident, supplemented by some take-home materials. Despite (1) the structured nature of each session, (2) the adoption of a widely accepted communication strategy, (3) our formal training of preceptors, and (4) our role-playing activities that were designed to be department specific, a 2-hour time period for a postgraduate educational activity may be relatively brief. We do note that (1) we had an excellent participation rate among the residents in our 3 participating departments and (2) all residents signed a &#x0201c;Commitment to Change&#x0201d; form at the end of their session, with an explicit promise to carry their skills learned during the session forward in daily practice. Nevertheless, residents were not directly observed during the postintervention period to confirm they were using the 5-step strategy in actual patient encounters nor was long-term follow-up survey data regarding the utility of the strategy obtained from our participating residents.</p><p>Third, our 1-month data collection periods both before and after all residents had participated in the training session turned out to be short, especially since our initial power calculation was based on much lower projected preintervention top-box CG-CAHPS scores. To detect a rise in our baseline, CG-CAHPS scores would likely have taken either an intervention with a large effect size or a much larger sample of patients. We propose that such studies with larger samples of patients are worthwhile in the future though, at the very least given that large increases in a hospital&#x02019;s CAHPS percentile score can occur with relatively subtle improvements in patients&#x02019; top-box response percentages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section20-2374373517694533"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that communication training for house staff focused on using role-playing exercises to practice patient-centered strategies for opening medical interviews can increase residents&#x02019; perception of such strategies but that demonstrating skills transfer and improvement in patient-centered outcomes after implementing such communication training for residents remains challenging (<xref rid="bibr19-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). High percentages of top-box responses from patients on survey items from the US CG-CAHPS may translate to a wide variation in percentile scores for those items, a fact that may point to room for practice improvement that may not be initially obvious. However, future studies of communication training initiatives geared toward residents and their impact on patient experience surveys may need to take into account the possibility of a ceiling effect among the raw survey scores when determining the sample size necessary to power their analyses adequately.</p><sec id="section21-2374373517694533"><title>Practice and Research Implications</title><p>We would recommend that future communication training programs geared specifically toward improving patient-centered outcomes via house staff communication training include a longitudinal series of educational sessions for each participant, as opposed to 1 single role-playing activity. Direct observation of residents in real-life clinical encounters, after participation in formal training, with immediate feedback from trained coaches may help ensure that the strategies learned during training remain in place moving forward (<xref rid="bibr3-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Future formal studies using the CG-CAHPS as an outcome tool should ideally include more participants to detect improvements in subtle effect size, which may nevertheless be meaningful.</p><p>Finally, so many of the communication habits and techniques that house staff may learn may be from the &#x0201c;hidden curriculum&#x0201d; of residency&#x02014;the habits which the residents observe from their attendings and peers&#x02014;and the possible emphasis during training on biomedical science over interpersonal communication (<xref rid="bibr25-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As emerging studies have shown the possible effectiveness of communication training for attendings in improving patient experience scores (<xref rid="bibr7-2374373517694533" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), an effort to train an institution&#x02019;s physician leaders at the same time or prior to the implementation of an educational initiative for trainees may be a future fruitful strategy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2374373517694533"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> All authors contributed to study conception and manuscript revisions and approved the final version of the submitted article.
