and Drug Administration (approval number: 2006L01603).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims</title><p>Compare the treatment efficacy and safety of generic duloxetine to that of paroxetine in patients with
major depressive disorders (MDD).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-dummy, double-blind, multicenter, positive drug (paroxetine), parallel
randomized controlled clinical trial. The 299 patients with MDD recruited for the study were randomly
assigned to use duloxetine (n=149; 40&#x02013;60 mg/d) or paroxetine (n=150; 20 mg/d) for 8 weeks. The Hamilton
Depression rating scale (HAMD-17) was administered at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after starting
treatment. Remission was defined as a HAMD-17 score below 8 at the end of the trial, and treatment
effectiveness was defined as a decrease in baseline HAMD-17 score of at least 50% by the end of the trial.
Safety was assessed based on the reported prevalence and severity of side effects and changes in laboratory
and electrocardiographic findings. Three patients in the duloxetine group dropped out before starting
medication, so results were analyzed using a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) method with 146 in the
experimental group and 150 in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>Both groups experienced 29 dropouts during the 8-week trial. HAMD-17 scores decreased
significantly from baseline throughout the trial in both groups. Based on the ITT analysis, at the end of
the trial there was no significant difference between the duloxetine group and the paroxetine group in
effectiveness (67.1% v. 71.3%, X<sup>2</sup>=0.62 p=0.433), remission rate (41.1% v. 51.3%, X<sup>2</sup>=3.12, p=0.077), or in
the incidence of side effects (56.8% v. 54.7%, X<sup>2</sup>=0.14, p=0.705). </p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Generic duloxetine is as effective and safe as paroxetine in the acute treatment of patients
with MDD who seek care at psychiatric outpatient departments in China.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="zh"><sec><title>&#x080cc;&#x0666f;</title><p>&#x0672c;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x0662f;&#x07ecf;&#x056fd;&#x05bb6;&#x098df;&#x054c1;&#x0836f;&#x054c1;&#x076d1;&#x07763;&#x07ba1;&#x07406;&#x0603b;&#x05c40;&#x06279;&#x051c6;&#x07684;&#x04eff;&#x05236;&#x05ea6;&#x06d1b;&#x0897f;&#x06c40;&#x06ce8;&#x0518c;&#x0524d;&#x08bd5;&#x09a8c;&#x0ff08;&#x06279;&#x051c6;&#x053f7;&#x0ff1a;2006L01603&#x0ff09;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x076ee;&#x07684;</title><p>&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x04eff;&#x05236;&#x05ea6;&#x06d1b;&#x0897f;&#x06c40;&#x0548c;&#x05e15;&#x07f57;&#x0897f;&#x06c40;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x07684;&#x07597;&#x06548;&#x0548c;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x065b9;&#x06cd5;</title><p>&#x08fd9;&#x0662f;&#x04e00;&#x09879;&#x053cc;&#x076f2;&#x053cc;&#x05b89;&#x06170;&#x05242; (double dummy)&#x03001;&#x0591a;&#x04e2d;&#x05fc3;&#x03001;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x0836f;&#x07269;&#x0ff08;&#x05e15;&#x07f57;&#x0897f;&#x06c40;&#x0ff09;&#x05e73;&#x0884c;&#x0968f;&#x0673a;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x04e34;&#x05e8a;&#x08bd5;&#x09a8c;&#x03002;&#x05c06;&#x07eb3;&#x05165;&#x07684;299 &#x04f8b;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x075c7;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x0968f;&#x0673a;&#x05206;&#x07ec4;&#x0ff0c;&#x04f7f;&#x07528;&#x05ea6;&#x06d1b;&#x0897f;&#x06c40; (n=149; 40-60 mg/d) &#x06216;&#x05e15;&#x07f57;&#x0897f;&#x06c40; (n=150; 20 mg/d) &#x08fde;&#x07eed;&#x06cbb;&#x07597; 8 &#x05468;&#x03002;&#x05728;&#x057fa;&#x07ebf;&#x0548c;&#x05f00;&#x059cb;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x0540e;&#x07684;&#x07b2c; 1&#x03001;2&#x03001;4&#x03001;6 &#x0548c;8&#x05468;&#x04f7f;&#x07528;&#x06c49;&#x05bc6;&#x05c14;&#x0987f;&#x06291;&#x090c1;&#x091cf;&#x08868;(Hamilton Depression rating scale, HAMD-17) &#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x03002;&#x07f13;&#x089e3;&#x07684;&#x05b9a;&#x04e49;&#x04e3a;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec8;&#x070b9; HAMD-17&#x08bc4;&#x05206;&#x04f4e;&#x04e8e;8&#x05206;&#x0ff0c;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x06709;&#x06548;&#x07684;&#x05b9a;&#x04e49;&#x04e3a;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec8;&#x070b9;HAMD-17&#x05f97;&#x05206;&#x08f83;&#x057fa;&#x07ebf;&#x081f3;&#x05c11;&#x0964d;&#x04f4e;&#x04e86;50%&#x03002;&#x06839;&#x0636e;&#x062a5;&#x0544a;&#x07684;&#x04e0d;&#x0826f;&#x053cd;&#x05e94;&#x07684;&#x053d1;&#x0751f;&#x07387;&#x03001;&#x04e25;&#x091cd;&#x07a0b;&#x05ea6;&#x04ee5;&#x053ca;&#x05b9e;&#x09a8c;&#x05ba4;&#x068c0;&#x067e5;&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;&#x03001;&#x05fc3;&#x07535;&#x056fe;&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;&#x07684;&#x053d8;&#x05316;&#x06765;&#x08bc4;&#x04f30;&#x05b89;&#x05168;&#x06027;&#x03002;&#x05ea6;&#x06d1b;&#x0897f;&#x06c40;&#x07ec4;&#x04e2d;&#x06709;&#x04e09;&#x04f8b;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x05728;&#x05f00;&#x059cb;&#x07528;&#x0836f;&#x0524d;&#x09000;&#x051fa;&#x0ff0c;&#x091c7;&#x07528;&#x04fee;&#x06b63;&#x07684;&#x0610f;&#x05411;&#x06cbb;&#x07597;&#x05206;&#x06790; (intention-to-treat, ITT) &#x065b9;&#x06cd5;&#x04ee5;&#x06bd4;&#x08f83;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ec4; 146 &#x04f8b;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x0548c;&#x05bf9;&#x07167;&#x07ec4;150&#x04f8b;&#x060a3;&#x08005;&#x07684;&#x07814;&#x07a76;&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;&#x03002;</p></sec><sec><title>&#x07ed3;&#x0679c;</title><p>

Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that is a
common cause of suicide.[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to data from the
2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study,[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] mental
and substance use disorders were the leading cause
of years lived with disability (YLDs) and depressive
disorders were the most important type of mental
disorder, accounting for 40.5% (confidence interval, 
31.7-49.2%) of the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
caused by mental and substance use disorders. The
World Health Organization predicts that depressive
disorders will soon account for 15% of worldwide
disease burden, making it the second most important
cause of ill health after cardiac diseases.[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Depressive
disorders are important in both high-income countries
and in low- and middle-income countries; in China the
prevalence of MDD among adults 18 and older is 6%.[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] </p><p>The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression (STAR*D) study[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that MDD is often
chronic, severe, and associated with substantial general
medical and psychiatric comorbidity; moreover, the
remission rate is low-only 33%-when treated with
a single antidepressant medication. Pharmacotherapy
can, nevertheless, relieve the symptoms of depression
and improve the quality of life of depressed patients.
Timely and appropriate therapy may increase the clinical
cure rate and reduce the disease burden.</p><p>Duloxetine is a new anti-depressant drug that
selectively inhibits the uptake of serotonin (5-HT) and
norepinephrine (NE) by neurons from the synaptic
gap, thereby increasing the synaptic pool of available
neurotransmitters and, thus, relieving depressive
symptoms.[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In vivo and in vitro studies have shown
that duloxetine is an effective and balanced inhibitor
of 5-HT and NE uptake that has little effect on other
neurotransmitter receptors (such as M, a1, a2, dopamine
D2, and histamine H1 and H2 receptors).[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Clinically it
has been shown to be effective in both the short-term
and long-term treatment of adults with major depressive
disorder (MDD),[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] comparable in efficacy to selective
5-HT reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, 
citalopram, and sertraline.[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Duloxetine has also been
reported to be effective in the treatment of generalized
anxiety disorder[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and fibromyalgia.[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] </p><p>This paper reports on a pre-registration trial of
generic duloxetine (manufactured by Jiangsu Nhwa
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in China) which was approved
by the China Food and Drug Administration (approval
number: 2006L01603). In this trial we use paroxetine as
the active comparator drug because it is a widely used
first-line treatment for MDD with proven efficacy and
safety that is often used as a positive</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s7a"><label>2.1</label><title>Sample</title><p>
The enrollment process is shown in Figure 1. Psychiatric
outpatients with MDD treated at eight outpatient psychiatric centers in China from September 2009 to
September 2010 were enrolled in the study. The study
sites included the Shanghai Mental Health Center (which
coordinated the study), the Affiliated Beijing Anding

Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University, 
the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University, 
the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College, 
and the Mental Health Center of Hebei Province. In total
299 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study:
current MDD as diagnosed using the Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria;[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] aged 18-65
years; 17-item Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD-17) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] score of 20 or above with the depressed mood

parallel-group, positive drug (paroxetine), 
multi-centered clinical trial. The goal was to determine
whether or not generic duloxetine was similar in
effectiveness and safety to paroxetine in the treatment
of MDD&#x02014;that is, it is a &#x02018;non-inferiority&#x02019; trial. The
required sample size was estimated using standard
methods for test of non-inferiority. Based on published
data,[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the total HAMD-17 score in patients with MDD
drop an average of 13.5 points after 8 eight weeks of
treatment with paroxetine. Based on a &#x003b4; of 2.2 (the
standard for non-inferiority trials), a type I error (&#x003b1;)
of 0.025, a type II error (&#x003b2;) of 0.20, and a combined
standard deviation (S) of 6, the estimated sample
size required for each group was 117. Taking into consideration potential dropouts during the study, we
set the target sample size at 300 subjects, 150 in each
group.</p><p>
Recruited outpatients were randomized to treatment
with duloxetine or paroxetine using a computerized
random number generator. The Jiangsu Nhwa
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. provided the medications used in
the study: enteric-coated duloxetine hydrochloride tablets
(20 mg/tablet; 20090401; Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd.),and paroxetine hydrochloride tablets (Seroxat;
20 mg/tablet; Glaxo Smith Kline Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd.). In the duloxetine group,patients were treated
each morning with duloxetine (40 mg/d; 2 tablets) and
paroxetine placebo (1 tablet) during week one,and
with duloxetine (60 mg/d; 3 tablets) and paroxetine
placebo (1 tablet) from week two to week eight. In
the paroxetine (control) group,patients were treated
each morning with paroxetine (20 mg/d; 1 tablet) and
duloxetine placebo (2 tablets) during week one,and
with paroxetine (20 mg/d; 1 tablet) and duloxetine
placebo (3 tablets) from week two to week eight.</p><p>
During the study, drugs used at conventional doses
for the treatment of insomnia (zolpidem, zopiclone, 
zaleplon) and drugs used for controlling physical
diseases were allowed. The dose of each allowed
drug and the duration of treatment with these drugs
were recorded in detail. However, antipsychotics, 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, anti-manic drugs, systemic
psychotherapy (such as cognitive and behavioral
therapy), and modified electroconvulsive therapy were
not allowed.</p><p>Patients were withdrawn or dropped out of the trial
if they experienced intolerable side effects, violated the
study protocol (i.e., met any of the exclusion criteria
listed above), withdrew consent, or were lost to follow up.</p><p>
The investigators were all experienced clinicians;
3-5 clinical psychiatrists and one medication coordinator
(who maintained the randomization results and
distributed medications) participated at each of the
8 study sites. Before the trial, participating clinicians
were trained in the diagnosis of MDD using DSM-IV criteria and in the methods of rating the HAMD-17, 
the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS), the severity measure of the Clinical Global
Impression Scale (CGI-S), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale
(HAMA), the Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI), 
and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).</p></sec><sec id="s7c"><label>2.3</label><title>Evaluation of treatment efficacy and safety</title><p>
The HAMD-17 was assessed at baseline and at the end
of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> week of treatment. At each
of these clinical visits the treating clinician also asked
patients about the occurrence of any adverse events.
The total HAMD-17 score after eight weeks of treatment
and the difference between the HAMD-17 score at
baseline and after eight weeks of treatment were used
as the primary measures of therapeutic efficacy. Clinical
remission was defined as a HAMD-17 score of &#x02264;7 by
the end of the trial. Effectiveness was defined as a
decrease of at least 50% in the baseline HAMD-17 score
at the end of the trial. The total scores, differences in
scores, effectiveness, and clinical remission rates were
compared between the two groups.</p><p>
A variety of secondary measures of efficacy were
also assessed at baseline and at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> week of treatment: the Montgomery
and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the
severity measure of the Clinical Global Impression scale
(CGI-S), the Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAMA), the Visual
Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VAS-PI), and the Sheehan
Disability Scale (SDS).[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] </p><p>
The following examinations were completed
at baseline, at the end of the 8-week trial, and, 
additionally, at any time during the trial the treating
clinician considered such tests necessary: routine blood
tests; blood biochemistry to determine liver function, 
kidney function, and fasting blood glucose; routine
urinalysis; a urine pregnancy test (women only); and a
12-lead electrocardiographic examination.</p><p>
Treatment adherence was assessed by determining
the proportion of prescribed medication that was actually
taken (as reported by the patient); if 80% or greater of
the prescribed medication was taken, adherence was
considered &#x02018;good&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s7d"><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
An electronic data management system was used for
data management; data entry clerks input trial data
into an electronic case report form (eCRF) specifically
designed for this study. SAS version 9.1.3 was used for
statistical analysis. The primary analysis was a modified
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which excluded three
patients that were randomized to the duloxetine group
but never started medication and, thus, included 146
patients in the duloxetine group and 150 patients in
the paroxetine group. In both groups, 29 patients who
started medications dropped out during the 8-week
trial (see Figure 1); a &#x02018;last observation carried forward&#x02019;
(LOCF) method was used to include their results in the ITT analysis. A secondary &#x02018;per protocol set&#x02019; (PPS)
analysis of the 117 duloxetine group patients and 121
paroxetine group patients who completed the 8-week
trial was also conducted.</p><p>
Differences between groups in baseline and final
HAMD-17 scores and in the magnitude of the change
in HAMD-17 scores over the trial were assessed using
t-tests. Between group comparison of baseline, final, 
and change scores for the other five clinical measures
(MADRS, HAMA, VAS-PI, CGI-S, SDS) also used t-tests.
Within group changes over time were assessed using
paired t-tests. Differences between groups in the
proportion of individuals that experienced remission, 
effective treatment, and side-effects were compared
using Chi-square tests and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. The trend
of change over the 8-week trial in the HAMD-17 score
between the groups was assessed using a repeated
measures analysis of variance. All tests were two-tailed
and statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>
The protocol for this study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Mental Health Center.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><label>3.</label><title>Results</title><p>
The baseline characteristics of enrolled patients who
started the trial medications are shown in Table 1.
About half of the participants were experiencing their
first episode of depression. On average the current
episode of depression had lasted more than 6 months.
Compared to the patients in the paroxetine group,
those in the duloxetine group were more likely to be
female, were somewhat shorter in stature, and had a
significantly higher pain index score on the VAS-PI.</p><table-wrap id="Table1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of patients in the two groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="text-align:center; "><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">duloxetine group<break/>(n=146)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">paroxetine group<break/>(n=150)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">statistic</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (sd) age</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.4 (12.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.5 (11.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.428</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">94 (64.4%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79 (52.7%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X<sup>2</sup>=4.18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.041</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Han ethnicity, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">146 (100.0%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">147 (98.0%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X<sup>2</sup>=0<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.248</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean body weight in Kg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7 (9.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0 (9.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.830</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean height in cm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.5 (7.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.3 (8.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=2.03</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.043</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prior episode of depression, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77 (52.7%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76 (50.7%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X<sup>2</sup>=1.15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.564</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Psychosocial precipitant of current episode, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">95 (65.1%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77 (51.3%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">X<sup>2</sup>=11.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.025</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean months of current course</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 (13.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3 (10.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.32<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.580</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean months total illness</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.4 (53.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.7 (42.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.35<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.552</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.7 (3.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.8 (3.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.596</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1 (5.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.8 (5.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.43</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.669</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.4 (5.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.4 (5.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.01</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.994</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Visual Analogue Scale--pain index score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.1 (24.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.5 (19.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=3.33</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>&#x0003c;0.001</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Clinical Global Impression -- severity score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5 (0.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.4 (0.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=0.08</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.937</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Sheehan Disability Scale score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.3 (5.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.3 (5.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic>=1.53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.128</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>a</sup> Fisher&#x02019;s exact test</p><p><sup>b</sup> Wilcoxson rank test</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>

enrolled in the duloxetine group who started medication
and 80.7% (121/150) of patients enrolled in the
paroxetine group who started medication completed
the 8-week trial. A total of 29 patients dropped out

clinicians withdrew 6 patients because of troubling side
effects (somnolence, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, 
abnormal transaminase, psychotic symptoms, and
numbness in the occiput) and 2 patients due to lack
of effectiveness. In the paroxetine group clinicians
withdrew 6 patients due to troubling side effects
(fidgeting, agitation, allergy, abnormal liver function, 
nausea, and hyperhidrosis) and 3 due to lack of
effectiveness.</p><sec id="s8a"><label>3.1</label><title>Treatment efficacy</title><p>
As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, based on the modified

from baseline over the course of therapy in both groups.
There were no significant differences in the magnitude
of the change in HAMD-17 from baseline between the

Based on the ITT analysis, 67.1% (98/146) of the
patients in the duloxetine group were effectively treated
(i.e., drop in baseline HAMD-17 of &#x02265;50%) compared
to 71.3% (107/150) in the paroxetine group (X<sup>2</sup>=0.62, 
p=0.433). Using a final HAMD-17 score of 7 or lower
as the criteria for &#x02018;remission&#x02019;, 41.1% (60/146) of the
patients in the duloxetine group and 51.3% (77/150) of
the patients in the paroxetine group achieved remission
(X<sup>2</sup>=3.12, p=0.077). Using the per protocol set (PPS)

were 49.6% (58/117) versus 61.2% (74/121) (X<sup>2</sup>=3.23, 
p=0.072).</p><p>
Based on the ITT analysis, the secondary clinical
measures all showed significant improvement over
the 8-week trial and, as was the case for the HAMD-17 score, there was no significant difference in the
magnitude of the change in scores between the two
treatment groups. For the duloxetine and paroxetine
groups, the mean (sd) decreases in baseline scores
after 8 weeks of treatment were as follows: MADRS, 
21.8 (7.8) versus 20.7 (8.6), t=1.02, p=0.311; HAMA, 
12.5 (5.7) versus 12.2 (6.2), t=0.32, p=0.749; CGI-S, 2.49

(6.5) versus 13.5 (7.1), t=0.65, p=0.515.</p><p>
There was no significant between-group difference
in the number patients using other drugs (mainly
hypnotics such as zolpidem and drugs used to treat
other diseases): 36 patients in the duloxetine group
(24.7%] and 41 patients (27.3%]) in the paroxetine
group used non-study medications (X<sup>2</sup>=0.23, p=0.600). The proportion of patients in each group with good
adherence (i.e., took 80% or more of prescribed
medication) was 77.4% in the duloxetine group and
79.3% in the paroxetine group (X<sup>2</sup>=0.16, p=0.686).</p></sec><sec id="s8b"><label>3.2</label><title>Safety</title><p>
The incidence of the common adverse effects that
occurred in 1% or more of the patients is listed in Table
3. The most common adverse events were nausea, dry
month, constipation, loss of appetite, and dizziness.
With few exceptions (that, as described above, resulted
in withdrawal from the study) these adverse events
were mild to moderate, of short duration, and resolved
without any specific management. Overall, 83 of the
146 patients in the duloxetine group (56.8%) and 82
of the 150 patients in the paroxetine group (54.7%)
experienced 1 or more adverse events at some point
over the 8-week trial (X<sup>2</sup>=0.14, p=0.705). None in the

The present study is a registered, multi-centered, 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, positive
drug, parallel, and controlled clinical trial. This study
aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of entericcoated
generic duloxetine produced by Jiangsu Nhwa
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in China for the acute treatment
of major depressive disorders in Chinese patients. Noninferiority
analysis was used to compare the mean
change from baseline to week eight of therapy between
duloxetine and paroxetine. Using a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the HAMD-17 score reduction was
found to be 13.5 (8.0) and 14.1 (8.3) in the duloxetine
and paroxetine groups, respectively. The repeated
measures ANOVA indicated that both the rate and
magnitude of change in the two groups were similar.
Over the 8 weeks of treatment with 40-60 mg of
duloxetine per day, 67% of the patients were effectively
treated (i.e., &#x02265;50% drop in baseline HAMD-17 score) and
41% achieved the criteria for remission (final HAMD-17
score &#x02264;7); these results were not significantly different
from those for the paroxetine group. Our findings are
consistent with those reported in an open label 12-week trial by Martinez and colleagues[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and with those
of a placebo-controlled study of duloxetine (60 mg/d) as
treatment for acute MDD by Detke and colleagues.[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] </p><p>
In the United States, duloxetine is also approved
for the management of generalized anxiety disorder.[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] 
In the current study we found significant improvement
in the HAMA scale scores after 8 weeks of treatment
with both duloxetine and paroxetine and no significant
difference in the magnitude of the improvement
between the two groups. This suggests that duloxetine is
equally effective as paroxetine (which is commonly used
to treat anxiety) in improving concurrent symptoms of
anxiety in depressed patients.</p><p>
Physical pain is a common somatic symptom of
depression. Prior studies have shown that duloxetine is
more effective in reducing reported pain in depressed
patients than placebo and other selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, in this study
duloxetine and paroxetine treatment were both
associated with similar significant decreases in the
level of pain reported on the VAS-PI scale. The reason
for this difference from prior findings may be that in
our study, despite the random group assignment, the
baseline score of VAS-PI in the duloxetine group was
more than 30% higher than that in the paroxetine group
(27.1 v. 18.5) - a highly significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.001).
Future studies will need to evaluate the therapeutic
effect of duloxetine on the somatic symptoms of pain in
depressed patients.</p><p>
The common side effects for duloxetine reported
in this study (nausea, dry mouth, constipation, loss of
appetite, dizziness, diarrhea, drowsiness and fatigue)
were similar to those reported in prior studies.[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] These
side effects were largely mild to moderate in severity
and did not require specific therapy or management. In
the present study duloxetine had no detrimental effect on kidney and liver function, heart rate, blood pressure, 
or body weight.</p></sec><sec id="s9b"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p>
The patients entered in this study were those attending
outpatient departments at specialized psychiatric
hospitals in China, did not have any comorbid disorders, 
and had moderate to severe symptoms. Moreover, 
the number of patients screened for the study prior
to enrollment but excluded for different reasons
(including refusal to participate) were not recorded
at all eight centers. Thus it is not known the extent
to which the included sample is representative of all
depressed individuals in China. The sample size, though
large enough to assess the main hypothesis about
the comparable effectiveness of the two drugs, was
not large enough to conduct stratified analysis (e.g., 
by gender, age group, number of previous depressive
episodes, and so forth) to determine whether or not
there are differences in outcome in different subgroups
of patients. Adverse events were assessed by clinicians
at each clinical visit during the trial without the use
of a standardized instrument, so some less serious
adverse events may have been missed. The duration
of treatment of 8 weeks was sufficient to assess the
acute response of MDD to duloxetine, but longer lasting
studies will be needed to determine its effectiveness in
chronic depression and its effectiveness in preventing
relapses in depressed patients. </p></sec><sec id="s9c"><label>4.3</label><title>Significance</title><p>
This study is a multi-centered, double-blind, doubledummy
randomized controlled clinical trial conducted
in Chinese psychiatric outpatients with MDD. Based
on a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the results
show that eight weeks of treatment with 40-60mg/d of generic duloxetine in these patients was equally
effective, safe, and well-tolerated as treatment with
20mg/d of paroxetine.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn><p>Ethics approval: The ethics committee of the Shanghai Mental Health
