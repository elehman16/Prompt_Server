The most common migraine-associated symptoms (MAS) are nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and osmophobia, with a cumulative percentage of the onset in about 90% of the patients.</p><p>In menstrually related migraine (MRM), a particularly difficult-to-treat form of primary headache, MAS are also present in percentages similar to the other forms of migraine (non-MRM). Data in recent literature report that in MRM versus non-MRM, pre-treatment nausea is present in 40.4 versus 33.4% of attacks, phonophobia in 71.3 versus 75.4% of attacks and photophobia in 84.0 versus 78.9% of attacks, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>MRM is a common form of migraine affecting more than 50% of female migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Population-based studies indicate that this type of migraine, which occurs during the perimenstrual period, is mostly migraine without aura and is significantly more likely (but not exclusively) to occur on the 2&#x000a0;days before and on the first 3&#x000a0;days of menses. Only a small percentage of female migraineurs (7&#x02013;12%) have migraine attacks exclusively occurring in this period, a condition known as &#x0201c;pure menstrual migraine&#x0201d;.</p><p>The various drugs used to treat &#x02018;ordinary&#x02019; migraine may be prescribed for MRM<italic>,</italic> but triptans&#x02014;selective 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonists, which are considered the most effective specific acute anti-migraine medications&#x02014;are preferable for MRM in view of its difficult-to-treat nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Almotriptan is one of the most recent selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonists successfully used for the acute treatment of migraine. It is rapidly absorbed, with very good oral bioavailability (80%), and at the usual dose of 12.5&#x000a0;mg is at least as or even more effective than sumatriptan 100&#x000a0;mg and has a significantly better tolerability profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>A placebo-controlled randomized study with almotriptan in MRM was recently concluded and data relevant to the number of patients reporting MAS were therefore available for a separate analysis. It is interesting to evaluate the effects of the symptomatic treatment of the migraine attack more closely, not only as far as pain relief is concerned, but also in terms of MAS evolution, particularly if patients are suffering from MRM.</p><p>The aim of this analysis is to show and discuss the evolution of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and osmophobia in MRM patients following treatment with almotriptan 12.5&#x000a0;mg or placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The original trial was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study that was followed by an open phase. In the double-blind period, two single menstrual migraine attacks per menstrual cycle were treated with almotriptan or placebo (and vice versa). In the open phase, two additional single attacks (3rd and 4th) per menstrual cycle were treated with almotriptan.</p><p>The primary objective of the original study consisted in proving the effectiveness (superiority hypothesis) of almotriptan versus placebo by testing the percentages of patients pain free at 2&#x000a0;h (primary study end point) following drug intake.</p><p>Patients were provided with a diary card to record their migraine attacks for each menstrual cycle under consideration. In particular, at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h after drug intake, the presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia and osmophobia were recorded along with the intensity of headache pain and other parameters.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment</title><p>Almotriptan or matching placebo was self-administered at the onset of the first menstrual migraine attack occurring during the specified window (day &#x02212;2 to +3) of the menstrual cycle. One single menstrual migraine attack per menstrual cycle was treated in four different menstrual cycles. One out of the first two of the four attacks was placebo-treated. Each attack was treated with one single tablet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For each symptom and for each scheduled time, the percentage of patients was analyzed using a generalized linear model implemented with binomial distribution, log-link function and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results were reported as risk ratio (RR) with associated 95% CL and two-tailed <italic>p</italic> values. The main analysis was performed on the modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and in whom the evaluation of the primary outcome, at both the first and the second period of the double-blind phase, was available.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><p>Following a screening period, 147 outpatient women aged 18&#x02013;50 and suffering from MRM without aura (IHS criteria) were randomized: 74 to almotriptan-placebo and 73 to placebo-almotriptan; 122 patients completed the double-blind phase (mITT) and 105 completed the additional open follow-up phase (two further attacks).</p><p>Patient disposition is summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1"

This is also highlighted by the correlation found between the severity of MAS (especially nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) and impaired functioning. In fact, quality of life is critically lowered by the presence of severe MAS, and consequently symptomatic treatment should also be carefully evaluated in terms of its efficacy in affecting MAS.</p><p>Almotriptan has proven to be effective in the control of migraine pain in menstrual migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that almotriptan in MRM treatment showed excellent efficacy on MAS in comparison to placebo, with a significant reduction in the percentages of suffering patients over a 2-h period of time. These positive data were also confirmed during the open follow-up phase.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Almirall SA, Spain.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest statement</bold> G.
