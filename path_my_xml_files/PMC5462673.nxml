ankle flexibility and balance. [Subjects and Methods] The study&#x02019;s subjects were 32 healthy
college students, divided into two groups according to the massage methods applied. Both
groups received five-minutes of massage to each calf, making a total of ten minutes.
Massage group A received effleurage, tapotement and pressure, and massage group B received
effleurage, friction and petrissage. The functional reaching test and the modified one leg
standing test were performed to measure the flexibility and balance of the ankles both
before and after the massage application. [Results] In the functional reaching test
performed after the calf muscle massage intervention, both groups showed significant
increases. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups. In the
modified one leg standing test, massage group A showed a significant increase in
flexibility and balance after the intervention only when the left foot was used for
support. Massage group B showed a significant increase when each foot was used for
support. A significant difference between the groups was only observed only when the left
foot was used for support. [Conclusion] Calf muscle massage may be effective for enhancing
the flexibility and balance function of the ankle joint. In particular, a combined
application of friction and petrissage massage techniques may be more effective for
increasing ankle joint flexibility. Therefore, the application of calf massage can be
considered an appropriate method for improving balancing ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ankle flexibility</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Calf muscle massage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Massage is defined as the systematic manual manipulation of the body by movements such as
rubbing, kneading, pressing, rolling, slapping, and tapping for therapeutic purposes. These
movements promote circulation of the blood and lymph, relaxation of muscles, relief from
pain, restoration of metabolic balance, and sundry other benefits both physical and
mental<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapists in
different parts of the world use therapeutic massage in clinical settings to facilitate
relaxation and to treat pain, increase muscle compliance and range of joint movement,
decrease stiffness, diminish anxiety, and improve mood state<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has been suggested that the benefits of massage may help healthy people to enhance their
dynamic balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance may be
maintained by using an ankle strategy, hip strategy, or both strategies at the same time. In
particular, the ankle strategy functions in the early stages of balancing to facilitate
control over external sway<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The soleus muscle, which provides stability to the ankle
joint and acts in push off at the end of the stance phase during walking. The gastrocnemius
muscle maintains the weight center of the basal area through continuous muscle contraction
during walking and generates sufficient muscle strength to maintain stability during
exercise of the lower limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The plantar-flexion torque of the ankle joint, which generates sufficient momentum at the
end of the stance phase, is an important factor in human walking. The plantar-flexion torque
of the ankle joint is an important factor that generates propulsion by connecting with the
motion of the sole as it pushes against the floor and moves the lower limbs forward.
However, as the plantar-flexion torque decreases due to a limited range of motion of the
ankle joint or ankle instability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, walking
ability diminishes as the momentum through the ankle joint decreases<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, research on interventions involving ankle joint
plantar-flexion through management of the calf muscle is required to assist in ankle
flexibility and stable walking. In particular, the ability to create plantar-flexion torque
diminishes in older people due to weakened muscle strength in their lower limbs. This
decreases the momentum arising from the ankle joint and eventually decreases walking
ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research into intervention
methods that can be applied easily to older people and to those who have problems with their
plantar-flexion torque due to fatigue in daily life is particularly important.</p><p>This study attempts to investigate the effects of applying massage to calf muscle on the
flexibility and balance of the ankle. It also examines the investigation of massages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 32 healthy university students in Korea: fourteen males in
their 20s (ages: 21.50 &#x000b1; 0.45&#x02005;years, height: 173.38 &#x000b1; 4.03&#x02005;cm, weight: 66.75 &#x000b1; 1.74&#x02005;kg) and
fourteen females in their 20s (ages 21.3 &#x000b1; 0.35&#x02005;years, height: 161.75 &#x000b1; 6.25&#x02005;cm, weight:
51.75 &#x000b1; 8.25&#x02005;kg). Subjects were required to be injury free in their ankles, lower legs and
feet.</p><p>The Ethics Committee of Kangwon National University approved (KWNUIRB-2015-06-006-001) the
research protocol with criteria based on the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical
practice. All subjects read and signed an informed consent form prior to the study
beginning.</p><p>The students were randomly assigned to the two intervention groups (massage A group:
effleurage, tapotement and pressure technique or the massage B group: effleurage, friction
and petrissage technique). A type of massage that is not very difficult for students to
apply was selected and performed on each of the two groups. This is because we considered
that the massage methods applied by students, who were not massage experts, would also be
easily applicable for individuals who are members of the general public.</p><p>Five-minutes of massage was applied to each calf giving a total of 10 minutes. During the
research period, the research subjects were instructed to avoid heavy exercises to their
calves to put excessive burdens on their calf muscles from heavy exercise or other activity
during their daily lives. Before the massage, the subjects performed the light exercise of
climbing up and down the five-story building once, which is considered an ordinary daily
activity, followed by a five-minute rest. Research subjects wore shorts and received massage
in the prone position. Calf massages were performed by a student who was not a massage
expert, but who had completed a therapeutic massage course. Massage intensity and pressure
strength were controlled at a similar level through a test before the massage was applied. A
functional reaching test (FRT) was performed to measure flexibility and balance of the
ankles both before and after the intervention, and a modified one leg standing test (OLST)
was performed to measure static balance.</p><p>In assuming the correct posture for the FRT, the subjects stood straight, in a comfortable
position, and the measuring ruler was located right in front of the measuring shoulder at
the acromion height of the subject. Before starting the measurement, the shoulder joint of
the subject was placed in a 90 degree forward flexion and the elbow and wrist joints were
placed in complete extension so that the subject stretched his or her arms and hands
straight out in front. While holding this position, the third metacarpophalangeal joint and
the front point of the ruler were matched to define the baseline location. The subject then
pushed the ruler with both arms as far as possible, and the distance that the ruler moved
forward was measured<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The OLST is a test that investigates balance by checking how long the subject can maintain
balance on one leg. It has been used as a tool for measuring static balance in a number of
studies, including one by Riemann et al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study, a modified OLST was performed which implemented one leg
standing under conditions where the ground was unstable and visibility was blocked to
prevent the ceiling effect, since this study was using a sample of healthy adults. The
subjects were told to stand on one leg with their eyes closed on a trampoline that provided
instability of ground. The length of time on right and left leg were each measured and the
test was conducted twice with each leg to provide an average value. During the OLST for this
study, the subjects spread out both arms and initially stood on both legs. They then bent
the knee on the opposite side to the leg to be used for support. The length of time that the
subject could stand on one leg was measured for both the right and left legs, and the
measurement procedure was conducted twice, so the average value could be used in order to
minimize measurement and training errors. After receiving the massage intervention, the OLST
was repeated using the same procedure.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS (version 21.0) statistical analysis program. The paired
t-test was used to test the significance of changes following the intervention with each
group; the independent t-test was used to test the significance of differences between the
two groups. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the OLST were investigated for any differences before and after the calf

local massage is applied to the calf using normal adults as research subjects with the
purpose of exploring the effect of massage to balance. In this study, effleurage,
petrissage, friction, tapotement, and pressure massage techniques were applied.</p><p>Effleurage is beginning of a session and end of each session. Effleurage must always follow
the direction of venous return back to the heart and the direction of lymphatic drainage
towards the nearest group of lymphatic nodes. This increases the arterial blood flow,
bringing oxygen and nutrients to the tissues more quickly. Friction is aimed directly at the
site of injury to mobilize muscle; separate adhesions in muscle, tendon, or scar tissue; and
restore fibers to a more normal alignment for freer movement. Petrissage almost always
follows effleurage to further warm the muscle tissue. It can be applied with two hands or
one, and is done toward the heart on the extremities. The alternate squeezing and releasing
action of the hands on the tissues again increases the circulation to the area, removing
waste products and bringing oxygen and nutrients to the area, thus improving the condition
of the tissues. Tapotement is various parts of the hand striking finishing a section of the
body stimulate the tissues either by the tissues at a fairly rapid and stimulate the tissues
either by direct mechanical force or by reflex action. Pressure is the amount of force a
stroke applies to the tissue. If the intent is to reach deep into the tissue and break up
adhesions<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among physical therapists working in Saudi Arabia, friction is
reported to be the most commonly used technique in therapeutic massage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, there was significant difference between the two legs in the group to whom
effleurage, petrissage and friction were applied, and who performed a modified OLST before
and after the application. However, in the group where effleurage, pressure and tapotement
were applied, the difference after massage was only evident when the subjects were being
supported on their left legs. The effects of the massage were therefore stronger in the
group to which effleurage, petrissage and friction were applied. This result may have been
due to the type of massage techniques that were applied. The friction technique employed for
massage group B is applied to tendons and scar tissue, and it breaks up muscle adhesions.
The petrissage technique mobilizes deep muscle tissue or the skin and subcutaneous tissue
and increases local circulation. Therefore, these techniques may have been useful for
increasing flexibility. Friction affect not only the deepest part of the muscle tendon or
joint capsule gives a stimulating effect on the nervous system and tapotement is very
efficient in revitalizing sore and tires muscles. Therefore, more effective at both legs in
the group B that includes the friction.</p><p>In this study, significant differences in the FRT were evident before and after the massage
application. However, there was no between-group difference. It is conjectured that the
massage brought about no significant differences because the period of massage application
was too short.</p><p>Grant et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> randomly performed
tapotement and petrissage and examined their effect on ankle flexibility. In this research,
no significant correlation was observed in the flexibility achieved by the two massage
approaches, although the ankle joint flexibility of the left leg showed a significant
result, which indicates a result similar to that of our study.</p><p>Gentle mechanical pressure provided by massage can change neuronal excitability as
characterized by reduced amplitude of the H-reflex<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Massage-facilitated relaxation has
also been found to increase parasympathetic activity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, to reduce hormonal stress levels<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, to increase muscle compliance and range of joint movement<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, to decrease passive stiffness<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and active stiffness<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the eyes are shut during the OLST, visual information
is restricted; we can therefore say that the test measures the maintenance of balance by
using the proprioceptive senses. Proprioceptive sensing by the feet is a very important
factor in that it can affect the overall postural control of the body<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weerapong et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> argue that massage can also affect biomechanical mechanisms, which
supports the results of this study.</p><p>In conclusion, it was shown that calf massage is effective in improving the flexibility and
balance ability of the ankle joint. Massage applied to the calf seems to be a useful method
that can be easily applied to those who feel fatigue in their ankles, or to elderly people
who have diminished balancing abilities due to problems with their plantar-flexion torque.
However, the types of massage used in this study resulted in no difference in effectiveness.
This implies that any massage can be applied to the calf to induce improvements in the
flexibility of the ankle joints. Massage has high usability in terms that it can easily be
applied at home since it has a broad range of applications and no special qualifications are
required.</p><p>The danger of falling is expected to decrease if balancing ability is improved by the
application of calf massage. Because this decrease is likely to reduce the medical expenses
incurred by falls and contribute to enhancing the ability of elderly people to perform daily
activities, additional research related to falls and ankle flexibility is required.</p><p>We believe that the results of this study can be used as a resource for applying calf
massage therapy not only to healthy people but also to patients and the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by 2015 Research Grant from Kangwon National University (No.
