The study has produced findings about girls&#x02019; preferences for dance and an embryonic costing tool that can be applied to design and conduct an economic evaluation alongside a full cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). This feasibility and exploratory pilot study is powered to test the intervention concept, the feasibility of obtaining programme cost data in categories and the evidence required to power a full cluster RCT in the future. Consequently, the variation in programme costs at the school level has not been captured and this is a limitation of the cost estimates presented.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Recent influential studies attach substantial economic and social costs to obesity prevalence projections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> These forecasts are based on a body of research from long-term cohort studies which suggest that change in the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents born at the millennium is likely to lead to increased health risks in middle age irrespective of adult adiposity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5">3&#x02013;5</xref> Consequently, there is a need for new interventions that focus on preventing obesity or changing diet or physical activity (PA), the two behaviours that are central to the accrual of body mass.</p><p>As well as being a health and well-being issue, children's obesity also has serious economic impacts. Scarce resources with competing uses in all health systems and the need to decide between new, &#x02018;efficacious&#x02019; primary prevention PA programme interventions on the grounds of cost-effectiveness have increased the significance of economic evaluation as a concept and methodology. Recent guidance from the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex behavioural interventions suggests that efficacy and cost-effectiveness should be established before programmes are implemented at the population level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> However, the meaningful determination of these criteria is often problematic in primary prevention, and guidelines for the design and conduct of economic evaluation of complex interventions are at an early stage of development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10 R11">8&#x02013;11</xref> It is, therefore, important to develop the conceptual and measurement process by which effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of complex PA interventions can be evaluated in a full trial using a pilot study.</p><p>The main findings of the Bristol Girls Dance Project (BGDP) feasibility trial concerning process evaluation, outcomes and effectiveness have been published elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> This part of the study suggested that it is feasible to deliver the intervention and that participating in dance has the potential to yield change in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) among 11&#x02013;12-year-old girls (school year 7), but a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In the absence of robust evidence for the cost and outcome of dance interventions, other aims of the feasibility pilot were to refine the information required to sufficiently power a full trial and to use the preference data to inform potential refinements to intervention design.</p><p>Preferences for competing after-school activities are potential determinants of the economic benefit of dance intervention, as increased PA must be valued in order for it to be maintained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> and to have potential for long-term impact on PA levels. In this study, discrete choice experiment (DCE) and survey methods are applied to examine two separate, but complementary aspects of value&#x02014;preferences for the attributes of dance classes and preferences for dance among other competing alternatives for spending leisure time, respectively. PA levels decline during youth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> with the start of secondary school being a critical period of change, so it was important to establish comparative preferences for after-school leisure activities on weekdays.</p><p>Value is a concept germane to recruitment and retention rates and linked to the outcome dimension of the BGDP intervention and is therefore important to examine in detail. DCE works on the premise that any &#x02018;product&#x02019;, for example, a healthcare treatment or PA programme, can be described by its characteristics or attributes, and the extent to which an individual values a &#x02018;product&#x02019; is dependent on the level of these characteristics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>Thus, this article reports the findings of a pilot economic evaluation of the BGDP for girls aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years in a primary school setting in England that can be applied to design and conduct a future full trial and economic evaluation.</p><p>Two hours available for other leisure activities on dance class days was preferred to 3&#x02005;h, suggesting after-school dance classes are valued compared with other ways to spend leisure time after school on weekdays.</p><p>Resources used in the development, preparation, delivery and maintenance of dance classes should be categorised separately in stages in order to identify the mainstream cost of the programme intervention to commissioners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>BGDP feasibility study</title><p>BGDP was a three-arm, parallel group, cluster randomised, controlled pilot trial with schools as the unit of allocation. Seven schools from three school districts, Bristol, Bath and South Gloucestershire (the UK), were recruited to take part in the study from schools in these districts with no current after-school dance provision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The hip-hop and street dance style of dance to popular music was facilitated by a professional dance teacher.</p><p>Stratifying by school district, three schools were randomly allocated to the intervention arm (n=90) and four schools to the two control arms (n=120) and each school was assigned a dance teacher to lead the sessions. Randomisation was conducted by an independent member of the clinical trials unit at Bristol University using computer-generated random sequences and codes for school district and school name. The three intervention schools received two, 90&#x02005;min after-school dance classes&#x000a0;per week for 9&#x02005;weeks selected to allow the entire programme to be delivered within a school term. Pilot work had suggested that dance is a very attractive form of PA for girls, so the control element was designed to ascertain whether offering a dance workshop at the end of the research process (ie, after the last data collection) would affect either retention or the quality of data provided by participants. We, therefore, utilised a three-arm design with two different control groups. In two schools, participants were provided with small thank you gifts for each wave of data collection. In the other two control schools, participants were provided with the same small thank you gifts, as well as a half-day dance workshop at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size</title><p>This feasibility study was powered to test the intervention concept and to provide the necessary information to calculate the sample size of a full cluster RCT and economic evaluation of an after-school dance programme. Detection of important parameters of 10&#x02005;min difference in MVPA&#x000a0;per weekday (50&#x02005;min/week) between the intervention and control groups, intraclass correlation for weekday MVPA at time 2 and associated CIs have been reported and profiled in another article from this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> For practical reasons, the sample was limited to 30 girls aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years&#x000a0;per school.

Eighteen BGDP dance classes (2 classes/week for 9&#x02005;weeks) of 90&#x02005;min duration were delivered to 90 girls in three intervention schools (30/ school) for 81&#x02005;h (27&#x02005;h/school) at a total estimated cost of $6380, &#x000a3;3988and &#x020ac;4666 in 2010&#x02013;2011 prices.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> The average cost of the BGDP programme in its mainstream form per school was $2126.40, &#x000a3;1329 and &#x020ac;1555 and per participant was $70.90, &#x000a3;44.31 and &#x020ac;51.84 in 2010&#x02013;2011 prices. If training costs for dance teachers on the BGDP were included to the mainstream cost, this would add $1280, &#x000a3;800 and &#x020ac;928 to the cost&#x000a0;per school and $43, &#x000a3;27 and &#x020ac;31.60 to the cost&#x000a0;per pupil. These are not insubstantial additions, but are at the high end of training costs because this new dance programme was properly prepared for delivery. Training costs for the delivery of an established dance programme are likely to be lower. It was not possible to calculate CIs for average programme costs per school or per participant (see Limitations of this pilot study).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013003726TB3"

programme is feasible, practical and likely to be successful. Around two-thirds of resources are development and research control costs, so resources used to develop, prepare and deliver these programmes should be categorised separately so that the cost of the mainstream programme can be estimated accurately.</p><p>DCE is an acceptable method to elicit preferences of girls aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years.</p><p>At this point in their lives, after-school dance is an activity valued by girls when offered within the context of other competing choices and parental support for activities for spending leisure time after school on weekdays.</p><p>Participation in after-school dance classes has opportunity costs for participants and parents extending beyond the funder that suggest a social model of cost should be considered for to capture the costs associated with intervention outcome.</p><p>Robust evidence for the cost-effectiveness of PA complex interventions is important for knowing where to invest scarce resources and commission programmes to maximise health outcomes in primary prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27 R28 R29">27&#x02013;29</xref> However, gathering robust evidence to support investment in public health interventions is a challenge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Significant barriers remain and there is currently little guidance in how to conduct economic evaluation where behaviour change is associated with health outcomes determined beyond genetic inheritance by family, social and physical environments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>Indicative programme cost data from the pilot economic evaluation indicated that a substantial proportion of the intervention programme costs, that is 41%, occurs at stage 0&#x02014;the preprogramme development stage. This is an important finding because it suggests that the provided BGDP is effective and cost-effective in a full trial, and it would be substantially less costly to roll out in its mainstream form. All complex interventions in primary prevention are likely to generate a high proportion of upfront development costs that will not reoccur once a programme is mainstreamed&#x02014;an aspect of investment in public health interventions often overlooked by decision-makers.</p><p>Application of DCE is an established technique in adult populations, but, to our knowledge, has not been applied previously in populations of children aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years to establish values for the attributes of PAs. This study has demonstrated that application of DCE methods is feasible and acceptable to girls of this age. This is important because it suggests DCE could be applied in other studies with children to understand the concept of &#x02018;value&#x02019; of an activity which plays an important role in recruitment, participation and maintenance of participants which are all linked to intervention outcome. In addition to its acceptability in this study, the DCE method has produced more complete and valid data than the direct survey method in eliciting preference ranks for after-school leisure activities. These findings support a previous contention that DCE techniques may have merit over more &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; survey methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> in eliciting preferences. However, more evidence would be required to fully support this finding.</p><p>Taken together, findings of the DCE and survey of leisure activity preference in this study indicate that dance is a valued leisure activity among competing alternatives and reveals more about the attributes of dance classes in girls of this age that can be taken forward to maximise recruitment and retention in the BGDP programme. The findings of this study suggest that dance has immediate appeal as an after-school leisure activity among a range of strongly competing alternatives in girls of this age compared with older adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Girls in this study have a first rank preference for the attribute &#x02018;time remaining for other leisure activities on dance class days&#x02019;, over the &#x02018;cost of&#x02019; and &#x02018;frequency of dance classes per week&#x02019;. The finding that, in the intervention group, 2&#x02005;h is preferred to 3&#x02005;h remaining for other leisure activities on dance class days is significant. Overall, these findings could suggest that at this point in their lives dance is valued by girls as a physical and social activity when offered within the context of competing and constrained choices for spending leisure time at this age. For example, at this age, girls are not likely to be able to go to &#x02018;discos or dance classes&#x02019; without parents or carers or to &#x02018;hang around on street corners with friends&#x02019; and these issues may have affected their responses in the survey. These are important findings because they predict positive recruitment rates and participation of girls aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years in dance as a physical leisure time activity and in a full trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>Delivery of after-school dance classes is dependent on substantial commitment from the girls giving up their after-school leisure time to participate in dancing. In turn, participation is dependent on the willingness of parents and carers to support attendance and to provide encouragement and a means of travelling back home after school hours when school buses are not available. This pilot study suggests development of a social model of costing that reflects the cost of participants&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; time and opportunity costs as substantial elements of the intervention cost that could be captured, if practical, in a full trial.</p><p>However, methods and tools to capture &#x02018;hidden&#x02019; cost items that facilitate the success of the intervention, but are not incurred by funders, are not yet fully established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Where to include training costs in these metrics is a question that remains for a future trial as they should arguably be included in mainstream cost estimation despite their categorisation as development costs. How identification of costs falling outside the public sector that are relevant to programme implementation can be captured at a full trial stage also needs to be considered carefully.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> In a full trial, resources used should be captured prospectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> and this pilot study has established that categories of resource use are also important to consider to establish accurate mainstream programme costs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The feasibility of providing costing data for full trial of the BGDP programme is established and an embryonic resource use checklist has been developed. Resources used to develop and run the BGDP programme should be categorised separately in order for the mainstream delivery cost of BGDP to be estimated accurately in a full trial. A social model of costing that reflects participants&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; opportunity costs should be considered. BGDP after-school dance classes have potential for sustained participation and cost-effective delivery, but a full trial using methodological learning from this study is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e179" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003726.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e180" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003726.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants, dance teachers, school teachers and schools who participated in or assisted with this research.
