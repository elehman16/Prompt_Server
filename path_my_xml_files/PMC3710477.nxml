The primary treatment of EIB is inhaling a short-acting beta-2-agonist such as salbutamol. However, professional speed skaters also inhale nebulized isotonic saline or tap water before and after a race or intense training. The use of nebulized isotonic saline or tap water to prevent EIB has not been studied before, raising questions about safety and efficacy. The aim of this study is to analyze the acute effect of nebulized isotonic saline or salbutamol on EIB in elite speed skaters following a1,500-meter race.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized controlled trial compares single dose treatment of 1 mg nebulized salbutamol in 4 mL of isotonic saline, or with 5 mL of isotonic saline. A minimum of 13 participants will be allocated in each treatment group. Participants should be between 18 and 35 years of age and able to skate 1,500 m in less than 2 min 10 s (women) or 2 min 05 s (men). Repeated measurements of spirometry, forced oscillation technique, and electromyography will be performed before and after an official 1,500-m race. Primary outcome of the study is the difference in fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> after exercise in the different treatment groups. The trial is currently enrolling participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Elite athletes run the risk of pulmonary inflammation and remodeling as a consequence of their frequent exercise, and thus increased ventilation in cold and dry environments.

Especially endurance athletes who reach high ventilation in cold, dry air on a regular basis are susceptible to EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A study using a canine model highlighted the negative effect of dry air on the airways as it leads to airway inflammation and airway remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In humans this find has been confirmed in bronchial biopsies from competitive elite skiers, showing signs of eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation in the lungs, similar to those seen in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In elite speed skaters intense training may cause thoracic pain and cause EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For this reason many speed skaters use a roll-collar in training to warm and humidify inhaled air. Beuther <italic>et al.</italic> already showed that warming the inhaled air can reduce EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In competition, due to aerodynamics, this method cannot be used. In an effort to reduce EIB and thoracic pain, international professional speed skaters nowadays inhale nebulized isotonic saline or tap water before and after a race or intense training session. In EIB, the primary treatment is a short-acting beta-2-agonist such as salbutamol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This treatment reduced smooth muscle contraction very effectively, but still is an example of symptomatic therapy. The recommended dosage of nebulized salbutamol is 5 mg, which would require a therapeutic use exemption for participating athletes from the world anti-doping agency (WADA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wada-ama.org">http://www.wada-ama.org</ext-link>). Although such a dosage is safe in highly trained athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we routinely recommend using 1 mg of salbutamol, which we believe leads to substantial reductions in EIB in this population. The use of nebulized isotonic saline treat EIB has not been studied before, raising questions about safety and efficacy.</p><p>Spirometry before and after exercise is the golden standard for assessing the occurrence and severity of EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x0003e;10%, after exercise (&#x0003e;95% predicted heart frequency) indicates EIB. A potential disadvantage of spirometry is the use of a forced maneuver and not everybody is able to perform reliable measurements. In addition the maneuver requires a forced deep inspiration which in asthmatic children with EIB may lead to bronchodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and an underestimation of EIB. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) may be used to evaluate the patency of the airways without the need of forced breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Another substitute for evaluating lung function without the need of forced breathing may be electromyography (EMG), however, it has not been used to evaluate EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of nebulized isotonic saline or salbutamol on EIB in elite speed skaters following a 1,500-m race using spirometry, FOT, and EMG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo, treatment, and non-intervention controlled study, consisting of three parallel groups. Participants will be randomized to receive either no intervention (control), 1 mg of nebulized salbutamol (treatment), or nebulized isotonic saline (placebo).

An elite athlete inhaling nebulized tap water can be seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The dose of salbutamol, 1 mg, will be used to stay well below the WADA cutoff for doping at an elite level of 1.6 mg daily. The route of administration has been chosen to allow a viable comparison with nebulized saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inhaled Salbutamol has a longstanding record for treatment of bronchoconstriction and poses a minimal risk for cardiovascular complications even if used in dosages above the recommended dosage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The dosage used is below the recommended dosage, furthermore, expert opinion states that salbutamol has been used in higher dosages immediately after extremely strenuous activity before and no adverse reactions have been reported. Furthermore, in a study by Elers <italic>et al</italic>., high dosages of inhaled salbutamol were used to evaluate anabolic effects in well trained athletes (VO<sub>2</sub> max 66 mg&#x02219;ml&#x02219;min<sup>-1</sup>). No beneficial or harmful effects were seen on cardiopulmonary function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-204-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function measurements</title><p>FOT measurements will be performed with R.O.S., Oscilink&#x000ae;, Sensormedics&#x000ae; to measure general respiratory resistance and reactance. FOT measurements will consist of three repeated measurements with nose clipped and with hands supporting cheeks and base of the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. FOT measurements will be performed before and at 10, 15, and 30 min after exercise.

Flow volumes will be measured in duplicate before and at 11, 16, and 31 min after exercise, the best values at each time point retained for analysis. Feeling of dyspnea and thoracic pain will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) after every complete spirometry measurement.</p><p>EMG of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles will be derived transcutaneously from pairs of single electrodes (disposable Neotrode, ConMed Corporation, NY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To obtain the electrical activity of the diaphragm, two electrodes will be placed bilaterally below the costal margin in the nipple line (frontal lead of diaphragm) and two bilaterally on the back at the same level (dorsal lead of diaphragm). The mean value of the processed data of the frontal and dorsal leads of the diaphragm represented the electrical activity of the whole diaphragm. A common electrode will be placed at the height of the sternum.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise provocation challenge</title><p>Exercise testing for measuring EIB will be performed by skating 1,500 m.

Data used to produce these numbers came from research performed by Driessen <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We expect no difference between placebo and control groups. Analyzing the protective effect of salbutamol in a randomized control trial, with an expected difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 10% and a standard deviation from the mean of 6% the number of participants was set at 13 per group. Therefore the total number of randomized participants will be at least 39. In the aforementioned research performed by Driessen <italic>et al.</italic>, 95% of patients completed the study. Therefore the enrolled patient count will be 1.05 times the total number (39&#x02022;1.05=41).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants are randomized using a pre-generated randomization list. For randomization a linear congruential algorithm of Park and Miller with Bays-Durham shuffling was employed, using block sizes of two, four, and eight participants. Stratified minimization will commence using the number of intensive training years (&#x0003e; or &#x0003c;5 years) and the current use of asthma medication. A flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the study can be seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1.</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The study medication will be delivered to the skating ring in a standard syringe, containing either 1 mg salbutamol in isotonic saline or solely isotonic saline with a standard label.

The investigator can decide to withdraw a participant from the study for urgent medical reasons (for example, a fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003e;25% from baseline). Discontinued participants will not be replaced.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Best values of spirometric measurements, mean values of FOT measurements and EMG measurements recordings of 60 s during FOT measurements will be used for statistical calculations. Data will consist of a set of comparing participants who nebulized 1 mg Salbutamol, isotonic saline, and one set of controls. Once gathered, data will be analyzed with SPSS analytical software after testing for normality with a Shapiro-Wilk test. Difference between groups will be analyzed with a chi-square test for dichotomous variables and a one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey&#x02019;s test for continuous variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Data storage</title><p>Data will be encoded in Access&#x000ae; for windows.

Elite athletes run the risk of pulmonary inflammation and remodeling as a consequence of their frequent exercise, and thus increased ventilation in cold and dry environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although inhalation of nebulized isotonic saline is commonplace, no study has ever investigated the safety or efficacy of this treatment.</p><p>Furthermore the pulmonary response to such an extreme performance has not been investigated in such detail, using not only spirometry and feeling of dyspnea, but also the FOT and EMG of breathing musculature.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. First and foremost is the inclusion of the participants limited to elite skaters. Not all speed skaters however will show a substantial drop in FEV<sub>1</sub> after exercise limiting the power of our study. In our experience however, at least 40% of elite speed skaters in the Netherlands will show a substantial drop in FEV<sub>1</sub> after exercise, this is even higher than the percentage of American elite winter athletes experiencing EIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore the inclusion of the FOT and EMG measurements will allow more subtle evaluation of pulmonary function, not disrupted by forced breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We will be able to analyze the smaller airways using the extensive pulmonary function measurements, however we preferred to also assess the damage to pulmonary parenchyma using Clara Cell protein (CC16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We believe however that analyzing CC16 in serum would have severely hampered the inclusion rate of the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently enrolling participants and collects data on three separate dates; all test dates will be official races, approved by the Royal Dutch Skating organization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knsb.nl">http://www.knsb.nl</ext-link>).
