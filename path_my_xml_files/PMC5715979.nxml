Hyperkyphosis is highly prevalent, more common in older women than men. There is no standard intervention to reduce age-related hyperkyphosis. Sex differences in response to a kyphosis-specific exercise intervention are not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a targeted kyphosis-specific exercise and postural training program on the primary outcome Cobb angle of kyphosis, and investigated whether the magnitude of change differed between men and women. One hundred twelve participants aged &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years with kyphosis &#x02265;40&#x000b0; were enrolled and randomized to exercise or waitlist control, and 101 participants had analyzable baseline and follow-up radiographs for Cobb angle measurements. A group intervention including 10 participants per group was delivered by a physical therapist, 1-h, twice a week for 3-months. Controls were placed on a waitlist for 3&#x000a0;months before receiving a delayed intervention. Primary outcome was change from baseline to 3-months in Cobb angle measured from standing lateral spine radiographs. Secondary outcomes included change over 3-months in kyphometer-measured kyphosis, physical function and quality of life. Groups were combined for analysis after both received the intervention, and sex differences in response to the intervention were tested with ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Participants (60 women, 41 men) were 70.0 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.7) years old with mean Cobb angle 55.9 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.2) degrees at baseline.

Some of these trials included both men and women, although sex differences in treatment effects were not investigated.

Cobb angle was not measured because radiographs were not obtained. Our recent randomized controlled Study of Hyperkyphosis Exercise and Function (SHEAF) trial among 99 older men and women, an average 70.6 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) years old (range 60&#x02013;88), demonstrated that spine strengthening exercise and postural training effectively reduced both clinical and radiographic measures of kyphosis in older men and women, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] but sex differences in response to the intervention were not explored. It is important to investigate whether sex differences in the underlying musculoskeletal impairments that are associated with kyphosis affect the response to a potential treatment of kyphosis. These investigations will inform the medical community about this common and often disabling disorder, help future clinical trial design (e.g., effect size, sex difference), and determine whether a different approach may be warranted for men versus women.</p><p id="Par18">We designed a randomized controlled waitlist trial to determine if a targeted kyphosis specific exercise and posture training program improves the primary outcome of Cobb angle of kyphosis in older community-dwelling men and women, and secondarily to investigate whether the magnitude of change in the outcome of Cobb angle of kyphosis before and after the intervention differs between men and women. Additionally, we included secondary outcome measures of physical function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that are affected by age-related hyperkyphosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par19">Participants were recruited from January 2013 through June 2015 from local senior centers and outpatient medical clinics at 2 large urban medical centers (a university-based center and an integrated managed-care center).

First, ANCOVA was used to assess differences in change in the primary and secondary outcomes from baseline to 3-months in the active and control groups while controlling for the pre-treatment outcome. In addition, to determine the difference-in-difference and 95% confidence interval of the pre- and post-treatment changes between the active and control groups, we regressed the within person change in primary and secondary outcomes on treatment group. Then, we combined the active and control groups after both groups received the intervention, and ANOVA was used to test a sex by treatment interaction to evaluate differences in change in the outcomes before and after the intervention in men and women. We planned a modified intention to treat analyses with participants who had readable baseline and follow-up radiographs of sufficient quality to be evaluated to compare change in the primary Cobb angle outcome. Thus we excluded those that had radiographs that could not be evaluated and those who withdrew from the study during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks due to lack of time or interest. <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. In exploratory analyses, we assessed differences in the treatment effect by the presence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) (yes, no) and vertebral fractures (SQ&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2). In these analyses, we tested for interactions with <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.1 considered statistically significant. Based upon results from our prior pilot study, we determined that a sample size of 100 participants would have 80% power in 2-sided tests with a type-I error rate of 5%, allowing for within-subject correlation of the baseline and 3-month outcomes, and loss to follow-up of 20% of participants, to detect a clinically meaningful change of 2 degrees (or more) in the primary outcome Cobb angle of kyphosis. Additionally we determined a priori that a sample including 40% men would have 84% power to detect a 2-degree difference between men and women in mean change in the primary outcome. We calculated the minimal detectable difference while using the pooled standard deviation from ANCOVA models, modeling the change after treatment in Cobb angle in active versus controls while controlling for baseline values. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Subject characteristics and clinical variables</title><p id="Par32">One hundred twelve participants were enrolled and randomized to exercise (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;53) or waitlist control (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;48), however 9 withdrew within the first week due to lack of time or interest, and 2 did not have analyzable baseline radiographs for Cobb angle measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par39">There were no serious adverse events (death, life-threatening adverse experiences, or related inpatient hospitalization) and no reportable adverse events associated with the study in either group according to federal regulations and UCSF Institutional Review board criteria. There were numerous non-reportable events in both groups, which included pain and stiffness felt in muscles several hours to days after testing or exercise, and resolved within an expected duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. When we examined both groups during the 3-month period when they were allocated to the intervention, 95 (84.8%) reported a total of 129 different non-reportable events, with 10 falls. The majority of the musculoskeletal complaints (90%) were pre-existing and resolved within a couple of weeks. Twenty-seven control participants (49.1%) reported 31 different non-reportable events including 7 falls and 22 reports of musculoskeletal pain during the 3-month waitlist period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">In this randomized controlled waitlist trial of a kyphosis-specific exercise and posture training intervention, performed twice weekly for 3&#x000a0;months, we found that the magnitude of kyphosis improved in the clinical but not the radiographic measure of kyphosis. The clinical kyphometer measure of kyphosis progressed 1.0 (95% CI: &#x02212;0.5 to 2.4) degree in the control group and was reduced by 3.8 (95% CI: &#x02212;5.3 to &#x02212;2.3) degrees in the active group in the initial 3&#x000a0;months, suggesting that this type of intervention may reduce hyperkyphosis and prevent its progression over 3&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par41">We did not find a significant change in the primary outcome of change in radiographic Cobb angle of kyphosis that we previously reported after a similar kyphosis-specific exercise and posture training intervention over 6-months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The between group difference of 1.7 degrees exceeded the 1.4 degree standard error of the measurement, but it was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the difference in change in Cobb angle did not reach the minimal detectable difference of 2.6 degrees. While we did find change in the clinical measure of kyphosis, a longer period of time may be needed before radiographic changes are established. It is also possible that differences in the superior landmarks used to assess kyphosis, the T23 interspace in the kyphometer-derived kyphosis, and the superior endplate of T4 in the radiographic Cobb angle of kyphosis, may confound these measurements because the T23 interspace may be more anterior than T4 in the sagittal plane.</p><p id="Par42">The clinical response to the intervention is consistent with some but not all prior studies, and may be affected by the intensity and duration of the intervention. The 3.8 degree reduction in the clinical kyphometer measure of kyphosis that we observed is less than our prior uncontrolled pilot trial that reported a 6 degree reduction in kyphometer-derived kyphosis after a similar twice a week for 3&#x000a0;months exercise intervention in older women. In that trial, the resistance was progressed after every third study visit to maintain the resistance at a &#x0201c;hard to somewhat hard&#x0201d; level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is consistent with a similar intervention (SHEAF trial) that progressed the resistance according to the participant&#x02019;s perception when the exercise was no longer &#x0201c;hard or somewhat hard&#x0201d; over a 3&#x000d7;/week for 6-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The change in the clinical measure of kyphosis exceeded the Greendale, et al. trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that reported a 3-degree improvement in kyphometer-derived kyphosis in the active group, albeit with no significant difference between the groups, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.44, after a 3&#x000d7;/week for 6-month yoga randomized controlled trial with no strengthening component. The previous uncontrolled pilot with structured progression of resistance resulted in a 10.5% improvement over 3-months compared to a 7.3% improvement in our current trial with the same frequency and duration of study visits, but our current trial allowed participants to decide when to progress the resistance to maintain a level of &#x0201c;hard to somewhat hard&#x0201d;. Both of these trials resulted in a larger clinical change in kyphosis in 3-months than the changes reported in the 3&#x000d7;/week for 6-month SHEAF trial (6.7% change) and Greendale trial (5.2% change). Thus, it appears that 3-months may be sufficient to produce a clinical change in kyphosis, but a structured progression of resistance may produce better results over a shorter time. Future trials should include 10RM max testing at intervals throughout the trial to facilitate progression of the strengthening component of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">We also did not observe a change in either physical function or health-related quality of life measurements. In contrast to our pilot study that reported a significant improvement in the modified PPT, our cohort was quite robust at baseline with only 5 participants categorized in the mild frailty range. Moreover, these results are consistent with our previous SHEAF randomized controlled trial where the cohort was also quite robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Even a more frequent and longer intervention in SHEAF did not produce changes in physical function. Future trials may consider recruiting a more frail population, and including exercises that specifically target physical function. In the SHEAF trial, the SRS-30 self-image domain improved whereas we did not find a change in this outcome. It is possible that a longer term and more frequent intervention may be necessary to affect self-image.</p><p id="Par44">There were no sex differences in the main treatment effects in our cohort despite sex differences in kyphosis, bone mineral density, spine strength, vertebral fractures and DISH at baseline. Interestingly, men in our cohort had better hip and spine bone mineral density than the women, yet they had more vertebral fractures. Men had more DISH which has previously been associated with vertebral fractures due to the ankylosis of vertebral segments that creates long lever arms that may increase risk of fracture even in low-energy injuries. DISH has also been associated with greater magnitude of kyphosis in older men and women, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and less progression of kyphosis in older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Regardless, participants in our cohort with DISH and vertebral fractures responded equally well to the intervention compared to those without DISH or prevalent vertebral fractures.</p><p id="Par45">Men had greater spine strength at baseline, however there were no significant sex differences in their response to the intervention. Men did not improve in spinal extensor strength, whereas women increased spinal extensor peak torque by 5.4 (0.3, 10.5) percent, although the difference between men and women was not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.1). Previous study by DaBoit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported sex differences in change in knee extension peak torque after an 18-week resistance exercise training program in a cohort of older (&#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years) men and women. Maximal torque increased by 15.8% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.6) in women and 41.7% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.5) in men. In contrast, Lemmer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] found that changes in 1-RM strength in response to both strength training and detraining are affected by age, but not sex. Both older men and women increased knee extension muscle 1RM strength after 9-weeks of training. Our cohort increased spinal extension and flexion peak torque after the intervention in the active versus the control group, but the between group difference was not statistically significant, and there were no significant differences in spinal extension or flexion strength change between the men and women.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths/limitations</title><p id="Par46">The strengths of our study are that it included 40% men and we investigated sex differences in response to a randomized controlled intervention, which adds to our understanding of sex-differences in response to a kyphosis-specific intervention. Also, the intervention was well tolerated with no reportable adverse events. However, the intervention was only 3&#x000a0;months in duration, and we did not test 10 RM maximum to control intensity, thus a longer term and more intense intervention may be needed to demonstrate changes in radiographic-measured kyphosis, physical function and HRQoL. In addition, our cohort was high functioning at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and a cohort with a wider range of baseline functioning may be more reflective of the general population and also might be better able to demonstrate changes in physical function with the intervention. Furthermore, a greater proportion of the control group was classified with &#x0201c;mild frailty&#x0201d; on the modified PPT, even though there were no differences in the other physical function measures, and this may have influenced the results. Moreover, PPT was a secondary outcome, and we did not design the study to test for an interaction to determine if PPT was an effect modifier. Future studies are needed to investigate this type of intervention in lower functioning participants and whether this intervention prevents the progression of kyphosis that usually occurs over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">A targeted spine strengthening exercise and postural training program over 3&#x000a0;months had a non-statistically significant improvement in radiographic Cobb angle of kyphosis, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.09, but improved the clinical kyphometer-measured kyphosis by 4.8 degrees in the active group compared to the control group. Results from our randomized controlled trial show that despite sex differences in baseline kyphosis and other musculoskeletal impairments that affect kyphosis, there were no sex differences in response to the intervention. For older men and women with hyperkyphosis, a recommendation for a spine strengthening exercise and posture training program may be considered.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>&#x02265;</term><def><p id="Par6">Greater than or equal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x000b0;</term><def><p id="Par7">Degrees</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMD</term><def><p id="Par8">Bone mineral density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DID</term><def><p id="Par9">Difference of the difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DISH</term><def><p id="Par10">Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p id="Par11">Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kg/m<sup>2</sup></term><def><p id="Par12">Kilogram/m<sup>2</sup>
