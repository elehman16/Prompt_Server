POAG considered as a chronic, progressive, anterior optic neuropathy that is accompanied by the characteristic cupping and atrophy of the optic disc (OD), visual field loss, open angles, with no obvious causative ocular or systemic conditions, leading to death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) which contribute to optic neuropathy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and the third leading cause of it in India.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Globally, POAG affects more than angle closure glaucoma (ACG) with ratio of 3:1. In India, 4.7% of people having country&#x02019;s total blindness are affected with glaucoma.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Population-based studies reported a prevalence rate between 2% and 13%. Glaucoma can affect any age group, including newborn, infants, children, and elderly.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Early detection is the key to preserve vision-related quality of life. The current strategy of modern management of glaucoma is mainly concentrated on lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) that requires life time topical medication to be instilled. Some patients do not respond to mono therapy, demanding for multiple drug therapy. Sometimes, surgical intervention is required, which includes filtration and nonfiltrating surgeries that have their own advantages and disadvantages. Meticulous efforts in treating the other important pathological events such as hypo-perfusion to optic nerve head (ONH) and management of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) are non-yielding. It is established in management of glaucoma that along with control of IOP, perfusion of ONH, nerve regeneration and adaptability should also be addressed.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, search for few alternative therapeutic approaches independent of IOP reduction is highly demanded.</p><p>Critical analysis of pathophysiology of OAG in Ayurvedic perspective has four important events; first of all, <italic>Margavarana</italic> leading to <italic>Sroto-Avarodha</italic> (increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow secondary to the degeneration/sclerosis of filtering apparatus which results in increased IOP) followed by <italic>Sokshma-Sroto Sanga</italic>/<italic>Rasayani Avarodha</italic> (ischemia/hypoperfusion to ONH/nutrient channels obstruction) which may or may not be due to IOP. Third, <italic>Dhatu Rupi Ojo Hrasa</italic>/<italic>Vyadhi Kshamatva Hani</italic> (failure of local immunity) and finally <italic>Dhatu Kshaya</italic> (remodeling/changes of ONH) secondary to the above three factors occurs.</p><p>Considering the limitations of the contemporary system in managing the condition and after analyzing the <italic>Samprapti</italic> (pathophysiology) of the OAG in Ayurveda; it was planned to complement Ayurveda management with few modifications in addition to modern topical anti-glaucomatous drugs. This method was followed in one group, while the patients of control group were kept only on modern topical anti-glaucomatous drugs in another group.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Ayurvedic line of management of progressive GON.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drugs</title><p>Ingredients of trial drug Varafort powder (VFP) were procured from the Institute Pharmacy, except <italic>Swarnamakshika Bhasma</italic> (which was purchased from Dhootapapeshwar Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai, with Quality Analysis Certificate).

Such a state of improved nutrition is claimed to lead to a series of secondary attributes such as longevity, immunity against diseases, enhancing the function of sense organs, increasing the mental competence and delaying of aging. Immunomodulators are considered now as one of the most potent tools in the preservation of health and management of disease by modern medicine. VFP is a unique rejuvenating poly-herbomineral compound used in the treatment of <italic>Vataja Timira</italic>. The drug taken in a powder form offers some unique advantages such as it can be administered easily with <italic>Anupana</italic> to all people who are averse to swallow tablets/capsules and powders will have a rapid onset of action since disintegration is not required; hence, the drug was selected in powder form.</p><p><italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> group of drugs are defined as the one which apart from having <italic>Rasayana</italic> property possess the special affinity to visual apparatus resulting in vision promotion, helps in bringing homeostasis in the eye, rejuvenates the eye structurally and functionally and thus protecting the eye from easily getting afflicted by any disease. The drugs and treatment protocol selected are having antioxidants, neuroprotective, healing, adaptability, and immunity enhancing properties. The previously diagnosed patients who were on timolol/betaxolol eye drops were asked to continue their antiglaucoma topical medicines and taken under Group A. Newly diagnosed patients were advised with brimonidine eye drops after consultation with modern ophthalmologist (Group B). Brimonidine has got some neuroprotective effect with its IOP lowering effect that is why to avoid summative effect of neuroprotection of brimonidine, Group A was designed with beta-blocker eye drops.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This was also helpful to compare the neuroprotective effect of <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> and brimonidine. With this background in mind, the present clinical study was planned.</p><p>Of 102 registered patients of glaucoma, maximum patients had <italic>Swapna Viparyaya</italic> (im proper sleep pattern) and in this, about 40% patients had <italic>Alpa Nidra</italic> (insomnia) due to various causes. In the <italic>Aharaja Nidana</italic> (dietetic factor), maximum numbers of patients were having regular habit of taking <italic>Masha-Kulatha-Amla-Suktha Aharas</italic>. In the <italic>Viharaja Nidana</italic> (daily activities) a maximum number of patients had <italic>Atapa-Anala Sevana</italic> of about 23.52 % was repoted. <italic>Swapna Viparyaya</italic> leads to <italic>Agni Mandya</italic> and <italic>Vata Prakopa</italic>. <italic>Vidahi-Katu-Amla Rasa</italic> leads to <italic>Pitta-Vata Prakopa</italic> and <italic>Sama Rasa-Rakta Dhatu</italic>. The researches have shown excessive exposure to intense light (including UV radiation) may damage or cause the death of RGCs leading to formation of glaucoma. Excessive near-work requires excessive convergence, i.e., strain in the eyes which may bring the degenerative changes in the eye including trabecular meshwork resulting in glaucoma. This also causes <italic>Vata Prakopa</italic> in the <italic>Netra</italic> which brings loss of equilibrium of other two <italic>Doshas</italic> resulting in <italic>Netra Roga</italic>.</p><p>Effects of therapies were assessed in a total of 91 patients of Group A and Group B. Both the groups showed statistically highly significant results in many of the subjective as well as objective parameters. According to the percentage relief-wise observation in clinical features, few parameters showed some variations in the efficacy between the groups. On analysis of the effect of therapy, it was observed that BV, FCPG, and DDA were statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) improved in both Groups A and B. However, the percentage of improvement in Group A was greater than Group B. The literature also says that the cause for these symptoms is raised IOP. The <italic>Chakshushya</italic> drugs such as <italic>Jeevanti, Shatavari, Triphala, Rasayana Choorna</italic>, and <italic>Swarna Makshika Bhasma</italic> by virtue of their <italic>Guru-Snigdha Guna, Madhura-Kashaya-Tikta Rasa, Sheeta Veerya, Madhura Vipaka</italic>, and <italic>Jivaniya</italic>/<italic>Brimhaniya</italic> (anabolic) property might have shown this improvement. On analysis of the effect of therapy, it was observed that there was no change in the morphologic changes seen in ONH, before and after treatment in both the groups. This indicates that the visible structural damages once occurred are variable. A long period treatment protocol is required for its treatment.</p><p>The effect of therapy on BCVA in both the groups was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with equal percentage of relief (26%). BCVA is not directly related with the severity of glaucoma unless the refractive media including cornea, quality of aqueous humor and macular regions are not involved. The incidence of higher visual disturbance was greater in Group A than Group B. This may be the cause for not getting higher percentage of relief in Group A. In Group A, better control of IOP with <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> therapy and its neuroenhancer effect might have brought this much of improvement in BCVA in spite of having higher visual disturbance in the patients compared to Group B which may have accidentally occurred on its own without any bias. The effect of therapy on GAT in both the groups was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The literature says that raised IOP is one of the major risk factors for glaucoma progression and optic nerve damage. The <italic>Guru-Snigdha Guna, Madhura-Tikta-Kashaya Rasa</italic> and <italic>Sheeta Veerya</italic> checks the degeneration and enhance repairing of the tissue, there by re-establishing channels. By this way, the IOP might have better controlled in trial group than the control group where IOP was reduced by inhibiting the production of aqueous. Hence, the combined approach of modern antiglaucoma treatment along with the <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> regimen will definitely better manage the condition. Analysis showed that the effect of therapy in perimetry on NOP depressed at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 5% probability, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1% probability was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in trial group, whereas in control group for NOP depressed at &#x0003c;5%, probability was significant, and &#x0003c;1%, probability was insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5). This implies that the loss of retinal sensitivity within &#x0003c;12 dB (3&#x02013;6 dB at 5% probability and 6&#x02013;12 dB at 1% probability) was improved after treatment in Group A.</p><p>The RGCs which are the cause for the retinal sensitivity may be improving their functional level which was severely damaged earlier. This might have been occurred in many ways by the drug therapy interrupting the pathogenesis at many levels. The drugs with their <italic>Sukshma Srotogami</italic> and <italic>Marga Vishodhana</italic> property cleared the channels (removing <italic>Sanga</italic>/<italic>Margavarodha</italic>). The drugs by their <italic>Guru-Snigdha Guna, Madhura Rasa, Sheeta Veerya</italic>, and <italic>Vata Shamana</italic> properties cause <italic>Vatanulomana</italic> and <italic>Dhatu Poshana</italic> (anabolic function). The <italic>Kashaya-Tikta-Madhura Rasa</italic> might have helped in healing the degenerated <italic>Dhatu</italic>. The drugs by of their <italic>Balya-Jeevaniya</italic> (anabolic function) action strengthen the microvessels, and thus, the overall effect was improved by nourishment, healing, and regeneration of the lost tissue. This overall drug effect at multilevel improved the RGC functions, thereby improving the retinal sensitivity. This proves that the Ayurvedic <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> therapy has a significant level of effect in bringing back the lost RGCs function, especially when administered as adjuvant along with the modern antiglaucoma therapy.</p><p>Analysis of the effect of therapy on RNFL thickness showed that the superior thickness of RNFL improved statistically which was highly significan in Group A, when compared to statistically significant improvement in Group B. This is one of the important indicators to assess the structural damage for GON. RNFL thickness which was decreased before the treatment was improved after treatment significantly. This indicates improved retinal sensitivity after the treatment which also justifies the improvement of retinal sensitivity seen in the perimetry findings at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 5% and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1% probability. The mechanism of function may be similar to that as explained to effect of therapy in perimetry findings. Overall assessment of the treatment showed that in Group A, showed 1 (1.3%) eyes progression was observed, and in 85 (98.83%) eyes, there was no progression, whereas in Group B, 3 (3.40%) eyes had shown signs of progression and the rest 85 (96.59%) eyes had no progression in the disease. This proves that better prevention of rate of progression in Group A as compared to Group B, may be due to the effect of overall <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> therapy. Better maintenance of IOP during follow-up period in group A compared to Group B patients can be attributed to the effect of overall <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> therapy, effect of which was still persisting during the follow-up period of 2 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Deepana</italic>/<italic>Pachana</italic> and <italic>Koshtha-Shuddhi</italic> (digestion and metabolism) protocol as the preparatory phase was adopted in this clinical trial for relieving the <italic>Srotorodha</italic> (microchannel obstruction) thus preparing the body for <italic>Rasayana</italic> therapy.<italic>Nasya Karma</italic> (Trans nasal medication) as the main treatment protocol further helped in the microchannel clearance and revitalization of the supraclavicular structures.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> the rejuvenating/revitalizing drugs with special affinity to visual apparatus structurally and physiologically enhanced adaptability and immunity of eye thus helped in maintaining the homeostasis. Significant improvement was observed in subjective parameter in Group A such as BV, FCPG and DDA. Improvement in the MD i.e., the average retinal sensitivity in Group A (trial group) showed just significant effect on statistical analysis, whereas in Group B (control group), the response was statistically insignificant. The inference is that RGCs normal physiology may have started to reverse with <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> treatment protocol within 3 months of duration. The antioxidants, neuroprotection, healing, immunomodulatory action of flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, carbohydrates, and tannins on phytochemical analysis of compound formulation seems to be responsible for altering the status of GON.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Thus, it can be concluded that <italic>Chakshushya Rasayana</italic> protocol if administered in a systematic approach along with a modern topical antiglaucoma drops has a definite role in improving the lost retinal sensitivity as much as up to 12 dB in 3 months duration. Early intervention with this treatment protocol is expected to fourfold the outcome.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>IPGT and RA, GAU.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shields</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name></person-group><source>Shields Textbook of Glaucoma</source><year>2005</year><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Baltimore, Maryland</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams and Wilkins Publishers</publisher-name><fpage>129</fpage><comment>176</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sihota</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandon</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>Parsons Diseases of the Eye</source><year>2015</year><edition>22nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Gurgaon</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Publication</publisher-name><fpage>563</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sihota</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandon</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>Parsons Diseases of the Eye</source><year>2015</year><edition>22nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Gurgaon</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Publication</publisher-name><fpage>296</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>National Survey on Blindness.
