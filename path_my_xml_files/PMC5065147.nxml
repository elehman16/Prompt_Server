Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a program evaluation (using mixed methods) to examine features and factors that contribute to the effectiveness of a successful text messaging program in terms of increased user/participant engagement, perceived usefulness (in relation to message frequency, content and personalization), behavior change and program delivery preferences so as to inform future research and implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Design</title><p>We undertook a mixed methods approach within the Tobacco, EXercise and dieT messages (TEXT ME) single-blind RCT that aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk in 710 patients with CHD.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Results reporting clinical effectiveness of the TEXT ME intervention are reported elsewhere.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The intervention group received four text messages per week for six months (further detail on the messaging program below) in additional to usual care and the control group received usual care without the text message program. In summary, at six months, the intervention group had significantly lower LDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), smoking rates and significantly higher physical activity levels, compared to the control group.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Patients provided written informed consent and ethical approval was obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee.</p><p>The evaluation plan is summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0163929.t001">Table 1</xref>. This program evaluation was designed alongside the TEXT ME trial and therefore data were collected in parallel to the RCT. The chosen methods follow a realist evaluation model which seeks to understand human choices and actions, within a systems context.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Qualitative and quantitative data sources comprised; (i) analytic data extracted directly from the text message software system, (ii) survey of participants to identify usefulness and engagement, (iii) focus groups to identify features influencing user engagement as well as barriers and enablers to program implementation in order to understand context and mechanisms of change and; (iv) recruitment screening logs to examine generalizability and engagement. In the context of this research, the term &#x02018;engagement&#x02019; refers to the concept of user interaction with the program where it is determined by a combination of user interaction with the program and their viewpoints regarding what program features made them more likely to read and follow the advice. The combination of survey (all intervention participants invited) and focus groups allowed for synthesis of specific participant viewpoints in addition to exploration of more detailed responses via focus groups. The evaluation examined fidelity of the intervention, usefulness and user engagement as well as delivery model and content of the intervention.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0163929.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0163929.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>TEXT ME Program evaluation plan.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0163929.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0163929.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Objective</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data source/s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

Focus groups</title><p>At final follow-up, participants allocated to the TEXT ME intervention program were invited to participate in a focus group discussion. Stratified purposeful sampling was used to identify potential participants to ensure a variety of views were explored. This included ensuring participants in each focus group had a balance of gender, ethnicity, revascularization and history of cardiac rehabilitation participation. Recruitment for focus groups was consecutive until thematic saturation was achieved (determined when no new descriptive concepts were emerging). Standard focus group methods were used including the use of a facilitator (JR), scribe, setting of ground-rules and audio-recording.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A set of 12 open-ended prompts were used to guide and facilitate discussion around key topics (message delivery, content, usefulness and impact).

Surveys were analysed for themes and the results were used to guide the development of focus group discussion points. To develop a coding framework based on the focus group data, a constant comparative method was used.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Two researchers (JR, GC) independently coded transcripts, line by line, and through two iterative stages a coding framework was developed. The coders were experienced clinician (nurse and allied health) researchers with expertise in CVD management, behaviour change and mixed methods research. Data checking was achieved by discussion between members of the multidisciplinary research team who are experts in the development and evaluation of secondary prevention programs. Where disagreements existed over the interpretation of data, these were resolved by consensus. Themes were then discussed amongst the full research group for review and further analysis. Throughout the coding process we constantly compared the content with previously coded data. This iterative process including collapsing and expanding various codes and themes until no new concepts were emerging. Direct quotations from the focus groups were used to illustrate some key emergent themes. In accordance with focus group methods, analysis examined the perspective of individuals and as well as emerging consensus between the participants around the issues being discussed.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 352 participants who received the text messaging program, 307 (87%) completed the user survey at six months.

During the intervention period, participants were asked not to respond to messages they received, however, we still received a total of 308 text message replies from 116 unique mobile telephone numbers. Most of the replies received were related to saying thank you (39%) but others were to provide feedback about behavior (18%), to make a general comment (16%), to unsubscribe (12%), request further information (7%), extraneous comment unrelated to the program (6%) or were complaints (2%).</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Factors influencing user engagement with the text message program</title><p>Analysis of qualitative data collected in the focus groups confirmed a high level of user engagement.

User engagement was also demonstrated by the fact that despite participants being asked not to respond to messages we received a total of 403 text message replies from 134 distinct mobile telephone numbers during the six month intervention period. Most of the replies received were related to saying thank you (30%), to provide feedback about a healthy behavior (14%) or to make a general comment (12%). As further evidence of engagement, in the user survey, 96% of participants reported that during the course of the program they read at least three-quarters of all text messages.

The Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills Theoretical Model[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] could primarily explain the observed behavior change associated with the TEXT ME program. This theory states that if a person is well-informed, motivated to act, and they have the skills and confidence to take action, they are more likely to initiate and maintain health-promoting behaviors that produce positive outcomes.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In the context of our messaging program, a theme emerged that participants felt motivated and engaged by the program when it provided credible and meaningful information with illustrative quotations links with this theory including:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;So the messages prompt me to research all my medications&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;D&#x0201d;, male, 65, FG2)</p><p>&#x0201c;I actually researched how many calories you should eat in a day and what&#x02019;s in everything and I set a spreadsheet and I started calculating what you should eat and what you shouldn&#x02019;t eat.&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;A&#x0201d;, male, 50, FG4)</p><p>&#x0201c;Any info is good.

Social cognitive theory[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggests that human behavior is determined by a combination of cognitive, personal and environmental influences. These reflect an interaction between thought, affect and action where expectations, beliefs, self- perceptions, goals and intentions give shape and direction to behavior.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Further, behaviour is modified based on whether the individual has high or low self-efficacy toward the behavior, the response a person receives after performing the behavior and aspects of the environment that improve self-efficacy including the setting of achievable goals. In the current text messaging program, social recognition, improved self-efficacy, the provision of achievable task-setting suggestions, practical advice and positive reinforcement were all built into the program[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and quotes illustrating their successful implementation are below.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;I found the program encouraging&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;B&#x0201d;, female, 60, FG1)</p><p>&#x0201c;It gives a good feeling just knowing that there is someone else who cares and kept an eye on it/you like a good link&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;K&#x0201d;, male, 58, FG1)</p><p>&#x0201c;It made me feel good when sometimes I already did my exercise and then got a message about it.

This type of conditioning was first reported by Ivan Pavlov where he demonstrated that dogs learned a stimulus-response connection in response to repeated stimuli such that a previously neutral stimulus eventually elicits a response.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Our qualitative data suggest that over time participants became &#x02018;conditioned&#x02019; towards healthy behaviors irrespective of the specific content of the individual messages received at a certain time. That is, through repeated presentation of a stimulus (in this case cardiovascular health related text messages) the participants eventually learned to associate the stimulus with overall cardiovascular health behaviour and consequently messages about diet also resulting in improved physical activity and vice versa. The notion that the program evoked a feeling of feeling &#x0201c;guilty&#x0201d; could also contribute to conditioning where the feeling of guilt is a noxious stimuli associated with &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; behaviour.

Results suggest that engagement was increased by several factors including the program being initiated close to the time of hospitalisation, the consistency of the messages with prior in-hospital education and management, having the opportunity for face-to-face contact at program commencement and the personalization of messages. We found features that impacted on behavioural change were the positive content, the sense of feeling supported, the delivery time being random and that most participants felt program duration could have been longer than six months. Through thematic analysis this research has identified several potential drivers of behavior change within a text messaging program and therefore facilitates understanding of components of the intervention that may increase effectiveness.</p><p>The primary goal of this evaluation was to help with understanding why text message-based programs for people with CHD are effective, the ingredients for success and how engagement can be optimized so as to inform development of other text message programs aimed at behavioural change in patients with other type of chronic disease.

The study concluded that the message program was acceptable, relevant, provided practical support for patients and that intervention success coincided with participant readiness for change.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Similar to our study, Leon et al[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that most participants found the text messages with practical tips for healthy living were most useful, that the messages improved adherence, that participants were comfortable receiving the messages and that a polite and respectful tone was important.</p><p>Understanding the theory associated with behavior change allows consideration of hypothesized causal processes involved.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In the case of the TEXT ME messaging program, the messages themselves were based on theory[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and understanding the factors influencing engagement and the mechanisms associated with the observed clinical outcomes[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is important for scalability, uptake and future implementation. Gaining an understanding of these mechanisms informs development of future content, delivery frequency and structure. Insight into the mechanisms of behavior change augments the clinical outcomes and ultimately enables a deeper understanding of the effectiveness. This level of analysis is important because ultimately a person&#x02019;s behaviour is the result of their individual or collective action and it is a key determinant of health.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] This concept is particularly important in relation to CHD where lifestyle risk factors are leading contributors to morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The behaviours that cause and contribute to CHD are common and changing them often means a person is required to make multiple and long-term changes to their everyday behavior. For example, a person may be recommended to stop smoking, increase their physical activity level and take daily medications for the remainder of their life. A National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline highlights the importance of identification and evaluation of mechanisms associated with behaviour change and that mixed method ethnographic research, longitudinal studies and qualitative approaches are needed.[<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Gaining an understanding of underlying theoretical factors influencing behaviour help establish why an intervention is working so as to inform decisions relating to implementation and improvement [<xref rid="pone.0163929.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>While this mixed methods evaluation provides significant insight into the potential mechanisms of intervention effectiveness and opportunities for optimising engagement, the study is not without limitations. Firstly, the sample was recruited from within a RCT from a tertiary hospital which might limit the generalisability of the intervention, however this hospital has broad socioeconomic and multicultural representation. Secondly, our sample size for women was small and therefore examination of gender differences requires further investigation. It is acknowledged that we did not stratify for age and that there were more people with higher years of education participating in the focus groups and that our findings will vary between individuals and naturally certain groups should not be denied access to potential interventions. The qualitative nature of this research enables features to be examined in detail and allows consideration of human experience. Future research is needed to identify the effectiveness of various program design features. For example, to specifically determine whether it is ideal to offer one-way or two-way communication or whether this should be offered to participants by choice. In addition, future research could clearly define the ideal message delivery frequency, timing and the ideal program duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This process evaluation found that patients with CHD were engaged with and positive about a text message program aimed at supporting behaviour change. Exploring the theoretical frameworks provides insight into the causal pathway between the text-message intervention, behavior change and impact on risk factor measures. Gaining an understanding of the factors that influence engagement with the program as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various program characteristics can inform the development of other programs, identifies the key elements important to maintain in larger-scale programs and gives clues to the directions of future research to improve programs and support their sustained effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0163929.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Focus Group Demographic information.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0163929.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0163929.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Survey Group Demographic information</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0163929.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Westmead Hospital Cardiologists for supporting the recruitment and TEXT ME program development at Westmead hospital: Robert Abraham, FRACP, Mikhail Altman, PhD,William Chik, PhD, James Chong, PhD, Mark Cooper, PhD, Lloyd Davis, PhD, A.
