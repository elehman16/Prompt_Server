Whether IPTc provides additional protection to children sleeping under an ITN has not been established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>To assess whether IPTc provides additional protection to children sleeping under an ITN, we conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IPTc with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) in three localities in Kati, Mali. After screening, eligible children aged 3&#x02013;59 mo were given a long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) and randomised to receive three rounds of active drugs or placebos. Treatments were administered under observation at monthly intervals during the high malaria transmission season in August, September, and October 2008. Adverse events were monitored immediately after the administration of each course of IPTc and throughout the follow-up period. The primary endpoint was clinical episodes of malaria recorded through passive surveillance by study clinicians available at all times during the follow-up. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 150 randomly selected children weekly and in all children at the end of the malaria transmission season to assess usage of ITNs and the impact of IPTc on the prevalence of malaria, anaemia, and malnutrition. Cox regression was used to compare incidence rates between intervention and control arms. The effects of IPTc on the prevalence of malaria infection and anaemia were estimated using logistic regression. 3,065 children were screened and 3,017 (1,508 in the control and 1,509 in the intervention arm) were enrolled in the study. 1,485 children (98.5&#x00025;) in the control arm and 1,481 (98.1&#x00025;) in the intervention arm completed follow-up. During the intervention period, the proportion of children reported to have slept under an ITN was 99.7&#x00025; in the control and 99.3&#x00025; in intervention arm (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.45). A total of 672 episodes of clinical malaria defined as fever or a history of fever and the presence of at least 5,000 asexual forms of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> per microlitre (incidence rate of 1.90; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] 1.76&#x02013;2.05 episodes per person year) were observed in the control arm versus 126 (incidence rate of 0.34; 95&#x00025; CI 0.29&#x02013;0.41 episodes per person year) in the intervention arm, indicating a protective effect (PE) of 82&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 78&#x00025;&#x02013;85&#x00025;) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) on the primary endpoint. There were 15 episodes of severe malaria in children in the control arm compared to two in children in the intervention group giving a PE of 87&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 42&#x00025;&#x02013;99&#x00025;) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).

Malaria also causes severe morbidity in children, such as anemia, low birth-weight, epilepsy, and neurological problems, which compromise the health and development of millions of children living in malaria endemic areas. As much of the impact of malaria on African children can be effectively prevented, significant efforts have been made in recent years to improve malaria control, such as the implementation of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria.</p><p>IPT involves administration of antimalarial drugs at defined time intervals to individuals, regardless of whether they are known to be infected with malaria, to prevent morbidity and mortality. IPT was initially recommended for pregnant women and recently this strategy was extended to include infants (IPTi). Now, there is also intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in children (IPTc), which is designed to protect against seasonal malaria transmission including those above one year of age.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Large clinical trials have shown that IPTc involving the administration of two to three doses of an antimalarial drug (sulphadoxine pyrimethamine [SP] and artesunate [AS] or amodiaquine [AQ]) during the high malaria transmission season effectively reduces the incidence of malaria. However, these studies were conducted in countries where the use of insecticide-treated bednets&#x02014;an intervention that provides at least 50&#x00025; protection against morbidity from malaria and is the main tool used for malaria control in most of sub-Saharan Africa&#x02014;was relatively low. Therefore, it is unclear whether IPTc will be as effective in children who sleep under insecticide-treated bednets as has been previously shown in communities where insecticide-treated bednet usage is low. So to determine the answer to this important question, the researchers conducted a randomized, placebo controlled trial of IPTc with SP&#x0002b;AQ (chosen because of the effectiveness of this combination in a pilot study) in children who slept under an insecticide-treated bednet in an area of seasonal malaria transmission in Mali.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled 3,017 eligible children aged 3&#x02013;59 months into a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during the 2008 malaria transmission season in Mali. All children were given a long-lasting insecticide-treated bednet at the start of the study with instructions to their family on the correct use of the net. Children were then randomized into two arms&#x02014;1,509 were allocated to the intervention group and 1,508 to the control group&#x02014;to receive three courses of IPTc with SP plus AQ or placebos given at monthly intervals during the peak malaria transmission season. The researchers monitored the incidence of malaria throughout the malaria season and also monitored the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets throughout the study period. In addition, researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey in 150 randomly selected children every week and in every child enrolled in the trial 6 weeks after the last course of IPTc, to measure their temperature, height and weight, and blood hemoglobin and parasite level.</p><p>The number of children who slept under their long-lasting insecticide-treated bednet was similar in both arms. During the intervention period, the researchers observed a total of 672 episodes of clinical malaria (defined as fever or a history of fever and the presence of at least 5,000 asexual forms of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> per microliter) in the control arm versus 126 episodes in the intervention arm, which is an incidence rate of 1.90 episodes per person year in the control arm versus 0.34 in the interventions arm&#x02014;giving a protective efficacy of 87&#x00025;. IPTc reduced the prevalence of malaria infection during the intervention period by 85&#x00025; and by 46&#x00025; at the end of the intervention period. The prevalence of moderate anemia was also reduced (by 47&#x00025;) at the end of intervention period. The frequencies of adverse events were similar between the two arms and there were no drug-related serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The results of this study show that in peak malarial transmission season in Mali, IPTc provides substantial additional protection against episodes of clinical malaria and severe malaria in children sleeping under long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets. In addition, intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with SP plus AQ appears to be safe and well tolerated for use in children.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000407">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000407</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This topic is further discussed in two <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> research articles by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000408">Konat et al.</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000409">Bojang et al.</ext-link>, and a <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> Perspective by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000410">Beeson</ext-link>

About 300 million people live in areas where malaria transmission is highly seasonal. Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is estimated to cause 881,000 deaths globally per year and sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately affected, suffering 91&#x00025; of global malaria deaths with 88&#x00025; occurring in children under 5 y of age <xref rid="pmed.1000407-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, in the absence of a vaccine, simple and effective control strategies are urgently needed to reduce the malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Vector control, using insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), insecticide-treated curtains, or indoor residual spraying (IRS), can reduce mortality and morbidity from malaria substantially <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Lengeler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but in high transmission settings, these interventions provide only partial protection and additional control measures are needed.</p><p>Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is a new approach in the prevention of malaria in infants and older children. Several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that IPT of malaria in infants (IPTi) with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) given during routine vaccinations at approximately 2, 3, and 9 mo of age, reduces the incidence of clinical malaria by 22&#x00025; to 59&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and this strategy has been shown to be safe and cost effective. However, in many regions of Africa, the main burden of malaria falls not on infants but on older children <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In parts of Africa, such as much of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, where malaria transmission is very seasonal, the incidence of severe malaria currently peaks at 2 to 3 y of age. As the overall incidence of malaria decreases in Africa in response to enhanced control efforts, an effect already being seen in some countries, it can be anticipated that the mean age of cases of malaria will increase further. For these reasons, trials have been undertaken in areas of seasonal malaria transmission to determine whether IPT in children (IPTc) could be used as an effective malaria control tool in older children. In Mali, a 69&#x00025; reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria was seen in children 0&#x02013;5 y old when two doses of SP were given 8 wk apart during the malaria transmission season <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In Senegal, SP plus a single dose of artesunate (AS), administered on three occasions at monthly intervals during the peak malaria season, reduced the incidence of clinical malaria by 86&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A subsequent trial of different drug regimens showed that IPT with SP and amodiaquine (AQ) was even more effective than SP&#x0002b;AS, providing approximately 95&#x00025; protection <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Sokhna1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A further study, conducted in an area of Ghana with more prolonged transmission, found that AS&#x0002b;AQ monthly was more effective than AS&#x0002b;AQ or SP alone given every 2 mo, suggesting that for drugs such as SP and AQ, monthly administration is needed to achieve effective IPTc <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Bednet coverage among young children was low at each of the sites where these trials were conducted and use of ITNs was very uncommon. Use of ITNs is now a favoured approach to the control of malaria in most parts of Africa and major efforts are being made to scale up their use. With international support, ITN coverage is increasing in many malaria endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Steketee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and it is expected that almost universal coverage with ITNs in high risk groups, as called for in the Global Malaria Action Plan <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Roll1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, will be achieved in many malaria endemic countries. Thus, following on the initial encouraging results obtained with IPTc, an issue that needs to be addressed urgently is whether IPTc can provide significant added benefit to the protection against malaria provided by ITNs to warrant its use as a malaria control tool in areas with seasonal transmission of malaria and a high use of ITNs. It was initially planned to address this question simultaneously in each of the three countries Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, using a similar design and methods. However, the site in Ghana had to be abandoned because of delays in obtaining regulatory approval for the use of SP&#x0002b;AQ, the drug combination chosen for the study on the basis of the results of previous trials and knowledge of the sensitivity of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> to these drugs in the proposed study areas. Very similar protocols were used for the studies conducted in Burkina Faso and Mali.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol of the trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s001">Text S1</xref>), protocol amendment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s005">Text S5</xref>), and CONSORT checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s002">Text S2</xref>) are available as supporting information.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to determine the degree to which IPTc given during the malaria transmission season reduces the incidence of clinical malaria in children who sleep under a long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN).

Recruitment was started in Djoliba followed by Siby. In these communities all available children in the target age group who were not selected for the baseline survey of drug resistance were screened and enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria. In the larger community of Ouelessebougou, children were screened for enrolment on a first-come first-served basis until the required sample size was met. Children were eligible to join the study if they were aged 3&#x02013;59 mo at the time of enrolment and permanent residents of the study area with no intention of leaving during the study period. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a severe, chronic illness, such as severe malnutrition or AIDS, and a history of a significant adverse reaction to SP or AQ. Cases of an acute illness, such as malaria, were not excluded. Such cases were treated appropriately and the child randomised and retained in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry, University of Bamako, Mali and by the Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Community consent was obtained at meetings with leaders, heads of families, and other community members of each locality prior to the start of the study. Individual, written, informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian of each child prior to screening and enrolment. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established and monitored the trial with the support of a local medical safety monitor. Current good clinical practices (cGCP) monitoring of the trial was performed by PharmaClin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pharmaclin.com">http://www.pharmaclin.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Interventions</title><p>Every child who was screened was provided with a LLIN (Permanet, Vestergaard Frandsen) that was marked with the child's identification number regardless of whether or not the child was enrolled. Instructions were given to the parent or guardian on how to use the net and the importance of using the net regularly was emphasized. Monitoring of utilisation of ITNs by study participants was made in 150 randomly selected children each week and in all study children during the cross-sectional survey conducted at the end of the malaria transmission season.</p><p>Eligible children were treated with a course of SP&#x0002b;AQ or matching placebos on three occasions at monthly intervals during the malaria transmission season, starting in August 2008. SP and AQ were manufactured by Kinapharma Limited and quality control checks on the drugs for solubility and content were performed at the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, prior to their use in the trial. Tablets met internal standards for drug solubility and content. Doses of SP and AQ were based on weight with children stratified into one of the three weight categories (5&#x02013;9 kg, 10&#x02013;18 kg, and &#x02265;19 kg). SP was given at a dose of 175/8.75 mg to children 5&#x02013;9 kg, 350/17.5 mg to children 10&#x02013;18 kg, and 550/26.25 mg to those who weighed &#x02265;19 kg. The corresponding doses for AQ were 70 mg, 140 mg, and 220 mg, respectively. AQ was given over 3 d. Drugs were prepackaged to facilitate administration and put in envelopes with colour codes, one for each weight group. Within each weight stratum, children were individually randomised using a computer-generated random number sequence and blocks of varying length. Treatment allocations were provided within sealed, opaque envelopes.</p><p>Drugs were given under direct observation at a research clinic by study staff. Children were observed for 30 min after drug administration. If vomiting occurred during this 30-min period, drugs were readministered. If vomiting occurred on a second occasion, this was noted but the drugs were not given again. Such children were not excluded from the trial and they were eligible to receive drugs on the subsequent 2 d and during subsequent monthly IPT rounds. If a child missed the day set for treatment, a home visit was made to enquire why the child had not been brought for treatment and the reason was recorded. If the family wished to continue with treatment but was unable to attend on the specified day, then treatment was reoffered within an interval of 7 d of the designated date. Children with an acute malaria episode were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and did not receive IPT with SP&#x0002b;AQ if the treatment for acute malaria was received within 7 d of the scheduled date of IPT. Such children were eligible for treatment in future treatment rounds</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of clinical malaria; this was defined as the presence of fever (axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C) or a history of fever in the past 24 h and the presence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual parasitaemia at a density greater or equal to 5,000 parasites per microlitre.

Parents were encouraged to bring their child to a study health centre, where medical staff were available 24 h a day and 7 d a week, if the child became unwell. A finger prick blood sample was be obtained from all study children with fever (an axillary temperature of 37.5&#x000b0;C or higher) or a history of fever within the previous 24 h for preparation of a blood film, measurement of Hb concentration, and for a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) OPTIMAL_IT (Diamed AG) for malaria. Children who had a positive RDT for malaria were treated immediately with AL. Severe cases were admitted to the health centre or referred to the paediatric ward of the Gabriel Tour&#x000e9; Hospital in Bamako. Causes of death were assessed within a month of death using a modified version of the INDEPTH post mortem questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indepth-network.org/index.php?option=com_content&#x00026;task=view&#x00026;id=95&#x00026;Itemid=183">http://www.indepth-network.org/index.php?option=com_content&#x00026;task=view&#x00026;id=95&#x00026;Itemid=183</ext-link>).</p><p>Use of a LLIN was assessed by asking if a child had slept under an LLIN the previous night and the presence of the net was checked by field staff. During these home visits, the axillary temperature of each child was taken and a blood film obtained regardless of whether or not the child had fever. A RDT was performed if a child had measured fever or a history of fever within the previous 24 h and if this was positive, treatment with AL was given according to national guidelines. At the end of the malaria transmission season, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken at which every child was examined, their height and weight recorded, and a finger prick blood sample obtained for determination of Hb concentration, preparation of blood films, and collection of a filter paper sample for subsequent molecular studies. Safety and tolerability of SP and AQ were monitored passively during the study period in all the children and actively in a subset at the time of the administration of IPT (days 0, 1, and 2) and 1 d after the last dose of treatment (day 3) at each round.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Assessment of Molecular Markers of Drug Resistance</title><p>Monitoring of the frequency of molecular markers of resistance to sulphadoxine, pyrimethamine, and AQ was performed in two cross-sectional surveys, the first at baseline in August 2008 and the second during the survey undertaken at the end of malaria transmission season. The baseline survey was conducted in 256 children randomly selected from the screening list. These children were not enrolled in the placebo control trial. Participants enrolled in the placebo control trial were surveyed about 6 wk after the third course of IPTc, at the end of malaria transmission season, to assess whether administration of IPT with SP&#x0002b;AQ had lead to an increase in molecular markers of resistance to these drugs. Thick and thin blood smears and blood blotted onto filter papers were collected during both surveys for molecular analysis as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Thick blood films were air dried, stained with Giemsa, and examined for malaria parasites by two well-trained technicians. 100 high power fields were counted before a film was declared negative.

In the case of a discrepancy (positive/negative or a difference in parasite density greater than 30&#x00025;), a third reading was done. The median parasite density of two or three readings was used. An external quality control of slide reading performed by the Malaria Diagnosis Centre of Excellence (MDCoE) of the Walter Reed/Kenya Medical Research Institute, in Kisumu, Kenya, showed an overall concordance of more than 90&#x00025; on parasite detection and 100&#x00025; on species identification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s004">Text S4</xref>).

The study was not powered to detect a smaller reduction in the incidence of severe malaria but the analysis plan included provision for combination of the results of this trial with those of a parallel study conducted in Burkina Faso to provide sufficient size to allow detection of a smaller impact of IPTc on this end point.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Data Management and Analysis</title><p>Data were collected on standardized forms, double-entered, and verified using MS Access and then exported to Stata (StataCorp) for additional cleaning and analysis. A data analysis plan was written and submitted to the DSMB prior to analysis. The final, cleaned database was locked and a copy sent to the DSMB. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Incidence rates of clinical malaria, severe malaria, and hospital admissions were calculated by dividing the number of episodes by the total child days at risk. Children were not considered at risk for 21 d after each type of a malaria episode and these days were not included in the calculation of the child days at risk. The incidence rates in the two treatment groups were compared using Cox regression to estimate the incidence rate ratio, with adjustment for age, gender, and locality, and using a robust standard error to allow for the lack of independence among repeated episodes in the same child. The protective effect (PE) of IPTc was computed as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio. Time to first episode of clinical malaria in the two arms was examined using Kaplan-Meier plots and compared using log rank test.

This level of protective efficacy is similar to that reported in a previous trial conducted in an area of Senegal with a coverage of ITNs of less than 1&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, suggesting that the relative efficacy of IPTc is not reduced by the use of an ITN at the time of the intervention. Two studies have shown that in pregnant women, IPT adds little benefit to the protection afforded by an ITN, at least in multigravidae <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Mbaye1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Menndez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This finding is not the case for IPTc in children, as the strategy remained highly efficacious even when deployed in a community with a high usage of ITNs.</p><p>Despite the large difference in background incidence of malaria in the three sites, suggesting high variability in transmission intensity, the protective efficacy of IPTc against clinical malaria was high and similar between the three sites. This suggests that similar efficacies of IPTc against clinical malaria can be expected in areas with different transmission intensities and baseline ITN coverage. Surprisingly, Siby and Ouelessebougou, which had a low EIR (less than ten infective bites per person/season), had a higher malaria attack rate than Djoliba, which had a higher EIR (37 infective bites per person/season). High malaria infection and attack rates have been reported previously in the context of a low EIR (3.5 infective bites per person/season) in Mali <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Sagara1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and similar malaria incidence rates were found in children aged 0&#x02013;5 y in two areas despite a more than 10-fold difference in EIR <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Dicko3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, these apparently anomalous results could have also been due to imprecision in the determination of the EIR, which can vary markedly with time and space or to a difference in the efficiency of transmission. Early detection and treatment of malaria cases is known to reduce hospital admission and deaths due to malaria <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Sirima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kidane1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Early detection and prompt treatment was available in our carefully controlled study and the protective effect of IPTc on severe malaria or death might be more marked than we observed if IPTc was deployed in a community that did not have such ready access to health care. Parasite prevalence, as assessed by weekly surveys during the intervention period was reduced by 85&#x00025; in children who received IPTc, but this difference dropped to 46&#x00025; at the end of the intervention period suggesting that the prophylactic effect of the last dose of SP&#x0002b;AQ had begun to decline 6 wk after administration, as has been found in studies of IPTi <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Cairns1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>We observed a 47&#x00025; reduction in the proportion of children with moderately severe anaemia (Hb &#x0003c;8 g/dl) as a result of administration of IPTc. This impact on anaemia is consistent with the reduction of 45&#x00025; in incidence of anaemia observed when AS&#x0002b;AQ was given at monthly intervals over 6 mo in Ghana, although in the Ghanaian study there was no difference in the proportion of children with anaemia at the end of the 6-mo intervention <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We did not detect any difference between the intervention and control arms in wasting, stunting, or under weight. This finding is consistent with a previous study in Senegal <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ntab1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which did not find evidence of an impact of IPTc on wasting, stunting, or being under weight at the end of the transmission season but only on triceps and subscapular skinfold, indicators that were not assessed in our study. However, in line with the Senegalese study, we found an increase in weight gain in the IPTc arm compared to the control arm during the course of the intervention period. More marked effects on nutritional measurements were found during a parallel study conducted in Burkina Faso <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, perhaps because the force of infection was higher in the Burkina Faso than in the Mali study areas and malaria, thus, a more important contributor to impairment of weight gain in the Burkina Faso than in the Mali study areas.</p><p>SP&#x0002b;AQ was chosen as the drug combination for use in the trial on the basis of the results of previous studies that had shown this to be an effective combination for IPTc. This drug combination was generally well tolerated and no serious adverse event attributable to the study drugs was reported. The proportions of children with mild-to-moderate adverse events using active surveillance were not significantly different between the two arms, although there was a trend towards a higher frequency of vomiting and loss of appetite in the intervention group. In the parallel study in Burkina using the same drugs, a higher frequency of vomiting was found in the intervention arm <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, even in the placebo group the frequency of vomiting was higher than in this study, suggesting a difference in the way in which minor side effects were solicited in the two study areas. Cisse et al. <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> reported a modest increase in vomiting in children who took SP&#x0002b;AS compared to those who took placebo in Senegal, while Kweku et al. <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> found no difference in incidence of these adverse events between IPTc intervention and control arms when using SP or AQ. Four withdrawals in the intervention arm were reported to be due to reactions to study drugs. In two cases, the presence of a skin rash was confirmed, another child had itching, and the final withdrawal followed the occurrence of an acute respiratory tract infection at the time of administration of the first round of IPTc. It is possible that this event was considered by the parents as a reaction to the study drugs. The safety of SP and AQ has been a concern in relation to their use for IPTc <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, there is a growing body of evidence from studies in the last few years <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> that these drugs are safe when used for IPT in pregnant women, infants, or children, and no safety concerns have arisen following the use of SP&#x0002b;AQ for IPTc on a large scale in Senegal.</p><p>The efficacy of IPTc against clinical malaria has now been demonstrated in a number of studies, including the current trial and a parallel one conducted in Burkina Faso <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Konat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Is the evidence now strong enough to support the introduction of IPTc into countries with seasonal malaria transmission? Evidence from studies of IPT in infants <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Cairns2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Cairns3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> suggests that prophylaxis is the key protective mechanism of IPT and that long-acting drugs are needed for effective IPTc. Currently, the SP&#x0002b;AQ combination meets this requirement in West Africa where both of these drugs are still reasonably effective as has been shown to be the case in the study area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s006">Text S6</xref>). Studies conducted in Senegal and in Ghana <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Sokhna1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> have compared different drug combination and regimens and shown that currently SP&#x0002b;AQ at monthly intervals is the best combination. However, the continuing efficacy of SP cannot be guaranteed and alternative regimens for IPTc will be required in the future, which might include the long-acting drug piperaquine.</p><p>Unlike the case of IPT in pregnant women and infants, IPT in children has no established delivery system, raising concerns as to whether it could be implemented as a control measure. However, studies conducted in Ghana and The Gambia have shown that high coverage with IPTc can be obtained using community health workers <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Kweku2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Bojang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and this appears the most promising way of delivering this intervention.</p><p>Another concern over the widespread deployment of IPTc is that this will enhance the spread of drug resistance. Therefore, we studied the presence of molecular markers associated with resistance before and after the intervention in children in the intervention or control group. The <italic>dhfr 59</italic> and <italic>dhps 437</italic> mutations associated with pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine resistance, respectively, were found significantly more frequently at the end of the malaria transmission season in parasites obtained from children in the intervention group than in those obtained from children in the control group, and this led to higher frequencies of the triple <italic>dhfr</italic> mutants and the quadruple mutant (triple <italic>dhfr &#x0002b; dhps 437</italic>) associated with significant resistance to SP in children who had received IPTc. This increase in the frequency of these mutations is consistent with a previous report in Senegal <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Ciss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. As in Senegal, the number of children in the intervention group carrying a resistant parasite was less than in children in the control group because of the substantial reduction in the overall prevalence of parasitaemia. Although IPTc may have contributed to the increase in frequency of some of resistant markers in this and other studies, the true impact on the resistance of SP and AQ remains to be established. Despite a prevalence of quadruple mutants of about 37&#x00025;, the SP&#x0002b;AQ combination was highly effective in clearing parasitaemia from children resident in the study area with asymptomatic parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000407.s006">Text S6</xref>).</p><p>As is the case with any successful malaria intervention, administration of IPTc to children during several, successive malaria transmission seasons could interfere with the development of naturally acquired immunity, raising concerns that there would be an increased period of risk (rebound malaria) during the period immediately after the intervention was stopped if exposure levels remained high. The risk of malaria for children in this trial in the year after the intervention was stopped has been studied and the results are currently being analysed. However, several years of administration would be needed to define the degree to which acquisition of natural immunity would be impaired. It is very unlikely that this would outbalance the substantial gains made during the period when the drug was given.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, the double-blind, randomised controlled design prevented a number of biases in the selection assignment of the participants to the two arms as well as in assessing the outcomes. A second strength is that this is the largest IPTc efficacy trial done so far, providing a more precise estimation of the outcomes measured. Third, the trial was conducted in three localities with different malaria incidence rates, allowing the efficacy of this strategy under different levels of malaria transmission to be assessed. The design would have been stronger if a factorial design had been used to assess the individual and combined impact of IPTc and ITN, but such a trial would be unethical as the efficacy of ITN is already established <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Lengeler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and use of ITNs is policy in Mali. Other potential limitations of the study include the duration of evaluation, which focused only on about 15 wk of follow-up during the malaria transmission season. However, it is well established that the in the Sahel region of Mali, 85&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; of clinical malaria cases occur during the period of August to November, and efficacy of this strategy remained high in a previous, smaller study when efficacy was computed over 12 mo period <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000407-Dicko4" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, IPTc given during the malaria transmission season, provided substantial additional protection against clinical malaria, infection with malaria, and anaemia to that provided by ITNs. IPTc with SP&#x0002b;AQ was safe and well tolerated. As the international community moves towards the target of malaria elimination, new malaria control tools will be needed <xref rid="pmed.1000407-Roll1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. IPT in children targeting the transmission season appears to be one of the strongest available tools to achieve this goal. Our findings support the need for an early review of whether IPTc can now be recommended as a component of malaria control in areas with seasonal malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol: A trial of the combined impact of IPT and ITNs on morbidity from malaria in African children.</p><p>(0.19 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.22 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s003"><label>Text S3</label><caption><p>Entomological investigations.</p><p>(0.45 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s004"><label>Text S4</label><caption><p>External quality assurance of malaria microscopic diagnosis.</p><p>(0.10 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s005"><label>Text S5</label><caption><p>Protocol amendment.</p><p>(0.11 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000407.s006"><label>Text S6</label><caption><p>In vivo efficacy of the SP&#x0002b;AQ combination used for IPTc in the study area.</p><p>(0.51 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000407.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to the study participants, the populations, the members of community health associations, and the staff of the health centres of Djoliba, Siby, and Ouelessebougou for their cooperation throughout the study.
