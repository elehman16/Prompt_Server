However, the ideal agent has not identified yet, and there is not an agent meet all of the mentioned criteria.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Different agents including talc, antimalarials (quinacrine, mepacrine), antineoplastic (bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, mitomicin, etc.), antibiotics (tetracyclines, minocycline, doxycycline), silver nitrate (SN), immunomodulating and biological agents have been investigated and different results have been achieved.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It seems that the ideal pleural sclerosing agent for each setting should be selected according to the characteristics of the patients and facilities of the center.</p><p>Silver nitrate and tetracycline are the most commonly used chemicals for pleurodesis.

The results indicated that effectiveness of the two agents was similar but regarding the complications, SN was a more appropriate agent.</p><p>As mentioned, there is much debate regarding selection of the most appropriate chemical agent for pleurodesis. According to the report of a review study, the most effective agents are oral forms of tetracycline derivatives, quinacrine, SN, iodopovidone, and talc.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Though many novel agents such as doxcycline have been introduced also,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but we studied the effectiveness of agents which most commonly used in our settings. However, Shouman <italic>et al</italic>. have indicated that the most important factors for choosing a sclerosing agent in developing countries are the drug availability and cost.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In this study, breast and lung cancer were the most common types of malignancies that result in MPE in both studied groups. It was in line with other studies. Previous studies indicated that about 75% of MPE are secondary to the lungs, breast cancers or lymphoma.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In another study in 50&#x02013;65% of cases of MPE, lung and breast cancer were the most frequent causes.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The success rate of pleurodesis in SN and tetracycline groups were 76% and 84%, respectively. Though our results were similar to the rates have been reported in previous studies,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but comparing the effectiveness of studied agents with other studies is so difficult due to the fact that different doses of the agents and various techniques for pleurodesis including tube size, differences in tube thoracostomy procedure and various definitions for success rate was applied.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Success rate of the two studied agents was similar in the current study.</p><p>There were few studies that compare these two therapeutic agents. Most of them were experimental and compared the agents with others. In addition, there was not any clinical trial for comparing the two agents. The first experimental study that compared the effectiveness of SN versus tetracycline was carried out in rabbits by Vargas <italic>et al</italic>. in Brazil. They showed that intrapleural injection of 0.50% SN produced an effective pleurodesis as well as 35 mg/kg tetracycline with no significant side effects. They concluded that SN is comparable to tetracycline.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>There were many studies regarding the effectiveness of SN and tetracycline.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Evidences indicated that tetracycline stimulates mesothelial cell release of growth factors for fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen. It is dose-dependent effective inhibitors of the matrix-degrading metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the pleural fluid. Therefore, it reduces the activity of MMPs and remodels the tissues by normal repairs not fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The doses of tetracycline that used in current study was higher than prior studies (2.5 g vs. 0.5&#x02013;1.5 g in other studies),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] whereas the success rate of studies which used lower doses of tetracycline were similar to ours, so it is recommended to study different doses of tetracycline for pleurodesis in patients with MPE.</p><p>The effectiveness of SN for pleurodesis is due to its induced caustic injury to the mesothelium, and its effectiveness has been proven in many experimental and few clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] According to that studies SN 0.5% could be an appropriate alternative to tetracycline with low adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of low dose SN that is, 0.1% for pleurodesis.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] It could be also used used in some conditions such as an early bronchopleural fistula.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In our study, SN had similar success rate to tetracycline and lower side effect. Its priority to tetracycline was its lower adverse effects. Considering that a lower dose of SN (0.1) could have a similar effect and obviously lower adverse consequences, so further studies for evaluating different doses of SN would be more practical.</p><p>The main limitation of our study was the small sample size of patients.</p><p>The strength of the current study was its design. Because most of the previous studies were experimental and in animals, and there were few clinical trials in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The findings of the current study showed that SN is at least as effective as tetracycline. In addition, its side effects were lower than tetracycline. Other advantages of SN are its low cost, availability and safety. For more accurate results, it is recommended to design further trials with larger sample size and with lower doses of both SN and tetracycline.</p><p>In addition, it seems that comparing the effectiveness and complications of other low-cost agents with SN would be more helpful to obtain more accurate and practical results in this field.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
