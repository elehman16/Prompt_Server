Patients were allowed background disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and previously discontinued &#x02265;1 tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; inhibitors for lack of efficacy/intolerance. Primary end point was American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at 24&#x02005;weeks. This study was terminated early due to futility.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Most patients had moderate-to-high baseline disease activity. There was no significant difference in week 24 ACR20 responses between 120/Q4W, 90/Q2W, and placebo (17.6%, 24.3%, 20%) per non-responder imputation analysis. Mean percent changes in CD20+ B-cell count (&#x02212;10.8%, &#x02212;9.6%, +10.9%) demonstrated expected pharmacodynamic effects. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar (59.5%, 51.7%, 52.6%), as were AE discontinuations (2.6%, 2.7%, 2.6%), serious AEs (4.6%, 4.1%, 3.9%), serious infectious events (1.3%, 0, 0) and events of interest: infections (23.5%, 25.9%, 24%), injection site reactions (13.1%, 25.8%, 11%) and allergy/hypersensitivity (3.9%, 4.1%, 3.9%) reports. Incidence of treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies was similar to placebo (3.9%, 4.8%, 3.9%).

ACR20 significance testing used the Dunnett procedure at an overall 2-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05, with each tabalumab regimen versus placebo comparison made at a two-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.0272. All other statistical tests of treatment effects and interaction effects were performed at two-sided significance levels of 0.05 and 0.10, respectively, unless otherwise stated. Primary and key secondary analyses followed a gatekeeping testing strategy to control the overall type I error rate at a two-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Treatment group comparisons used Fisher's exact test for categorical data and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous data, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Efficacy and health outcome analyses were conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. Primary efficacy analysis was repeated on the per protocol population, a subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population excluding patients with significant protocol violations. Safety analyses were conducted on the safety population including all patients who received at least one dose of assigned study drug. Primary end point analyses of continuous efficacy and health outcome data were conducted using a modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) approach; all other analyses were conducted using the modified last observation carried forward (mLOCF) approach.

Given the low frequency of ADA, it was difficult to assess the effect of ADA on the serum pharmacokinetics of tabalumab. No association was found between patients with treatment-emergent ADAs and reports of allergic/hypersensitivity (non-anaphylaxis) events or injection site reactions in the treatment or follow-up period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior phase two studies of tabalumab in patients with moderate-to-severe RA showed evidence of clinical efficacy, reporting higher ACR20 response rates and significant differences in response rates for ACR50, ACR70, DAS-28 CRP and EULAR scores in tabalumab groups versus placebo.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Biological activity was also demonstrated in these earlier studies, including reductions in B-cell counts and serum immunoglobulins.</p><p>While there is no obvious explanation for the discrepant results in this study relative to the earlier phase two studies, there are some differences between the phase 2 and 3 studies to consider. The baseline characteristics for disease activity in the earlier phase 2 studies were generally comparable to the current study; however, this study was a global study, while some of the phase 2 studies enrolled patients from less diverse geographic regions and were smaller in size. In terms of study drug administration, in one phase 2 study of patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors, tabalumab was administered as either a 30&#x02005;mg or 80&#x02005;mg intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 3 and 6,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> while the current phase 3 study evaluated two subcutaneous (SQ) tabalumab doses of 120&#x02005;mg every 4&#x02005;weeks (120/Q4W) or 90&#x02005;mg every 2&#x02005;weeks (90/Q2W), versus placebo. A separate phase 2 tabalumab study of patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, which also applied intravenous administration and the same dosing frequency, demonstrated that all tabalumab doses were significantly more effective than placebo through week 24.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is notable that clinical efficacy corresponded to peak drug concentrations following infusion of tabalumab.</p><p>The current phase 3 study of patients with moderate-to-severe RA and prior treatment failure or intolerance to 1 or more TNF inhibitors did not meet its primary objective, as tabalumab treatment was not superior to placebo for the primary end point of ACR20 response at week 24 and did not meet any secondary efficacy objective. The efficacy of tabalumab in special patient subgroups (eg, prior prednisolone use, smoking status, RF/anti-CCP seropositivity status and number of previous TNF inhibitor treatment failures), was inconclusive because data were insufficient due to early termination of the trial. The findings in this study corroborate preliminary reported data from other BAFF inhibitor trials in patients with RA showing a lack of significant efficacy<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> or efficacy that was restricted to a bDMARD-na&#x000ef;ve subgroup.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Despite the lack of efficacy, the biological activity of tabalumab was confirmed, but did not differ between the 2 dosing regimens in all parameters tested. Over the 24-week treatment period, CD20+ B-cells initially increased then gradually and significantly declined in response to tabalumab but not placebo administration, and without total B-cell depletion. This was expected, based on the mechanism of action of tabalumab: binding and neutralising BAFF,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> an essential B-cell survival signal, and has also been reported for other BAFF/B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) inhibiting agents (belimumab, atacicept).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Notably, these other BAFF blocking agents also showed a lack of correlation between different dosages and biomarker changes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In the current study, B-cell decline correlated with significant decreases in circulating IgA, IgG and IgM levels after tabalumab treatment. Despite decreases in biological parameters, there was no difference in infection rates for either tabalumab group compared with placebo. Tabalumab treatment was associated with a low incidence of ADA, and there was no association between treatment-emergent ADA and any reports of AEs.</p><p>Frequencies of TEAEs and SAEs were similar across tabalumab and placebo groups, and the incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation was low across all treatment groups. The safety profile of tabalumab in this RA population was consistent with prior studies, and no new or unexpected safety findings were observed.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Compared with prior phase 3 studies of other biological therapies in patients with RA, the present study of tabalumab had a similar incidence of TEAEs (range: 51.7-59.5%), discontinuations due to TEAEs (range: 2.6&#x02013;2.7%), infections (range: 23.5&#x02013;25.9%) and SAEs (range: 3.9&#x02013;4.6%).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref></p><p>There were limitations to the design and interpretation of results of this study, which was terminated early. The effects of background DMARD treatment, and prior and concomitant RA medications, may limit interpretation of results. In addition, patients were previously treated with 1 or more TNF inhibitors and had discontinued due to treatment failure or intolerance; there may be patients in this population who are refractory to immunomodulatory biological therapy for RA, including tabalumab.</p><p>In this phase 3 study in patients with previous failure of biological therapy, tabalumab did not demonstrate clinical efficacy in either dosing regimen, despite evidence of biological activity. Targeting BAFF may not be a viable therapeutic approach. Alternatively, the dose of active study drug and/or duration of the study may not have been optimal to observe a clinical effect. No new or unexpected safety findings were reported for patients with RA who received tabalumab.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jennifer N Bodie, PhD and Teresa Tartaglione, PharmD (ClinGenuity, LLC, Cincinnati, OH), for medical writing support and assistance with preparation and submission of this paper.
