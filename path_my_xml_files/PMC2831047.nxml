The workload generated by IBS is considerable and constitutes approximately one-third of all visits to gastroenterologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is a biopsychosocial disorder that requires a multifactorial approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. No proper treatment is available.</p><p>The human gut contains over 1000 different bacterial species and an indeterminate number of strains of which a minority of the strains is cultivable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Probiotics are defined as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Some studies have shown beneficial effect of probiotics in IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillus </italic>(<italic>L</italic>.) <italic>plantarum </italic>299v reduced flatulence and abdominal pain in patients with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 was found to have the best <italic>in vitro </italic>probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli isolated from fermented food products. This strain was confirmed to adhere to the human colon adenoma cell line CaCo2, to strengthen transepithelial resistance of a CaCo2 cell layer and to increase production of certain tight junction proteins, to have antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens, and to survive passage through the human gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 was therefore proposed as a potential candidate probiotic strain.</p><p>The aims of this randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial were to study the effect of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 on treatment preference, satisfactory relief of symptoms and symptoms in subjects with IBS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from a hospital-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic and a private gastroenterological practice. Subjects 18 to 75 years of age with IBS according to the Roma II criteria and symptoms the last three months were eligible for inclusion. All subjects had had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy performed within the last five years to exclude organic disease. Other tests to confirm the diagnosis were performed at the physicians' discretion. Pregnant and breast-feeding women and subjects with major psychiatric, mental or behavioural disorders, coexisting gastrointestinal and other disorders that might influence the symptoms, or poor knowledge of language were excluded, as were those who had used probiotics more than once a week in the previous three weeks or antibiotics or laxatives in the previous five weeks. The study was made in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and all participants gave written informed consent to participation before enrolment. The Regional medical research ethics committee, Central Norway approved the study protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomised double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with a one-week run-in period followed by randomisation and two three-week treatment periods separated by a four-week washout period. Participants with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the run-in period were excluded from further participation. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening during the run-in period, during the last week of the washout period, and the last week of the two treatment periods. Satisfactory relief of symptoms was recorded on diary cards at the end of the run-in and washout periods and at the end of each week during the treatment periods. At the end of the study, the participants recorded treatment preference for one of the treatment periods. Faecal samples were collected at the end of the run-in, washout period, and the two treatment periods. All data were collected at the hospital based gastroenterology outpatient clinic at Innlandet Hospital Trust, Gj&#x000f8;vik.</p><p>The computer-based randomisation was performed at the Unit for Applied Clinical Research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. Faun Pharma, Norway, provided packed and numbered containers with the capsules containing 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU live, freeze-dried <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF 1298 or placebo according to the randomisation list. The capsules were confirmed to contain the correct number of pure <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 by classical and genetic methods, and were checked for the presence of common pathogens. The capsules looked identical and were prescribed to be taken once daily with liquid. The participants and health care providers were blinded until data entry was complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The participants were asked about treatment preference (the period with least symptoms) at the last visit, and about satisfactory relief of symptoms (yes/no) at the end of the run-in and washout periods and at the end of each week during the treatment periods. Seven gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded. Abdominal pain/discomfort, urgency and bloating were recorded as none, mild, moderate, or severe (score 0-3); stool frequency as number of stools per day; stool consistency according to Bristol stool scale form (score 1-7); and straining and incomplete bowel movement as yes/no (score: 1 or 0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. An IBS sum score (score 0-15) was calculated as the sum of these seven scores after "normalisation" of stool frequency and consistency to achieve low scores for normal bowel habits. The "normalisation" was performed as follows: Stool frequency: 0 stool/day = 1; 1-3 stools/day = 0; 4-5 stools/day = 1; &#x02265; 6 stools/day = 2. Stool consistency: Bristol stool scale 3-5 = 0; Bristol stool scale 2 and 6 = 1; Bristol stool scale 1 and 7 = 2. A diarrhoea score was calculated as the sum of the "none normalised" scores of stool frequency and stool consistency. Assessment of compliance was based on returned capsules.</p><p>Faecal samples, frozen in Carey Blair medium (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK), were analyzed for detection of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>by real-time PCR using 50 cycles. Primers: 5'-TGG ACC GCA TGG TCC GAG-3' (F) and 5'-GTG AGC CGT TAC CCC ACC AT-3' (R), and the Taqman probe 5'-TCC CGC GGC GTA TTA-3', targeting a specific <italic>L. plantarum </italic>region of the conserved 16S rDNA sequence, were used in the analysis. Verification of specificity and control of efficiency of the primer-probe pair were performed according to standard procedures, and will be documented elsewhere (Rudi et al., manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure was treatment preference. Secondary outcomes were the number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and the IBS sum score. All comparisons were between treatment with <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 and placebo. Presence of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 was assessed by analysis of faeces as described above. Adverse events were noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the treatment preference (the proportion of participants preferring one treatment period to the other). Nineteen participants were required to reveal a treatment preference of 80% compared with the null hypothesis value of 50%, with 80% power at a two-sided significance level of 5%.</p><p>Changes within and between groups were compared with paired <italic>t </italic>test and independent <italic>t </italic>test, respectively. The confidence interval and <italic>P </italic>value for treatment preference were calculated with the Wilson (score) method. The difference between treatment periods as regards number of subjects with satisfactory relief of symptoms for zero, one, two and three weeks was tested with the marginal homogeneity test for matched ordinal variables. The number needed to harm was calculated by the method described by Walter, with a difference &#x02265; 2 in the IBS sum score between <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 and placebo regarded as clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Two-sided <italic>P </italic>values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the main outcomes. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed. All results are given as mean (SD) unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-eight participants were included between January and April 2006.

Sixteen participants (five males and eleven females) with a mean age of 50 (11) years and BMI 24 (3) kg/m<sup>2 </sup>were available for the modified intension-to-treat analysis; one had constipation-predominant, nine alternating, and six diarrhoea-predominant IBS. The IBS sum score at run-in was 6.21 (1.63), and the duration of symptoms was 31 (17) years. Four participants with protocol violations were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses; two had inadequately completed diary cards (three and five days, respectively), one used an antibiotic during the active period, and one received supplementary treatment for IBS in the placebo period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the participants through the trial</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-230X-10-16-1"/></fig><p>Thirteen participants (81%; CI 57% to 93%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.012) preferred placebo to <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 treatment.

To our knowledge, similar unfavourable effects of probiotics have not been reported in subjects with IBS. Other studies with probiotics in subjects with IBS show either no effect or a favourable effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The divergent results could be related to different probiotic properties and health effects of the genera, strains, and species in use. Quigley assumed the possible superiority of <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>spp for treatment in IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>(<italic>B</italic>.) <italic>animalis </italic>DN-173010 increased stool frequency in subjects with constipation at entry in a large study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. O'Mahony et al. compared the symptomatic effect of <italic>L. salivarius </italic>UCC4331 and <italic>B. infantis </italic>35624 in subjects with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>B. infantis </italic>35624 induced a favourable effect on IBS symptoms. In a second study by the same researchers, the beneficial effect of <italic>B. infantis </italic>35624 was confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Lactobacilli have been evaluated in several trials with inconsistent results, but no deleterious effects have been reported. One trial of <italic>L. reuteri </italic>ATCC 55730 showed no significant effect on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS, while another trial also in patients with IBS showed no effect of <italic>L. casei </italic>strain GG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>L. casei </italic>strain GG in combination with other probiotics showed a positive effect on IBS symptoms in one study by Kajander [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Two trials with <italic>L. plantarum </italic>299v showed a reduction of abdominal pain and flatulence, while a small crossover study found no effect on symptoms of IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Reports of unfavourable effects of probiotics are rare and probiotics have until recently been regarded as safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Untoward effects were reported in only three out of 185 human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A strain of <italic>L. acidophilus </italic>increased faecal protein catabolites in healthy volunteers in one study, while <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>increased disease activity in patients with stable Crohn's disease in one study, and in another study increased serum glucose in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Sepsis has been reported in some subjects using probiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The most alarming report was published in 2008, showing increased mortality of severe acute pancreatitis following treatment with a multispecies probiotic preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The doses of probiotics used for the treatment of IBS in other trials vary from 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In a dose-finding study, the optimal dose of <italic>B. infantis </italic>35624 was 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU which was superior to placebo, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>CFU and 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> CFU. However, the 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU dose was associated with significant formulation problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The only previous study in humans with <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 is a study of the survival and persistence of the strain in the gastrointestinal tract in 17 healthy volunteers. They were given 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>CFU per day of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 either as a freeze-dried preparation or present in 15 g fermented sausage. No gastrointestinal symptoms or other adverse events were spontaneously reported, but such symptoms were not systematically recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The dose of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 selected for this study was in the same order as the doses used in other studies with lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Despite the lack of evidence for a reduced or detrimental effect of high doses, we cannot exclude that a too high dose might have contributed to the unfavourable outcome of this study.</p><p>It has been proposed that the most potent probiotics may have increased pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The multispecies probiotic preparation used in the study of acute, severe pancreatitis where mortality was increased, was composed of six strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These strains, selected from 69 different probiotic bacteria, had better probiotic properties in combination than the individual components. <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 had the best <italic>in vitro </italic>probiotic properties of 22 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The probiotic with the best probiotic properties as determined <italic>in vitro </italic>is not necessarily the best one to "confer a health benefit on the host".</p><p>The possibility of contamination of capsules by pathogens was excluded in our study, but the presence of endotoxins in the <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 and placebo preparations was not checked. This is, however, unlikely to be the reason for the unfavourable effect, because the company providing the capsules is a reliable producer of food supplements.</p><p>The serious adverse event and three minor adverse events reported were judged to be unrelated to the treatment.</p><sec><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>Probably due to the heterogeneity of the sample in terms of bowel habit predominance, we cannot point to aggravation of a specific symptom. But all outcomes, both the primary outcome (treatment preference) and the secondary outcomes (number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score), show the same unfavourable direction for active treatment. This strengthens the internal validity, but a type I error cannot be excluded.</p><p>With an IBS sum score difference of 2 chosen as clinically significant, the number needed to harm was 3.7. A 2-point difference on a scale with a range of 15 means 13%, and a change of 10% is often regarded as significant on such scales. However, the IBS sum score was not validated for responsiveness and clinically significant differences. Considering that the mean IBS sum score in the run-in period was 5.97, the score difference of 2 chosen as clinically significant might be rather high.</p><p>In this study the mean age of subjects was 50 years and the proportions of subjects with diarrhoea predominant, constipation predominant, and alternating IBS were 38%, 6%, and 56%, respectively. In corresponding studies the participants were younger and the proportions of subjects in the subgroups were more balanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The older age and the somewhat different distribution of subgroups in our study raise the question of external validity. A beneficial effect in younger subjects, in subjects with more or less symptoms compared with our participants, in subgroups of subjects (such as constipation predominant), or in populations with other dietary habits and gut microflora cannot be excluded. Furthermore, a longer period of intervention would have strengthened the internal validity, but increased the drop-out rates.</p><p>The advantage of the crossover design used in this study is the increase in power of within-participant comparisons, and thus its requirement for fewer participants. For ethical reasons, the number of participants and the study period should be reduced as much as possible in a phase II study like this one. The design is fitted for stable chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although IBS is a fluctuating disease, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows that the prerequisites for the use of this design were fulfilled. The IBS sum scores in the two periods were not significantly different. The detection of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 in one faecal sample at the end of the washout period indicates that the washout period was too short in this subject. However, because the amount of <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 detected was small and the recording of symptoms took place in the last week of the three-week treatment period, the possibility for a carryover effect is negligible. In summary, the crossover design turned out to be appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results from our study contribute to focus on the risks of using strains with probiotic properties without scientific evaluation. Not all strains with <italic>in vitro </italic>demonstrated probiotic properties actually "confer a health benefit on the host", and their use may even be associated with unfavourable effects. <italic>L. plantarum </italic>MF1298 might be an unfavourable strain and this should stimulate basic research on the molecular basis of probiotic properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SCL and PGF have received funding from Nofima AS (former Matforsk AS) through LA and KN which in turn have received funding from Nortura BA (former Gilde BA).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SCL, LA, KN, and PGF wrote the protocol.
