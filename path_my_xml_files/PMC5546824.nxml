Safety analyses were based on the all treated set (patients who received one or more doses of extension trial medication); change from baseline analyses used the acute study baseline. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in laboratory parameters were monitored; weight change for asenapine versus olanzapine was the key secondary objective. Descriptive statistics were used; weight change was analyzed using a mixed-model repeated-measure approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 120 patients in the all-treated set, 60% completed treatment (asenapine 2.5 mg BID 66.1% overall, asenapine 5 mg BID 52.4%, olanzapine 15 mg QD 56.3%). The incidence of TEAEs was higher for placebo patients from the lead-in study who switched to asenapine 2.5 mg BID for extension treatment (71.0%) versus patients continuing asenapine 2.5 mg BID (38.7%), asenapine 5 mg BID (38.1%), or olanzapine 15 mg QD (25.0%). The most common TEAE (&#x02265;5% in every group) was worsening of schizophrenia. Least squares mean change in body weight from the acute study baseline to week 26 was +0.6 kg for overall asenapine 2.5 mg BID, +0.8 kg for asenapine 5 mg BID, and +1.2 kg for olanzapine 15 mg QD. There were no clinically relevant changes in metabolic parameters; values were generally similar across treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Asenapine 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID were generally well tolerated in long-term treatment. Weight gain was less for overall asenapine 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID than for olanzapine 15 mg QD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>asenapine</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>long-term</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>weight</kwd><kwd>olanzapine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with considerable medical morbidity and mortality<xref rid="b1-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and marked personal, familial, social, and occupational impairment.<xref rid="b2-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The symptoms of schizophrenia are classified into positive (eg, distortions of thinking and perception), negative (eg, blunted or loss of range of affective and conative functions), cognitive (ie, impairment), disorganization (ie, of thinking and behavior), mood (eg, increased emotional arousal and reactivity), and motor (eg, slowing or increase in motor activity) domains.<xref rid="b3-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Clinical presentations differ among patients, but schizophrenia is often characterized by a chronic and relapsing course with exacerbations and incomplete remissions and variable degrees of functional and social impairment.<xref rid="b3-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Although first- and second-generation antipsychotics offer similar efficacy in treating schizophrenia, second-generation agents induce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than haloperidol, a potent first-generation agent.<xref rid="b4-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, second-generation antipsychotics are sometimes associated with other serious treatment-related adverse events (AEs), including weight gain, metabolic effects, diabetes, cardiac effects, and prolactin elevation.<xref rid="b5-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Because second-generation antipsychotics are a heterogeneous class of drugs with different pharmacologic profiles and receptor-binding affinities, their propensity to cause these side effects differs by agent. Consideration of the safety profile of an antipsychotic medication is an important aspect of clinical management in schizophrenia, since long-term treatment is usually necessary to manage symptoms over the course of the illness.</p><p>Asenapine (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily [BID] sublin-gually) is a second-generation antipsychotic that is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (10&#x02013;17 years). Asenapine has a unique receptor-binding profile that displays potent multireceptor antagonism for serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and histamine receptors.<xref rid="b6-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Since asenapine has no affinity for muscarinic receptors, it incurs minimal risk for anticholinergic side effects. The efficacy of asenapine in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia has been demonstrated in two fixed-dose, short-term, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials.<xref rid="b7-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Maintenance of asenapine efficacy has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, flexible-dose trial with a randomized withdrawal design.<xref rid="b9-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>We present the results of an extension study that was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of asenapine 5 mg BID and assess the long-term safety of a lower dose of asenapine (2.5 mg BID) in adult patients with schizophrenia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT01617200).

In the acute trial, the difference in change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)<xref rid="b10-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> total score (primary endpoint) was statistically significant in favor of asenapine 5 mg BID over placebo; there was no statistically significant difference between asenapine 2.5 mg BID and placebo.<xref rid="b11-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This extension study was conducted at 39 centers in the US (9), Bulgaria (8), Romania (6), Russian Federation (9), Croatia (3), and Ukraine (4) between March 12, 2013, and March 6, 2015. The study protocol and applicable amendments were approved by independent ethics committees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ndt-13-2021">Table S1</xref>), and the trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice standards. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The extension study was a 26-week, Phase IIIB, double-blind, multicenter, double-dummy, fixed-dose study in adult patients (&#x02265;18 years of age) who had completed the 6-week acute study; olanzapine was included as the active comparator. A detailed description of the acute lead-in study has been published previously.<xref rid="b11-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Briefly, the 6-week acute study included male or female patients (&#x02265;18 years of age) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision<xref rid="b12-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and acute exacerbation at the time of the study. Patients were required to meet clinical criteria: PANSS total score of &#x02265;70, score &#x02265;4 (moderate) on at least two PANSS positive subscale items (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution), and a Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Severity (CGI-S) scale<xref rid="b13-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> score &#x02265;4 (moderately ill). After completing the 6-week double-blind treatment period in the acute trial, patients who had been randomized to asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 5 mg BID, olanzapine 15 mg once daily (QD), or placebo were able to enroll in the extension study. The extension study consisted of a baseline visit (week 6/end of treatment in the acute trial), an extension treatment period of 26 weeks, and 30-day follow-up period (visit on day 7; telephone follow-up on day 30 to determine if serious AEs [SAEs] or pregnancies had occurred) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-13-2021">Figure 1</xref>). Day 1 of the extension study overlapped with the last day of the acute trial. The first dose of the study drug in the extension was given on the evening of day 1; patients were contacted by telephone on day 2 to ensure that they understood dosing and to assess for AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients who had completed the acute trial and who were judged likely to benefit from continued treatment were included in the extension study. Included patients had no newly diagnosed medical or psychiatric condition that would have excluded them from participation in the acute study. Each patient was required to have a reliable caregiver who agreed to provide support for treatment compliance, outpatient visits, and protocol procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with a primary Axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia that was predominantly responsible for the current symptoms and functional impairment were excluded from the acute study. Patients were also excluded for any uncontrolled, unstable, or clinically significant medical condition, other than schizophrenia, that could interfere with the conduct of the trial. A clinically significant AE or other finding from the acute trial, including pregnancy, was exclusionary. Patients with a baseline CGI-S score &#x02265;6 (severely psychotic) or patients at risk of self-harm or harm to others based on investigator judgment and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)<xref rid="b14-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> assessment were excluded. Patients with substance abuse or dependence (within the time period between 6 months before the acute trial and the extension trial baseline) or history of imprisonment, parole, or assaultive behavior (within the time period from 2 years before the acute trial and the extension trial baseline) were excluded. Patients were not allowed to use antipsychotics other than the trial medication; psychotropic medications were prohibited, with the exception of lorazepam (for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia), zolpidem, zaleplon, or zopiclone (for insomnia), and medications to treat EPS (including anticholinergics).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment allocation</title><p>In the acute study, patients were randomized to placebo, asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 5 mg BID, or olanzapine 15 mg QD. During the 26-week extension period, patients were assigned to the same treatment regimen as during the acute trial; patients who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to asenapine 2.5 mg BID. Treatment groups are referred to by acute and extension-treatment assignment (ie, placebo/asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 2.5 mg BID/asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID, olanzapine 15 mg QD/olanzapine 15 mg QD); asenapine 2.5 mg BID overall refers to all patients who were treated with asenapine 2.5 mg BID in the extension trial, regardless of their lead-in treatment randomization.</p><p>Trial medication comprised fast-dissolving sublingual tablets of asenapine and placebo and film-coated tablets of oral olanzapine and placebo. Patients in the asenapine treatment groups received 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID in addition to olanzapine-matched placebo tablets BID; patients in the olanzapine treatment group received 15 mg olanzapine QD and olanzapine-matched placebo QD, along with asenapine-matched sublingual placebo tablets BID.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial blinding/masking</title><p>An interactive voice&#x02013;response system was contacted at the extension trial baseline to assign unique patient identification numbers. Asenapine and asenapine-matched placebo tablets were indistinguishable in appearance; olanzapine and olanzapine-matched placebo tablets were identical in appearance. Both were administered in a double-dummy fashion. Patients and investigational staff were unaware of treatment assignment; acute treatment assignments remained blinded during the extension study. If the blind was broken during the trial, patients were not excluded from analyses; of note, the study blind was not broken by any patient during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety outcomes</title><p>Safety assessments included AEs and SAEs (monitored at every study visit and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA], version 17.1), weight and abdominal circumference (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26), laboratory tests (weeks 4 and 26), vital signs (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26), physical examination (week 26), and electrocardiography (ECG; day 1 [baseline]). EPS were evaluated as AEs and by abnormal-movement rating scales: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS),<xref rid="b15-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS),<xref rid="b16-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and Simpson Angus Rating Scale (SARS)<xref rid="b17-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (weeks 1, 2, 4, 12, and 26). Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior were assessed by the C-SSRS (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26). Telephone contacts were made weekly between study visits to remind the subject to take the study drug as prescribed, to ask about new or ongoing AEs, and to ask about any change in concomitant medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy outcomes</title><p>Because the primary objective of this study was the evaluation of safety, there was no primary efficacy analysis; all efficacy endpoints were considered secondary. Secondary efficacy endpoints of interest in the extension study were based on the primary and secondary endpoints in the acute trial. Efficacy endpoints of interest included PANSS total score change from the acute study baseline to weeks 1, 4, 12, and 26 in the extension-treatment period, PANSS response rate at week 26 (&#x02265;30% reduction in PANSS total score from acute study baseline), CGI-S score (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26), and the rate of CGI &#x02013; Improvement (CGI-I)<xref rid="b13-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> response (score &#x02264;3) (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was determined by the number of patients who completed the acute trial and continued into the extension trial. All completers who may have benefited from treatment with asenapine or olanzapine were able to participate. This trial was not powered for direct comparison among groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>There was no primary analysis in this trial. Safety outcomes were specified as predefined or exploratory. Safety analyses were based on the all treated set (ATS), which included all randomized patients from the acute study who received at least one dose of extension trial medication. Efficacy assessments were based on the full analysis set, which included all randomized patients from the acute study who received at least one dose of extension trial medication and had baseline and at least one postbaseline PANSS total score measurements. All continuous endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics. The acute study baseline was used for change from baseline analyses for all treatment groups. The study endpoint for safety was defined as the last nonmissing assessment after the extension trial baseline and on or before the last dose date plus 7 days.</p><p>Change from acute study baseline for continuous safety and efficacy parameters was analyzed at each study visit using analysis of covariance models to assess the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI). Models included fixed effects for treatment and investigative site and baseline value as a covariate. For efficacy parameters, both observed case (OC) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) approaches were used. All efficacy analyses were considered secondary efficacy analyses, and no efficacy hypothesis was tested.</p><p>AEs were designated treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) if the event was newly reported or had worsened in severity after acute study baseline; the end of the period for determination of TEAEs was the last dose date plus 7 days for nonserious AEs and the last dose date plus 30 days for SAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs were TEAEs that were determined by the investigator to have a possible or probable relationship to study treatment. EPS assessed by movement disorder rating scales were evaluated by mean change from acute study baseline (the most recent nonmissing assessment before the first dose of acute study drug) and treatment-emergent symptoms (AIMS item 8 [abnormal movements] score &#x02265;2, BARS global score &#x02265;2, and SARS total score &#x0003e;3).</p><p>The prespecified key safety endpoint was change in weight from the acute study baseline to week 26. Weight change was analyzed using a mixed-model repeated-measure approach in the ATS population, with change from acute study baseline score at each visit as the dependent variable, adjusted for acute study baseline weight as a covariate; treatment, investigation site, visit, and treatment by visit interaction as fixed-effect factors; and a random subject effect. Comparisons between the asenapine groups and the olanzapine group were presented as least squares (LS) mean difference and 95% CI; no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, and no <italic>P</italic>-values were determined.</p><p>Exploratory safety data were analyzed using an a priori multi-tiered approach. Tier 1 and Tier 2 TEAEs were assessed via point estimates and 95% CIs of the adjusted population; Tier 2 laboratory parameters were assessed via point estimates of the LS mean and associated 95% CI. Point estimates by treatment group only were provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. Tier 1 events comprised weight gain &#x02265;7%, AE standardized MedDRA query (narrow) EPS, and preferred terms for AEs of akathisia, combined somnolence/hypersomnia/sedation, dizziness, insomnia, and combined oral hypoesthesia/dysgeusia. Combined endpoints required that a patient had at least one of the included preferred AE terms. Tier 2 safety endpoints required that four or more patients in any treatment group exhibited the event; Tier 2 laboratory endpoints were change from acute study baseline in fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, fasting cholesterol, prolactin, fasting insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). All other events were classified as Tier 3.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and demographics</title><p>A total of 120 patients continued from the acute study to the extension trial, and 120 patients received at least one dose of extension trial medication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ndt-13-2021">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, 72 (60%) patients in the ATS completed treatment. The most common reasons for discontinuation were AEs, most of which were related to worsening schizophrenia disorder and noncompliance with protocol.</p><p>Baseline demographic characteristics were recorded during the screening period of the acute trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-13-2021">Table 1</xref>); treatment groups in the ATS were generally well matched.

No SAEs led to study discontinuation in any asenapine-treated group. The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation were classified as psychiatric disorders; all AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by only one patient per treatment group, with the exceptions of worsening schizophrenia (asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID, five [11.9%] patients) and worsening schizophrenia, paranoid type (placebo/asenapine 2.5 mg BID group, two [6.5%] patients). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity; the only TEAEs that were considered severe in intensity were reported in two (12.5%) patients in the olanzapine 15 mg QD/olanzapine 15 mg QD group (suicide attempt [one] and pulmonary tuberculosis [one]) and one (2.4%) patient in the asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID group (schizophrenia). As assessed by the investigator, the only treatment-related TEAEs that occurred in three or more patients were schizophrenia (asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID [three patients]), and somnolence and weight increased (asenapine 2.5 mg BID overall, three patients each AE).</p></sec><sec><title>Key safety endpoint</title><p>During the 26-week extension study, LS mean change in weight from acute study baseline to week 26 was lower for patients treated with either asenapine 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID than for patients treated with olanzapine 15 mg QD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ndt-13-2021">Figure 3</xref>). Using mixed-model repeated-measure analysis, the LS mean (standard error) change in body weight from acute study baseline to week 26 was +0.6 (0.63) kg for overall asenapine 2.5 mg BID, +0.8 (0.82) kg for asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID, and +1.2 (1.36) kg for olanzapine 15 mg QD/olanzapine 15 mg QD.

The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the placebo/asenapine 2.5 mg BID group relative to the other treatment groups, which is understandable given the asenapine-na&#x000ef;ve status of patients in this group. As determined by the investigator, treatment-related TEAEs that occurred at an incidence of at least 5% in any treatment group and more often in the placebo/asenapine 2.5 mg BID group were somnolence, akathisia, and weight increase; the incidence of treatment-related schizophrenia was higher in the asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID group than in the other treatment groups. Treatment-related TEAEs of weight increase, somnolence, and akathisia were also the most commonly reported TEAEs in previous long-term studies of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, occurring at rates similar to those seen this study (3%&#x02013;17% of patients).<xref rid="b9-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The majority of TEAEs were mild/moderate in intensity. On the prespecified key safety endpoint, LS mean change in weight from the acute trial baseline to week 26, patients in the asenapine 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID groups gained less weight than patients in the olanzapine 15 mg QD group, although this difference was not statistically significant. Previous post hoc analyses and meta-analyses summarizing the effects of asenapine on weight gain in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder have shown that asenapine is associated with a lower incidence of weight gain relative to olanzapine,<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> suggesting that the present study may have been underpowered to detect a statistical difference.</p><p>While sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and poor diet contribute to high rates of cardiovascular disease in patients with schizophrenia,<xref rid="b21-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> metabolic syndrome is also an undeniable source of cardiovascular risk for these patients.

The inclusion of olanzapine in the study allowed for comparison of asenapine with another approved second-generation antipsychotic. The prespecified key weight safety endpoint, as well as the use of a tiered AE strategy, allowed for particular attention to be paid to metabolic and endocrine laboratory endpoints of special interest. Of note, clinically significant weight gain and mean change from acute study baseline to endpoint in fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, fasting cholesterol, fasting insulin, and HbA1c, which are factors that increase the risk of metabolic syndrome, were classified as Tier 2 laboratory endpoints.</p><p>TEAEs related to cardiovascular and metabolic risk occurred at relatively low rates among asenapine patients. From the acute study baseline to week 26 of the extension study, asenapine-treated patients had less weight gain than olanzapine-treated patients. Although the between-group difference in mean weight increase may not have been large enough to be considered clinically relevant, it is noteworthy that asenapine patients experienced less increase in abdominal girth and a lower incidence of clinically significant weight gain than olanzapine patients. Weight gain and intra-abdominal obesity, which is operationalized as increased waist circumference, are key factors in the development of metabolic syndrome.<xref rid="b21-ndt-13-2021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> There were no clinically relevant mean changes in metabolic parameters from the acute trial baseline to study endpoint for asenapine-treated patients.

No Tier 1 AE and no SAE led to treatment discontinuation in the asenapine-treated groups.

As such, changes in psychiatric symptoms and disease severity can be described, but no efficacy conclusions can be made. Mean PANSS total score decreased from the acute trial baseline to the extension trial study endpoint in all four treatment groups, suggesting symptomatic improvement in all treatment groups. The decrease in score was similar in the asenapine 2.5 mg BID/asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 5 mg BID/asenapine 5 mg BID, and olanzapine 15 mg QD/olanzapine 15 mg QD groups, and slightly less in the asenapine group that was randomized to placebo in the acute lead-in study. Modest improvement in disease severity was suggested by small decreases in CGI-S score from the acute study baseline at all time points in each treatment group. For patients who were switched from placebo in the acute study to asenapine 2.5 mg BID in the extension, symptomatic improvement was suggested by decreases in PANSS total score and CGI-S score.

Limitations of the study included the lack of a placebo-control group and statistical power that precluded the ability to detect between-treatment group differences. Additionally, there was a relatively low number of patients in the olanzapine treatment group relative to the asenapine treatment groups, and stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of these findings to more general schizophrenia populations. The lack of inferential statistics limits the ability to evaluate these results, and no efficacy conclusions can be made.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this long-term extension study, 26 weeks of treatment with asenapine 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID was generally safe and well tolerated in adults with schizophrenia.
