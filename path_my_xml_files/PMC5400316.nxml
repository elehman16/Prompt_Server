All 3 interventions were provided by physiotherapists in primary care and were undertaken over a 12-week period. In the NSE group, participants received supervised NSE twice weekly. Progressive resistance training was introduced in the gym with a focus on low-load endurance training. A detailed description of the exercises can be found at the Academic Archive On-line.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Exercise pain provocation was avoided in this group. Toward the end of the 12-week exercise period, participants were encouraged to engage in general physical activity and to continue NSE at home. In the NSEB group, the exercise protocol was the same as that undertaken by the NSE group, but with the addition of a behavioral approach. According to the concept of graded exercise, patients were encouraged not to focus on temporary increases in neck pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> They also received behavioral interventions including education and introduction to activities aimed at pain management and problem-solving, guided by a physiotherapist. Participants in the PPA group initially received a physical examination and a short motivational interview conducted by a physiotherapist. They were then prescribed individualized physical activity to be performed independently based on the interview and the physical examination. NSEs including any form of head resistance were not prescribed in this group. Further details about the intervention protocols have been published previously.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>All outcome measures were self-administered and filled in by the patients at their homes.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) short version were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months after inclusion.</p><sec><label>2.6.1</label><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The PDI was used to measure domain-specific and general disability related to chronic pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> It is a 7-item inventory designed to measure the degree to which pain interferes with functioning across a range of activities. Each item score can range from 0 (no interference) to 10 (total inference). Thus, the total PDI score can range from 0 to 70. The PDI has shown good reliability and validity.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6.2</label><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The PCS was used to measure the extent of pain catastrophizing in participants.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> The PCS is a 13-item scale in which participants are asked to reflect on past painful experiences and indicate the degree to which they experienced thoughts or feelings during pain on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (always). The scale has been shown to have good reliability and validity in pain outpatient samples.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup></p><p>The HAD was used to measure anxiety and depression.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> HAD is a 14-item scale with 2 subscales&#x02014;1 subscale of 7 items for anxiety and 1 subscale of 7 items for depression. It was designed to measure both anxiety and depression. It has a 4-point scale for each question, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very often). It has shown to be a valid clinical indicator of the possibility of depression and clinical anxiety in a Swedish population.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup></p><p>The TSK short version (TSK-11) was used to measure fear of movement and (re)injury. The 11-item scale (score range 11&#x02013;44) is a short version of the original TSK. It evaluates fear of movement with higher scores indicating greater fear of movement, and each item is scored on a 4-point scale. Scoring possibilities range from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; (score&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; (score&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4).

NSE improved in 3 out of 5 variables; catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and anxiety. NSEB improved in PDI and catastrophizing and PPA in none of the variables. More specifically, neck-specific training with the addition of a behavioral component significantly decreased general pain disability by 28% in the first 3 months and sustained this over 2 years. The active physiotherapy-led treatment, with or without the behavioral component, also decreased pain catastrophizing, while PPA did not. Moreover, the NSE group significantly diminished kinesiophobia the first year and anxiety over 2 years, while there was a trend toward lower kinesiophobia in NSEB group. NSEs with the behavioral component also showed a trend toward lower depression. The PPA had no effect on general disability or any of the measured psychological factors. The fact that active treatment by means of neck-specific training has superior effect on chronic WAD patients compared to the mere PPA has been reported before for pain and neck-specific disability.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> This trial now demonstrates similar results for general disability and several psychological factors and shows these results to be stable over time.</p><p>However, the effect in this 2-year follow-up was modest and only on disability a decisive difference could be seen in the outcome between the physiotherapist-led NSE leg and the intervention with the addition of a behavioral approach. This may not be so surprising because our behavioral approach was based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) principles, and a recent review of CBT treatment on chronic pain patients<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> concluded that CBT in addition to another interventions did not result in significantly better results. Moreover, the review showed only evidence for a short-time effect. In the present study, the effects were sustained over a longer period of time. Yet, there may be several additional explanations for the outcome.</p><p>A first reason for modest difference in the outcome between the physiotherapist-led NSE leg and the intervention with the addition of a behavioral approach on psychological factors may lay in the study population. In a recent study, Soer et al<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> calculated a reference value for general disability, measured by the PDI, for WAD patients (mainly from multispecialty tertiary care centers) to a mean of 37.6 points. The patients in the different treatment groups in our study had 18.8 to 23.1 as means, indicating considerably lower disability than Soers&#x02019; WAD patients at baseline. Moreover, if we compare the means of our patients (WAD grades 2 and 3) concerning pain catastrophizing with Sullivan et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> it shows that the patients in Sullivan's study of WAD patients (grades 1 and 2) had a mean of 27 points on the PCS, while our groups scored 17.1 to 19.2 at baseline, indicating again a considerably lower score for the patients in the present study. If we continue to look at anxiety and depression, our participants presented a mean score of 4.5 to 6.3 on HAD, which is below the cutoff score of 8 for low mood or low anxiety.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Taken together, there are clear indications that the present study population at baseline had low disability, pain catastrophizing, depression, and anxiety. This leaves less room for improvement compared to patients from rehabilitation or pain clinics with higher baseline scores.</p><p>Furthermore, more than 50% of the patients in the present study worked full-time and around 80% had employment at treatment start, suggesting a relatively high percentage of adaptive coopers. Adaptive coopers are patients dealing well with the psychological and emotional problems incorporated in chronic pain and characterized by lower interference with everyday activities, lower affective distress, and higher life control.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> For adaptive coopers, there is little room for improvement, and the behavioral approach might have had little impact on outcome contributing to the similar results for psychological factors for both active treatment arms. In concordance with this, Sullivan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> showed in a study of chronic WAD patients using a psychosocial risk-factor-targeting intervention that this treatment was only successful for patients displaying many psychosocial factors, whilst the intervention was superfluous for patients without these factors. So the patients in our study with a low degree of psychological factors that were randomized to the behavioral treatment arm might not have benefited much from the addition of the behavioral component. Yet, a 28% reduction in general disability was accomplished with the active treatment incorporating the behavioral component and was sustained over a 2-year period. The Minimal clinical important change (MCIC) for the PDI scale for chronic back pain patients, including neck pain patients, has been calculated to be 8.5 to 9.5 points.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> This was calculated from a mean of 34.6 corresponding to a 26% reduction. Participants in our study reduced their disability with 6 points but from a substantially lower starting point, 23.1 to 18.8 points, resulting in a similar MCIC of 26% reduction on general disability.</p><p>Participants in our study were identified through healthcare registers of 6 Swedish counties, including primary health care, specialist orthopedic clinics, and hospital outpatient services. They were contacted by mail and invited to participate in a study for WAD patients that included a form of exercise. Given the low baseline scores on disability, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in comparison with other studies, the data suggest that we might have encountered a selection bias. It seems reasonable to assume that patients with lower levels of distress and other psychological discomfort would be more inclined to submitting themselves to training and therefore probably chose to participate, while those with more prominent psychological factors may have chosen not to respond to the invitation.</p><p>The second reason for modest difference in the outcome may have to do with the patients&#x02019; characteristics in combination with treatment allocation. In our study, patients were allocated to the treatment arms irrespectively of their characteristics. Patients receiving the specific neck exercises without the behavioral approach were treated according to a pain contingent approach, and exercise pain provocation was avoided in this group. In accordance with the concept of graded exercise, patients who received the behavioral approach were encouraged not to focus on temporary increases in neck pain and were treated according to a time contingent regime. This may have increased the risk of augmenting nociceptive barrage toward the central nervous system during and following treatment in patients with signs of central sensitization, which in turn is likely to sustain the process of central sensitization. Nijs et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> advocated in his review to take central sensitization into account when prescribing exercise and to avoid time contingent exercise for patients with signs of central sensitization. This would mean that time contingent behavioral approach would be suitable for patients without sensitization and exercise with pain contingent approach would be more suitable for patients with signs of sensitization. Because our patients were randomly allocated to the different treatment arms instead of allocated based on sign of sensitization, and assuming that patients with central sensitization were equally distributed between the active treatment arms, the effect of the intervention may have been partially washed out.</p><p>Great care was taken into recruiting the physiotherapists administering the behavioral treatment. The vast majority had an interest in behavioral medicine and many had attended postgraduate courses in this field before participating in the study. They all received an additional 1-day training on how to deliver the behavioral treatment before treatment start. Although 2 recent systematic reviews<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> show that physiotherapists working with pain patients only partially recognized cognitive, psychological, and social factors, we have no reason to believe that this played a major role in the outcome. Treatment with a behavioral approach has been advocated<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> and tried before,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> but to our knowledge, the present study is the only study that shows a positive outcome of a physiotherapist-led behavioral approach on chronic WAD patients grades 2 and 3.</p><p>The strength of this study is that it has a 2-year follow-up, which enables us to investigate if the results are stable and sustained over time. It also has a relatively large number of participants, which makes the findings robust. It includes individuals with WAD grade 3, often excluded in other studies and was assessor blinded and conducted at multiple primary care centers. Although the study had a strict treatment protocol, a weakness of this study is that we do not have any data on actual practice behavior and therefore cannot be completely certain that the treatment was given in the way it was intended. Although all participating physiotherapists were experienced in managing patients with neck pain disorders, we cannot be sure of the specific competency of the physiotherapists in delivering a behavioral approach. Another limitation was the lack of no-intervention control group. However recently, Peolsson et al<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> using the same NSE treatment as in the present study showed NSE to be superior to staying on a waiting list.</p><p>For future research, given these modest results and the uncertainty of the impact of the possible other explanations, maybe a new line of research should be opened. Instead of submitting all patients irrespective of their characteristics to the same kind of treatment, like in traditional randomized controlled trials, tailoring the treatment to patient characteristics could be a more successful approach. In this kind of study, both central sensitization and potential psychosocial barriers for recovery could be taken into account as potential modifiers. A behavioral approach can consist of different components. It should include oral education regarding physiological and psychological aspects of pain<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> as well as challenging and changing inappropriate pain beliefs.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> It is often administered in a time contingent fashion. A new cognitive approach addressing the educational and cognitive aspect but administered on a pain contingent basis might be more appropriate for patients with signs of central sensitization and psychosocial risk factors. A behavioral approach on a time contingent basis is probably more appropriate for patients without signs of central sensitization but with potential psychosocial barriers for recovery. Instead of a one-size-fits-all strategy that ignores the heterogeneity in chronic WAD patients, predetermined patient characteristics will decide to what type of intervention they will be assigned, with a nonstratified group as control for the results. This type of stratified approach has been successfully tested before on other pain patients and in physiotherapy settings.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup></p><p>In summary, the results of this randomized controlled trial with a 2-year follow-up show that physiotherapist-led NSEB or NSE had better outcome on general disability and most psychological factors compared to the mere PPA. The PPA had no effect on general disability or any of the measured psychological factors. More specifically, neck-specific training with the addition of a behavioral component significantly decreased general pain disability by 26% in the first 3 months and sustained this over 2 years. The active physiotherapy-led treatment with or without the behavioral component also decreased pain catastrophizing, while PPA did not. Moreover, NSEs significantly diminished kinesiophobia the first year and anxiety over 2 years. To our knowledge, the present study is the only study that shows a positive outcome of a physiotherapist-led behavioral approach on chronic WAD patients grades 2 and 3.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Hans G Eriksson for his help with the statistical analysis and also all participants, including WAD participants, physiotherapists, and staff, involved in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: HAD = Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, NDI = Neck Disability Index, NSE = neck-specific exercise, NSEB = neck-specific exercise with behavioral approach, PCS = Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PDI = Pain Disability Index, PPA = prescription of physical activity, TSK = Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, WAD = whiplash-associated disorder.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holm</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cassidy</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
