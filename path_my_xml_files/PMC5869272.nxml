Seroconversion to PV2 was achieved in 48, 76, 98 and 100% in Groups 1&#x02013;4 respectively. mOPV2 was more immunogenic than tOPV alone (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001); and OPV in combination with IPV was more immunogenic than OPV alone (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001). There were 33%, 67%, 20% and 43% PV2 excretors in Groups 1&#x02013;4 respectively. mOPV2 resulted in more prevalent shedding of PV2 than when tOPV was used (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001); and tOPV together with IPV resulted in lower excretion of PV2 than tOPV alone (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.046).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>mOPV2 was a more potent vaccine than tOPV. Adding IPV to OPV improved immunological response; adding IPV also seemed to have shortened the duration of PV2 shedding. mIPV2 did not provide measurable improvement of immune response when compared to conventional IPV.

WPV2 is considered eradicated and WPV3 was last detected in 2012, in Nigeria <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0010">Complete poliovirus eradication, however, requires the disappearance of not only WPVs but of all polioviruses from human populations, including those resulting from use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The Polio Eradication &#x00026; Endgame Strategic Plan 2013&#x02013;2018 provides a framework for interruption of WPV transmission in remaining endemic foci and lays out plan for the new polio endgame, which includes the sequential withdrawal of Sabin virus strains contained in OPV vaccine, starting with type 2, and the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), for risk mitigation purposes <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">The switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) without type 2 poliovirus (PV2) was conducted in a globally synchronized manner in April 2016. As of May 2016, there were no countries still using type 2-containing OPV in routine immunization; however, the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a stock of monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2) reserved for outbreak response in case of outbreaks of type 2 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) or accidental release of WPV2 in the post-switch era <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The use of mOPV2 must be authorized by the Director General of WHO. In addition to mOPV2, monovalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine type 2 (mIPV2) with 4-times higher PV2 antigenic potency than standard IPV has been evaluated in clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic; however, mIPV2 has not been licensed, is considered experimental, and is not part of the outbreak response toolkit recommended by WHO <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">As per WHO&#x02019;s Poliovirus Outbreak Response Guidelines, bOPV and IPV or mOPV2 and IPV are tools for control of WPV1 or cVDPV2 outbreaks respectively <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Since the switch from tOPV to bOPV in April 2016 until December 2017, there were 44 separate incidents when VDPV2 was detected either in children or from environmental samples <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In 12/44 incidents, mOPV2 was authorized to be used to control the outbreak and in 7/44 incidents, IPV was used <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The decision regarding what outbreak response tools should be deployed is based on the assessment of risk of poliovirus circulation, and risk of exportation to other countries.</p><p id="p0025">In the post-switch era, the risk of emergence and spread of cVDPV2 is two-fold, from unrecognized foci seeded before the tOPV to bOPV switch such as long-term excretors among immunodeficient individuals, or from post-switch use of PV2-containing live vaccine such as mOPV2 or left-over tOPV.</p><p id="p0030">To assess the available tools for cVDPV2 outbreak response, we analyzed a subset of data obtained from a larger study that was conducted by the same investigators as this analysis in Pakistan and was entitled &#x0201c;Immunogenicity of Different Routine Poliovirus Vaccination Schedules: a Randomized Controlled Trial&#x0201d;.

The population of the study area according to the last census from 2015 was 294,171.

We stratified the analysis of PV2 excretion by primary immunization schedule the children had previously received, however, no significant differences in PV2 excretion were found between the strata.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Excretion of poliovirus type 2 in stool one week after OPV administration among seronegative children who were not excreting poliovirus type 2 at 22&#x0202f;weeks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0125">No severe adverse events linked to administration of the study vaccines were reported.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0130">We demonstrated that mOPV2 is more immunogenic than tOPV and that IPV in combination with OPV is more immunogenic than OPV alone. In our study, one dose of mOPV2 administered at 22&#x0202f;weeks of age resulted in lower seroconversion than previously reported (communication with CDC). We were unable to assess whether mIPV2 provided better immunological response than conventional IPV because the combination of tOPV+IPV was already immunogenic in 98% of children; the increase from 98% to 100% (provided by the combination of mOPV2+mIPV2) did not reach statistical significance.</p><p id="p0135">Previous data showed that priming after one IPV dose was common and assumed to provide protection against paralytic poliomyelitis in children who remain seronegative after past IPV administration. In one study in Cuba, priming after one IPV dose was estimated at 98% <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In our study we could not measure priming in the same way: there were no children in the IPV groups who had not received at least one prior IPV dose. However, seronegative children who had received at least one IPV dose and were subsequently vaccinated with OPV (tOPV or mOPV2) did not exhibit more frequent anamnestic immune response than children who had not received any prior IPV. It is therefore possible that the priming observed in Cuba occurs only when the subsequent poliovirus vaccine is IPV <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The role of priming in protection against poliomyelitis needs to be further evaluated.mOPV2 induced more frequent shedding of PV2 than did tOPV; IPV in combination with OPV resulted in lower proportion of shedding one week after vaccine administration, leading to two hypotheses: (1) that the combination of OPV and IPV shortened the duration of PV2 shedding; or (2) that IPV added to OPV suppressed the development of mucosal immunity. Exposure to environmental PV2 might have also played a role. In either case, this finding needs to be further explored.</p><p id="p0140">There were some limitations of the study. tOPV continued to be used for routine and supplementary immunizations in Pakistan during the study period, resulting in potential secondary exposure to PV2 among study participants. Further, due to the delay in importation permits for mOVP2 and mIPV2, only about half of study participants that had originally been planned for received these vaccines.</p><p id="p0145">Since the switch from tOPV to bOPV in April 2016, there is a growing cohort of young children that have no anti-PV2 antibodies. In addition, the immunization coverage with the newly introduced IPV is quite low, especially in the polio high risk areas <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, the spread of VDPV2 from potential existing undetected foci or from a post-switch use of mOPV2 vaccines is a growing concern.</p><p id="p0150">Assessment of tools to control VDPV2 outbreaks demonstrated that mOPV2 is a superior vaccine when compared to tOPV and that adding IPV to OPV significantly improves the immunological response in several ways: it improves seroconversion, increases titer of anti-PV2 antibodies, leads to faster secondary immunological response, and shortens the duration of PV2 excretion in stool.</p><p id="p0155">We believe that the use of mOPV2 for control of cVDPV2 outbreaks is the correct strategy &#x02013; mOPV2 is the only vaccine capable of inducing mucosal immunity in naive children. However, the use of mOPV2 has its risks, namely it may seed new VDPV2 outbreaks. Therefore the use of mOPV2 must be considered carefully; at present only the Director General of WHO may authorize the use of mOPV2.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0160">The World Health Organization.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="h0005">Cases of Wild Poliovirus by Country and Year.
