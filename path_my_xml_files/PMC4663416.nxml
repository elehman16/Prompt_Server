Problem gambling is a serious global public health concern due to adverse personal and social consequences. Previous research evaluating the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the treatment of problem gambling has been compromised by methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and the use of waitlist control groups. This article describes the study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), motivational interviewing (MI) against a non-directive supportive therapy (NDST) control, in treating problem gambling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study was a mixed-methods design, with a parallel group, pragmatic RCT as the primary component, and embedded qualitative studies conducted alongside. A total of 297 participants were recruited from the community in Victoria, Australia. Individuals aged 18&#x02005;years and over, could communicate in English and wished to receive treatment for a gambling problem were eligible. Participants were randomly allocated in to 1 of the 4 psychological interventions: CBT, BT, MI and NDST. Repeated measures were conducted at pretreatment and post-treatment, and 6 and 12&#x02005;months post-treatment. The statistical analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach. Multilevel mixed modelling will be used to examine changes in the primary outcome measures: gambling symptom severity, using the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale, and gambling behaviours (frequency, time and expenditure). Secondary outcomes are depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol use. Individual semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at pretreatment and post-treatment and 12&#x02005;months post-treatment for a subset of participants (n=66).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was approved by the Victorian Department of Justice, Monash University and the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committees.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), a gambling disorder is characterised by &#x0201c;persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behaviour leading to clinically significant impairment or distress.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the context of this study, the term problem gambling is used to describe a severe level of gambling, based on a continuum of gambling-related harm.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This continuum ranges from non-problem gambling, to problem gambling, where problem gambling is characterised by difficulties in limiting money and time spent on gambling and leads to adverse consequences for the gambler, others or the community.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>A recent review of international problem gambling prevalence rates indicated that problem gambling prevalence rates range from 0.5% (Denmark and the Netherlands) to 7.6% (Hong Kong).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In Australia, the problem gambling prevalence rate is estimated at 2.1%, with state-wide surveys suggesting prevalence rates ranging from 0.7% to 2.6%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The prevalence of problem gambling in Victoria is estimated at 2.4% and, interestingly, is the only state where an increase in prevalence rates was observed in recent years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> At problematic levels, gambling has far reaching consequences, and has been described as a global public health concern, with various personal, interpersonal and community level consequences.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Extensive research has indicated that problem gambling is associated with high levels of co-occurring psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Treatment options for problem gambling include a range of psychological, self-help, peer support and pharmacological interventions. Psychological interventions have been the most examined, to date. One of the most common psychological treatments is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), combining the cognitive and behavioural models for problem gambling. The cognitive model of problem gambling purports that gamblers have certain erroneous beliefs about gambling, which are based on false assumptions and biased information processing.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Cognitive interventions aim to correct erroneous beliefs (eg, belief that they have control over luck), by using techniques such as cognitive restructuring to correct any cognitive distortions and biases.</p><p>Generally, the behavioural model of problem gambling claims that gambling is a learned maladaptive behaviour. Behavioural interventions use classical and operational conditioning techniques to reduce the excitement and arousal linked with gambling.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These techniques include exposure, desensitisation and aversive techniques, problem solving training and relapse prevention. The earlier treatment studies in this field were based on the examination of behavioural techniques<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> and to date have been the most commonly used techniques in the treatment of problem gambling.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Motivational interviewing (MI), originally developed for the treatment of problem drinking,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> has recently been used in the treatment of other health behaviours, including problem gambling. By helping individuals explore and resolve their ambivalence, MI uses a directive and client-centred counselling approach to facilitate behaviour change.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> There are four general principles that underlie MI, including expressing empathy, developing discrepancy between an individual's current behaviour and his or her goals, rolling with an individual's resistance to change and not arguing or opposing the resistance, and supporting self-efficacy and one's ability to succeed in change.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Common techniques used in MI include the use of open questions, affirming an individual's strengths and freedom of choice, using reflective listening to understand an individual's frame of reference and using accurate summaries to further elicit change talk.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Overall, reviews of the treatment evidence base support the use of psychological interventions for the treatment of problem gambling.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> The most recent reviews, based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs), have indicated that when compared with a control group (eg, waitlist control), CBT can be effective in the treatment of problem gambling, with growing evidence to support the use of MI interventions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These reviews have highlighted the methodological limitations in the current evidence base, which will be discussed below.</p><p>Previous RCTs in problem gambling have been limited by small sample sizes. A recent review of RCTs of psychological interventions for problem gambling found that the average sample in these studies was 89 participants, ranging from 13 to 231,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with many studies lacking the statistical power required to detect change. Further complicating this issue are the high attrition rates in this field. A review of treatment dropout in psychological interventions indicated that dropout ranged from 14% to 50% (median=26%), with not all studies dealing with the missing data adequately.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While intention-to-treat analysis has been recommended as the least biased way to estimate the effects of an intervention, not all RCTs have used this type of analysis.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Additionally, while most RCTs report dropout rates, very few have reported the associated reasons. Understanding these reasons and investigating the time points during a study where dropout is more likely to occur will enable tailoring of treatment and research programmes to address specific risk factors for dropout and hence minimise the likelihood of dropout.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Waitlist control groups have been used frequently in the problem gambling treatment literature and are useful in determining the short-term efficacy of a treatment; however, the long-term efficacy of treatments cannot be ascertained.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A number of different control groups have been described and recommended in the general psychological treatment outcome literature, including the &#x02018;attention control groups&#x02019;,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> also referred to as &#x02018;non-specific treatment component controls&#x02019;.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This type of control condition aims to provide all participants, irrelevant of group allocation, a similar experience.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Non-specific treatment factors that can be held constant across all groups are equated (eg, attention or amount of contact with the psychologist), while the theoretically active treatment ingredients are withheld.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Other than allowing for long-term comparisons between the treatment and control groups, this control condition could conceivably allow researchers to assert that any differences identified cannot be attributed to differences in attention from the experimenter or psychologist, as well as, the participants outcome expectancies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>There is an increasing number of studies that are using qualitative methods alongside RCTs of complex interventions, such as semistructured interviews, focus groups and even different forms of observation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Qualitative studies have rarely been used in conjunction with RCTs of problem gambling treatment. A review by Lewin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> emphasised the importance and contribution qualitative studies can make to RCTs, especially where the interventions evaluated are complicated. Qualitative studies can assist in understanding the effects of these interventions as well as the mechanisms through which change occurs. This is particularly relevant in the problem gambling field, as research has indicated how diverse and heterogeneous this population is.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Overall, further research is required to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological interventions, as this has not yet been well examined. Furthermore, RCTs of problem gambling interventions have had various methodological limitations, which need to be addressed in future research. As such, a pragmatic RCT was designed to address these methodological limitations. This article describes the study protocol of this pragmatic RCT, entitled the PROblem Gambling RESearch Study (PROGRESS). This article includes a description of the methods of the RCT and embedded qualitative studies and the baseline characteristics of the RCT sample.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Trial objectives</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of CBT, behaviour therapy (BT) and MI in reducing gambling behaviours and gambling symptom severity, at post-treatment, 6 and 12&#x02005;months follow-up, when compared with an active control condition, non-directive supportive therapy (NDST). A secondary aim is to explore participants&#x02019; experiences of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a mixed-methods design, with a parallel group, pragmatic RCT as the primary component, and embedded qualitative studies conducted alongside. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009385F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> details the flow of participants through the study, according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).

Attempts were also made to recruit participants through Gamblers Help services. Participant recruitment occurred between January 2013 and February 2014.</p><p>Individuals were eligible to participate if they were aged 18&#x02005;years and over, could communicate in the English language, lived in Victoria and wished to receive treatment for a self-identified gambling problem. Individuals were excluded if they were unable to understand and provide informed consent, were at risk of self-harm or had received treatments for their gambling problems in the past 12&#x02005;months from a counsellor or therapist. People with comorbid mental health disorders were not excluded from the trial. Excluding participants based on this would have led to a sample that is unrepresentative of most treatment populations due to the high rates of comorbid mental health disorders in this population.</p><p>Individuals that were interested in participating contacted the research team via a free of charge 1800 telephone number or via a designated study email. Trained research assistants were responsible for responding to any queries via telephone or email. These research assistants were also responsible for screening potential participants for eligibility. The screening process was only conducted over the telephone.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation</title><p>To ensure equal numbers across the four interventions, participants were randomised using a permuted block design. The block sizes were randomly varied to reduce the chance of the research team recognising the assignment schedule.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trials Unit, an external and independent unit, was responsible for generating the randomisation schedule used in this study. Randomisation occurred after the pretreatment assessment interview. A research assistant was responsible for contacting the NHMRC clinical trials unit, via telephone, to ascertain the allocated intervention and was then responsible for allocating a psychologist to each participant. This research assistant was not involved in any of the post-treatment and follow-up data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size</title><p>To determine an appropriate effect size, the results of a recent Cochrane review of RCTs assessing psychological interventions for problem gambling was examined, and based on expected standardised effect size ranging from d=0.50 and d=0.84, for financial loss from gambling and frequency of gambling, respectively, the study was powered to detect the smaller reported effect size of d=0.50.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Sample size calculations for this trial were based on a rigorous power level of 0.90, an &#x003b1; level of 0.01, an effect size of d=0.50 and a correlation of 0.80 between repeated measures. Overall, a sample size of n=136 (34 per intervention) was calculated using G*Power software and a priori repeated measures analysis of variance. However, taking in to account potentially high rates of participant dropout, a sample size of n=276 was chosen (69 participants per intervention) to ensure sufficient statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants in each intervention received up to six individual, face-to-face sessions with a registered psychologist. The sessions lasted approximately 45&#x02013;60&#x02005;min each and were scheduled on a weekly basis. The interventions in this RCT were each guided by a manual. All of the treatment sessions were audio-recorded for treatment fidelity purposes. A randomly selected subset of the treatment sessions were rated by two people, independent of the research team. A treatment fidelity checklist was developed for this purpose, with the same checklist used for all sessions.</p><p>A detailed description of the interventions is provided below.

Throughout the trial, 41 psychologists provided treatment (CBT=12, BT=10, MI=7 and NDST=12).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Treatment setting and referrals</title><p>The treatment sessions were delivered from the psychologists&#x02019; current practice. While not an exclusion criterion, participants were informed that as part of this study they would need to be able to travel to see their allocated psychologist. The trained research assistant who was responsible for the randomisation process was also responsible for allocating a psychologist to each participant and sending referral documents to the participants and psychologists. A psychologist was allocated to a participant based principally on geographical proximity.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes for this study were changes in gambling symptom severity and gambling behaviours (frequency, time and expenditure).

Random effects will account for within-participant correlation; fixed effects will be time and intervention group and the interaction of intervention and time. There are four primary outcome measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009385TB2">table 2</xref>) and two-sided tests, with an &#x003b1; level of p&#x0003c;0.05 will be used to evaluate statistical significance. There are numerous secondary measures, thus an &#x003b1; level of p&#x0003c;0.01 will be used to avoid type I errors. Prespecified subgroup (covariate) analyses will be performed to explore whether comorbidities (depression, anxiety and stress) and alcohol and drug use at baseline impact the outcomes. Demographic factors such as gender and age group will also be examined.</p><p>The gambling behaviour primary outcome measures (frequency, time and expenditure) are anticipated to be positively skewed data distributions consisting of raw data bunched closer towards the zero measure and data points that more lightly scattered towards a larger number.

As such, we aimed to identify, where possible, the reasons why participants dropout from a treatment study before it is completed. Participants who dropped out of the study were contacted as a courtesy to thank them for their participation and to investigate their reasons for dropping out. All participants who dropped out before or during the treatment period, or during the 12-month follow-up period were contacted.

this RCT will contribute to the problem gambling treatment evidence base in several ways. This RCT will build on the existing evidence base, by addressing some of the methodological limitations identified in previous RCTs.</p><p>This trial is one of the first to use a non-specific treatment component control group (ie, NDST). This will enable the examination of the long-term effects of these psychological treatments. Therefore, this RCT will be able to provide much needed evidence in to the durability of any therapeutic effects identified, as well as the patterns of change over time at a group and individual level.</p><p>One of the major challenges for this study was the potential for high dropout rates that are commonly associated with longitudinal studies, and the problem gambling population, in particular. When calculating an appropriate sample size, the commonly high attrition rates were taken in to account. Based on Melville <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> review of dropout in psychological treatment for problem gambling, the proposed sample size allowed for the maximum 50% dropout rate, and an intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted. In addition, a parallel qualitative study will identify reasons for dropping out, further contributing important knowledge about treatment attrition.</p><p>A limitation of the current study may be that all outcome assessments were conducted over the telephone. While there is much research showing that telephone-based assessment using standardised measures is as good as face-to-face assessment,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52&#x02013;54</xref> some research has shown that telephone interviews may not be as reliable as face-to-face interviews;<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> however, it was not feasible to conduct the large number of outcome assessment interviews face-to-face.</p><p>This trial has the potential to make a significant contribution to the problem gambling treatment field. Through the use of quantitative and qualitative methods, we aim to gain a better understanding, not only of the empirical effectiveness of the treatments, but also the components of the treatment process that participants perceive to be effective. The findings of this trial may have implications for the way current problem gambling treatment services are provided.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the work of all the research assistants who assisted throughout this trial.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SAT led the conception and design of the study with contributions from ACJ, CJB, SSM, HR, SF and JE.
