This suggests the need for bespoke surveillance protocols after rupture. Limb ischaemia is a frequent early reason and distal aneurysms a frequent later reason for re-intervention to indicate where quality improvement programmes might be directed. Limb amputation is uncommon but higher after open repair than after endovascular aneurysm repair.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0020">As experience with elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has increased and stent graft technology has advanced, the rate of re-interventions has reduced. In the early randomised trials, the mid-term re-intervention rates were about 3.5 per 100 person years versus 0.5 per 100 person years after open repair,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> but, today, much lower rates are reported from more recent data.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Endovascular repair of ruptured AAA presents additional challenges: the aneurysms are larger, the emergency imaging may not be optimal, sizing for endografts may be difficult owing to hypotensive arterial collapse, the available stock of endografts may be limited and these may be used outside conservative instructions for use (IFU). Therefore, there is widespread acceptance that EVAR for rupture is likely to be associated with a higher re-intervention rate than EVAR for elective repair.</p><p id="p0025">There are few studies that report mid-term re-intervention rates after either EVAR or open repair for rupture. The most comprehensive study comes from the 467 patients with repair of ruptured AAA in the Amsterdam cohort from 2004 to 2011.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> By 5 years 45% of the EVAR patients and 40% of the open repair patients had had at least one re-intervention. The re-interventions in the primary admission and after discharge were described separately. After discharge the rate of re-interventions after EVAR was nearly four times as high as after open repair and a common reason for re-intervention after EVAR was life threatening graft infection.</p><p id="p0030">The IMPROVE trial, which randomised 613 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured AAA to either an endovascular strategy (EVAR if morphologically feasible, open repair if not) or open repair, included 502 patients in whom repair of rupture was commenced, and followed these patients for re-interventions for 3 or more years. It has already been reported that the overall re-intervention rates were not significantly different between the randomised groups and that any additional re-interventions incurred in the endovascular strategy group did not compromise the overall cost-effectiveness of the endovascular strategy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The purpose here is threefold: (i) to provide further insight concerning the reasons for and rates of re-intervention (directly aneurysm related and other) in the 502 patients with repair of rupture started, both by randomised group and by treatment received; (ii) to investigate whether pre-operative aneurysm morphology was associated with re-intervention rates; and (iii) to assess whether major amputation (an uncommon outcome but one much feared by patients) was more common after either EVAR or open repair in an individual patient meta-analysis across the three recent European randomised trials for the management of ruptured AAA.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The first two aims will also provide important information as to whether surveillance protocols after rupture might need to be different from those after elective AAA repair.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0035">The design and patients of the IMPROVE trial (ISRCTN48334791), their follow-up, and assessment of baseline aortic morphology have been described previously.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Briefly, 613 patients with an in hospital clinical diagnosis of ruptured AAA were randomised to either an endovascular strategy (immediate computed tomography [CT] scan and EVAR if morphologically feasible, otherwise open repair) or to open repair (CT scan optional). Of these, 502 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of rupture had aneurysm repair or started aneurysm repair and were followed up by trained local coordinators, for all re-interventions in the first 30 days, and aneurysm related re-interventions for 3 years thereafter. The trial protocol required clinical follow-up with imaging at 3, 12, and 36 months after repair, with intermediate follow-up left to the discretion of each trial centre. A standardised protocol for the detection and management of abdominal compartment syndrome, with recording of intra-abdominal pressures, was recommended but not widely followed. The completeness of re-intervention data, including re-interventions at non-trial hospitals, was verified by cross-checking against an administrative data set for English patients (Hospital Episode Statistics) and by detailed audit for Scottish and Canadian patients. Re-interventions beyond 3 years were not collected comprehensively. Re-interventions for pre-existing conditions, for example colon cancer, which had been included for the analysis of outcomes at 30 days are excluded from the present analysis, whereas fistula formation to treat renal failure and endovascular treatment of pulmonary embolism are included. Trial investigators extended the categorisation of re-interventions used by the EVAR-1 trial to obtain a consensus as to whether a re-intervention was for a life threatening condition (<xref rid="appsec3" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S1 [see Supplementary Material]</xref>, with a full list of re-interventions).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Two observers categorised the re-interventions as arterial, laparotomy related, or other, with differences resolved by discussion. Separately, six patients or their spouses, from outside the trial, were asked to rank the main re-interventions: they were unanimous in reporting amputation of the leg as the most feared re-intervention, followed by graft infection.</p><p id="p0040">The indications for re-intervention are tabulated both by randomised group and by treatment received. When two separate indications for re-intervention were corrected in the same operating or endovascular session these are listed separately but described in table footnotes. Multiple planned recurring procedures requiring time in the operating theatre (e.g., debridement, change of dressings) are excluded from the descriptive tables (e.g., there would be only a single listing for change of negative pressure wound therapy dressing, even if this occurred on several occasions).</p><p id="p0045">CT scans were acquired in DICOM format from hospital archives, anonymised, and transferred to the core laboratory at St George's Vascular Institute for three dimensional reconstruction and analysis<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>; in total, 458 admission scans from patients with confirmed rupture were available.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Five morphological parameters (aortic diameter at 1&#x000a0;mm distal to the distal renal artery, aneurysm neck length from distal renal artery to sac, proximal neck angle &#x003b1;, maximum aneurysm diameter, and maximum common iliac diameter) were measured in a core laboratory and a sixth, neck conicality derived, as described previously.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> From these parameters the endovascular repairs were categorised as either within liberal IFU or not (liberal IFU aneurysm neck length&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mm, neck diameter&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;32&#x000a0;mm, and neck angle&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;60&#x000b0;).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The 3 month follow up CT scans also were collected in the core laboratory and were used to confirm the diagnosis of any underlying conditions requiring re-intervention at this time.

In the mid-term period, for patients treated by EVAR, the commonest indication for a re-intervention was for an endograft related problem (kinking, migration, or endoleak), which occurred in 21/125 patients (17%): the re-intervention was for secondary aneurysm rupture in two cases. The patient with type 1A endoleak and secondary rupture was treated with a chimney graft to the left renal artery and a proximal cuff, whereas the patient with type 1B endoleak and secondary rupture was treated by a right limb extension. Distal aneurysm (common iliac, internal iliac, or femoral) was the next most common indication for re-intervention and occurred in both randomised groups and after treatment by both EVAR and open repair.

Overall the percentage (&#x0223c;28%) of patients requiring one or more re-interventions by 3 years is twice that reported from the Medicare database.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Although the rates in the acute period of care (0&#x02013;90 days) are highest, there is a significant rate of mid-term re-interventions in both the endovascular strategy and open repair groups, with about one third of these re-interventions needed for a life threatening condition. These mid-term re-intervention rates are over twice those reported after elective repair of large AAA.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It is also clear that mid-term re-intervention is needed for endograft related complications for about one in six patients after EVAR and that bowel ischaemia is a more important problem after open repair, with further mid-term re-interventions required for this condition. The present analysis indicates that the rate of arterial re-interventions is associated with increasing common iliac diameters at presentation, perhaps indicative of more extensive aneurysmal disease. The re-intervention most feared by patients is major limb amputation; fortunately, this is a rare event but individual patient data meta-analysis of the three recent European randomised trials for the management of ruptured AAA shows that amputation is five times more frequent after open repair than EVAR.</p><p id="p0125">The complications and re-interventions required during the primary admission for AAA rupture have been described in the large Medicare dataset.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The only previous detailed reporting of midterm re-interventions comes from the Amsterdam cohort, which followed 467 patients (130 treated by EVAR, 337 by open repair).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The prospective data from the IMPROVE trial provide more cases with EVAR treated predominantly with bifurcated endografts, compared with the preferred use of aorto-uni-iliac endografts in the AJAX trial and Amsterdam study.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The finding from the Amsterdam cohort that graft infection was the commonest reason for mid-term re-intervention cannot be confirmed. Interestingly, the only two cases of graft infection after EVAR came in the acute period and were in the femoro-femoral crossover graft of patients who had been treated with an aorto-uni-iliac endograft. In the acute period abdominal compartment syndrome, bowel ischaemia and limb ischaemia were all more common after open repair. Amputation was much more common after treatment by open repair, although because this is a rare event it needed the combined data from three trials to show this. Taken together this information might suggest the direction of future quality improvement programmes, with stricter adherence to protocols to detect abdominal compartment syndrome and bowel ischaemia, and new protocols for early post-operative imaging to identify limb ischaemia and potential future problems from distal aneurysms: these latter protocols are a topic for future research and evaluation.</p><p id="p0130">In the mid-term the commonest reason for re-intervention was endoleak, with about half of these being type II endoleaks: perhaps there is more enthusiasm for treating type II endoleaks after rupture than after elective repair. The next most common indication for re-intervention was distal aneurysm (in the iliac or common femoral arteries). This is likely to have contributed to the observation that increasing common iliac artery diameter was associated with an increasing rate of arterial re-interventions. There are several potential reasons for this, including focal iliac dilatation not being recognised before repair and the acceptance of a less durable seal in the common iliac artery after EVAR, to avoid internal iliac embolisation, which worsens pelvic ischaemia and prolongs the procedure. There was no other convincing evidence that other morphological parameters, including maximum aortic diameter, influenced the mid-term re-intervention rate. There were two cases of secondary rupture, both after EVAR, but neither was fatal.</p><p id="p0135">The present study has some limitations. The most important of these is that data on re-interventions for the IMPROVE trial were collected from an economic perspective, with the reasons for re-intervention being collected as free text, rather than according to reporting standards. There was no separate collection of data for complications, which may not have been treated, unless they required a hospital admission. The grading of re-interventions as life threatening or not was undertaken retrospectively, following a survey of trial investigators and not included in the case record forms. Also, although the 3 month CT scans were collected in the core laboratory, there were no resources for detailed assessment of whether endograft under sizing was responsible, at least in part, for arterial re-interventions after EVAR.</p><p id="p0140">In summary, this report raises two important matters. Firstly, the continuing need for mid-term re-interventions for life threatening conditions after both EVAR and open repair, at more than twice the rates after elective repair, might suggest that surveillance policies after rupture need to be more strictly enforced and more intensive than those offered after elective repair, particularly for those with open repair and/or greater common iliac diameters. Secondly, clinicians and patients view the impact of re-interventions rather differently and perhaps patient focused outcomes should be included in routine reporting metrics following rupture.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group
