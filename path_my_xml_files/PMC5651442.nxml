Throughout these clinical studies, ponezumab was generally safe and well tolerated, although the pharmacodynamic (PD) response associated with various dosing intervals has not been established. The current clinical study used both biochemical and neuroimaging methods to evaluate the effect of two dosage schedules (monthly and quarterly) of ponezumab on peripheral and central amyloid burden in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. The purpose of this study was to inform dose interval for subsequent trials given the adverse events (AEs) of particularly of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) observed with other anti-amyloid approaches. This study was conducted in parallel with a larger multiple-dose study designed and powered to inform efficacy end points.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were men and women aged &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years with a Mini&#x02013;Mental State Examination (MMSE) <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> score of 16 to 26 and otherwise healthy.

Although active treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, no significant differences from placebo were observed in the change from baseline to month 19 in measures of cognition and function.</p><p>The lack of progression of brain amyloid burden in either treated or placebo subjects over the period evaluated in the present study is consistent with data showing that the most rapid deposition of brain amyloid is an early pathologic event, greatest during the periods preceding and during mild cognitive impairment <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This may explain the apparent lack of translation from preclinical studies with ponezumab, in which a reduction in central amyloid burden, together with improvements in memory and function, were demonstrated in transgenic mouse models of amyloid overexpression <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The small sample size was a limitation of the present study, which was underpowered to detect differences between treatment arms in biochemical, cognitive, or functional end points. With an 80% power to detect a 20% change in the PIB-imaged estimates of insoluble amyloid plaque in the brain, it is important to consider the results of this study alongside the magnitude of changes in brain amyloid burden in studies of other monoclonal antibodies.</p><p>In studies of bapineuzumab, PIB showed significant differences in amyloid burden between the treatment and control groups; there were also significant differences in CSF p-tau concentrations between the two groups among patients who were carriers of the <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 allele <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Furthermore, solanezumab that also recognizes soluble, monomeric amyloid has showed a trend in three successive phase III pivotal trials for modest clinical meaningful improvement albeit nonsignificant on the primary end point. The third trial, Expedition3 reported and 11% (nonsignificant) reduction (improvement) in the ADAS-cog 14 in the mild population <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Solanezumab is now being advanced for an earlier population.

Musuek and Holzman <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> point out that it is possible that the appearance of fibular A&#x003b2; may represent a point in the cascade where it is too late for effective anti-A&#x003b2; therapy. Although the current ponezumab study reports negative results, these data add to the important literature on anti-amyloid therapies to continue to progress the understanding of each antibody's unique mechanism and the potential for therapy alone or in combination.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that ponezumab was generally safe and well tolerated at doses of 7.5&#x000a0;mg/kg administered monthly or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg quarterly for 1&#x000a0;year in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. Plasma ponezumab accumulation was limited following multiple dosing and showed low CSF penetration. Although plasma A&#x003b2; biomarkers showed robust increases, there was no apparent effect on CSF biomarkers, cognition, function, or brain amyloid burden.
