We sought to determine efficacy and safety of teplizumab immunotherapy at 2 years and to identify characteristics associated with therapeutic response. Of 516 randomized patients, 513 were treated, and 462 completed 2 years of follow-up. Teplizumab (14-day full-dose) reduced the loss of C-peptide mean area under the curve (AUC), a prespecified secondary end point, at 2 years versus placebo. In analyses of prespecified and post hoc subsets at entry, U.S. residents, patients with C-peptide mean AUC &#x0003e;0.2 nmol/L, those randomized &#x02264;6 weeks after diagnosis, HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.5% (58 mmol/mol), insulin use &#x0003c;0.4 units/kg/day, and 8&#x02013;17 years of age each had greater teplizumab-associated C-peptide preservation than their counterparts. Exogenous insulin needs tended to be reduced versus placebo. Antidrug antibodies developed in some patients, without apparent change in drug efficacy. No new safety or tolerability issues were observed during year 2. In summary, anti-CD3 therapy reduced C-peptide loss 2 years after diagnosis using a tolerable dose.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Immunotherapy that directly inhibits &#x003b2;-cell destruction is an unfulfilled need for treatment of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Although it may eventually be useful in prediabetes, treatment at clinical onset is an excellent opportunity when patients are easily identified and functional &#x003b2;-cell mass remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Preservation of residual &#x003b2;-cell function, represented by higher levels of C-peptide, facilitates better glycemic control to lessen retinopathy, nephropathy, hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Immunotherapy given at diagnosis aims to prolong and augment this effect by preventing further &#x003b2;-cell death and possibly also by enabling living &#x003b2;-cells to recover function after resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Clinical trials of different agents have had modest success in this regard, but treatment responses have often waned within 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Teplizumab is a nonactivating, Fc-modified, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody thought to attenuate activated autoreactive T cells mediating &#x003b2;-cell death. These T cells disappear from the peripheral circulation during immunotherapy but return within weeks after stopping treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the drug may induce regulatory T-cell activity, suggesting augmented immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; was a large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Recently diagnosed patients (8&#x02013;35 years of age) were randomized to receive daily infusions of placebo or one of three teplizumab regimens at baseline and at 6 months. The primary outcome, a composite of insulin &#x0003c;0.5 units/kg/day and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at year 1, had not been validated previously and did not achieve statistical significance. In exploratory analyses, a significant improvement in area under the curve (AUC) mean C-peptide during a 4-h mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) was observed in the group treated with a full-dose 14-day course. In certain prespecified subgroups, the AUC mean C-peptide differences versus placebo appeared to be most pronounced in recently diagnosed patients, patients in the U.S., and in younger patients. The drug was generally well tolerated.</p><p>A recent study reported that teplizumab treatment reduced &#x003b2;-cell death at 1 year, but the differences versus placebo were not significant earlier, at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The acute (i.e., within 1 year) effects of immunotherapy on &#x003b2;-cell function may not occur through the same mechanisms as longer-term effects that have greater clinical importance. Improvement in C-peptide responses may be seen in type 1 diabetes trials, even with therapies that do not affect immune responses, through mechanisms that may involve recovery of dysfunctional &#x003b2;-cells when inflammation is acutely resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To be of value, a lasting effect on &#x003b2;-cell function and survival is needed.</p><p>The objective of this report is to characterize the efficacy and safety of teplizumab over 2 years and identify characteristics associated with response to therapy. Regarding efficacy, we focus on the 14-day full-dose regimen that was administered versus placebo, because at 1 year, efficacy was seen in the 14-day full-dose arm but not in the reduced-dose or curtailed-dose arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Emphasis is given to AUC mean C-peptide because this has become the preferred measure of efficacy in type 1 diabetes immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). To explore the potential implications for dosing in future studies, we also describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of teplizumab, the effect of antidrug antibodies, and the safety profiles of all three dosing regimens.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Details of the trial methodology were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and are summarized briefly here and in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0236/-/DC1">Supplementary Data online</ext-link>. Participation was restricted to patients with type 1 diabetes diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) within the prior 12 weeks and who required injected insulin therapy. Inclusion also required detectable levels of fasting or stimulated C-peptide and autoantibodies to one or more standard islet autoantigens. Exclusion criteria focused on medical disorders, such as active infections, that might confound results or interfere with safe trial completion. The research protocol was approved by institutional review boards, and all participants or guardians gave written informed consent.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1:1) to one of four parallel treatment groups, with an escalating dose, 14-day course of daily intravenous treatment starting at baseline, and another 14-day course at week 26. For each treatment course, the 14-day full-dose group (<italic>n</italic> = 209) received a total cumulative teplizumab dose of &#x0223c;9,034 &#x000b5;g/m<sup>2</sup>, the 14-day low-dose group (<italic>n</italic> = 102) received a total of &#x0223c;2,985 &#x000b5;g/m<sup>2</sup>, the 6-day full-dose group received a total of &#x0223c;2,426 &#x000b5;g/m<sup>2</sup> over 6 days, followed by 8 days of placebo, and the placebo group (<italic>n</italic> = 99) received 14 days of placebo infusions. Randomization was stratified by age-group (8&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;17, and 18&#x02013;35 years) and by country. Dosing was double-blind (patients and study personnel) to conceal allocation. Patients received a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (e.g., ibuprofen) and/or antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) to minimize adverse events during each treatment cycle.</p><p>Intensive diabetes care was provided for all patients. Investigators were instructed to aggressively treat diabetes to a target HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02264;6.5% and to maintain an insulin dose of &#x02265;0.25 units/kg/day, but insulin adjustment algorithms were not prespecified. Patients used diary cards to record insulin use at screening and for 3 days before each visit at days 91, 140, 273, 364, 448, 546, 616, and 728. Use of agents that might affect islet growth, endogenous insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or immune function was not permitted during the study.</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured, and a 4-h MMTT was performed at a screening visit and on days 140, 364, 546, and 728 (HbA<sub>1c</sub> was also measured on days 273, 448, and 616), and the total AUC mean C-peptide during the MMTT was then calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). After interim analyses determined that the primary end point at 1 year was not met, patients not yet at day 728 continued follow-up, but AUC mean C-peptide, flow cytometry, and anti-drug antibodies were no longer measured to reduce the burden on participants and cost. Anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG, anti&#x02013;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG, and IgM titers were measured at screening and days 28, 91, 140, 210, 273, 364, and 728 to evaluate seropositivity for EBV and CMV; semiquantitative PCR was used to measure viral load for seropositive patients.</p><p>Adverse events, including clinically significant hypoglycemia, and abnormal laboratory values were reported by investigators, coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Changes from baseline for AUC mean C-peptide, a prespecified secondary end point, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and other measures in teplizumab groups were compared with the placebo group using mixed-model repeated-measures analysis (MMRM) models, adjusted for age-group and baseline values. A Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by age-group (8&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;17, and 18&#x02013;35 years) or Fisher exact test was used for exploratory efficacy analyses of dichotomous outcomes. Two-sided testing was done at an &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Subset analyses compared the 14-day full-dose regimen with placebo; age-groups, regions, and time from diagnosis to randomization were prespecified subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These analyses were done for hypothesis generation because the primary outcome was not significant at 1 year; therefore, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Similar analyses were conducted for the other treatment groups; however, no meaningful findings were observed, so the results are not presented.</p><p>The 1-year analysis used a nonparametric analysis and reported median values for AUC mean C-peptide because the distribution was not normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>); a last observation carried forward analysis was used at the request of regulators, because too few time points existed for a longitudinal analysis at 1 year. For the current report at 2 years, longitudinal analysis (MMRM) was used instead of last observation carried forward. AUC mean C-peptide change from baseline was calculated using [ln(AUC mean C-peptide<sub>Day </sub><italic><sub>x</sub></italic> + 1) &#x02212; ln(AUC mean C-peptide<sub>Baseline</sub> + 1)].

This effect was strongest in particular subsets, including children, those randomized &#x02264;6 weeks after diagnosis, and in U.S. participants. As reported earlier, no significant differences were observed between the teplizumab and placebo treatment groups using a previously unvalidated primary composite end point (insulin &#x0003c;0.5 units/kg/day and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.5% at year 1). Although investigators were instructed to treat aggressively to HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.5% and to maintain insulin &#x0003e;0.25 units/kg/day, this may have been unrealistic given that, after a nadir of &#x0223c;6.9% (52 mmol/mol) at 90 days, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> increased to &#x0223c;7.9% (63 mmol/mol) at year 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and to 8.4% (68 mmol/mol) at year 2. Further, C-peptide may be a more objective and reliable outcome than insulin use and HbA<sub>1c</sub> because it is a more direct indicator of endogenous insulin secretion and cannot be easily measured or manipulated by patients or their physicians. AUC mean C-peptide is now the most widely used end point for type 1 diabetes interventions and is accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a primary end point for these trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The AUC mean C-peptide treatment difference versus placebo did not appear to change markedly during the second year of follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), although the study was not designed to test hypotheses regarding time-trends. A particularly strong treatment effect was found in patient subsets that shared characteristics of early type 1 diabetes, including treatment sooner after diagnosis, lower baseline insulin use, greater C-peptide, and lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline. The higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lower C-peptide levels suggest the patients in India had more advanced disease. Larger treatment effects on AUC mean C-peptide were also observed in subjects 8&#x02013;17 years of age, who have a more rapid C-peptide decline, on average, than adults.</p><p>The modified composite end point (insulin &#x0003c;0.25 units/kg/day and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%) and insulin use also suggested a treatment benefit on insulin use. In the U.S., the overall insulin use was less in the teplizumab-treated subjects compared with those receiving placebo. This trend was not seen when subjects outside the U.S. were included, perhaps reflecting different patterns of insulin use in other countries. Together, the results suggest teplizumab treatment preserves endogenous insulin, thereby reducing needs for exogenous insulin to maintain glycemic control.</p><p>Immunotherapy must meet a high safety standard because clinical type 1 diabetes can be managed using insulin. However, good metabolic control is often difficult to achieve safely with insulin: a recent study of 25,833 type 1 diabetic patients revealed that 7% reported severe hypoglycemic events (seizure or coma) and 8% reported diabetic ketoacidosis in the prior 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). High doses of anti-CD3 immunotherapy are associated with tolerability/toxicity issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), whereas low doses appear to be ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). One phase 2 trial of teplizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) used a high dose (37 mg total per course per 1.9-m<sup>2</sup> subject) and observed a high (28%) incidence of grade 2 or greater adverse events associated with infusion (primarily fever, nausea, vomiting, and rigors), whereas the incidence was only 6% in an earlier trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; trial used a dose of 17 mg total per course (for a 1.9-m<sup>2</sup> patient), comparable with that used in the earlier trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and experienced similar excellent tolerability. Conversely, very low-dose otelixizumab (another nonactivating Fc-modified anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody), dosed at 3.1 mg over 8 days, did not preserve &#x003b2;-cell function in a double-blinded phase 3 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and the Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; treatment arms with lower cumulative dose were also ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Overall, the 14-day full-dose regimen of Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; appears to provide sufficient drug to influence efficacy measures, with acceptable tolerability and safety.</p><p>Treatment-related adverse experiences were mostly limited to the dosing period and generally resolved within 14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Most (transient cytopenias, transient mild laboratory or clinical manifestations of cytokine release such as rash, headache, nausea, and vomiting) were moderate, manageable, and expected as a manifestation of the intended mechanism of action. Along with transient small increases in aminotransferases, these also represented the main differences versus placebo in year 1 safety analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Use of effective stopping rules (based on liver function tests to delimit cytokine-release syndrome) served to lessen adverse events compared with earlier studies, allowing 90.6% of treated patients to complete a full course of drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The observed reduction in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells likely reflects transient margination of the T-cell compartment and apoptosis of some activated T-cell subsets. Both may be relevant mechanisms of action of teplizumab, wherein the T-effector cells, which are maintaining an inflammatory environment in the pancreas, are preferentially depleted while regulatory T cells are favored. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood in the treated Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; patients suggested that Foxp3 expression might be increased in CD8<sup>+</sup> but not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during periods of maximum drug binding to T cells. Previous studies have shown that teplizumab induces activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells are directed to the lamina propria, where they appear to acquire regulatory function, although cell deletion may also be involved in the drug action.</p><p>Longer-term changes in patient immune function, such as persistent low CD4 counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and reactivation of EBV infection, were reported from previous studies that used much higher anti-CD3 doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). At the lower doses used in Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9;, EBV reactivation was rare, and acute mononucleosis syndrome was not increased versus placebo. A possible dose-related increase in herpes zoster was seen, with 10 cases (that could not be subsequently confirmed) reported among teplizumab patients; no cases occurred in the placebo group. Of note, in a subsequent phase 3, double-blind, randomized study (<italic>n</italic> = 254) with identical teplizumab dosing (NCT00920582), after 2 years of follow-up, the only patient with herpes zoster was a placebo patient (data on file).</p><p>To be meaningful, treatment effects must be maintained for multiple years. Repeated dosing might be advantageous if it increases durability without causing new or cumulative side effects. Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; did not include an arm with a single drug cycle and cannot answer whether two drug cycles confer greater benefit or duration than a single cycle. Nonetheless, Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; did not identify any cumulative, persistent, or unexpected safety or tolerability issues. Although high levels of anti-drug antibodies occurred late in the second cycle in about one-sixth of all patients and appeared to accelerate drug clearance, this did not appear to affect efficacy end points.</p><p>The large number and diverse characteristics of Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; patients enables more precise estimates of treatment effects than smaller trials, increases generalizability, and allows for meaningful subset analyses. The 2-year follow-up provides evaluation of efficacy and safety during placebo-controlled double-blind conditions for a longer period than previous trials. The double-blind design reduces the potential for bias. Limitations of the study include the heterogeneous baseline patient disease status, post hoc analyses without adjustment for multiple comparisons, and elimination of AUC mean C-peptide measurements in some patients after the primary analysis at year 1, which may have reduced statistical power. Another limitation is the lack of information on HLA-DQ/DR or other genotypes that might identify patient subsets with greater response.</p><p>Rodent studies reported full reversal of diabetes using anti-CD3 immunotherapy, but only when given immediately at disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In clinical trials, delays due to required screening and enrollment procedures may lead to lower drug efficacy. In actual clinical settings, immunotherapy could be initiated promptly at the time of diagnosis. Further, the peak incidence of diabetes occurs in 8- to 11-year-olds, and subjects 8&#x02013;17 years of age appeared to have a greater drug response than older patients.</p><p>In summary, continued follow-up for a second year demonstrated a benefit of teplizumab treatment on AUC mean C-peptide and a possible benefit on insulin needs. Most importantly, these analyses identified baseline characteristics associated with greater treatment efficacy. No new safety or tolerability issues emerged. These post hoc findings are hypothesis-generating, and confirmation is needed; nevertheless, they suggest that future studies of CD3 immunotherapy should consider recruiting young patients with better glucose control and greater remaining endogenous insulin secretion and initiating treatment immediately upon diagnosis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
