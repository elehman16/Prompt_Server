The influence of cruciferous vegetable intake on cancer risk has been hypothesized to be through several mechanisms, including reduction in systemic oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], suppression of mutagenic and carcinogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], reduction in proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables that can be hydrolyzed to yield isothiocyanates (ITC) and indole-3-carbinol are hypothesized to be the major bioactive constituents contributing to these cancer-preventive effects.</p><p>ITC are metabolized through the mercapturic acid pathway, with GST conjugation of ITC and glutathione as the first step in the pathway toward degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, ITC are substrates for several GST enzymes, particularly <italic>GSTM1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A homozygous deletion of the <italic>GSTM1 </italic>gene results in no detectable <italic>GSTM1</italic> activity. Hence, <italic>GSTM1</italic>-null individuals may have greater exposure to ITC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although pharmacokinetic studies do not conclusively support this concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is possible that other GST isozymes may partially compensate for the lack of <italic>GSTM1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we showed that matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis of serum proteins could distinguish individuals on the basis of whether they were consuming controlled diets devoid of, or supplemented with, cruciferous vegetables; two specific peptide markers, one of which was the B-chain of alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG B-chain), had the ability to discriminate most accurately between diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here we analyze samples from a more recent and comprehensive controlled feeding study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] with the objectives to: 1) confirm the previous results, 2) evaluate the dose-response effect of cruciferous vegetables on the serum peptidome in a separate, independent sample, and 3) examine the peptidomic response to diet in the context of <italic>GSTM1+ </italic>genotype. We hypothesized that, due to the potential differences in ITC metabolism between <italic>GSTM1</italic>+ and <italic>GSTM1-null </italic>individuals, the serum peptidome would differ by genotype.

The Institutional Review Board at the FHCRC approved the studies and informed written consent was obtained from all participants prior to the start of these studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Diets</title><p>The EAT and 2EAT studies were conducted as randomized, controlled feeding studies. Study diets were prepared by the FHCRC Human Nutrition Lab. Dinner was served in the Human Nutrition Lab dining room Sunday through Friday evening, and food for the following day's morning, midday meal, and snacks was distributed at that time. On Friday evening, participants picked up food for Saturday and Sunday meals. The major portion of the test vegetables was provided as part of the dinner under the supervision of the study staff. Participants were instructed to consume only the food and beverages provided for them during the diet periods. They were requested not to take any medication, alcoholic beverages, or nutritional supplements and to maintain their usual physical activity during each period. Any food not consumed was recorded on the participant's chart. Compliance with the study diet and deviations from the diet were monitored using daily food check-off forms.</p><p>In the EAT feeding study, participants consumed four different controlled diets: (i) a basal diet devoid of fruit and vegetables; (ii) the basal diet supplemented with a prescribed amount of cruciferous vegetables (436 g/day of a mixture of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and radish sprouts); (iii) the basal diet supplemented with allium vegetables (90 g/day of a mixture of chives, leeks, garlic and onions); (iv) and the basal diet supplemented with apiaceous vegetables (270 g/day of a mixture of carrots, celery, dill weed, parsley and parsnips) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Designed originally to test the effects of diet on biotransformation enzymes, each of the four diet periods lasted 6 days with at least a 2 week washout period between diets. Biotransformation enzymes respond rapidly to diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ITC doses are cleared in urine in 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], supporting the lengths of the treatment periods and washouts. In this study, all individuals received the same doses of vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the 2EAT feeding study, participants consumed four different controlled diets: (i) a basal diet devoid of fruit and vegetables; (ii) the basal diet supplemented with a prescribed amount of cruciferous vegetables [single-dose (1X) cruciferous diet, 7 g/kg-body-weight of a mixture of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and radish sprouts]; (iii) the basal diet supplemented with twice this amount of cruciferous vegetables [double-dose (2X) cruciferous diet, 14 g/kg body weight]; (iv) and the basal diet supplemented with 7 g cruciferous vegetables/kg body weight and 4 g apiaceous vegetables/kg body weight (1X cruciferous plus apiaceous vegetable diet; the apiaceous vegetables include a mix of carrots, celery, dill weed, parsley and parsnips) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Diet order was randomly assigned in the cross-over design and controlled for in the analysis. Each of the four diet periods lasted 14 days with at least a 21 day washout period between diets and as indicated, vegetables were dosed by body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our initial mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the largest differences were between the cruciferous and basal diets, so the apiaceous and allium vegetable diets (from EAT, diet iii and iv; from 2EAT, diet iv) were not included in further analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Specimen collection</title><p>For the EAT study, blood samples obtained on the last day (day 7) of each feeding period were used for this analysis. Blood was drawn in the morning following an 8-12 hour overnight fast. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min before it was centrifuged to separate the serum. Serum was aliquotted and stored at -80&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For the 2EAT study, blood was collected from participants on days 0, 7, 11 and day 15 of each feeding period; only samples from day 15 of the basal and 2 cruciferous vegetable diets were used for this analysis. Blood was drawn in the morning after a 12 hour, overnight fast and serum obtained, aliquoted and stored as for the EAT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotyping was conducted on buccal cell DNA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Highly abundant serum proteins, such as albumin and IgG, can cause crystallization defects and reduce the flight of low abundant proteins and peptides in TOF analyses. Therefore, after evaluating a number of methods, we chose a commonly used method to precipitate large globular proteins by mixing 25 uL serum 1:1 with 100% acetonitrile (AcN), shaking on a Vortex Genie 2 (Scientific Industries, Inc., Bohemia, NY) for 30 min and centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamic acid (sinapic acid) matrix (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 &#x003bc;L was spotted onto a hydrophobic 384 well MALDI plate in quintuplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Samples were analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS on an Applied Biosystem Voyager DE-Pro spectrometer (Foster City, CA). Daily machine calibrations were performed using cytochrome c [12361 (+1), 6181 (+2)] to obtain mass accuracy. Plates were analyzed in linear mode using a 337 nm nitrogen laser, under the following settings optimized using cytochrome c: laser intensity 1,784; accelerating voltage 25,000; grid voltage 23,000; guide wire voltage 1,250; delay time 325 ns; low mass gate 1,000; molecular mass range 1,000-40,000. Final spectra were generated by summing spectra produced from 20 laser hits at up to 20 places per spot (a total of up to 400 laser hits per summed spectra).</p></sec><sec><title>Peak Identification and Alignment</title><p>To allow for direct comparison, the two datasets were aligned and processed to formulate a common set of peaks among spectra using procedures as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The intensity values of the resulting aligned peaks were then transformed and standardized as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Briefly, an intensity value, <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>ijk </italic></sub>for subject <italic>i</italic>, spectrum <italic>j </italic>at peak <italic>k</italic>, was transformed to <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ijk </italic></sub>= ln(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>ijk </italic></sub>- <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k </italic></sub>+ 0.1) where <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k </italic></sub>is the minimum intensity measured at the <italic>k</italic><sup>th </sup>peak among all spectra. The value 0.1 is arbitrary and included to stabilize the logarithm of any extremely small value; <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub>-<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k </italic></sub>was the minimum intensity measured at the <italic>k</italic><sup>th </sup>peak among all spectra.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Transformed peak intensities were used in a linear mixed model that included fixed-effect covariates of sex, <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype, feeding period, diet treatment, feeding order and an interaction term between genotype and diet; a random-effects term for 'participant' was included to accommodate the crossover feeding design. The same model was used in both EAT and 2EAT feeding studies. To make these data compatible, it was necessary to jointly process and align spectra from both studies to obtain a list of peaks common to both sets of spectra. The peak intensities at each m/z value in this list were independently estimated by the back-transformed least squares for each study. To find the peaks of interest that were consistent in both EAT and 2EAT and, hence, worthy of further study, we applied the following criterion: (1) the peaks shown to be significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05 from the linear mixed model) when comparing the ratio of basal to 1X cruciferous in EAT and 2EAT or the ratio of basal to 2X cruciferous in 2EAT study; (2) peaks from step 1 that have similar size in both studies for the basal and 1X cruciferous diets (EAT has no 2X diet); (3) peaks from steps 1 and 2 that exhibit the same trend when comparing basal and 1X cruciferous diets in both studies. The peaks selected with these criteria were used for further investigation. All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS Program (version 9.1; SAS Institute). Two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value for statistical significance was set at &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>To prevent confounding by body weight between the sexes in the second study, the amount of vegetables provided was done on a per-kg body-weight basis, and ranged from 284 g to 662 g for the single-dose cruciferous diet and 568 g to 1324 g for the double-dose cruciferous diet. Analyses were conducted both with and without adjusting for vegetable amount; because there were no statistically significant differences between the analyses with and without adjustment, the data are presented without adjustment.</p><p>Analysis of significance for the western and dot blots was done using linear regression of the average transthyretin (TTR) and zinc &#x003b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG) levels associated with cruciferous dose according to genotype, adjusted for the TTR or ZAG levels from basal feeding period with robust standard error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, generalized estimating equations were used with an exchangeable working correlation structure and averages were regressed of any level of TTR or ZAG from cruciferous intake on genotype and adjusted for basal levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein Identification</title><p>To identify peptides represented by the statistically significant peaks from the MALDI-TOF analysis, albumin and IgG were removed from the sample via PROT-IA spin columns (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Laemmli sample buffer was added to the eluate and the sample was heated at 100&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The proteins were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) using 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES) running buffer (Invitrogen). The gel was silver stained and bands corresponding to the correct size were excised. The gel slices were digested with trypsin in 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. Peptides were extracted from the gel slice and desalted with a C18 ZipTip (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The material was then analyzed by nano LC/MS using a ThermoFisher LTQ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Proteins were identified using Xtandem. The database search was performed against the human IPI database using Protein Prophet. Results were uploaded to Computational Portal and Analysis System (CPAS) database and interrogated using the following filters to look for individual proteins or peptides: Ion Percent &#x02265; 0.15; +1 Raw Score &#x02265; 200; + 2 Raw Score &#x02265; 300; + 3 Raw Score &#x02265; 300; Unique Peptides &#x0003e; 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Fractionation of serum for peptide identification</title><p>Control serum (3 mL) was precipitated with an equal volume of AcN. The protein concentration of the supernatant from the precipitation was determined using a BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 4 mg protein was concentrated to 500 uL in a Thermo Scientific SpeedVac and loaded onto a Poros R2/10 RP column (Applied Biosystems) attached to a Shimadzu SCL-10A liquid chromatograph. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 2.7 mL/min using aqueous AcN-TFA solvents (buffer A: 5% AcN in 0.1% TFA in water; buffer B: 90% AcN and 0.1% TFA in 10% water). The column was equilibrated at 90% buffer A. Buffer B was increased to 5% over 10 min, then to 60% over the next 57 min, and finally to 95% in the last 6 min. The column eluate was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. Fractions were collected every 30 sec. All fractions were analyzed <italic>via </italic>MALDI-TOF to identify those containing the peptide of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analyses</title><p>For immunoblot analyses, serum samples from the basal and 2X cruciferous diets for 4 participants in the 2EAT study were chosen based on high signal-to-noise ratios in the range of interest. Each sample (25 &#x003bc;L) was precipitated with 25 &#x003bc;L AcN. The protein concentration of the supernatant from the precipitation was determined using a BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Seventy-five micrograms of protein per sample was boiled for 5 min in 3X sample buffer and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS at room temperature. The blot was incubated overnight with a TTR antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) at 1:500 dilution. Primary antibodies were visualized with a fluorescent-dye-labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor-680 goat anti-rabbit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and directly quantified using the LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey infrared imaging system (Lincoln, NE) and associated software.</p><p>For dot blot analyses, serum samples (1 &#x003bc;L) from each of the diets for 2EAT participants were spotted in a 96-well format onto nitrocellulose and the level of TTR or ZAG was visualized as described above. For ZAG, the blot was incubated overnight with a ZAG antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 1:250 dilution.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of diet and genotype in EAT</title><p>In the EAT feeding study, participants consumed a basal diet devoid of fruits and vegetables for 6 days, and, in a different feeding period, the basal diet supplemented with cruciferous vegetables (436 g/day of a mixture of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and radish sprouts) also for 6 days. MALDI-TOF spectra (1,000-40,000 m/z range) of participant serum were collected for the basal and cruciferous diets for the 36 study participants in EAT.

MALDI-TOF spectra were collected for each of the diets for the 42 study participants in 2EAT. Peak alignment (coordinated with the EAT data), peak selection and statistical analysis were carried out as described for the EAT spectra. For the 2X cruciferous diet, the analysis identified 24 statistically significant (P &#x0003c; 0.05) peaks that differed from the basal diet. Stratifying the 2X data by genotype, 19 of these 24 were still significant in one genotype or the other. However, independent of these, there were 15 additional peaks that were unique to <italic>GSTM1-null </italic>individuals and 23 additional peaks that were unique to <italic>GSTM1+ </italic>individuals.

We identified two peaks (6700 <italic>m/z </italic>and 9565 <italic>m/z</italic>) that were affected by the combination of diet and <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype and showed consistent trends across diets in both studies as a doubly charged isoform of TTR (6700 <italic>m/z</italic>) and a fragment of ZAG (9565 <italic>m/z</italic>). Using both MALDI-TOF and immunoassays, we demonstrated that both TTR and ZAG decrease with cruciferous vegetable intake among <italic>GSTM1+ </italic>individuals, but not among individuals with the <italic>GSTM1-null </italic>genotype.</p><p>TTR is a negative acute-phase protein that decreases in serum with early signs of inflammation. It is a known marker of nutritional status and with a half-life of ~2 days, its concentration closely reflects recent changes in diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. TTR has several known biological roles: In cerebrospinal fluid, it is a carrier of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and retinol. In serum, TTR transports 15% of T4 and retinol through the complex formation with retinol binding protein (RBP). It also binds many aromatic compounds, leading to speculation of its role in removal of toxic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Constituents of cruciferous vegetables at high doses have been shown to suppress the function of the thyroid gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, although the types and doses of cruciferous vegetables fed in this study were unlikely to influence thyroid function appreciably, one possible explanation of our results is that changes in T4 due to cruciferous vegetable feeding result in less TTR being needed in serum to aid in transport. Another possible explanation is that cruciferous vegetable constituents more directly influence TTR gene expression or TTR protein half-life through other pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>ZAG is an adipokine and apparently plays multiple roles in the human body, most concerning lipid mobilization from fat stores. Levels of ZAG expression are regulated by glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. ZAG is synthesized in the liver and increased levels correlate with lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], implying that it may be regulated by fat intake. Decreased levels of ZAG associated with increased cruciferous vegetable intake could relate to adipokine signaling. Another possible explanation is that cruciferous vegetable constituents directly influence gene expression as it has been suggested that ZAG expression is likely mediated by the interaction of several synergistic transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Investigation into the levels of other adipokines and further analysis of ZAG processing will be necessary to shed light on the biology behind these cruciferous vegetable mediated changes.</p><p>These <italic>GSTM1</italic>-genotype-specific responses of TTR and ZAG to cruciferous vegetable intake suggest that differential response to ITC exposure in <italic>GSTM1+ </italic>and <italic>GSTM1</italic>-null individuals may influence the serum peptidome. Whether this genotypic difference is due to a difference in ITC metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or another factor remains to be determined. To date, studies have not shown consistent pharmacokinetic differences in ITC handling by <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype, but given the rather broad and overlapping substrate specificities of this superfamily of enzymes, other GST isozymes may compensate in part for the lack of <italic>GSTM1</italic> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or alternative metabolic pathways may substitute for <italic>GSTM1</italic>. By whatever mechanism, several interventions and observational studies suggest a modifying effect of <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype on serum GST-&#x003b1; in response to cruciferous vegetable exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and as biomarkers of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Based on this previous work and our findings here, it appears that this effect may extend to other serum proteins.</p><p>We have also demonstrated that, in the context of a controlled study and systematic data analysis, MALDI-TOF MS is a suitable tool for identifying reproducible biomarkers that respond to diet. In an earlier MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the EAT study, a peptide identified as the B-chain of &#x003b1;2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) decreased with cruciferous vegetable intake (p = 0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the current 2EAT single-dose cruciferous diet data this peptide showed a similar trend but without statistical significance (p = 0.197).</p><p>The strengths of our study include the controlled feeding study crossover design, the use of two separate datasets to examine the consistency of peak changes across both studies, and the availability of samples from individuals given two doses of cruciferous vegetables in 2EAT for the assessment of dose-response. Limitations of this study include the modest sample sizes, which limited our power to further stratify the data by sex, race, genotype and other possibly confounding factors. Nonetheless, with 78 (36 + 42) participants, we had 80% power (with Type I error probability of 5%) to detect a biomarker difference between the cruciferous and basal diets as small as one-third of its standard deviation. The two feeding studies were slightly different; the feeding period length was 6 days for EAT and 14 days for 2EAT. Further, participants were fed amounts of cruciferous vegetables based on their total body weight in 2EAT, but the same, absolute amount in EAT. In 2EAT, the 2X cruciferous diet also provided doses of cruciferous vegetables that were substantially higher than usual intake reducing generalizability of the results. To reduce inherent variability due to sample preparation and matrix crystallization inconsistencies, samples were run in quintuplicate with multiple preparations for each sample. All samples from each individual in the study were run on the same plate to decrease variability between plates. All plates were run over the course of two consecutive days to limit day-to-day and instrument variability. The peak identification process can be time-consuming and validation can be costly, hence identifying a large number of significant peaks is challenging. Despite these issues, we were able to find peaks with consistent changes in response to cruciferous diet. Further investigation is necessary to establish the mechanism by which crucifers contribute to these protein changes in relation to <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we demonstrated that the serum peptidome is dependent on <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotype-diet interactions. Our results support the hypothesis that people of different <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genotypes show changes in serum protein content as a result of metabolic response to diets high in cruciferous vegetables. We identified two notable peaks as TTR and ZAG with high sensitivities and specificities. Particularly for ZAG, these results imply a role in <italic>GSTM1</italic>-regulated dietary biomarkers that should be investigated further. Finally, the study design and the analytic methods utilized here could be applied more generally to intervention and observational studies of genotype-diet interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors (Heather Ann Brauer, Tanya Libby, Breeana L.
