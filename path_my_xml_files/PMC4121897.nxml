Foot ulcers are one such complication observed in one in six people with diabetes. Unfortunately, these foot ulcers do not heal easily, are difficult to treat and are more prone to secondary infections.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Neuropathy, high plantar pressure, poor glucose control and duration of diabetes contribute to the severity of foot ulceration[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and are the most common underlying cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Severities of diabetic foot ulceration are classified using the Wagner system.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Grade 1 ulcers are superficial ulcers involving the full skin thickness, but no underlying tissues. Grade 2 ulcers are deeper, penetrating down to ligaments and muscle, but not involving bone or abscess formation. Grade 3 ulcers are deep ulcers with cellulitis or abscess formation, often complicated with osteomyelitis. Ulcers with localized gangrene are classified as Grade 4 and those with extensive gangrene involving the entire foot are classified as Grade 5.</p><p>Novel therapeutic approaches such as topical use of honey,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] collagen,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] cryopreserved fibroblast implants[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or growth factors[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are being evaluated to treat diabetic foot ulcers. Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) is one such factor, which plays a significant role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, recombinant hEGF (rhEGF) (beta-urogastrone) has been developed using the recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to explore its therapeutic application. In the present study, we have to evaluate the efficacy of beta-urogastrone (rhEGF) dressings in Wagner's Grades 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted in the Department of Surgery, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India. Patients were divided into two groups of 25 patients each. Group I was the study group and patients in this group received topical application of beta-urogastrone (rhEGF) gel. Group II was the control group and patients in this group received betadine dressing.

In some patients, surgical intervention (amputation or debridement) was performed to remove any slough or necrotic tissue over the wound surface before initiating the treatment. In Group I, beta-urogastrone (rhEGF) was applied. Beta-urogastrone is commercially available in the market in gel form in 15 g concentration. It was applied as a thick layer and a dry sterilized gauze piece was placed over the dressing and covered with a bandage. The beta-urogastrone dressing was kept over the wound surface for a maximum period of 8 weeks. In Group II, dressings were performed with betadine daily.</p><p>The observations of the treatment were recorded after every 2 weeks. At each inspection, the following points were recorded:</p><p>

The main goal of dressing selection is to produce rapid and optimal wound healing that is cosmetically acceptable, reduce pain, prevent/control wound infections, decrease the quantity of wound secretion, cause minimal distress to the patient and improve the quality of patient's life.</p><p>hEGF plays a significant role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recombinant hEGF (beta-urogastrone) produced by recombinant DNA technology acts by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor on the cell surface and stimulates the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, ultimately leading to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of rhEGF dressings in Wagner's Grades 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers.</p><p>rhEGF therapy significantly decreased the amount of discharge in both groups; however, the effects were observed earlier in Group I compared with Group II. The decreasing trend in Group I was more evident in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> weeks, whereas in Group II, a similar trend was delayed and observed at 6<sup>th</sup> week. Our results are consistent with the previous study reporting topical application of rhEGF ointment promoting wound healing.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The benefits following rhEGF application was attributed to increased rate of epidermal proliferation, accelerated wound contraction, myofibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Increase in collagen deposition contributes to decrease in wound discharge. rhEGF therapy also significantly promoted granulation tissue formation as observed in Group I, which is consistent with previously reported effects of rhEGF in promoting skin wound repair by enhancing granulation tissue formation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The mean time of wound healing was (17.2 &#x000b1; 1.3) and (20.5 &#x000b1; 1.6) days in Group I and II respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p><p>Cellulitis in the surrounding tissue was seen only in 15 patients (60%) in Group I while cellulites was observed in 20 patients from Group II; hence, it is reasonable to conclude that rhEGF therapy significantly reduced incidence of cellulites. Significantly more number of patient's in Group I showed reduced wound size while the majority of the patient's in Group II had ulcers resistant to treatment.
