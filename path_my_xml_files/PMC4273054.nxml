riding and virtual reality exercises on the dynamic balance ability of normal adults.
[Subjects] This study enrolled 24 normal adults and divided them into two groups: an
indoor horseback riding exercise group (IHREG, n = 12) and a virtual reality exercise
group (VREG, n = 12). [Methods] IHREG exercised on indoor horseback riding equipment and
VREG exercised using the Nintendo Wii Fit three times a week for six weeks. The Biodex
Balance System was used to analyze dynamic balance as measured by the overall stability
index (OSI), anteroposterior stability index (APSI), and mediolateral stability index
(MLSI). [Results] In the within-group comparison, IHREG and VERG both showed significant
decreases in the dynamic balance indexes of OSI, APSI, and MLSI after the intervention,
but no significant difference was found between the groups. [Conclusion] Both indoor
horseback riding and virtual reality exercises were effective at improving the subjects&#x02019;
dynamic balance ability as measured by OSI, APSI, and MLSI, and can be used as additional
exercises for patients with conditions affecting postural control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Indoor horseback riding exercise</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality exercise</kwd><kwd>Dynamic balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with conditions affecting postural control face difficulties performing daily
living activities and therapeutic interventions because of postural disturbance and a large
negative effect on muscle activity, as their sensory information is often transmitted
abnormally<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hippotherapy has been used to improve the postural control of such patients, but it has
limited applicability due to its space requirements, cost, and the risks involved in
mounting patients on live horses. To overcome these barriers, an indoor horseback riding
machine has been devised and can be used as a therapeutic tool that is available any time.
Indoor horseback riding exercise equipment can mimic the rhythmic motion of a horse&#x02019;s
movement, helping riders improve their stability and flexibility, as well as developing
their muscles. It can be used to improve the balance and postural control of normal and
disabled individuals<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality programs using the Nintendo Wii Fit can be
conveniently and inexpensively enjoyed at home. These programs often stimulate excitement
and enjoyment motivating users to continue using them. Furthermore, many studies of virtual
reality have been conducted and the reliability of its therapeutic effects has been
proven<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality, the
interaction between users and computers, has the advantage of providing a wider range of
motions than patients might encounter in real situations.</p><p>Although many previous studies have investigated the effects of proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation, the Bobath method, sling, and ball exercises on postural
balance, comparative studies of the dynamic balance ability gains from exercise on indoor
horseback riding equipment and virtual reality exercise using Nintendo Wii Fit have not yet
been performed. This study aimed to determine the effects of indoor horseback riding and
virtual reality exercises on dynamic balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 24 healthy adults in their twenties, all students of Y
University in Chungbuk, who were divided into two groups: an indoor horseback riding
exercise group (IHREG; n = 12, age 19.4 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years, height 163.7 &#x000b1; 6.8&#x02005;cm, weight 61.5 &#x000b1;
13.8&#x02005;kg) and a virtual reality exercise group (VREG; n = 12, age 19.4 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, height
162.2 &#x000b1; 5.0&#x02005;cm, weight 53.7 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;kg). All of the subjects received an explanation about the
purpose and exercise methods of the study prior to their participation and provided their
informed consent according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
selected subjects had no experience of indoor horseback riding or virtual reality exercises,
no medical abnormalities and were not receiving pharmacological treatments. Those who had
undergone muscle-strengthening training within the previous six months or who had orthopedic
or neurological injuries were excluded from the study.</p><p>In this study, an electrical indoor horseback riding exercise equipment (SRIDER, Neipplus
Co., Korea) was employed to simulate horseback riding exercise for the subjects. Indoor
horseback riding exercise equipment&#x02014;a machine that imitates the movements of a horse&#x02019;s
back&#x02014;has been widely used in Korea in recent years. The equipment used for this study is
less than 1&#x02005;m long, smaller than most existing horseback riding simulators. The intensity of
the exercise can be controlled by adjusting the speed and the range of the saddle&#x02019;s
movement. IHREG used whole-body and complex exercise programs selected from the SRIDER&#x02019;s
built-in programs. Subjects were instructed to look forward with the shoulders in a neutral
position and with a straight back while holding the handle and bending the knees at 90
degrees to keep the feet from touching the ground. The foot rest was not installed in this
study. The exercise consisted of a 25-minute session three days a week for six weeks. During
the same period, the VREG exercised using the Nintendo Wii Fit (Nintendo Co., Ltd., Japan).
To use the Wii Fit, a subject stands on a balance plate and the virtual reality system
starts a game in which the balance plate recognizes the subject&#x02019;s motion. When the subject
redistributes his or her weight on the balance plate, the system simulates the action in the
virtual reality displayed on the screen. An on-screen avatar follows the subject&#x02019;s movement,
providing visual and auditory feedback, and the Wii Remote supplies tactile feedback by
vibrating in response to the user&#x02019;s actions. The VREG was assigned three exercises related
to balance activity that were chosen from the Wii Fit menu and are played by standing and
redistributing body weight on the balance board without lifting the heels and toes. The
subjects played a 25-minute sessions including Ski Slalom, Table Tile, and Balance Bubble
exercises three days a week, for the first three weeks in the beginner mode, and then for
three more weeks in the advanced mode.</p><p>In order to collect clinical data related to dynamic balance ability, this study used the
Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., USA). Stability levels of the foot board
range from Level 8, the lowest, to Level 1, the highest. To measure their posture, subjects
stood on the center of the circular foot board of the Biodex Balance System which was set to
Stability Level 6, with their legs about shoulder width apart and their arms resting
alongside the trunk, for 40 seconds per measurement. Three measurements were taken, and
subjects were allowed 10 seconds of rest on the floor between measurements. The lower the
values of the overall stability index (OSI), anterioposterior stability index (APSI), and
mediolateral stability index (MLSI) are, the higher a subject&#x02019;s balance ability is.</p><p>The paired t-test was employed to determine the significance of differences in dynamic
balance ability between before and after the intervention within each group, while the
independent sample t-test was conducted to compare dynamic balance ability between the two
groups. The present study used SPSS 12.0 Windows for statistical processing, and a
significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, both IHREG and VERG showed significant decreases in average OSI,

horseback riding equipment and virtual reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit on the
dynamic balance ability of normal adults.</p><p>Cho et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 30 subjects
improved their postural balance ability and proprioception by using a horseback riding
simulator. Kuczy&#x00144;ski and S&#x00142;onka<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> presented
evidence that after 25 subjects with cerebral palsy had used horseback riding simulators for
12 weeks, their right and left balance ability improved significantly. In addition, Lee et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a horseback riding
simulator used for hippotherapy improved both the static and the dynamic balance of children
with cerebral palsy. Beinotti el al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that 20 stroke patients who received hippotherapy found their gait and balance
ability improved. Park et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> also
reported that use of a horseback riding simulator improved the eyes-closed balance and
dynamic balance ability of patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>Dunning et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that after
patients with stroke performed exercises using virtual reality systems for eight weeks, they
showed improvements in gait speed, ankle movement, and plantar flexion while pushing the
ankle, as well as increases in ankle muscle strength and gait speed. Walker et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that weight-supported treadmill
training performed by patients with chronic stroke in a virtual environment was more
effective at improving their balance than treadmill training in a normal environment.
Yavuzer et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 20 patients with
stroke and found that a group that performed virtual reality exercises for four weeks showed
a significant increase in upper extremity functions, such as dressing, in terms of
functional independence measures, compared to a placebo group. Park et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a virtual reality exercise
significantly increased the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior and medial
gastrocnemius muscles. Merians et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
also studied stroke patients and reported that virtual reality programs using robots, motion
detection, sensor-attached gloves, and computers were effective for the recovery of upper
extremity functions. The same study explained that the addition of virtual reality to
traditional exercise treatments can be more beneficial, because exercise intervention using
virtual reality can provide appropriately modified visual feedback to further activate brain
tissues.</p><p>In the present study, the within-group comparison after the intervention revealed that both
IHREG and VERG showed significant decreases in dynamic balance indexes of OSI, APSI, and
MLSI. We speculate that the subjects in IHREG improved the strength of the main muscles of
the lower extremities and trunk, as well as proprioception, thereby increasing their dynamic
balance ability. Subjects in VERG changed their center of pressure using forward, backward,
right and left movements during virtual reality balance training which would have improved
the stability of their ankle joints through the frequent use of the muscles in the ankles,
thereby improving their dynamic balance ability. Despite the differing gains experienced by
the two groups, no significant difference in the dynamic balance indexes was found in the
post-intervention comparison of the groups. Both indoor horseback riding and virtual reality
exercises can be performed indoors, solving the cost and space problems associated with
traditional hippotherapy and providing patients with conditions to postural control with
additional exercises for improving their balance ability.</p><p>One limitation of this study was the small number of subjects which precludes the
generalization of the results. Furthermore, no follow-up was done to evaluate the residual
effects following completion of the experimental indoor horseback riding and virtual reality
exercise interventions. This study should be repeated with a greater number of subjects and
an increased exercise duration to determine which exercises would be most appropriate for
patients with postural control problems.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hlavacka</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Horak</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Somatosensory influence on postural response to galvanic
