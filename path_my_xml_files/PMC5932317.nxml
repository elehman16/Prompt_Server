The study was approved by the Suleyman Demirel University, Faculty of Medicine, Clinical Research Ethics committee (04.06.2014/96). The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: (1) mandibular anterior dental crowding (Little's Irregularity Index [LII] &#x0003e; 6 mm); (2) 12 to 18 years of age; (3) permanent dentition; (4) treatment requiring no extraction of premolars or any other teeth; (5) skeletal and dental Class I relationships; (6) normal overjet and overbite; and (7) systemically and periodontally healthy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unwilling to be assigned to any of the treatment options; (2) caries and impacted or missing teeth except for third molars; (3) orthodontic treatment history; (4) posterior crossbite; (5) craniofacial syndrome or skeletal asymmetry; and (6) periodic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants and their parents before the study was carried out.</p><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The patients were divided into the NiTi group and CuNiTi group. Roth prescription brackets with a 0.018-inch (in) slot (Mini Sprint-Prescription: Roth 0.018 in; Forestadent, Pforzheim, Germany) were used in both groups. The orthodontic light-cured adhesive system used for bonding all brackets was Transbond XT (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In the NiTi group, a 0.014-in round NiTi wire (natural arch form, Nickel-Titanium Archwire; Ortho Organizers, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied as the initial archwire immediately after the bonding procedure. At the next appointment, which was scheduled 6 weeks later, the patients received a 0.016-in round NiTi wire (natural arch form, Nickel-Titanium Archwire). The next appointment was scheduled 6 weeks later, at which time the study was terminated. The total study duration was 12 weeks. Both archwires were tightly and fully ligated to each wing of the brackets by using ligature wires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In the CuNiTi group, a 0.014-in round Tru-Arch CuNiTi 27&#x02103; (mandibular&#x02013;small; Ormco Corp., Glendora, CA, USA) was applied as the initial archwire immediately after the bonding procedure. The next appointment was scheduled 6 weeks later, at which time the patients received a 0.016-in round Tru-Arch CuNiTi 27&#x02103; (mandibular&#x02013;small). The next appointment was scheduled 6 weeks later, when the study terminated. The total study duration was 12 weeks. Both archwires were tightly and fully ligated to each wing of the brackets by using ligature wires.</p><p>To avoid occlusal interferences that may occur during the study, a thermoplastic retainer with an acrylic bite block (2 mm) in the premolar-molar region was applied to the upper jaw from the beginning to the end of the study in each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were asked to wear these retainers at all times except mealtimes. All clinical procedures were carried out by the same clinician (BA).</p><p>All patients underwent scanning at the beginning of the study (T0) and at the 2nd (T1), 4th (T2), 6th (T3), 8th (T4), 10th (T5), and 12th (T6) weeks of treatment by using a three-dimensional (3D) intraoral scanner (TRIOS; 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). The parameters measured in this study were evaluated using 3D digital casts obtained at 2-week intervals by using a 3D software program (OrthoAnalyzer; 3Shape).</p><p>The amount of alignment achieved during the study using each different archwire was measured according to LII. In the assessment of LII, each 3D dental cast was measured three times, and the mean value of the measurements was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The length of the arch perimeter between the mandibular canines and mandibular first molars was measured to evaluate the changes in the anterior arch perimeter and total arch perimeter resulting from the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interdental and interalveolar measurements were performed using the abovementioned 3D software program to evaluate the transversal arch width changes resulting from the treatment using different archwires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and changes after trial commencement</title><p>The main outcome measure of this study was the alignment of the mandibular anterior dentition, achieved using sequentially applied round archwires over 12 weeks. The secondary outcome measure was the change in mandibular dental arch dimensions. The first initial archwire applied was a 0.014-in round archwire; after 6 weeks, the archwire was changed to a 0.016-in round archwire in both groups. During the 12-week study period, the changes were recorded using a 3D digital intraoral scanner at 2-week intervals. Using computer software, the irregularity index and mandibular arch dimensions were measured for each of the 3D digital dental models obtained at 2-week intervals for 12 weeks. The archwires used in the NiTi and CuNiTi groups were (M<sub>stab</sub>) NiTi and (M<sub>act</sub>) CuNiTi, respectively.</p><p>All patients were clinically examined every 2 weeks, and the mandibular dental arch of each patient was scanned using an intraoral 3D scanner. Their complaints were also addressed where necessary. Patients were recalled after 1 to 3 days in case of broken brackets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). New brackets were bonded to teeth by using the same bonding materials and techniques. No changes in outcome were observed after study commencement.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In this study, a preliminary calculation was performed to calculate the sample size by using G*Power software version 3.0.10 (Franz Faul Universit&#x000e4;t, Kiel, Germany). To achieve 95% power, the study included 36 patients per group (for alveolar inter-first molar width feature; mean, 50 mm; standard deviation, 0.35; alpha level, 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>This study used the volunteer sampling method. The two study groups were designated using simple randomization (coin method), with an allocation ratio of 1:1 according to the type of NiTi archwire. The NiTi group, comprising 26 women and 10 men, was treated using NiTi archwires, while the CuNiTi group, comprising 20 women and 10 men, was treated using CuNiTi (27&#x02103;) archwires.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>During the single-blind study, the allocation of wires was concealed from the participants, but the clinician had this information. No other wire was used, and no other treatment was performed on the maxilla or mandible throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The normal distribution of data was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z-test, and a normal distribution was found for all features. A Levene test of homogeneity was used to determine whether the distribution was similar in the groups. The data were analyzed using repeated measures of a variance analysis technique by using a factorial system (rANOVA). Repeated measures were performed in levels of wire diameter and week. In this study, the application factor had two levels (NiTi and CuNiTi); the archwire diameter factor had two levels (0.014 in and 0.016 in); and the week factor had three levels (2, 4, and 6). In order to determine the exact differences between the NiTi and CuNiTi groups in these time intervals, the covariant adjustment was calculated for the initial value of each measurement. The starting points of the means for each group were also equalized. Turkey's method was used for post hoc comparisons, and values of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered significant. After a 2-week interval, 20 study models were randomly selected and re-measured for reproducibility of the measurements (r: Cronbach's alpha, 0.871&#x02013;0.963).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Volunteer inclusion began in October 2014 and ended in August 2015. When the volunteer groups were composed, 80 patients fulfilling the criteria were assessed for eligibility. After the randomization of 76 subjects to the NiTi and CuNiTi groups for the study with a 1:1 allocation ratio, the treatment protocol was carried out. However, at the end of the study, the data of only 66 subjects (46 females and 20 males) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Since differences were found between the groups according to baseline irregularity index values, a covariant adjustment was calculated for the initial value of each measurement.

The total amount of alleviation of crowding with the sequential (6 weeks for each archwire) application of 0.014-in and 0.016-in archwires was 4.07 mm in the NiTi group and 3.58 mm in the CuNiTi group. In this study, the NiTi and CuNiTi archwires showed statistically non-significant results in terms of the alleviation of crowding. These results are compatible with those of other studies.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our study groups included patients with severe crowding. However, our result is similar to that of studies on groups with severe and/or moderate crowding.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Previous studies have demonstrated that during the alleviation of crowding under both moderate and severe crowding conditions, NiTi wires provide successful treatment results with preadjusted edgewise appliances.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The arch perimeter, measured parallel to the occlusal plane, was affected by the protrusion of the incisors. The ligation of malposed teeth to the archwire without space-gaining methods could cause forced (obligatory) labial/buccal tipping, which could result in protrusion or dental expansion. This protrusion may be more evident in the anterior region, since crowding often occurs in this region. Moreover, the weaker roots of the anterior teeth predispose them to dental tipping. Insufficient occlusal contacts, which can limit dental tipping unlike in the posterior teeth, could be the reason for the shift of this protrusion through the anterior region.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In our study, the mean values for the intercanine arch perimeter were higher in the CuNiTi group than in the NiTi group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) from the second week. The covariates were adjusted for initial values of all examined parameters. This difference in intercanine arch perimeter appeared at the end of the second week and remained until the end of the study. The application of CuNiTi archwires involves stronger forces than does the application of NiTi wires, and they exhibit rapid hardening in the oral environment because of their alloy structure.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This difference in intercanine arch perimeter may be attributed to the anterior teeth in the CuNiTi group protruding faster as a result of the archwire alloy structure. Hence, both NiTi and CuNiTi archwires have similar effects on the alleviation of crowding and expansion of the intercanine arch width. The significantly increased changes in the CuNiTi group than in the NiTi group in terms of the length of the intercanine arch perimeter show that this group may have a greater tendency towards protrusion, which is a risk factor for stability.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Some studies have suggested an increase in arch perimeter after nonextraction orthodontic treatment in patients with Class I malocclusion.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>For the intermolar arch perimeter, the mean values obtained using CuNiTi archwires were significantly higher than those obtained using NiTi archwires (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Moreover, this measurement showed higher values in the CuNiTi group throughout the treatment protocol. This result was also compatible with the increase in intercanine arch perimeter.</p><p>The shape of the mandibular arch is in structural and functional harmony.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> During orthodontic treatment, the prevention of intercanine arch width changes could increase the long-term success in terms of retention.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In this study, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in intercanine arch width (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The increases in intercanine width were 1.44 mm in the NiTi group and 1.63 mm in the CuNiTi group.

For the 0.016-in CuNiTi archwire, the increase obtained at the end of the second, fourth, and sixth weeks was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) (capitals, right-hand side; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). As the study progressed, an increase in arch width was obtained for both types of archwires. Studies evaluating the changes in intercanine, interpremolar, and intermolar widths after fixed orthodontic treatment have reported that the most notable difference was observed in the premolar region.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The first reason for this could lie in the arch form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) of the archwires used in the study. It has been revealed that during the leveling and aligning phases of treatment, the Tru-Arch archwires, which were used in this study, could produce statistically significant increases in the transverse dentoalveolar width and the perimeter of the maxillary arch.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> As the forms of arches used in this study were similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), the obtained changes in arch widths were an expected conclusion. The second reason could be the eruption path of the first premolar teeth in the lingual direction.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The application of orthodontic forces to the lingually erupted premolars from the buccal side may have caused more dramatic changes in this region.</p><p>In this study, the inter-first premolar width measurements were statistically higher in the NiTi group than in the CuNiTi group at the end of the second week; these were reversed in the next period, and this pattern repeated until the end of the study. This could be explained by the increase in the length of the intercanine arch perimeter in the lower anterior region at the end of the second week in the CuNiTi group. In the first week of application of the CuNiTi archwires, the rapid hardening of the wire in conjunction with the influence of its mechanical properties may have caused protrusions in the anterior region, where the roots were weaker than in the posterior teeth, rather than contributing to the increase in transversal arch width. The reversal of this pattern in the fourth week, where the CuNiTi archwire caused transversally greater expansion in the premolar region, suggests that CuNiTi had started expanding the arch after a sudden protrusion in the first week. In the sixth week, the pattern again favored the NiTi group, and this was maintained in the following weeks.</p><p>Studies evaluating the changes in inter-first premolar width in fixed orthodontic treatment have shown that the results obtained vary between 1.46 and 3.22 mm because of the differences in materials and methodology.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In contrast to the results of our study, Fleming et al.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> found no statistically significant increase in inter-first and inter-second premolar width changes before and after fixed orthodontic treatment at the leveling stage. The reason for this difference could be the difference in the design materials and methods.</p><p>The changes in interalveolar widths evaluated in this study were statistically non-significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Lundstr&#x000e4;m<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> has shown that the apical base is not affected by orthodontic tooth movement and mastication. Additionally, alveolar buccal changes do not follow dental expansion.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since neither group showed changes in alveolar widths, this is considered a favorable factor for retention.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>In this single-center study, the treatments were performed by a single clinician. Thus, the generalizability of the results of this study may be limited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
