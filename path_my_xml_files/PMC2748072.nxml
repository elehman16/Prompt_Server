Since the mid 1970's surgeons began shortening their incisions because of a presumed quicker convalescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Soon thereafter, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was introduced, and rapidly expanded around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The popularity of this procedure was partly based on an appealing technological innovation as well as industry driven motives and not primarily a result of an evidence-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of evidence in Cochrane reviews shows no difference regarding primary outcome measures (mortality and complications) between the three operative techniques of cholecystectomy (open, small-incision and laparoscopic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In absence of clear clinical benefit based on these meta-analyses it may be interesting to focus on the resource use associated with the available techniques. We performed a single blind randomized clinical trial focusing on a secondary outcome: costs. In a previous paper we emphasized intrinsic validity of this trial, proved reproducibility of results from other trials and showed generalisability in a general teaching hospital.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]</p><p>The costs of LC and small-incision cholecystectomy (SIC) have been compared in six randomized trials. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] These available studies are inconsistent in outcome and conclusions, use different perspectives and most of the trials suffer methodological shortcomings.</p><p>The research question is whether there is a difference in costs from a societal perspective between small-incision and laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a blind randomized approach. In a detailed cost analysis attention has to be paid to both direct and indirect costs as well as the perspective of the analysis. Furthermore, cost prices, budget prices and tariffs have to be distinguished.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In meta-analyses we found no major differences in clinical outcome measures (mortality, complications, conversions, hospital stay, and convalescence) between LC and SIC for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] We also found no differences considering pulmonary function, health status, and cosmesis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] Costs are a secondary outcome measure and ultimately may be a decisional factor. This paper focuses on cost-minimization analysis.</p><p>Medical Ethics Committee approval for this single-centre trial was obtained in September 2000. Between January 2001 and January 2004, all patients referred to our surgical outpatient's clinic with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (confirmed by ultrasonography) were considered for inclusion in this study.</p><sec><title>Inclusion- and exclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria were male or female patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, aged 18 years or older at recruitment, reasonable to good health (ASA I or II), no known relevant allergies, and a signed informed consent letter.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, choledocholithiasis (icterus, acholic faeces and/or bilirubine of twice normal range), cholangitis, known pregnancy, moderate to severe systemic disease (ASA III and higher), known cirrhosis of the liver, history of abdominal malignancy, previous upper abdominal surgery (precluding a laparoscopic approach), psychiatric disease, or a reasons (e.g. lack of knowledge of the Dutch language) that might make follow-up or completion of questionnaires unreliable.</p><p>Obesity was not an exclusion criterion. Recovery after successful endoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis was not a contra-indication. Acute cholecystitis was excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>A random number table was used for generation of the allocation sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the allocation concealment was guaranteed by using sealed envelopes. Patients were randomized after induction of anesthesia. An employee of the secretary office opened an envelope. Details were recorded in a case record form. Otherwise the procedure was recorded as 'trial cholecystectomy'.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>All patients had a standard anesthesia regime. Premedication, medications for induction and continuation of anesthesia, as well as respiration during surgery were standardized. Residents (from 2<sup>nd </sup>year on) performed most of the operations. In case of technical difficulties either trial technique could be converted to open cholecystectomy (OC). Wounds were covered with standard wound dressings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] In this way blinding of patients, nurses, and ward physicians was achieved. Postoperative analgesics and medication for nausea were standardized.</p><p>Open introduction was performed in all laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Pneumoperitoneum was created with an intra-abdominal pressure up to 12 mmHg. Three trocars for instruments were inserted. The dissection of the cystic artery and cystic duct, identifying Calot's triangle, was performed using a three points 'flag' technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] The cystic duct and artery were clipped and transected. All instruments were reusable.</p><p>In concordance with literature a cut-off point of 8 cm was used to differentiate between SIC and OC.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] The incision was placed over the musculus rectus abdominis. No special equipment was used. Access to the peritoneum was obtained by a 'muscle splitting' technique. The gallbladder was dissected by a 'fundus-first' technique. The cystic duct and artery were ligated and the gallbladder was removed. Posterior and anterior fascias were closed separately. If the length of the incision exceeded 8 cm, the operation was considered to be a conversion to OC.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative protocol</title><p>Early oral intake and mobilization were encouraged. Patients left the hospital as soon as they were able to do so. Incidental 'social' reasons for lengthening of hospital stay (by a few days) were accepted. Hospital stay was defined as the number of postoperative nights in hospital. For logistic reasons, we were not able to blind the surgeon during follow-up. Follow-up was standardized after 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months. Patients were encouraged to resume work as soon as possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis and sample size</title><p>In meta-analyses no differences in patient-relevant outcomes appear to be present between these two techniques. Assuming no differences in primary outcome measures, sample size calculation was based on anticipated differences of costs. The direct costs of the first 50 patients in the trial were calculated so as to estimate the likely range of differences in costs and their standard deviations. On this basis, we estimated that 120 patients per group would be needed to detect a difference of 10% in direct costs using an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a &#x003b2; of 0.9.</p><p>Analyzing differences in costs due to complications between both techniques would require another sample size including thousands of patients in order to possibly find significant results. Consequently, differences in complication costs were therefore not statistically tested in our study. However, these costs were reported to illustrate their impact on total costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All data were stored in a case record form (Access<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) based on a patient-linked trial registration number. A double data entry was performed. Comparisons were made on an intention to treat basis. Calculations were made using SPSS 11.0<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>The chi-square test was used for dichotomous outcome. Normality of data was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] Levene's test was used for checking equality of variances. When the condition of normality and equal variances was met, the t-test for independent data was used; otherwise the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for independent data was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods of cost analysis</title><p>As cost items that are equally present in both groups do not contribute to differences, it can be argued that these can be left out of consideration. On the other hand all costs contribute to the total amount and the incremental value. Therefore, we strived for reporting costs in detail.

Tariffs are costs that are calculated for insurance companies. Tariffs are nearly always different from real costs. Budget prices on the other hand are figures used for internal (hospital) calculations, and do not reflect real costs either. Cost prices are real costs for procedures and are usually not used in hospital administrations. These cost prices can be calculated but are sometimes difficult to retrieve.</p><p>Apart from these differences there are costs for depreciation and interest. Different methods are used and no uniform guidelines exist how to estimate these overhead costs, neither do arguments exist that one method is superior over the other. In our hospital a percentage incremental value is added to every cost price. We applied this method in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of procedures and measurement of resources</title><p>In this cost-minimization analysis, all resources were prospectively recorded. A visit to the general practitioner, diagnostic examinations, and costs due to preoperative outpatient clinic visits were counted. Hospital stay was counted as the number of overnights stay. Medication use is included in admittance cost prices. Operative costs and the costs of anesthesiologists were calculated according to operating room occupancy. Standard materials and equipment used in the operating room including costs associated with cleaning and sterilisation are included in hospital costs for surgery. The costs of the surgeon and resident were calculated from the time of incision to last suture. In laparoscopic instruments extra laparoscopy-specific materials like clips and endobags were calculated, but monitor, gass-insufflator, and camera were not calculated as these were considered present. In the small-incision procedure no extra equipment other than standard instruments is needed. In follow-up the time of the surgeon was calculated. Finally, if complications occurred, all extra costs were included. Costs of consultants were calculated using the national agreed honorarium (140 euro per hour) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>Several sensitivity analyses were performed to yield an impression of the effect of changes on total costs. Variables were considered if the costs were appreciable and a change in the costs of the variable could be possible and clinically relevant:</p><p>1. The influence of the use of disposable instead of reusable laparoscopic instruments on total costs.</p><p>2. Influence of reduction of time back-to-work by one week on total costs.</p><p>3. Influence of the reduction of hospital stay by one night on total costs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All trial patients were included and operated between January 2001 and March 2004. Leaving unwilling and excluded patients out of consideration, 366 patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the hospital for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were initially included in the trial. A total of 102 patients were not randomized for a variety of reasons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Most of these secondary outcome measures are incorporated in a total cost assessment. Our cost analyses show that SIC is more expensive compared to LC when all patients are included (intention to treat, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Excluding one outlier from analyses in each group, total costs per patient are higher in the LC group (p = 0.034). This difference is caused by a difference in operative costs (difference 203 euro; 95% CI 147 to 259 euro; p &#x0003c; 0.001) and a difference in indirect costs (p = 0.315). When all complicated cases are excluded, direct costs (p = 0.006) and operative costs (199 euro, p &#x0003c; 0.001) per patient remain higher in the LC group (using reusable laparoscopic instruments).</p><p>The problem in reporting costs are non-Gaussian distributions. Following intention-to-treat principles, complicated cases should be included to obtain an objective impression of absolute costs. Using means results in a biased impression of falsely increased measures as a consequence of skewed data, while using medians would ignore complicated cases since in cholecystectomy about 80% of operations are uneventful procedures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In our trial one extreme outlier occurred. Differences in techniques have to be distinguished from random variations. Meta-analyses demonstrate no differences in complications between laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy. We therefore believe that differences in complication costs should be considered random variations. Moreover, our trial was not powered to detect differences in complication costs and these results should be considered a spurious finding and should therefore not be statistically tested at all. Reporting costs excluding one outlier in each group might therefore be more correct as it incorporates complication costs but prohibits distortion of total costs by random extreme outliers.</p><p>There are several problems in analyzing and pooling cost results from different studies. First of all, costs are reported in different ways including different cost items. A second problem is that different points of views are taken. These different perspectives make comparison of studies difficult. A third problem is the difference in validity of the cost assessments, defined by the details in which costs are calculated. More detailed analyses are known for more reliable estimates, while less detailed studies cause severe bias.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] A fourth problem in comparing studies is that there may be considerable differences in local costs. Specific items in cost analyses differ from one country or even setting to another. A fifth and probably most important problem are cultural differences. There are wide variations in convalescence (and return to work) between different cultures depending on a multitude of causes, like social security and cultural habits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] As multiple factors cause heterogeneity, pooling results seems inappropriate and one may only draw general conclusions from individual studies.</p><p>In literature six trials report costs and lack of methodological quality was present in several trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] In some trials methodology of cost assessment was very limited described.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] Outpatients' costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and indirect costs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] are excluded in several studies making overall (societal) comparison of techniques incomplete.

They concluded that hospital costs using the laparoscopic technique were 29% higher.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] The trial by Nilsson is a high quality multi-centre trial. However, standardization of procedures is less biased and more uniform in a single-centre trial compared to a multi-centre trial. Costs are reported in medians (ignoring outliers and complications). This study found lower direct costs and higher indirect costs for the SIC group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]</p><p>Some conclusions of differences in costs were based on differences in hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or convalescence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] However, in meta-analysis no differences were found in hospital stay and convalescence between both techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] The differences in indirect costs in our trial should be considered as random variations caused by random differences in age and sex between both groups in the employed patients: calculated friction costs per hour per employee are higher for male and for higher aged employees.</p><p>Remarkably, the trials with lack in methodological or cost assessment quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] favor the laparoscopic technique, while the trials with high methodological quality or more detailed cost assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] favor the small-incision technique.

Though, all perspectives belong to our society. Advantages of a certain therapy in a societal perspective should be given more importance compared to other perspectives not including all cost categories. It provides the most comprehensive assessment and is most relevant for national policy decisions. Implementation at a local level, however, may require to also taking into account a hospital perspective as financial consequences will become visible.</p><p>Feasibility of ambulatory cholecystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and the wide range in return to work from a few days to 12 weeks raises questions on potential savings. Possibilities for future savings by reduction of hospital stay (direct costs), irrespective of the operating technique for cholecystectomy, were compared to savings by reduction of sick leave (indirect costs). Assuming 21000 cholecystectomies in the Netherlands, reducing hospital stay by one night (50%) in every patient would result in potential savings of 4.8 million euro in the Netherlands annually. Assuming that 50% of the cholecystectomy patients are employed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>), reducing sick leave by one week (25%) in every employed patient would lead to savings of 8.6 million euro on a national basis annually. Based on these hypothetical figures it seems easier to achieve savings by earlier return to work instead of reducing hospital stay. Moreover, as more than 60% of costs of employed patients are caused by sick leave it is more logical to focus on this cost category.</p><p>Assuming 21000 cholecystectomies in the Netherlands and an employment ratio of 50%, calculations of sensitivity analyses on hypothetical savings were performed considering change in policy from disposable to reusable laparoscopic instruments, change from LC to SIC, or reducing sick leave by one week. As a result savings of approximately 16 million, 4.2 million and 8.6 million euro respectively are possible on a national basis annually. However, conclusions have to be careful since calculations are hypothetical.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this single-centre trial with representative results and emphasis on methodological quality LC appears more costly: the procedural costs surpass those of SIC (and use of disposable instruments would only further increase this difference). Thus SIC is the preferred operative technique over LC both from a hospital and societal cost perspective.</p><p>Sick leave associated with convalescence after surgery results in considerable costs to society especially in the employed patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FK and CJHML had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
