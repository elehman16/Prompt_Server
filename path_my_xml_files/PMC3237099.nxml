After screening and a 1- to 2-week washout, eligible patients were randomized and initiated treatment with valsartan/ amlodipine 160/5 mg or losartan 100 mg. At week 3, HCTZ 25 mg was added in both treatment groups. ABPM was performed for 24 hours before study visits at baseline and at week 6.</p><p>Patients were discontinued from the study if they had MSSBP &#x02265;200 mmHg or MSDBP &#x02265;110 mmHg, or if they could not be force titrated to the next dose due to adverse events or hypotension (MSSBP &#x0003c;100 mmHg or MSDBP &#x0003c;60 mmHg). Patients took double-blinded study medication once daily, in the morning. On study visit days, clinic BP measures were obtained before the daily dose of study medication.

Readings were correlated with clinic BP measurements at the time of device placement. Following the correlation procedure, BP and heart rate were recorded every 20 minutes during the 24-hour monitoring period. Qualitycontrol criteria for ABPM were defined as starting between 7 and 10 am, with at least 24 hours of ABP data after the beginning of the test time, at least 80% of expected readings captured during the 24-hour period, and no more than two nonconsecutive hours with no valid BP reading. If baseline ABPM was successful, the patient was randomized into the ABPM substudy. If baseline ABPM was unsuccessful, their randomization was postponed and the ABP device was reapplied within 48 hours. If the second ABP measurement was successful, the patient was randomized into the study, and ABP was measured again at the week-6 study visit. Patients who had two unsuccessful attempts to measure mean 24-hour ABP at baseline were discontinued from the ABPM substudy but were allowed to continue in the main study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary study efficacy variable was the change from baseline in MSSBP at week 6 in the overall population, as has been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-7-701">15</xref> The following efficacy endpoints were evaluated for both systolic and diastolic ABP in this ABPM substudy: 24-hour ABP, nighttime ABP (10 pm to 6 am), daytime ABP (6 am to 10 pm), ABP in the last 4 hours of the dosing period, and hourly ABP values.

Patients were analyzed for efficacy endpoints according to the treatment they were assigned at randomization. The least-squares mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) for changes in systolic and diastolic ABP from baseline to week 6 were analyzed for 24-hour mean ABP, nighttime ABP, daytime ABP, and ABP in the last 4 hours of the dosing period. Least-squares mean and SEM for changes in clinic BP measures (MSSBP and MSDBP) from baseline to week 6 were also analyzed for patients participating in the ABPM substudy. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline MSSBP and treatment regimen as explanatory variables was used to test each efficacy endpoint for superiority of the valsartan/ amlodipine group over the losartan group. For ABP load, both ANCOVA and a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to determine between-treatment differences.

These results were consistent with the clinic BP findings of the main study, which was designed to investigate whether triple-combination therapy with moderate doses of an ARB and a CCB with a diuretic was comparable or superior to dual-combination therapy with the maximal available fixed combination dose of an ARB with a diuretic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-7-701">15</xref> Thus, the observed differences in ABPM lowering were attributable to the combination of moderate doses of a CCB with an ARB + diuretic versus the maximal dose of an ARB + diuretic.</p><p>In contrast to the clinic BP findings of the main study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-7-701">15</xref> among the patients in the ABPM substudy, there was no significant difference in clinic BP results between the two treatment groups. This observation could have been due to the small number of patients in the substudy. For the main study, a sample size of at least 460 patients was projected to provide adequate power to detect a 5 mmHg difference in clinic BP between treatment groups. Only 84 patients were evaluable in the ABPM substudy; thus, treatment differences using clinic BP measures were not observed. These findings provide additional support for previous evidence that ABPM is a more sensitive measure than clinic BP to evaluate the BP-lowering efficacy of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-vhrm-7-701">3</xref></p><p>In addition to its increased sensitivity for changes in BP control, ABPM can be used to assess the BP-lowering efficacy of a treatment over the entire dosing interval and circadian patterns of BP control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-7-701">17</xref> In this analysis, significant treatment differences were seen not only for 24-hour mean ABP, but also for nighttime ABP (10 pm to 6 am), and ABP load (percentage of readings &#x0003e;140 mmHg [systolic] or &#x0003e;90 mmHg [diastolic]). The differences between treatment groups in nighttime ABP were more pronounced than the differences in daytime ABP, which shows that triple-therapy combination provides even greater control at nighttime. Diminished nighttime decline in ABP has been shown to predict cardiovascular events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-7-701">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-7-701">20</xref> and cardiovascular mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-7-701">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-vhrm-7-701">21</xref> Similarly, ABP load has been reported to predict end-organ damage in patients with systolic hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-vhrm-7-701">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-vhrm-7-701">6</xref></p><p>Two other recent reports described the effects of triple-therapy or dual-therapy combinations of an ARB, CCB, and diuretic on ABP endpoints in 283 patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-7-701">22</xref> and 380 patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-7-701">23</xref> respectively. In those studies, the fulldose triple-therapy combinations (valsartan/amlodipine/ HCTZ 320/10/25 mg or olmesartan/amlodipine/HCTZ 40/10/25 mg) lowered 24-hour, nighttime, and daytime ABP significantly more effectively than any dual-therapy combination at the same doses. The authors of the present paper compared lower doses of the ARB and CCB in the triple-therapy combination (valsartan/amlodipine/HCTZ 160/5/25 mg) to dual therapy with full-dose losartan with HCTZ (100/25 mg). Although comparing the findings of the present study to the other studies is limited by differences in study populations and study designs, the treatment difference of 5.4 mmHg in favor of the triple-therapy combination for the reduction of 24-hour mean systolic ABP in this study was similar to the 6.4 mmHg difference between the full-dose triple-therapy combinations and the ARB/HCTZ dual-therapy combinations in each of the previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-7-701">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-7-701">23</xref></p><p>The main limitation of this analysis is the small number of patients in the ABPM substudy. Because of the small sample size, it was not possible to perform subgroup analyses of triple versus dual therapy within different subgroups (eg, gender, age, race, hypertension severity): future studies in these subgroups would be helpful. Another potential limitation is that postbaseline ABP evaluation was done only at week 6, which provided a single point estimate of the effects of study treatment on ABP.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the findings show that using ABPM, initiating treatment with a combination of moderate doses of an ARB, and a CCB with HCTZ lowers BP more effectively than a maximal dose of an ARB with HCTZ. These results support both the efficacy of combining lower doses of multiple antihypertensive agents and the use of ABP instead of clinic BP as a better measure of treatment efficacy in hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
