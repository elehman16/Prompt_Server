Nowadays most psychologists try to find ways to deal with the problems of different people with different social standings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Due to a small number of experienced practitioners and consulting services and the high cost of these services, it is important to create new, simple and inexpensive ways for providing consulting services in a national scale.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It is believed that the promotion of bibliotherapy can provide the patients with a simple and effective method of treatment. Despite the long and effective background of bibliotherapy, it has gained the special attention only in the last two decades. In 1815, Benjamin Rash was the first person to use bibliotherapy in order to treat the patients and later in 1853 John Mill Sangelt used bibliotherapy to treat the psychological patients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Bibliotherapy is a process or activity that uses dynamic interaction along with reading a book in order to help the people to solve problems or increase their cognitive understanding. There is no previous study for investigating the direct effect of bibliotherapy on psychological capital, but some studies investigated the effect of bibliotherapy on different parts of the psychological capital such as optimism, confidence, and hopefulness. Some of these studies are mentioned below.</p><p>GholiZadeh <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study called &#x0201c;The Effect of Bibliotherapy on the self-management skills of Elderly.&#x0201d; Their findings showed that bibliotherapy can greatly improve the self-management skills of the elderly, thus improving their life quality.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Nokarizi and Alemzadeh in a study titled &#x0201c;The effect of Bibliotherapy on Symptoms Internalization and externalization of deaf elementary school students of Vesal especial care school of Birjand&#x0201d; showed that bibliotherapy can help to reduce the internalization symptoms such as stress, depression, withdrawal and physical complaints and externalization symptoms such as lawless and aggressive behavior and can also help to reduce the social problems of the students.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Ebadi <italic>et al</italic>.

Due to the advantages of bibliotherapy, this method can be easily used in organizations in the form of group workshops or individual sessions. The goal of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of bibliotherapy on the psychological capital of the nonfaculty employees of the Department of Management and Medical Informatics at the Isfahan University of Medical Science. This method can be used to improve the psychological capital of the employees and improving their life quality. By using bibliotherapy workshops held by relevant authorities, librarians and university's consultants in order to increase the psychological capital of the employees and increasing the factors affecting their resiliency, optimism, hopefulness, and self-efficiency, it is possible to increase the social welfare of the employees, leading to a improvement of the society as a whole. This study investigates the effect of bibliotherapy on the psychological capital and each of the factors effecting the psychological capital including self-efficiency, hopefulness, resilience, and optimism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is an applied study using semi-empirical method (two group design with pretest and posttest).

The sampling was done using the census method which selected 30 employees who, when, then randomly placed in experiment and control groups (15 employees each), however, two of the selected employees withdrew from the program. The data gathering tool is the psychological capital questionnaire of Lathan's.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This questionnaire has 24 questions and four dimensions. The dimensions of this questionnaire are self-efficiency (question 1&#x02013;6), hopefulness (questions 7&#x02013;12), resilience (questions 13&#x02013;18) and optimism (questions 19&#x02013;24) and each dimension has 6 items. The participant answers each item using a 6&#x000b0; scale (Fully agree, Agree, Somewhat agree, Somewhat disagree, Disagree, and Fully disagree). For calculating the psychological capital score, first the score of each dimension was separately calculated and then the sum of all 4 scores was reported as the psychological capital score. The first dimension had a total score of 36, the second dimension a total of 36, the third dimension a total of 31, and the fourth dimension had the total score of 26 leading to a maximum psychological capital score or 129.

Experts of management agree that the effectiveness of any organization is dependent on a suitable structure, competent and efficient employees and proper usage of available resources, especially human resources. In educational organizations such as a university, human recourses gain special importance because human resources affect every level of system from input to process and output of the system and directly affect the students, education and research in these organizations. Due to the teachable nature of psychological capital and its financial and spiritual uses in an organization, one can use different educational workshops to improve the psychological capital of the employees of any organization, thus improving the organization as a whole. Bibliotherapy with the help of psychologists and librarianship experts is among the easy and inexpensive methods of improving psychological capital or an organization. With the improvement of literacy and reading culture and novel technologies in the current era of information technology, bibliotherapy can be used as a perfect treatment or at least an adjunct therapy method inorder to battle the anxieties and stresses caused by today's busy lifestyle.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Norouzi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Professionalism of the staff of Islamic Azad university of Tehran-north and Shahid Beheshti university and the factors affecting it</article-title><source>Sociol Youth Stud (</source><year>2010</year><volume>;1</volume><fpage>143</fpage><lpage>67</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hassanzadeh</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Positivism in the organization</article-title><source>Tadbir</source><year>2010</year><volume>216</volume><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Syfizadh</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><source>Organizational culture and employees&#x02019; psychological capital of Mashhad.
