National guidelines recommend that the physical care of people with severe mental illnesses should be the responsibility of primary care; however, little is known about effective interventions to lower cardiovascular disease risk in this population and setting. Following extensive peer review, funding was secured from the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to deliver the proposed study. The aim of the trial is to test the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention to lower cardiovascular disease risk in people with severe mental illnesses in United Kingdom General Practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial in 70 GP practices for people with severe mental illnesses, aged 30 to 75&#x000a0;years old, with elevated cardiovascular disease risk factors. The trial will compare the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention designed to lower cardiovascular disease risk and delivered by a practice nurse or healthcare assistant, with standard care offered in General Practice. A total of 350 people will be recruited and followed up at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome is total cholesterol level at the 12-month follow-up and secondary outcomes include blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking status, quality of life, adherence to treatments and services and behavioural measures for diet, physical activity and alcohol use. An economic evaluation will be carried out to determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention compared with standard care.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this pragmatic trial will provide evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the intervention on lowering total cholesterol and addressing multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors in people with severe mental illnesses in GP Practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN13762819">ISRCTN13762819</ext-link>.

The National Health Service (NHS) expenditure on mental health in 2012 to 2013 was &#x000a3;11.5 billion, higher than any other health category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The predicted cost to the public health sector of schizophrenia is &#x000a3;7.6 billion, with the cost to society at &#x000a3;11.8 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These disorders frequently present in the early to mid-twenties and have a major impact on health and social functioning. Whilst the employment rate for all adults aged 16 to 64&#x000a0;years in England is currently 71&#x000a0;%, recent estimates place the employment rate for people with schizophrenia between 5 and 15&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>People with SMI are more likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CVD rates are falling in the general population but not for people with SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This widening health inequality is an NHS priority, emphasised in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) schizophrenia and bipolar guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CVD is one of the most important physical health problems experienced by people with SMI. Those aged under 50&#x000a0;years are three times more likely to die from CVD, whereas those aged 50 to 75&#x000a0;years have a twofold increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These risks remain high after the effects of smoking and social deprivation are controlled for in the analysis.</p><p>There are likely to be multiple reasons for increased CVD in people with SMI. Research in general practice has demonstrated increased levels of cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidaemia in people with SMI compared to general practice controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This included raised total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Research has also found a higher proportion of people with SMI eat a diet higher in fat, lower in fibre and may be less likely to take even mild to moderate exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A higher prevalence of increased CVD risk factors has been demonstrated at illness onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and later in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The adverse effects of antipsychotic medication are a concern for both people with SMI and practitioners. The most effective and most commonly prescribed treatments are associated with weight gain and abnormalities of both lipid and glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The antipsychotics most strongly implicated are olanzapine and clozapine, but nearly all antipsychotics can have effects on appetite, weight gain and metabolism.</p><p>Most people with SMI are in contact with primary care and consult with General Practitioners (GPs) more frequently than people without SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], yet they are less likely to see a practice nurse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. NICE recommends routine annual screening for CVD risk factors for people with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and individuals prescribed antipsychotics should receive more frequent monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Clinics for CVD screening in other long-term conditions are routinely carried out by nurses in primary care. Training practice nurses to carry out physical health screening in people with SMI in England has the potential to increase the level of screening and lifestyle advice received by people with SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The UK primary care quality outcomes framework (QoF) remunerates GPs for providing an annual review to people with SMI. The required content of such reviews has varied over the last few years with glucose and lipid measurements being retired in 2014/15. Research has shown that if people with SMI are offered CVD screening, they are as likely to take up the offer as people without SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Although there is strong evidence for relatively high rates of CVD deaths and CVD risk factors in people with SMI, high quality evidence on CVD risk-reduction strategies is lacking. Strategies might include intervening earlier and more assertively than is currently recommended for the general population. Statins have been found to reduce CVD risk by up to 33&#x000a0;% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; however, we have limited evidence on the clinical effectiveness of existing treatments such as statins for people with SMI and whether they adhere to them. Statins have shown some promise in the short-term reduction of severe dyslipidaemia in people with SMI. An open, non-randomised study of statin therapy for 52 people with severe dyslipidaemia showed significant improvement in lipid levels at 12&#x000a0;weeks compared with 48 people not receiving statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, a pilot randomised controlled trial of Pravastatin identified a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in people with SMI; however, the effects were much smaller than in the non-randomised study described above, and this effect did not remain significant at 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials of smoking cessation in people with SMI show small effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review of reducing weight gain in people with SMI revealed little high quality evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with a handful of small studies showing modest effectiveness for pharmacological and behavioural interventions. A systematic review found that non-pharmacological interventions produced a 3.12&#x000a0;kg reduction in body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Most studies, however, are short, lack statistical power, and many are not randomised. A longer, randomised effectiveness study is required to determine whether the impact of CVD risk reducing strategies can be maintained.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of the study is to test the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a behavioural intervention to lower CVD risk in primary care delivered to people with SMI.</p><p>The primary objective is to establish the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing total cholesterol over a 12-month period compared with treatment as usual (TAU).</p><p>The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention accomplishes the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>reduces glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol;</p></list-item><list-item><p>lowers cardiovascular risk scores;</p></list-item><list-item><p>increases physical activity, improves diet, reduces the number of cigarettes smoked and reduces alcohol intake;</p></list-item><list-item><p>increases the uptake of statin medications and adherence to statin regimens; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>increases satisfaction with services, wellbeing and quality of life.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We also aim to establish the cost-effectiveness of the intervention while considering both the costs of the intervention itself and other direct health care costs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a two arm cluster-randomised controlled trial in United Kingdom primary care services with people who have a diagnosis of SMI, are aged 30 to 75&#x000a0;years old and who have elevated CVD risk factors. GP practices will be randomised to provide either a 6-month CVD risk reduction intervention or usual care. The cluster design will decrease the likelihood of contamination by participants in the TAU arm receiving the benefits of the intervention through access to their practice nurse or healthcare assistant who has been trained in assertively reducing CVD risk for people with SMI.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment of GP practices</title><p>Recruitment of 70 GP practices across both rural and urban areas of England will be coordinated in six waves. In the first wave, we will recruit eight GP practices in North London that will act as a pilot of the research procedures. Any problems will be considered and, if necessary, the trial will be modified for the remaining recruitment waves. Ten to 15 general practices will then be recruited per wave. GP practices will first be approached by local clinical research networks (CRNs) and asked to submit an expression of interest to the study team. Any interested practices will then be asked to complete a site feasibility questionnaire to ensure that they have a practice nurse or healthcare assistant who can assess patient eligibility and deliver the intervention if randomised, and a mental health register of 40 or more patients. A site initiation visit will then be arranged by the central study team. All staff involved in the study at the practice and the research nurse from the local clinical research network, who will be taking informed consent and collecting outcome data from participants, will be invited to attend this meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>In each recruited GP practice, all people with a relevant diagnosis of SMI (see participant inclusion criteria) who have not had a CVD health check in the last 12&#x000a0;months will be invited to a screening appointment over an 8-week period with a practice nurse or healthcare assistant (HCA) who has been identified to work on the study. Individuals will be screened for CVD risk, to include current smoking status, lipid profile, blood pressure, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and BMI. At the initial appointment, people with SMI will be asked by the practice nurse or HCA if they would like to receive further information about the study should they meet inclusion criteria. When screening results are received by the practice, if they are of immediate concern, the nurse/HCA will liaise with the GP. Otherwise, if an individual is eligible for the trial, the results will be handled by the nurse/HCA in a 6 to 8-week period, after the nurse/HCA has been informed of treatment allocation. The recruitment process is summarised in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participant recruitment in the PRIMROSE trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1176_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Practices will also search their electronic medical records to identify individuals who have had a health check in the last 12&#x000a0;months and who are potentially eligible for the study. These people will be sent a study invitation letter by the practice which includes a reply slip, study leaflet and freepost practice-addressed envelope. Practices will then follow-up non-responders by telephone to check if the information has been received and to determine whether or not the person is interested in participating. An up-to-date health check will be arranged either by the practice or the research nurse for all interested individuals for whom eligibility criteria were recorded more than 3&#x000a0;months previously to ensure that they are still currently eligible for the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant inclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria are adults on each participating GP Practice mental health register with a diagnosis of SMI (schizophrenia, persistent delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, psychosis, psychotic depression or other psychotic disorder), aged 30 to 75&#x000a0;years old with a total cholesterol level above and including 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/l OR raised total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio above and including 4 AND one or more of the following risk factors:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Current smoker</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blood pressure&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;140&#x000a0;mm Hg systolic AND/OR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;mm Hg diastolic</p></list-item><list-item><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 42 to 47&#x000a0;mmol/mol (6.0 to 6.4&#x000a0;%) and/or impaired fasting glucose (5.5 to 6.9&#x000a0;mmol/L)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis of diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis of hypertension</p></list-item></list></p><p>Individuals must also be able to give written informed consent and give their initial consent to be contacted by a researcher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Exclusion criteria include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Under acute psychiatric care (for example, currently a psychiatric hospital inpatient or under the care of a crisis team)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Primary diagnosis of an organic mental health problem and/or severe cognitive impairment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Life expectancy&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months (diagnosis of metastatic cancer or on the palliative care register)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pre-existing CVD</p></list-item><list-item><p>Currently pregnant</p></list-item><list-item><p>Personality disorder or depression/anxiety without any psychotic features</p></list-item></list></p><p>We will not specifically exclude people who already receive statins if their lipids remain raised at the initial screening, since they still require monitoring and further risk reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Consent and research assessments</title><p>Initial agreement to be contacted by a researcher from the local clinical research network will be obtained from individuals either at their screening appointment with the practice nurse/HCA or through the return of a reply slip to the GP practice sent to people who are already potentially eligible.

Baseline data will be collected by the researcher from the participant&#x02019;s medical records and through interviews and participant self-complete questionnaires with all recruited participants at the start of the study. Outcome data will be collected at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months during the trial period. Participants will be allocated a unique study identification number, and data will be entered anonymously by researchers using a web-based system set up by Sealed Envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It has range checks, consistency checks and for closed questions gives a number of options plus &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; where appropriate. Researchers who will be entering the data will have no access to the group allocation through this system. With these checks in place, there should not be any issues with illegal values or inconsistent data being entered, so necessary cleaning should be minimal. Data will be checked by the trial statistician before analysis and any problems reported to the trial manager, who will liaise with the researchers to rectify them as appropriate before data analysis.</p><p>Participants will be reimbursed &#x000a3;20 at baseline, &#x000a3;10 at the 6-month follow up and &#x000a3;20 at the 12-month follow-up to thank them for their time and to cover any transportation costs. Postcards will be sent after each data collection point to thank participants for their involvement in the study and remind them that follow-up will occur later in the year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding</title><p>The trial will not be blind because masking of the participants, practice nurses/HCAs and GPs to the treatment allocation is not possible. The primary outcome - total cholesterol - is objective, and researchers collecting outcome data will be blinded to participant allocation. The randomisation variable will be held separately to the main body of data and will be given to the statisticians and health economists without labels so they remain blind to allocation when they are ready to analyse the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>GP practices will be randomised to intervention or to treatment as usual on a 1:1 basis by a statistician not otherwise involved in the programme based at the University College London PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit. The trial manager will communicate the results of randomisation to the practices.</p><p>There should be the same number of GP practices recruited to the intervention and usual care. This will be achieved using block randomisation. The size of the blocks is at the discretion of the independent statistician, who will not divulge this to the trial management group, senior statistician, trial statistician or health economists until the allocation code is broken and the information is needed to write up the trial. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> demonstrates the recruitment pathway through the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention arm</title><p>In the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded PRIMROSE programme we performed a range of work to inform the development of the PRIMROSE intervention. We consulted with experts in the fields of cardiovascular health, psychiatry and health psychology to ensure the intervention encompasses the most contemporary evidence, and that it was acceptable to people with SMI and health professionals. We have updated literature searches and run focus groups with stakeholders to ensure that the timing, content and delivery of the intervention are appropriate. We conducted focus groups with primary care nurses, people with SMI, carers, mental health experts and GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We also benefited from a Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP), which provided feedback on the intervention and associated materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Focus group interviews were underpinned by two complimentary theoretical models, the COM-B model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; both have been used to identify influences on patient and health professional behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These findings were mapped to a theoretical framework of behaviour change, the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to determine eight key behavioural strategies for practice nurses/HCAs to use when working with people with SMI to help reduce their CVD risk. These eight behavioural change strategies form the basis of the intervention manual and training programme and include goal-setting, making an action plan, recording progress, providing positive feedback, involving supportive others, reviewing progress, coping with setbacks and habit formation.</p><p>The training will take place over 2&#x000a0;days (with a 2-week gap in between each training session to enable rehearsal of skills) with opportunities for telephone supervision. Training day one includes the following sessions: i) the reasons for increased cardiovascular risk in people with severe mental illness; ii) severe mental illness symptoms, treatments and lived experience; iii) evidence on how the intervention manual and training programme were developed; iv) how to deliver the PRIMROSE intervention and use the PRIMROSE manual; and v) how to deliver the eight behavioural change strategies in consultations with recruited patients. Nurses and HCAs will then be asked to implement what they have learned with a recruited patient. Training day 2 is then an opportunity to feedback any problems, anything that went well and to practice and revisit the skills learned on training day 1.</p><p>The training will be delivered by members of the research team, a nurse with primary care and mental health expertise, and a lived experience trainer. The intervention has been documented in a written manual and will be distributed to practice nurses/HCAs. The nurse/HCA will be asked to record all of their work including appointment attendance, clinical measures and monitoring of health goals, and all consultations will be audio recorded. A sample of 20&#x000a0;% of the recordings will be transcribed and analysed to assess for fidelity to the manual using an adaptation of a reliable fidelity assessment method that has been developed for behavioural interventions including physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Participants in the GP practices allocated to the intervention will be offered weekly to fortnightly appointments with the practice nurse/HCA over a period of 6&#x000a0;months. Progress with CVD risk reduction will be reviewed at each consultation. Appointments will decrease to monthly if satisfactory progress is made with reducing CVD risk. There will be flexibility over the delivery of the intervention depending on each individual&#x02019;s preferences and needs; however, the intervention will include one or more of the following elements:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Setting and monitoring participant-led behavioural goals aimed at lowering CVD risk (for example, improving adherence to statins or other CVD risk lowering medications, improving diet, increasing physical activity, reducing smoking and/or alcohol consumption.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of a health plan to formulate a health goal and action plan and record progress with achieving the identified health goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sign-posting to services such as smoking cessation or physical activity programmes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Statin prescriptions to people whose CVD risk or lipids exceed recommended thresholds. The choice of statin will follow local and national treatment guidelines for statin prescribing. Current NICE guidance advises initial treatment with atorvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg unless there are drug interactions or contraindication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

It will have been booked in their diaries, but they will be informed of allocation to the standard care arm, cancelling the training session. They will be sent British Heart Foundation leaflets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to distribute to participants. They will not be asked to review participants, to check adherence or arrange statin prescriptions. At best, we envisage that treatment as usual, will comprise of an invitation to attend an annual health check to screen for smoking, blood pressure, alcohol use and BMI; however, the intensity of usual care will vary depending on the patient&#x02019;s health needs. Practice nurses/HCAs in the treatment as usual arm will be offered the opportunity to attend a training session once the intervention period is complete. Usual procedures of care for patients are permitted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure is total cholesterol at 12-month follow-up. A blood sample will be collected at baseline using usual GP practice equipment and procedures.

Results are then received electronically through the participant&#x02019;s medical record. The blood test will be repeated at 6 and 12-month follow up by a clinical research network nurse and processed using usual GP practice procedures described above.</p><p>The baseline data described below will be collected either directly from participant interviews/clinical measures or from the GP practice medical records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Demographics</title><p>Demographic data including age, sex, marital status, employment status, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation score calculated using each participant&#x02019;s postcode, mental healthcare worker details, whether or not the participant is on the Care Programme Approach (CPA), and whether they have a support worker or carer will be collected for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Clinical measures</title><p>Clinical measures including blood pressure, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lipids (HDL, Total/HDL ratio and LDL) will be measured using usual practice procedures.

This will be used to determine whether there is any DNA variation relevant to mental health diagnosis and physical health outcomes. Participants will be given the opportunity to opt out of providing this saliva sample if they wish.

Two community studies of UK adults with SMI reveal mean total cholesterol levels of 5.4&#x000a0;mmol/l (standard deviation (SD) 1.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 5.7&#x000a0;mmol/l (SD 1.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>We consider an effect size of 0.4 SDs difference in cholesterol, between the two trial arms, to be the minimum clinically important difference. Statins usually have far greater effect sizes, approaching two SDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], however in this effectiveness trial, we are comparing a behavioural intervention with treatment as usual, so cannot expect effects as large as this. Based on a two-sample t-test, to detect a difference of 0.4 x (1.3&#x000a0;mmol/l) requires 132 participants per arm, with 90&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% significance level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Sample size inflation for clustering and attrition</title><p>To account for the cluster effect, we have assumed that five participants on average will be recruited per practice.

Statistical analyses will be carried out using Stata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. We will produce summary statistics for all variables, both overall and by randomised group.

The analyses will be subjected to one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses to test any assumptions made in the analysis.

The intervention is underpinned by a theoretical framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which was applied to the development work findings in order to select simple behaviour change strategies that can be used by practice nurses or HCAs, with minimal training, and incorporated into time-limited primary care consultations.</p><p>Existing reviews identify a need for interventions that tackle multiple cardiovascular risk factors in people with SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

The PRIMROSE study is a pragmatic trial with the intervention being delivered by a practice nurse/HCA at each participant&#x02019;s GP practice.
