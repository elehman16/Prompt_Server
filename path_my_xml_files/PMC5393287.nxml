A recently approved new effervescent formulation of Aln (Aln-NEF) is given once weekly. As with all Aln formulations, Aln-NEF must be taken after an overnight fast at least 30&#x000a0;min before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day because food decreases the absorption. The dosing instructions for Aln-NEF must be followed in order to assure adequate drug absorption and to minimize the risk of esophageal adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>It may be challenging for a patient to take more than 1 prescribed medication in the fasted state. A search was performed to identify oral drugs taken in the fasted state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The search identified six drugs that are to be taken exclusively under overnight fasting conditions: three bisphosphonates (Aln alone and in combination with cholecalciferol, ibandronate, and risedronate), levothyroxine (LT4), and linaclotide (a guanylate cyclase-C agonist used to treat chronic constipation). Many patients treated for osteoporosis may require thyroid hormone replacement. A study conducted in older adults (57 to 85&#x000a0;years of age) to estimate potential major drug-drug interactions of medications and supplements using a household interview documented the use of these medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Aln and LT4 were the 15th and 4th most commonly used drugs, respectively. It was estimated that 4.5% of older adults in the USA take Aln and 12.4% take LT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>According to the approved product labeling, Aln has low oral bioavailability, and there is a well-documented decrease in its absorption when taken with food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical studies with Aln oral tablets (Fosamax&#x000ae;) showed the mean oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration of Aln in women was 0.64% (for doses ranging from 5 to 70&#x000a0;mg) and 0.59% (for a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg) in men when administered after an overnight fast and 2&#x000a0;h before breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Aln was effective when administered at least 30&#x000a0;min before breakfast in studies of the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Aln administration with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Aln-NEF has also demonstrated a food interaction. A study evaluating the effect of food on absorption showed Aln bioavailability to be decreased by approximately 50% when Aln-NEF was administered 15&#x000a0;min before a standardized breakfast to 119 healthy women compared to Aln-NEF administration followed by a 4-h fast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>LT4 is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one half to 1&#x000a0;h before breakfast and should be taken at least 4&#x000a0;h apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption. LT4 is administered in the fasted state because certain foods alter its bioavailability. Gastrointestinal tract absorption of LT4 ranges from 40 to 80% and is increased by fasting and decreased by certain foods. LT4 has a narrow therapeutic index. Careful dosage titration is necessary in order to avoid the consequences of over- or under-treatment. Many drugs interact with LT4 necessitating adjustments in dosing to maintain an optimal therapeutic response; however, bisphosphonates including Aln are not listed as interacting drugs in the LT4 prescribing information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evaluation of potential interaction</title><p>Potential interaction between LT4 and Aln could be due to chemical reaction, interaction of the excipients in the formulations, effects on the metabolism of the drugs, effects on protein binding, effects on renal excretion, and effects on pharmacodynamics.</p><p>Neither LT4 nor Aln possesses reactive substituents and both are negatively charged; therefore, they would not be expected to interact chemically when ingested together. Interference from excipients in the formulations is unlikely. The LT4 tablets used in this study do not contain materials known to interfere with Aln absorption in sufficient quantity to be of concern, and the Aln-NEF formulation does not contain any of the materials known to decrease LT4 absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because Aln is not metabolized, it is not expected to affect metabolizing enzymes and the metabolism of other drugs including LT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other potential clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions involving protein binding and renal excretion are also considered unlikely due to the small amounts of the two drugs dosed and/or absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Any interference between Aln-NEF and LT4 would likely be related to interference in absorption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design considerations</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction between Aln-NEF and LT4. Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of coadministration of Aln-NEF and LT4 was a secondary objective. The design of the Aln and LT4 study is complicated because Aln is poorly absorbed and circulating levels are low. Furthermore, in order to raise LT4 levels above the endogenous background in normal subjects to allow measurement, several times a normal dose of LT4 must be given, and the washout period for LT4 is long (35&#x000a0;days). The dose administered in this study is a multiple of the highest dose of LT4 marketed in keeping with FDA guidance on LT4 tablets for in vivo bioavailability studies.</p><p>The use of a large dose (600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) of Synthroid in this study is based on the Synthroid application for marketing approval to FDA (NDA 21-402). It was established that two 300-&#x003bc;g tablets were bioequivalent to a 600-&#x003bc;g oral solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Synthroid application also showed proportionality between 50-, 100-, and 300-&#x003bc;g Synthroid tablets. The approved product label for Synthroid states that the excipients are the same for each strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In order to deliver 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of LT4 while simulating the clinical administration of only one or two tablets, the use of two 300-&#x003bc;g tablets was chosen for this study to minimize the risk of any artifact that might be introduced by a large number of tablets.</p><p>The sample size was based on FDA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and not on statistical considerations. FDA&#x02019;s Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products was consulted concerning the design of the study and the advice was followed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study participants</title><p>This study was conducted in 15 men and 15 nonpregnant, nonlactating women, aged 18 to 45&#x000a0;years, who were healthy based on a complete physical examination and medical history, vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests.

Subjects had to be able to sit or stand upright for 30&#x000a0;min. A number of restrictions were imposed on the subjects, including abstinence from alcohol, caffeine-containing beverages, tobacco (or nicotine-containing products), and highly spiced foods for the duration of the study. On the day of administration, the subjects were not allowed to eat any food other than that provided.</p><p>All subjects gave written informed consent. The study was approved by Chesapeake Institutional Review Board; it was conducted in compliance with the good clinical practice and ethical standards for human experimentation and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Discharge from the study occurred 48&#x000a0;h after the third study period.</p><p>Study drugs were administered to subjects after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects received either 1 dose of Aln-NEF 70&#x000a0;mg effervescent tablet (Binosto&#x000ae;, Mission Pharmacal Company) dissolved in 4&#x000a0;oz water, 1 dose of LT4 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Synthroid&#x000ae;, AbbVie Inc.) tablets with 4&#x000a0;oz water, or concomitantly 1 dose of LT4 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) tablets with 1 dose of Aln-NEF 70&#x000a0;mg dissolved in 4&#x000a0;oz water, in a crossover design. According to the Aln-NEF label, the pharmacy waited at least 5&#x000a0;min after the effervescence stopped and stirred the solution for approximately 10&#x000a0;s prior to providing Aln-NEF to the subjects.

The sample collection times for Aln analysis were based on a study by Yun, et al., who measured alendronate in plasma following administration of alendronate sodium tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For determination of LT4 serum concentrations, venous blood samples were collected at baseline (0.5, 0.25, and 0&#x000a0;h prior to dose) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, and 48&#x000a0;h post-dose.

Most patients administered alendronate are postmenopausal women who are older than the subjects in this study. Alendronate is also approved in the USA for treatment to increase bone mass in men, so it was appropriate to include men in this study. The reason for any potential interaction between Aln and LT4 would be a physicochemical interaction of the products within the intestinal lumen. The physicochemical properties of the drugs are not a function of age and sex of the patients.</p><p>Aln dosing instructions specify upright posture, and LT4 dosing instructions do not specify posture. Therefore, all subjects were dosed in conformance with the Aln directions. Subjects were treated consistently at each dosing/draw visit. While there is some evidence that sustained standing versus supine posture can affect LT4 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and there are no such studies for Aln, the consistent seated position for this study provides a systematic control for any such variation, while remaining consistent with approved product labeling.</p><p>Bioanalytical methods used in the measurement of Aln have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Because absorbed Aln disappears rapidly from systemic circulation (plasma <italic>T</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> 0.5 to 2&#x000a0;h after oral administration) and is renally excreted rather than metabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the number of bioanalytical methods for use with serum or plasma is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consequently, many pharmacokinetic studies have relied on urine, rather than plasma, in the determination of Aln concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To date, there are 2 studies that have determined plasma Aln concentrations for bioavailability and bioequivalence assessments of Aln tablets using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection and LLOQs of 1 to 2&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the present study, a validated LC-MS/MS method with high sensitivity (LLOQ 50&#x000a0;pg/mL) and selectivity was used to determine Aln plasma concentrations.</p><p>In the 2 previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Aln tablets were administered with 240&#x000a0;mL of water after an overnight fast; a standardized meal was given at 4&#x000a0;h post-dose. In the present study, Aln-NEF was dissolved in 4&#x000a0;oz (about 120&#x000a0;mL) water for administration; a standardized meal was given 30&#x000a0;min after dosing. The <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and <italic>T</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values obtained in this study were similar to those previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Aln plasma exposure values (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>) were slightly lower, which may reflect differences in population studied, bioanalytical method used, drug administration, or timing of the first meal.</p><p>In the present study, there was no material pharmacokinetic interaction between Aln and LT4 observed when Aln-NEF and LT4 were coadministered. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratio of Aln <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (0.77 to 1.08) and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> (0.79 to 1.08) contained 1, the lower bounds were near the bioequivalence boundary of 0.8, and the upper bounds were within the boundary of 1.25. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratio of LT4 <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (1.01 to 1.15) and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub> (0.98 to 1.12) fell within the 0.8 to 1.25 bioequivalence boundary. The variability in <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was greater than anticipated. The reason for this higher variability is unknown. Nevertheless, AUC values were much tighter and are far more important. These results are consistent with the prediction based on the known physicochemical properties of Aln-NEF and LT4, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aln and LT4.</p><p>Because LT4 is administered daily and Aln-NEF is administered once weekly, an increase of a few percent in LT4 absorption 1&#x000a0;day of the week would have no appreciable effect on average LT4 levels. These results indicate that coadministration of LT4 with the specific Aln-NEF formulation tested is feasible. The LT4 levels thereby achieved were bioequivalent to those achieved in the same study subjects in the absence of Aln. Of course, monitoring of thyroid function tests and adjustment of LT4 dosage, as needed, will remain essential in the management of hypothyroidism. It would be appropriate to perform laboratory reassessment of the patient&#x02019;s thyroxine status after 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks of coadministration. The Aln levels achieved in this study missed the formal boundary for determination of bioequivalence by less than 1%. In the clinical trial (FIT) that established the anti-fracture efficacy of Aln, the participants in the active treatment arm received 5&#x000a0;mg daily for the first 2&#x000a0;years, followed by 10&#x000a0;mg daily for approximately one more year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the extension of that study, (FLEX) participants received either 5 or 10&#x000a0;mg daily or placebo. The 2 active arms produced similar results and were pooled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It seems clear that there is a much wider therapeutic window for Aln treatment of osteoporosis than for LT4 treatment of hypothyroidism. Therefore, no clinically important difference in the efficacy of Aln would be expected to result from coadministration.</p><p>For LT4, <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> is marginally higher for the combined administration group (CI for the ratio was 1.006&#x02013;1.148). Of course, in view of the long half-life of LT4, it is the AUC that is of clinical importance. The upper limit of the confidence interval for the ratio of AUCs was 1.119, and the mean ratio was 1.049. Taking into account the weekly schedule of administration of Aln, and the usual daily administration schedule for LT4, the effect on weekly AUC of LT4 would be less than 1% at the mean and less than 2% at the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval.</p><p>Aln-NEF and LT4 were well tolerated when given alone or concurrently administered in healthy subjects. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interference between the Aln-NEF formulation of Aln sodium and LT4. LT4 does not materially affect absorption of Aln when administered as Aln-NEF. Whether the findings of this study that used Aln-NEF apply to any other formulations of Aln is uncertain. A formal interaction study would be necessary to evaluate each formulation of Aln, available as either tablets for oral use or oral solution, with LT4 as the formulations may vary in composition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored and funded by Mission Pharmacal Company, San Antonio, TX.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p>This study was conducted in compliance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki&#x02014;Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects and Good Clinical Practice.
