A UK National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approved the trial (07/NIR03/37). Patients with glaucoma were identified on the basis of either having had glaucoma surgery (of which there were none) or prescription of topical pressure lowering medications (46 patients). This criterion does not distinguish between patients with ocular hypertension and those with glaucoma and so these two groups were combined into a single group and labelled as glaucoma for the analyses. And it should be noted that neither gonioscopy nor central corneal thickness measurements were performed.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-307595.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2015-307595supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>IOP measurements</title><p>The IOP was measured monthly using Goldmann applanation tonometry in both eyes prior to treatment and in the study eye after injection if treated. Two readings were made and if more than 2&#x02005;mm apart, a third reading was taken. Visit IOP for each eye was the mean of the two or the median of the three. Equipment was calibrated at least twice annually.</p><p>The clinicians were not masked to which was the study eye for these measurements but were doing it for safety monitoring only and no hypothesis was even discussed until after data collection was complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>Three outcomes were prespecified in an analysis plan.

Ten covariates were prespecified in the analysis plan: months in study, months since last injection, mean arterial blood pressure, study drug, cataract surgery, glaucoma, age at randomisation, gender, baseline preinjection IOP in the study eye (outcomes 1 and 3) and the time between the injection and the postinjection IOP measurement (outcome 1). We treated time in trial as a proxy for number of injections (adjusting for time since last injection) since the two were strongly correlated. Linear mixed modelling was used to analyse the three study outcomes; intercept and &#x02018;months in trial&#x02019; terms were fitted as random effects in all three models. For the analyses of preinjection IOP, namely outcomes 2 and 3, the baseline measurements of each outcome were modelled jointly with the subsequent values to avoid the need to exclude cases with missing baseline values. Model validity was checked and outlying values were excluded. Linearity assumptions were also checked and when non-linear, the data were grouped into categories. All covariates were retained in the models regardless of their significance. Results are reported as effect estimates with 95% CIs. Two-sided p values &#x0003c;0.05 are considered statistically significant.</p><p>IOP was measured at every visit and the amount of missing data was low (less than 5% of attended visits; a further 13% of visits were not attended<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, blood pressure was only measured every 3&#x02005;months. Plots of the mean arterial pressure suggested that the pressure did not change much over time, so values were interpolated for the visits where it was not measured.</p><p>Cataract surgery was identified by the phakic status of the eye. A time-dependent indicator variable was fitted to denote when surgery took place. The impact of having surgery in both eyes was tested by adding an interaction term to the model. This term was retained if significant at the 5% level. As for cataract surgery, a time-dependent indicator variable was fitted to describe when patients' were identified as glaucomatous during time in the trial.</p><p>Baseline preinjection IOP in the study eye, study drug, age at randomisation and gender did not vary across visits.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>All 610 participants in the IVAN study cohort were included in this analysis.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There were 13&#x02005;371 study visits including baseline and injections were administered at 10&#x02005;160 of these visits.</p><p>The median duration of active participation in the trial was 23.6&#x02005;months (IQR 22.8 to 24.3), with a median time between injections of 1.0&#x02005;month (IQR 0.9 to 1.2).

It should be noted that the study population was patients with treatment naive nAMD, of whom less than 10% had glaucoma; investigators were discouraged from recruiting patients with advanced glaucoma. Accordingly, the results of this should not be extrapolated to those with advanced glaucoma.</p><p>In our models, we chose time in trial as a proxy for number of injections (we could not fit both as they were highly correlated). In the models dealing with IOP spike and preinjection IOP over time in the study eye, this effect also includes changes with age within patients (which is distinct from the cross-sectional effect of age between patients) since patients were ageing with time in trial. The third analysis, of changes in the intereye difference in IOP over time, provides the most direct estimate of the trend in IOP over time attributable to the number of injections, since ageing cannot be a consideration (ie, both eyes age at the same time).</p><p>The first model explored was the immediate postinjection IOP change. An injection of even a small volume into the vitreous gives an immediate rise in the IOP, and injections of anti-VEGF agents are no exception<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> given the non-extensible properties of the sclera. This pressure rise usually returns to normal in under 1&#x02005;h without the need for pressure lowering treatment, and therefore our analyses were adjusted for the varying time of the postinjection measurement after administration of the injection.</p><p>As adjustment of IOP following a volume load occurs as a consequence of pressure dependent increased flow through the trabecular meshwork (the uveoscleral pathway flux is independent of the ocular pressure), we predicted that damage to the trabecular meshwork would give rise to an elevated and more prolonged postinjection IOP rise. Kahook <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> raised this as a particular concern for repackaged bevacizumab due to the presence of increased levels of particulates associated with repackaging. Our data found no difference between those receiving ranibizumab and those receiving repackaged bevamizumab arguing against an association between repackaging and pressure rises.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, a small (1.15&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) increase in the pressure rise in study eyes of patients with glaucoma<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> compared with those without glaucoma was observed. A reduction in IOP of similar size (1&#x02005;mm Hg) is seen in cataract-operated versus unoperated study eyes. Fluid has to flow past the lens from the vitreous cavity to the anterior chamber and then into the angle and out through the trabecular meshwork. Intraocular lenses, due to their smaller size, reduce the resistance to this flow. We would have expected the same effect when both eyes were pseudo/aphakic and it is a matter of surprise that this was not observed.</p><p>On average the IOP spike increased at a rate of 0.03&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg/month in the trial, which over the 24-month period equates to a rise of 0.72&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. There was no suggestion that the IOP increase was higher with bevacizumab.</p><p>In the second model, we explored whether a rise in the preinjection IOP would occur in the study eye over time. Three significant factors emerged. The first was phakic status, with our findings being consistent with previous observations that cataract surgery causes a lowering of the ocular pressure.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>After allowance for cataract surgery, age and glaucoma, there was a small (0.02&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg/month) significant rise in IOP over time but no relationship with the agent injected.</p><p>We repeated the analysis excluding blood pressure from the model as 0.023&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg rise in IOP per mm&#x02005;Hg rise in blood pressure has been shown<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and is 0 similar to the 0.01&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg noted in the present study. Anti-VEGF agents can cause a rise in blood pressure, and if the mechanism for their effect on the ocular pressure is mediated by this effect on the blood pressure, then controlling for blood pressure would reduce or eliminate this effect. We checked this and the relationship remained unchanged arguing for a local effect rather than a systemic action.</p><p>As IOP tends to rise with age, we constructed a third model using the fellow eye as an internal control, which removes the effect of in-trial ageing. Again, cataract surgery and glaucoma appeared in the model in a manner consistent with the previous analyses. The rise in IOP was similar to that observed in the previous model supporting our findings of a small but significant rise in IOP with injection frequency. As with the other models, there was no difference between the anti-VEGF drugs.</p><p>Overall, our data support an ocular hypertensive action of anti-VEGF drugs probably mediated by a direct action on the trabecular meshwork. The endothelial cells are known to express VEGF receptors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and one potential mechanism for the observed rise in the IOP is inhibition of the ocular hypotensive VEGF-NO pathway.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There was no indication of differential effects on IOP between ranibizumab and bevacizumab.</p><p>The effect on IOP is small but discernible due to the size of this trial. As anti-VEGF therapies require long administration, information on the potential risk of high IOP spikes and chronic IOP elevation becomes increasingly relevant. The other studies that have failed to identify the change in IOP that occurs in eyes treated with anti-VEGF agents have generally had small sample sizes and short-term follow-up.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We cannot comment on the risk of developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy (disc appearances were not graded) but the limited evidence available from the literature so far is reassuring.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref> Nonetheless, a note of caution should be struck as endothelial damage from radiation is a potentially late complication (reflecting the slow turnover rate of endothelial cells) and can take 3&#x02005;years to manifest<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and a similar situation may apply here.</p><p>We conclude that repeated use of anti-VEGF agents induces a small but statistically significant rise in IOP in treated eyes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have read and approved this manuscript.
