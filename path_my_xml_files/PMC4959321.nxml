In this light, early vision loss adversely affects physical, mental, social and psychological health, and quality of life in children with VI.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thus, they require more support to fulfill all aspects of their lives.</p><p>To tackle these issues, activities such as balance exercises,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] aerobics,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] ice skating,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] gymnastics skills,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] goal ball game,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and rope jumping as exercise training[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been specially adapted for children with VI. Today, yoga is well accepted as a physical activity, as beneficial or better than exercises at improving the levels of fitness[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and health outcomes.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Extensive research has investigated the wide-ranging effects of yoga on body, mind, and psyche in children. Previous studies have reported that regular yoga practice enhances the functioning of various bodily organs and organ systems.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Yoga's positive effects on physical health include co-ordination,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] muscle strength,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] balance,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] cardio-pulmonary fitness,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and overall physical fitness.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Mentally, it improves memory,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] concentration, and attention,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] whereas psycho-physiologically it diminishes cortisol level,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] anxiety, and stress.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In normal children, it improves quality of life[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Overall, yoga constitutes an ethical, physical, mental, and emotional discipline, forming the basis of a way of life. It promises to fulfill the special needs of children with VI, but only few studies have been conducted on yoga on such populations. These showed positive effects on physiological arousal,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proprioception,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] minimum muscular fitness,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and balance.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Surprisingly, despite yoga's promise, it has not been added to the regular curriculum for those with VI.</p><p>This study had two objectives; development of a suitable protocol and to determine preferred mode of learning yoga from a survey of students&#x02019; reports.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Protocol development</title><p>The learning capacity of children with VI varies according to age, socioeconomic status, and previous exposure to the outside world. Children's fundamental issues; inability to perceive space, fear of falling, and difficulty in locating direction of sounds motivated us to modify normal yoga teaching protocols to tackle their problems.</p><p>Various instructional strategies have been used for teaching physical exercises to children with VI, including verbal instruction, tactile teaching, and physical guidance.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The yoga training protocol was developed based on 4 years&#x02019; experience of imparting yoga to children with VI, with input from yoga experts, physical trainers, and experience from a previous study.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Initially, yoga training focused on verbal instructions. While this described the concepts of practice, it failed to help it integrate intellectually or to be applied practically. Most yoga practices are named for elements of nature or animals: Sun, butterfly, fish, camel, etc., which fail to communicate concrete conceptions to the children. Preliminary stages of practice must focus on concrete experiences with direct meaning for the children. Such limitations of verbal instruction make tactile models necessary to illustrate concepts of practice sufficiently and accurately. Observing each child's limitations and ability to gain ideas about each practice from a tactile model was also important. Some children found both steps difficult, so each practice was further divided into sub-steps to better guide their body positions. Trainers&#x02019; key roles were to observe children&#x02019; interest and grasping capacity, and to adapt training techniques as required.</p><p>The following five-step method was adapted to teach the yoga practices effectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Step 1: Verbal guidance</title><p>Verbal communication is a prime medium for children with VI and unable to make eye contact, or perceive facial expressions or gestures. Descriptions explain actions required to perform practical tasks. Verbal guidance is most effective when composed in simple, precise language.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Clear, concise, and complete descriptions of each yoga practice were given. In addition, to avoid possible adverse effects, each yoga posture's limitations and contraindications were explained.</p><p>For students with VI, verbal description alone could not give them sufficient concrete conceptions of each practice, and failed to inculcate practical competence. Further steps were needed to create strong enough mental images to learn each practice. These limitations led to Step 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Step 2: Tactile modeling</title><p>Children with VI greatly rely on the sense of touch as an additional mode of learning. For many, touch is the chief mode of communication. Arora and Kour[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that to identify objects of different textures, children with VI use tactile discrimination more than the senses of taste and hearing. To promote communication, textured materials such as sandpaper or board are commonly used. Regardless of the type of material, tactile models must make sense to children with VI.</p><p>For better understanding and to create interest, thick paper cut out models of each asana were prepared and distributed among participants. Each child was encouraged to touch and feel the model until they thought they really understood the body position. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the paper cut out models of different yoga postures. Touching such cut out models greatly enhanced the student's ability to understand precisely what is required to correctly position every part of their body in each yoga posture.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Paper cut out models of postures named, 1Bhujangasana, 2Dhanurasana, 3 Parvatasana (part of Surya namaskar), 4 Ustrasana</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-9-114-g001"/></fig><p>This required sensitivity and sufficient time to comprehend the tactile information. Such models of yoga postures are challenging to prepare. Note that tactile models are useful only when a child recognizes what they represent. Furthermore, use of touch cues for each separate practice should be consistent so that no confusion is introduced.</p><p>While physical postures can be taught using models, moving practices such as loosening exercises cannot be taught. Similarly, breathing and relaxation practices do not require tactile input.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Step 3: Step-by-step teaching</title><p>Proficiency comes not by verbal instruction but by practice. Step-by-step instruction constitutes a strategic teaching method that divides each practice into sub-steps to understand, memorize, and perform it comfortably. It is more effective in verbal guidance, and helps students gain proficiency, though overall instruction may require a longer time period. In addition, extra time is needed to reinstruct when sub-steps are forgotten.</p><p>Teaching <italic>Bhujanga</italic> (cobra) asana, an important posture for all spinal problems[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] offers an example. Steps are as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1<sup>st</sup> step: Lie down in prone posture and place the palms besides the chest.</p></list-item><list-item><p>2<sup>nd</sup> step: Inhale and raise the upper part of the body including head, neck, shoulders, chest, and upper part of the abdomen, above the navel.</p></list-item><list-item><p>3<sup>rd</sup> step: Maintain the final position with normal breathing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>4<sup>th</sup> step: Exhale and come back to the starting position.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Step 4: Learning in a group</title><p>Practices become easier to learn when participants can touch and feel an instructor or peer-performing the movements. Students were divided into groups of four or five of the same gender, standing in a circle with a demonstrator student at the center. As the demonstrator performed the posture according to the yoga instructor's directions, members of the group touched and felt the body and limb positions. This method was highly effective in helping the children to learn postures. Although similar to tactile modeling, students experienced the required positions more directly.</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable being touched, so this step should be used carefully. Students need to understand clearly what they are trying to learn. Limitations such as aversion to physical touch or tendencies to back away or wince noted in studies of sighted children[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] were not encountered.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Step 5: Physical assistance with verbal guidance</title><p>Physical assistance is an important, effective teaching technique to improve the performance of children with VI. When other modes of teaching fail to provide clear conception of a practice, this strategy becomes appropriate to teach a skill. Instructions are given in students&#x02019; local language to accomplish each posture after they have successfully acquired its essence. When all the students could follow instructions for each asana, the yoga instructor corrected their postures guiding their limbs to better positions individually. Since children with VI may hesitate to explore, and may misunderstand or misinterpret touch, this step may help them become comfortable with a practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Participants</title><p>In the first half of the study, 41 children with VI (26 male, 15 female) aged 11.90 &#x000b1; 2.09 enrolled from a residential school for the blind, &#x0201c;Ramana Maharishi Academy for the Blind,&#x0201d; Bengaluru, South India, and underwent 16 weeks of yoga training.

Two more trained yoga instructors were also employed to guide the children. For the convenience of learning, the entire group of 41 children was subdivided into four groups with 10 or 11 in each group. Classes were conducted separately for each group in different sessions.</p><p>Practices were selected to promote all-round development, including breathing exercises (5 min) to normalize breath rate; loosening practices (10 min) to stretch and relax muscles; asanas, maintaining various postures (20 min) to release physical and mental tensions by relaxing and revitalizing the body; pranayama, voluntary regulation of breathing (10 min) to lower levels of stress and anxiety, relaxation practices (15 min) to relax the whole psycho-physiological system, and develop body&#x02013;mind awareness.

This part determined students&#x02019; preferred method of learning. Findings revealed that of the five teaching techniques, &#x0201c;physical assistance with verbal guidance&#x0201d; was most favored by the children, with &#x0201c;tactile modeling with verbal guidance&#x0201d; as the 2<sup>nd</sup> choice. &#x0201c;Learning in a group,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;verbal guidance,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;step-by-step teaching&#x0201d; were, respectively, their third, fourth, and fifth preferences.</p><p>These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that physical guidance is a successful teaching method for acquiring skills in students with VI.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Another study found physical guidance to be the preferred instructional strategy for learning to swim.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] In contrast, another study suggested that those children with VI who happen to be hesitant to physical touch may prefer tactile modeling as a mode of teaching.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Our observation was that students were initially protective, but after they became familiar with the instructors, they preferred individual guidance to tactile model. This may be because physical assistance clarifies movements required in each practice by physically aligning participants&#x02019; body part,[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] may provide kinesthetic cues to transmit clear ideas about the posture.</p><p>Like physical guidance, tactile modeling is also effective, and has been found the preferred mode of teaching for some children with VI.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Here, &#x0201c;tactile modeling&#x0201d; was the second choice possibly because it was only used for few of the practices.</p><p>&#x0201d;Learning in a group&#x0201d; was the students&#x02019; third favored method, but was close to the second possible method because the sense of touch is used in both. Although &#x0201c;verbal guidance&#x0201d; is essential as the fundamental technique for transmitting mental images,[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] it was only fourth choice. Possibly because students were the first-time yoga practitioners, verbal guidance could not provide a clear conception of each practice. This is supported by Kohler,[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] who explains that the auditory sense is not the only compensatory sense used by those with VI when acquiring much needed practical skills.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Observations</title><p>Each step has its own uniqueness and importance for teaching yoga efficiently. Once moves are clearly understood, they can be taught using only verbal cues for each movement. A second important observation was of no adverse effects during the study period.</p><p>Most students found adjustment to the new routine difficult, while for some comprehension, it was limited. A few were nervous and afraid of falling. Some could not recognize the direction of the instructor's voice, and faced the opposite direction, but within a week, all started taking more interest and were more positive about learning yogic practices. With certain practices, they never felt comfortable; these were balancing asanas, dynamic practices, and ones where the body needs to be lifted from the ground.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Limitations</title><p>The findings are limited by a small sample size. Hence, the present trial could not detect the preferred mode of learning gender wise.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Suggestions</title><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patience is the prime need for a yoga instructor, especially when dealing with children who require more time and energy to communicate each practice</p></list-item><list-item><p>Awareness of what motivates children and how to use such motivation as an effective strategy is the foremost need to conduct a class successfully</p></list-item><list-item><p>Students become enthusiastic when given positive feedback with phrases such as great job, nice performance, and absolutely right.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Children with VI are now being integrated into mainstream physical education. This study implemented a yoga-teaching method adapted for children with VI in a residential school setting, and determined preferences for different steps of learning, confirming acceptability of the new approach. It hopes to inspire more instructors to become involved in teaching children with VI yoga, the advantages of which have been reported elsewhere.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The steps described above will help yoga instructors do so more effectively and enjoyably. Tactile modeling and correcting student postures with verbal instructions particularly help students&#x02019; understanding and ability to practice independently. Parents and teachers alike can encourage the children to engage in such physical activity to improve fitness, reduce stress, and help cope with their many needs and challenges. Further studies using this protocol may encourage adoption of yoga as a part of their regular activities and incorporation into their curriculum.</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>World Health Organisation.
