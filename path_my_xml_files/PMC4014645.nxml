Patients often develop dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and malnutrition which affect the compliance to therapy, compromising the dosage and thus the efficacy of the regimen. Control of nausea and vomiting have significantly improved after the advent of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists, leading to a remarkably better quality of life of the cancer patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, improved gastrointestinal tolerance with cancer chemotherapy is still incomplete and control of &#x0201c;delayed nausea and vomiting&#x0201d; in particular, remains an area of unmet therapeutic need. The ability of the currently available 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists such as ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron to control these symptoms, which appear beyond 24 h of administration of chemotherapy is considered to be limited.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Further, in the control of acute nausea/vomiting also, some of the patients do not respond to a given 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist. However, these patients are still benefited by changeover to another agent and there is no complete &#x0201c;cross-resistance&#x0201d; between the different agents despite structural similarities.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Ramosetron, a new member in the class of selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, is a tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative structurally independent of the previously developed 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron. It is more potent and has longer-lasting effects than the older agents because of a slower rate of dissociation from the target receptor and higher binding affinity. The safety and efficacy of ramosetron in the management and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy as well as in post-operative setting is well-established.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Ramosetron has a flexible administration schedule with 0.1 mg oral tablet for the prevention and 0.3 mg/2 ml intravenous injection for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Comparative clinical trials have shown that the treatment efficacy with ramosetron in early post-dose period is similar to or higher than that of granisetron or ondansetron, but it is significantly better in the late phases due to its longer duration of action.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Ramosetron has also been shown to be effective and is approved internationally for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in males as 2.5 &#x003bc;g and 5 &#x003bc;g tablets.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Although the efficacy and safety of ramosetron is established internationally, there is no data on the efficacy and safety of this drug in the Indian population. This phase III study was conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ramosetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg tablets with ondansetron hydrochloride 4 mg tablets for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adult patients of Indian origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective, open label, active controlled multicentric, phase III non-inferiority clinical trial was conducted at four different centers in India. The study was approved by the licensing authority (Drugs Controller General of India) and the institutional/independent ethics committees of each of the participating centers before start of the study. It was conducted in compliance with the good clinical practice guidelines issued by the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use and the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients before the start of any screening procedure.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients of either sex, 18-75 years of age, receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy were included in the study. Patients suffering from concomitant diseases that may cause vomiting (for example, active peptic ulcer, gastric outlet obstruction or intestinal obstruction, brain tumor, brain metastasis and epilepsy) and those who had experienced vomiting in the past 24 h prior to enrolment into the study due to any reason were excluded from the study. Patients taking medications that can affect the gastrointestinal tract or central nervous system (for example, other antiemetics or antipsychotics) or with a history of hypersensitivity to ondansetron or any other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists were not eligible for enrolment. Patients having clinically significant concomitant illnesses such as cardiac, renal or hepatic disease, those with anticipated survival of &#x0003c;3 months or those who had participated in another clinical trial in the past 3 months or patients having a continuing history of alcohol and/or drug abuse were also excluded from the study. Female patients with pregnancy or lactation were not included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drug administration</title><p>Patients enrolled in the study were randomized to receive either one tablet of ramosetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg (Group R) or one tablet of ondansetron hydrochloride 4 mg (Group O) once a day in the morning for 5 consecutive days starting 1 h before the start of chemotherapy on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the study.</p><p>Concomitant medications which could possibly influence the outcome of the trial such as other antiemetics, antipsychotics or sedatives were not permitted during the study. In the event of severe nausea and/or vomiting in any of the enrolled patients, a rescue anti-emetic could be used at the discretion of the investigator in the best interest of the patient and details of such rescue medication usage were recorded. Treatment with corticosteroids in the enrolled patients was allowed only if such drugs were a part of the chemotherapy regimen. Medications for other concomitant illnesses, if present, were permitted as deemed necessary by the investigator and recorded in the case record form.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessments</title><p>Efficacy assessments were based on the severity of nausea and vomiting in the patients enrolled in the two study groups after administration of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy during the follow-up period.

Investigators&#x02019; global assessment of efficacy on a 4-point rating scale of excellent, good, fair and poor at the end of the study was also analyzed.</p><p>Adverse events were documented by the investigators on a daily basis, including date of onset and end (duration), intensity (mild, moderate or severe), treatment required and outcome. The relationship of the study medication to adverse event was determined by assigning one of the four criteria (definite, probable, possible or remote) to each adverse event. Standard laboratory tests including hematology, blood biochemistries and urine analysis were performed before administration of the study drug and at the end of treatment for the assessment of safety of the study medications. Clinically significant abnormalities in the laboratory investigations were documented as adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>On the basis of previous studies, 68% and 63% CRR were assumed for patients treated with ramosetron and ondansetron at day 1, respectively.

The results of this study indicate that ramosetron is non-inferior to ondansetron in the control of early nausea and vomiting (occurring during the first 24 h) and is superior to ondansetron in the control of delayed nausea and vomiting (occurring after the first 24 h) after treatment with emetogenic chemotherapy. It is a very well-tolerated drug in cancer patients.</p><p>It was seen in our study that the intensity of nausea and vomiting progressively increases from day 2 onwards, in spite of prophylactic treatment, as reported by the severity grades of these symptoms in patients during the course of study. In fact, delayed nausea and vomiting beyond 24 h of chemotherapy administration is reported to be incompletely assuaged by existing 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In our study, we observed that ramosetron was significantly better than ondansetron for the prevention of delayed symptoms at all time-points beyond 24 h with consistently higher treatment response rates reported. This effect could be attributed to the longer half-life of the drug and the active metabolite of ramosetron which maintains high receptor occupancy and thus prolongs the action of the drug providing a good therapeutic effect.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, it is to be noted that the emesis control was still not complete.</p><p>Several studies comparing the efficacy of ramosetron (oral or intravenous) with ondansetron,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] granisetron[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and tropisetron[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for the prevention of chemotherapy induced gastrointestinal adverse effects are published internationally. However, the severity grades used as efficacy parameters, emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy regimens and the time-points of assessment are very diverse; therefore accurate efficacy comparisons of the findings of our study with these studies are difficult. Overall, these studies have shown that ramosetron is non-inferior to other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting; while it is generally better for the control of symptoms beyond 24 h of treatment. Ramosetron is also shown to be effective in the patients receiving chemo-radiotherapy who did not sufficiently respond to ondansetron in the previous therapy cycles.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The efficacy findings of our study are also consistent with the results of these previous studies. Future studies should be done to optimize the use of ramosetron in combination with corticosteroids and/or neurokinin antagonists; as is currently recommended for other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists, in order to attain complete emesis control.</p><p>Most of the studies evaluating ramosetron for the prevention of CINV until date, had enrolled patients on chemotherapeutic agents with high emetogenic potential, especially those using Cisplatin based chemotherapy regimens.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Although restricting the patient enrolment to a particular regimen helps in reducing the variance in the study population, the compatibility and efficacy of the study drug with various other chemotherapeutic agents having different emetogenic potentials is not established. Our study has evaluated the overall therapeutic efficacy and safety of ramosetron and ondansetron in all the chemotherapy induced emetogenic risk categories. The emetogenic categories were fairly comparable in both groups, with the majority of the patients in both groups having received chemotherapy of moderate to high emetogenic potential. The results of our study suggest that ramosetron can be used along with all kinds of chemotherapeutic agents with varying emetogenic potential that are likely to be seen in any real time clinical setting to attain good control of CINV.</p><p>Both the treatments were well-tolerated, with no significant differences between the two groups. Further, since the patients enrolled in the study were being treated with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, the causal association of the reported adverse events to either of the study medication needed to be critically evaluated, given the known potential of the chemotherapeutic agents to cause adverse events. Thus, on causality assessment, adverse events reported in the study were unlikely to be attributable to either of the study medications with any degree of certainty. Moreover, previous published clinical trials have reported the incidence of adverse events during treatment with ramosetron ranging from 2.1% to 76.7%;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] however, causal association is rated to be uncertain for majority of them. The adverse events rate reported in the present study is 7% and is in line with the previous studies.</p><p>Our study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of ramosetron in cancer patient population in India. The open label design of the study is likely to be influenced by the investigator bias. However, comparability of both the study groups is verifiable from the similar baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in each treatment arm. Further, use of an active comparator and patient reported objective outcomes as efficacy parameters ensure the validity of the results of study. The efficacy results could be less than optimal in ondansetron group at the dose studied; still an earlier comparative study had used this dose of ondansetron,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and other studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] comparing different doses and oral/parenteral formulations of other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists and ramosetron have shown efficacy results similar to those reported in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of our above comparative, multicentric, clinical trial clearly indicate that ramosetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg tablet given once a day is non-inferior to ondansetron 4 mg tablet given once a day in the control of early nausea and vomiting (occurring during the first 24 h) after the treatment with emetogenic chemotherapy and is superior to ondansetron 4 mg tablet given once a day in the control of delayed nausea and vomiting (occurring after the first 24 h).
