Immune inflammatory reactions caused by local factors are considered as essential reasons for gingival bleeding, as also for the systemic bleeding disorders. In disease-free conditions of gingiva, the bleeding disorders are considered to be the main contender for bleeding. Other than these variables, many systemic drugs including systemic aspirin could also cause gingival bleeding. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of buffered aspirin therapy on gingival bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Totally, 36 systemically healthy individuals were included in the 15-day randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The 15 days were divided as: control period for the first 7 days and study period for the following 7 days. On the 1<sup>st</sup> day, all individuals were given oral prophylaxis after recording gingival parameters such as Plaque Index, probing depth, and Bleeding Index, and then blood samples were collected for hematological investigations. Then, all individuals were administered placebo capsules for 1 week as once daily dose. On the 8<sup>th</sup> day, all procedures were repeated and the individuals were prescribed with 325 coated aspirin capsules for 1 week. On the 15<sup>th</sup> day, all parameters were repeated and the results were statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In the study period, the parameters such as Bleeding Index, bleeding time, and prothrombin time were increased significantly, compared to the control period.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The variables such as systemic drug therapy should be considered for the examination of gingiva while the diagnosis is considered mainly based on gingival bleeding.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Altered bleeding</kwd><kwd>altered platelet function</kwd><kwd>gingival sulcus bleeding</kwd><kwd>systemic aspirin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Gingival sulcus bleeding is considered as an important clinical parameter in periodontal disease diagnosis. Despite numerous diagnostic advancements, gingival bleeding on probing is more sensitive and an early clinical indication of early gingival pathology. Several studies have shown that bleeding on probing is a positive predictor, but conversely lack of bleeding is a very strong negative predictor. Continued absence of bleeding on probing is considered as a strong predictor of continued periodontal health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Periodontal disease diagnosis and classification are almost entirely based on traditional clinical parameters like presence/absence of clinical inflammatory signs, probing depth, loss of attachment and bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Many studies revealed bleeding on probing as an earlier and more sensitive sign of gingival inflammation and also indicated that gingival bleeding may be associated with a lesion not dominated by inflammatory cells such as plasma cells. So, if active disease is characterized by a plasma cell dominated lesion, and then bleeding may not, in fact is a reliable indicator of disease activity.</p><p>It is also possible that bleeding tendency is unrelated to inflammatory cell type, but rather related to other pathologic changes associated with inflammation. Disorders like defective platelet function can also cause bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Acquired platelet dysfunction which is much more prevalent may induce gingival bleeding. Many drugs induce thrombocytopenia by eliciting an immune response in which the platelet is as innocent bystander. Platelets are damaged by complement activation following the formation of drug antibody complexes, which results in the acquired form of platelet dysfunction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Anti-platelet drug therapy is given in management of patients with arterial vascular disease, thromboembolism. Aspirin is the most widely used and studied drug, among the anti-platelet drugs. Aspirin induces inhibition of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) and prostacyclin and has opposing effects on hemostasis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The antithrombotic effects of TXA2 inhibition predominate according to Patrono <italic>et al</italic>. As per Fitzgerald's study, the anti-platelet effects of aspirin are associated with prolonged bleeding time (BT) and inhibition of TXA2-dependent platelet aggregation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Since prescribing aspirin has increased many fold nowadays for systemic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, the anti-thromboxane activity of systemic aspirin therapy should be considered in periodontal clinical examination since aspirin, acting as a non-disease factor, has the potential of altering the cause of bleeding.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

This rationale is supported by immune inflammatory changes in periodontal disease progression,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] which states that bacterial plaque and calculus elicit an inflammatory immune response which ultimately liberates cytokines that in turn mediate hyperemic events.</p><p>Other than hyperemic events, variables such as defective platelet function can also result in bleeding as per Schrodi <italic>et al</italic>. Platelet dysfunction can either be congenital or acquired. Congenital platelet dysfunctions like Von Willebrand's disease are rare, while conditions like uremia and myeloproliferative disorders, drugs such as cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, NSAIDs, chloroquine, chlorothiazide, gold salts, excessive alcohol intake, and thiazide diuretics induce acquired platelet dysfunction which is more prevalent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] NSAIDs, the most commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs, could be the more important cause for defective platelet function. Most of the NSAIDs acting through inhibition of cyclooxygenase route result in altering the bleeding response.</p><p>Among the NSAIDs, aspirin is the most effective anti-inflammatory agent and the most commonly used too. It is widely used as an anti-platelet drug therapy for cerebrovascular disease, arteriovascular disease, and thromboembolism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases and conditions such as coronary artery bypass graft operation, heart attack, stroke, arterial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome cause an increase in the number of anti-platelet therapy users and decrease in the mean age of these diseases definitely shifts the concern on aspirin since it is the widely used anti-platelet therapy drug.</p><p>The minimal anti-inflammatory dose of aspirin is 325 mg/day, while 86 mg/day is for given for anti-platelet action. Though use of aspirin in children is limited as it causes Reye's syndrome, cardiovascular diseases in children attract low dose of 75 mg aspirin daily. The minimal anti-inflammatory dose of aspirin is well enough to alter the platelet functions,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] hence it was used in this trial. The irreversible inhibition of prostaglandins by aspirin was the prime consideration of the trial.</p><p>Many studies demonstrated that the usage of NSAIDs reduced the gingival inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity by NSAIDs is associated with variable effects on prostaglandin synthesis in the gastric mucosa and the kidney. Aspirin acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase and permanently inhibits TXA2 production in a dose-dependent manner, when a single dose of 0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg/kg given for selective sparing of extra platelet cyclooxygenase activity by low-dose aspirin will result in increased antithrombotic efficacy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The action mechanism of aspirin is primarily by interfering with the biosynthesis of cyclic prostanoids, i.e. TXA2, PGI2, and other prostaglandins. Prostaglandins G and H are generated by the enzyme prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase, though its cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities are derived respectively from the arachidonic acid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Several studies revealed that aspirin exerts its primary anti-thrombotic effects through the inhibition of PGH synthase/COX by irreversible acetylation of a specific serine moiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Smith <italic>et al</italic>. predicted that COX<sub>1</sub> is completely inactivated by aspirin,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] whereas COX<sub>2</sub> converts arachidonic acid into 15-R-HETE instead of PGH<sub>2</sub>. The COX<sub>1</sub> inhibition of aspirin is more potent than COX<sub>2</sub> inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] (N ~ 180).</p><p>The platelet production of TXA<sub>2</sub> in response for the amplification of platelet aggregation revealed by Wu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Vascular endothelial cell production of PGs results in inhibition of platelet aggregation and induces vasodilatation. The vascular endothelial cells are able to regenerate new COX, and thus recover normal function, whereas COX inhibition in platelets is irreversible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Aspirin induces inhibition of TXA2 and PGI2 and has opposing effects on hemostasis. A single dose of 100 mg aspirin effectively inhibits the production of TXA2 in normal individuals. As per Fitzgerald, the anti-platelet effect of aspirin is associated with prolonged BT and inhibition of TXA2-dependent platelet aggregation.</p><p>The aspirin intake affects hemostasis. It doubles the BT when taken for a week. Because its action is irreversible, its effects on platelets last for up to 8 days, i.e. until new platelets are formed. With optimal analgesic dose, aspirin inhibits the platelet aggregation second to the inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, which prolongs the BT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The results of the 15-day study trial with 36 patients showed a significant increase of bleeding-associated parameters. Thus, gingival bleeding was shown to be higher in the study period and all parameters associated with bleeding were higher. The mean gingival bleeding was statistically significant in the study period (0.76) compared with the control period (0.42). It denotes that the 1-week aspirin therapy increases the bleeding episode [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mean, standard deviation, and test of significance of mean values of baseline, control and study periods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-4-221-g001"/></table-wrap><p>A single dose of 80 mg aspirin causes slight prolongation in the BT. It almost doubles the normal BT on 1-week aspirin intake of 325 mg/day. In fact, the mean BT of 4&#x02032;0&#x02033; for the study period supports that notion, while the control period mean was 2&#x02032;33&#x02033; [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Correlation coefficients of baseline, control, and study periods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-4-221-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The CT not show much variation in this study [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>] since aspirin is not an inhibitor of renal PGs, and at least 20% of platelets are functionally normal as the daily turnover rate is ~10% for platelets. Hence, aspirin intake does not affect the amount of the platelets, and the platelet count did not vary much in this study.</p><p>The aspirin intake affects prothrombin. The conversion of prothrombin into thrombin is affected by aspirin ingestion. Hence, aspirin intake for a week causes a twofold increase in PT. This was significantly increased in the study period (33.05 sec) compared with the control period (17.77 sec) [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><p>The effect of aspirin on individuals depends on their tolerance to aspirin and other factors like their body weight and rate of metabolism. Long-term aspirin therapy may alter the platelet function. It exerts anti-platelet, anti-thrombotic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. These effects cause alteration in bleeding. Long-term aspirin intake in healthy individuals, who are without any bleeding problems, may produce increased bleeding tendency without any specific cause. The significant increase of gingival bleeding in this study trial in healthy periodontium shows the effects of systemic short-term aspirin therapy.</p><p>This increase of bleeding on probing following aspirin ingestion would definitely challenge the notion that bleeding is essentially a sign of inflammation. This would also support the notion that gingival bleeding may be related to the proper functioning of platelets. Alteration in the sensitivity and specificity of bleeding on probing by aspirin is important to consider. The causes for altering the platelet function and other bleeding cascade mechanisms should be considered when the outcome of effects is measured by gingival bleeding tendency. The outcome of the present study supports the hypothesis that proper functioning of the platelets is an important factor to be considered in gingival bleeding specificity and sensitivity and its implication in diagnostic and treatment procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The outcome of the study indicates a significant relationship between aspirin intake and bleeding on probing. This would support the notion that bleeding may be related to platelet functioning. Proper platelet function could be considered as an important factor for bleeding on probing. Bleeding is always critical to evaluate and the altered platelet function should be considered in systemically diseased individuals.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name><name><surname>Adler</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Joss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nyman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Absence of bleeding on probing.
