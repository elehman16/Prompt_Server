This may in part be due to the treatment &#x0201c;default.&#x0201d; Current treatment guidelines recommend that providers (1) ask patients if they are willing to quit and (2) provide cessation-focused medications and counseling only to smokers who state that they are willing to quit. The default is that patients have to &#x0201c;opt in&#x0201d; to receive cessation assistance: providers ask smokers if they are willing to quit, and only offer medications and cessation support to those who say &#x0201c;yes.&#x0201d; This drastically limits the reach of cessation services because, at any given encounter, only one in three smokers say that they are ready to quit. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of providing all smokers with tobacco-cessation treatment unless they refuse it (OPT OUT) versus current practice&#x02014;screening for readiness and only offering treatment to smokers who say they are ready to quit (OPT IN).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This individually randomized clinical trial is conducted in a tertiary-care hospital. We will conduct the trial among up to 1000 randomly selected hospitalized smokers to determine the population impact of changing the treatment default, identify mediators of outcome, and determine the cost-effectiveness of this new, highly proactive approach. This is a population-based study that targets an endpoint of vital interest; applies minimal eligibility criteria to broaden generalizability; and utilizes hospital staff for interventions to ensure long-term sustainability. The study employs delayed consent and an innovative Bayesian adaptive design to evaluate a major shift in our approach to care. If effective, this change would expand the reach of tobacco-cessation treatment from 30% to 100% of smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Regardless of outcome, the trial will provide a model of how to alter and evaluate the impact of health care defaults. If OPT OUT proves to be more effective, it will expand the population eligible for cessation treatment by over 300%. It will also simplify the tobacco-cessation treatment algorithm, and relieve busy health care providers of the burden of evaluating readiness to quit.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Clinical Trials Registration, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02721082?term=NCT02721082&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02721082</ext-link>.

Due to the 20&#x02013;40-year time lag between starting smoking and the onset of tobacco-related illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], helping smokers quit is the best way to immediately reduce illness and deaths. Guideline-based tobacco-cessation treatment consists of two branching approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]: motivational counseling, based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], for patients not willing to make a quit attempt; and cessation-oriented pharmacotherapy and counseling for smokers who are prepared to make a quit attempt. Motivational treatment focuses on building smokers&#x02019; motivation to quit, but its effectiveness for smoking cessation is, at best, mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Cessation-oriented pharmacotherapy and counseling double quit rates over no-treatment controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but the &#x0201c;default option&#x0201d; for patients unwilling to quit tobacco use is &#x0201c;no treatment.&#x0201d; With each step of guideline-based tobacco-cessation treatment, smokers must say &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; (<italic>are they willing to quit, do they want medications, do they want counseling</italic>) in order to receive evidence based care&#x02014;they must &#x0201c;opt in.&#x0201d; This is in stark contrast to treatment of other common medical conditions, such as hypertension, where the default option is &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d;: physicians identify and initiate treatment for hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and patients must &#x0201c;opt out&#x0201d; if they do not want care.</p><p id="Par28">Likely as a result of this tobacco-cessation treatment &#x0201c;default,&#x0201d; fewer than one in five smokers actually get assistance in quitting on any given outpatient encounter with their health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In hospitals, an even smaller percentage of smokers receive assistance: a meta-analysis found that only 14% of inpatient smokers were provided with a prescription for cessation medication and 12% received referrals for follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, because smokers must opt in for cessation counseling and medication separately, few receive both components of evidence-based care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many would blame this treatment gap on smokers and their lack of motivation to quit smoking. Another potential cause, however, is how the &#x0201c;default&#x0201d; treatment for tobacco dependence is currently constructed in US health care systems.</p><p id="Par29">The treatment default for tobacco is different from any other chronic health condition. In health care, most treatment guidelines direct clinicians to provide evidence-based treatment, which the patient will receive by default unless they refuse treatment. In fact, this choice architecture is arguably the most ethical. Where there is strong clinical evidence that supports an appropriate therapy, the therapy should be presented as the default [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hence, the exceptional position that smokers should be asked if they are &#x0201c;willing&#x0201d; to quit creates a rate-limiting step in tobacco-cessation treatment that may be less effective and less ethical than an opt-out approach. Details on how defaults potentially affect treatment choices, and how this relates to tobacco-cessation treatment, may be found in a commentary by Richter and Ellerbeck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Decision theorists suggest that institutions should structure default choices to be the options that make the choosers better off, as judged by themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Tobacco-cessation treatment is an excellent candidate for a default that favors treatment because 70% of smokers state that they ultimately want to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Choosing to quit in the near future, however, is extremely difficult for smokers because they get the pleasures of smoking, and the pain of abstaining from smoking in the present, but suffer the terrible consequences of smoking in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This may be why fewer smokers state that they are ready to quit in the near future. They could use a &#x0201c;nudge&#x0201d; to accept treatment in order to reach their ultimate goal of quitting. In our opinion, smokers fail to receive effective cessation treatment due to the way in which the US structures the tobacco-cessation treatment default [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, we will examine the effects of proactively providing cessation-oriented treatment to all smokers, regardless of their willingness or readiness to quit.</p><p id="Par31">The objective of the study is to determine the impact of providing all smokers with cessation pharmacotherapy and counseling unless they refuse it (OPT OUT) versus current practice&#x02014;screening for readiness and only offering cessation assistance to smokers who say they are ready to quit (OPT IN).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p id="Par32">The study is a prospective, randomized, comparative effectiveness study using a Bayesian adaptive design. It is a two-arm study with individual randomization to groups in a large Midwestern academic medical center (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The hospital is a 475-bed tertiary-care hospital that admits over 20,000 patients per year and is located in a large metropolitan area.

For the outcome analysis, the study uses a Bayesian adaptive trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Mediation analyses will also provide insight into why changing the default did, or did not, work. We hypothesize that smoker perceptions of what course of action their cessation counselor recommends, and what is the status quo for receiving medications and counseling at the hospital, will affect their counseling participation, medication use, and quit rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment of study participants</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Random selection for the trial via the electronic health record (EHR)</title><p id="Par34">Study staff have access via the EHR to a real-time, comprehensive list of all smokers in the hospital&#x02014;the <italic>tobacco use list</italic>. For the purposes of the study, research staff will randomly select patients from the tobacco use list, and provide selected patients&#x02019; names to study staff for baseline assessment, randomization, and intervention. Random selection of participants serves two purposes. First, it ensures that we will test the change of default among a sample representative of all hospitalized smokers, which will enhance the generalizability of the findings. Second, it ensures that smokers <italic>not</italic> seeking tobacco-cessation treatment will be included in the trial, which will enhance our ability to detect the effect of changing the default among smokers who have not requested, and who might not be considered &#x0201c;ready&#x0201d; for medications and counseling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patients excluded from random selection via EHR</title><p id="Par35">A number of hospital services routinely do not permit a majority of their patients to be placed on Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). These include the operating room, orthopedic surgery, gastro-intestinal surgery, the burns service, and the neurology stroke service. Patients on these units, as well as patients less than 18&#x000a0;years of age, patients who have been in the hospital longer than 3&#x000a0;days, and pregnant patients, will be excluded from the tobacco use list prior to random selection for the trial. Patients who requested, or have orders for, tobacco-cessation treatment will be treated as usual by the existing hospital tobacco-cessation treatment service and will only be included in the trial if randomly selected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility and baseline assessment</title><p id="Par36">Study staff will visit all randomly selected smokers. For all study patients, staff will assess and address patient comfort, provide brief advice to quit, and provide a quit-smoking pamphlet. Staff will then assess eligibility and collect baseline data. Initial study eligibility criteria include: (1) the ability to speak English or Spanish, (2) have no significant comorbidity that precludes participation (i.e., acute, life-threatening illness or altered mental status such as dementia), (3) be a permanent resident of the state of Kansas or Missouri, (4) provide a secondary telephone contact to ensure 1-month follow-up survey completion, and (5) completed all eligibility questions.</p><p id="Par37">Other eligibility criteria ensure that patients are able to benefit from the intervention. Because follow-up counseling is by telephone, participants are required to have access to a telephone or mobile phone. Because patients are receiving free starter packs of NRT and prescriptions for post-discharge smoking cessation medications, eligibility is limited to patients who smoke one or more cigarettes per day, have smoked at least 25 of the past 30&#x000a0;days, and are otherwise medically eligible to use NRT (i.e., no acute myocardial infarction/ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), or other acute heart conditions).</p><p id="Par38">Last, several criteria preserve our ability to detect the effects of the trial. Patients cannot already have been seen by hospital tobacco-cessation treatment (UKanQuit) counselors or study staff during the recruitment hospitalization, cannot currently be taking cessation medications, or cannot be enrolled in a separate quit-smoking program.</p><p id="Par39">Study staff will record eligibility for the study on their clinic service tablet computer, along with standard service administrative data, which includes demographics, smoking characteristics, readiness to quit, and contact information for the 1-month follow-up. These administrative data will constitute baseline data for the clinical trial.</p><p id="Par40">The patients who are not eligible will be provided with the typical hospital tobacco-cessation services but will not be enrolled into the trial. The typical hospital services will follow the guidelines of UKanQuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which is a dedicated tobacco-cessation treatment service funded by the hospital. UKanQuit services include: (1) working with the medical team to address inpatient withdrawal symptoms, usually with NRT, (2) assessing readiness to quit, (3) providing motivational counseling to smokers who are not ready to quit, and (4) arranging for post-discharge counseling and medication prescriptions for patients who are ready to quit. The principal investigator (PI) of the present study also directs UKanQuit, and staff for both projects will work together closely to ensure that the study and the UKanQuit service avoid duplicating intervention among the same patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Enrollment and random allocation</title><p id="Par41">All patients who are eligible will be automatically enrolled into the trial and randomly allocated to a treatment arm. Consent for the trial is delayed&#x02014;it is sought at the 1-month follow-up. A function will be programmed into the tablet intake form so that study staff will select a key to randomize eligible smokers to either OPT OUT or OPT IN. At the beginning of the trial, the function will assign patients to groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Later, based on intermediate outcomes, the study biostatistician may alter the ratio in accordance with the Bayesian study design (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec31" ref-type="sec">Data analysis</xref>,&#x0201d; below). Study staff will offer smokers motivational counseling, medications, and cessation-oriented practical counseling in accordance with the study arm to which patients are randomized. Patients are only randomized into our trial once. If someone has been randomized into the trial in the past&#x02014;regardless of whether they provided consent at the 1-month follow-up or not&#x02014;they are not eligible for repeat randomization. There are likely cases where a randomly selected patient is screened and found ineligible at one point in time, then eligible at a later readmission date. These patients may be enrolled at the later admission date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Rationale for conducting a study with delayed consent</title><p id="Par42">The study uses a modified Zelen design, in which consent is obtained after randomization and treatment. We considered consenting patients before randomization and treatment. This would, however, require patients to &#x0201c;opt in&#x0201d; to being in a trial and possibly exclude the very smokers who might benefit from changing the default. We rejected consent before randomization and treatment, as it is the very experimental manipulation we seek to test. The Zelen design, in which patients are consented after randomization, can markedly enhance recruitment and improve generalizability by including a higher proportion of eligible patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In a departure from most traditional Zelen design trials, the proposed study will delay consent until after treatment in order to examine the impact of OPT OUT on cessation at 1-month post discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>OPT IN and OPT OUT intervention procedures&#x02014;framing the default</title><p id="Par43">We have created language that constitutes the &#x0201c;choice architecture&#x0201d; for each study condition (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>)<italic>.</italic> We have crafted these phrases to be short and simple, to enable study staff to reliably use them. Based on the patients&#x02019; group assignment, staff will frame the default and provide the appropriate intervention.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Treatment options by study arm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2119_Tab2_HTML" id="MO2"/></table-wrap>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Inpatient counseling and treatment plan&#x02014;OPT OUT</title><p id="Par44">For all patients in OPT OUT, staff will provide brief practical counseling, complete a treatment plan, and provide a pamphlet that outlines tips on quitting. The treatment plan includes: (1) inpatient medications, (2) outpatient prescription for medication and a free &#x0201c;starter pack&#x0201d; of medications, and (3) post-discharge counseling. In describing the treatment plan for the patients, study staff operationalize constructs thought to underpin the power of the default [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These terms: (1) signal the provider&#x02019;s positive attitude towards medication and counseling, and (2) state that the hospital&#x02019;s status quo is to provide medications and counseling.</p><p id="Par45">Using this OPT OUT language, staff will clearly indicate that they believe medications and counseling will benefit the patient, and that the hospital routinely and proactively provides cessation-oriented care to smokers. Unless a patient &#x0201c;opts out&#x0201d; of any or all elements of the treatment plan, all patients will receive all elements of the treatment plan, including inpatient medications, outpatient prescription and starter pack, and post-discharge counseling calls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Inpatient counseling and treatment plan&#x02014;OPT IN</title><p id="Par46">For patients in OPT IN, staff will screen for willingness to stay having quit after leaving the hospital. Patients who are willing to quit will be offered similar counseling, treatment planning, and medications as patients in OPT OUT, including a pamphlet with tips on quitting.

Moreover, assessing outcomes at 1&#x000a0;month is in accordance with Joint Commission Guidelines and UKanQuit standard practice for post-discharge follow-up of hospitalized smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Perhaps most importantly, 1&#x000a0;month represents an important timeframe for hospitals, as hospitals with excessive 1-month readmission rates for selected diagnoses will receive decreased Medicare reimbursements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Should our intervention prove effective, it could pave the way for future studies on the impact of smoking cessation on reduced 30-day readmission rates for specific diagnoses.

We created virtual responses for our &#x0201c;expected&#x0201d; quit rates, another for &#x0201c;small but unlikely&#x0201d; quit rates, and a third for &#x0201c;no differences&#x0201d; in quit rates. We performed three sets of trial simulations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Each set involved many trial simulations that identified power (the probability of success) in two scenarios&#x02014;one for early success (i.e., being able to stop randomization early) and one for late success (i.e., upon enrolling all 1000 patients). While two of these combinations are very unlikely to occur, we included all scenarios. First, under the &#x0201c;expected&#x0201d; quit rates, we estimated (identified) that 92% of the simulated trials had early success, 3% late success, and only 5% had incomplete results. Thus, this scenario had 95% power. The average sample size of this trial scenario was 625 patients with more than half (387) in the better OPT-OUT arm. The average length of these simulated trials was 98&#x000a0;weeks. Second, if there are &#x0201c;small but unlikely&#x0201d; quit rates, we identified that 30% of the simulated trials had early success, 5% had late success, and 65% had incomplete results. This trial scenario had 35% power and the sample size of this trial scenario was on average 903 with more than half (530) in the better OPT-OUT arm. The average length of this trial scenario was 142&#x000a0;weeks. Third, we examined the scenario that serves as our null hypothesis. In this scenario there are no differences in quit rates among the arms. The extent to which this scenario is &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; reflects our Type-I error rate. For this scenario, we identified that 4% of the simulated trials had early success, 1% late success. This trial scenario produced an appropriate expected Type-I error (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05). The sample size of this scenario on average was 986 patients, with about half (495) in the OPT-OUT arm. The average length of the trials under this scenario was 155&#x000a0;weeks&#x02014;approximately 3&#x000a0;years of recruitment. Hence, our maximal sample size of 1000, in 3&#x000a0;years of recruitment, provides ample time and participants to identify project outcomes under all three scenarios.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Study hypotheses, measures, and analytic strategy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Purpose</th><th>Variables</th><th>Analytic strategy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="3">Hypothesis 1: compared to OPT IN, significantly more patients in OPT OUT will participate in counseling, use cessation medications, and be abstinent from smoking</td><td>Abstinence: treatment condition and 1-month 7-day point-prevalence abstinence</td><td>2-sample binomial test</td></tr><tr><td>Counseling: treatment condition and total counseling time by 1&#x000a0;month</td><td>2-sample lognormal test</td></tr><tr><td>Medication: treatment condition and number of days of medication use</td><td>2-sample Poisson test</td></tr><tr><td>Hypothesis 2: significantly more smokers in OPT OUT will be abstinent from smoking, and mediation analyses will partially or fully explain the effects</td><td>Treatment condition and 6-month and &#x02022; 7-day point-prevalence abstinence &#x02022; Default variables &#x02022; Counseling/medication use</td><td>Bayesian structural equation modeling with a logistic outcome</td></tr><tr><td>Hypothesis 3: OPT OUT will be more costly but also more effective than OPT IN</td><td>Treatment condition and 1-month abstinence &#x02022; Variable costs</td><td>Incremental cost/quit</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

These are important to Bayesian adaptive designs for determining the length of the trial. Based on accrual patterns for EQUIP and other hospital studies conducted by our team, and the sample size required for this trial, we assume that the accrual patterns will follow a Poisson distribution with an average of 6.7 patients per week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Accounting for missing data</title><p id="Par80">For the main outcome analysis, in accordance with the ITT principle, patients lost to follow-up will be considered smokers. We will also calculate main and secondary outcomes using imputed data. Missing observations on covariates will be handled through Bayesian posterior predictive distributions with auxiliary variables, auxiliary variables are variables that are not part of the analysis model, yet are included as missing data correlates to strengthen the assumption that missing covariates are missing at random (MAR; missingness is independent of the missing value) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Assuming data are MAR, analyses employed under the ITT principle are considered acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par81">To explore the effects of assuming MAR when data are actually MNAR (missing not at random) sensitivity analyses will be conducted using either a pattern mixture model or a selection model approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, we will conduct and report an exploratory pooled ITT analysis to examine the effects of the Zelen design by calculating overall quit rates assuming patients who were dropped from the study due to failure to provide consent were (a) smokers, (b) nonsmokers, or (c) MNAR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Monitoring the impact of population drift and adaptive randomization</title><p id="Par82">There could be a drift in our population characteristics that are related to outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This is a problem for all trials, whether they are equally or adaptively randomized. A recent paper examined the effects of response probabilities that changed over time due to this population drift, and found that population drift had little effect on adaptive randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, given our large dataset, we may be in a unique position to contribute to understanding how adaptive randomization might interact with population drift. In order to determine whether drift occurs, we will monitor the characteristics of the study population over time&#x02014;especially focusing on drift introduced (or magnified) by adaptive changes in our random allocation rule. We will focus on several factors that are known to be associated with abstinence from smoking. These factors include cigarettes per day, time to first cigarette, sex, age, and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. If we find that sample characteristics become unbalanced, we will adjust our outcome analyses to account for this. In addition, in secondary outcome analyses, we will track 1-month abstinence to determine whether rates changed over time. If we find significant changes in either population characteristics or abstinence over time, we will investigate whether (1) population drift, (2) temporal changes in the randomization scheme, or (3) a combination of the two had an effect on the proportion of patients who quit smoking.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Analyses by aim</title><p id="Par83">The main analyses for each aim are outlined below (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par84">Aim 1. Hypothesis 1: among patients consented into the trial, significantly more patients in OPT OUT will participate in counseling, use cessation medications, and be abstinent from smoking at 1&#x000a0;month post randomization compared to OPT IN. These analyses will involve two-sample tests.</p><p id="Par85">Aim 2. Hypothesis 2: significantly more smokers in OPT OUT will be abstinent from smoking, and mediation analyses will find that counseling participation, medication use, and default-theory-based variables will partially or fully explain the effect of OPT OUT on cessation at 6&#x000a0;months post randomization. After identifying a structural equation model that adequately fits the data for the hypothesized associations between the intervention and 6-month outcome, i.e., that Comparative Fit Index (CFI)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.9 and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.8, we will examine mediation using approaches based on the work of MacKinnon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], Brown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and Shrout and Bolger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Our theoretical model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Significance) will guide our analysis.</p><p id="Par86">Aim 2. Hypothesis 3: OPT OUT will be more costly&#x02014;in terms of upfront costs&#x02014;but will be more effective than OPT IN. As a result, OPT OUT will be more cost-effective from a provider perspective. We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to explicitly document the relative costs and benefits of OPT OUT versus OPT IN. Our cost analytic framework generally follows the guidelines adopted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in accordance with the Consensus Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We will divide the analysis into two components: first, intervention-only costs, and second, intervention plus short-term (6&#x000a0;months or less) costs post discharge. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis will be set up as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis identifies the marginal benefit of switching from one intervention to the other and is the ratio of the difference in costs divided by the difference in effectiveness between the two study arms. The outcome assessed will be biochemically or proxy-verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence. The ICER will indicate the added cost per additional quitter OPT OUT versus OPT IN, a metric that will allow comparisons to other smoking-cessation economic studies. While the societal perspective is recommended by current national guidelines, it requires quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the denominator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Since this is a short-term study, we decided against attempting to estimate changes in QALYs, and focus instead on cost per quit and incorporate costs from a health care system perspective (direct costs only), comparable to a-priori cost analyses of several clinical trials based in Kansas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In sensitivity analyses, we will adjust wage rates upwards to the national average. In order be able to generalize our findings from this one clinical trial to other populations, we will explore how the variation in counseling time and effectiveness influence the relative cost-effectiveness of the treatment strategies. Our analyses will vary time and effectiveness until breakeven points are achieved between the treatment options.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec42"><title>Research contribution</title><p id="Par87">Missed opportunities for providing medications and counseling for tobacco dependence has created a large treatment gap. This study innovatively reframes the rationale for this gap: what if low rates of treatment are caused <italic>not</italic> by smokers&#x02019; lack of motivation to quit, but by requiring patients to opt in to care? Viewed from this perspective, the effects of screening for readiness on tobacco-cessation treatment can be tested by changing the way that treatment is offered. This study also identifies a major rate-limiting step in access to tobacco-cessation treatment. Regardless of what population, setting, or approach is used to disseminate tobacco-cessation treatment, as long as providers screen for readiness, the majority of smokers will report that they are <italic>not</italic> ready to quit&#x02014;and that they will <italic>not</italic> receive medications or counseling.</p><p id="Par88">The modified Zelen design is a novel feature of this trial, which will permit a true population-based study in which all smokers, regardless of their level of motivation, will be included in the study. By consenting patients after random assignment and treatment, the study does run the risk of dilution bias introduced by participants refusing consent post randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent comprehensive review of Zelen trials found that most trials experience low dilution bias (single-digit percentages of refusal to consent or crossover). This suggests that the potential for recruiting a more representative and generalizable sample greatly outweighs the dilution bias introduced at the time of consent.</p><p id="Par89">The Bayesian adaptive design approach is another novel feature of this trial. It is a highly efficient and ethical strategy for comparative effectiveness clinical trial design because it allocates more patients to effective treatments and can answer the research question earlier than conventional designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In this approach one primary endpoint is used to drive the adaptive randomization. This endpoint is compared across study groups periodically, and more patients are randomized to the stronger arm until a predetermined probability that one arm has &#x0201c;maximum utility&#x0201d; is reached, which signals the end of the comparative trial.</p><p id="Par90">This trial will identify the impact of default tobacco-cessation treatment, for an entire population of smokers, on (1) use of medications and counseling and (2) cessation. It will identify the costs and cost-effectiveness of changing the default, and examine psychological mediators of change based on decision theory. This contribution is significant because it will definitively determine the impact of routinely assessing smokers&#x02019; readiness to quit in real-world clinical practice. Assessing readiness is an integral step in the &#x0201c;5 As&#x0201d; of tobacco-cessation treatment (<italic>Ask, Advise, Assess</italic> [<italic>readiness to quit</italic>]<italic>, Assist, Arrange</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. But the <italic>Assess</italic> step is only supported by &#x0201c;C-level&#x0201d; evidence of effectiveness, as there are no trials that establish that it has a positive impact on cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, we hypothesize that the <italic>Assess</italic> step may actually reduce the number of smokers that receive evidence-based treatment. If our hypothesis is confirmed, it could transform the &#x0201c;5 A&#x0201d; approach and increase access to treatment for the more than 30 million smokers that visit a health care provider each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par91">Recruitment of participants started on 12 September 2016 and at the time of submission of this manuscript, enrollment is ongoing (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec44"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par99">
