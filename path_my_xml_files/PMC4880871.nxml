Most patients referred for CCTA do not have CAD and only approximately 20&#x02013;30 % of patients are subsequently referred to further testing by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or non-invasive perfusion evaluation due to suspected obstructive CAD. In cases with severe calcifications, a discrepancy between CCTA and ICA often occurs, leading to the well-described, low-diagnostic specificity of CCTA. As ICA is cost consuming and involves a risk of complications, an optimized algorithm would be valuable and could decrease the number of ICAs that do not lead to revascularization.</p><p>The primary objective of the Dan-NICAD study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) as secondary tests after a primary CCTA where CAD could not be ruled out. The secondary objective includes an evaluation of the diagnostic precision of an acoustic technology that analyses the sound of coronary blood flow. It may potentially provide better stratification prior to CCTA than clinical risk stratification scores alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Dan-NICAD is a multi-centre, randomised, cross-sectional trial, which will include approximately 2,000 patients without known CAD, who were referred to CCTA due to a history of symptoms suggestive of CAD and a low-risk to intermediate-risk profile, as evaluated by a cardiologist. Patient interview, sound recordings, and blood samples are obtained in connection with the CCTA. All patients with suspected obstructive CAD by CCTA are randomised to either stress CMRI or stress MPS, followed by ICA with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements. Obstructive CAD is defined as an FFR below 0.80 or as high-grade stenosis (&#x0003e;90 % diameter stenosis) by visual assessment.</p><p>Diagnostic performance is evaluated as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and C statistics.

No unequivocal diagnostic strategy has been established for diagnosing CAD in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of stable angina pectoris, and for that reason, clinical practice varies around the world.</p><p>The gold standard for detecting hemodynamic obstructive CAD is invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, ICA is costly and involves a small risk of complications and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has become an established procedure to examine patients with a low to intermediate risk of CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Due to high negative predictive value, obstructive CAD can be excluded by CCTA in approximately 70&#x02013;80 % of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], depending on the risk of the referred population. However, CCTA has consistently proven to have a low positive predictive value, often resulting in an overestimation of the severity of CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], especially in patients with moderate to severe coronary calcification. Consequently, the introduction of CCTA has not led to a substantial decrease in the number of annually performed ICAs or increased the frequency of revascularisation procedures following ICA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The above-mentioned issues raise the question of whether it is possible (1) to make a more precise risk stratification and consequently better selection of patients prior to CCTA and (2) to reduce the number of patients referred for unnecessary ICAs after CCTA.</p><p>European guidelines recommend conducting a myocardium perfusion examination after CCTA to reduce the number of ICAs when no revascularization is performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], although disagreement still exists regarding which perfusion examination to use.</p><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) offers many advantages such as no radiation exposure and high image resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A lack of scanner capacity and expertise are often mentioned as limitations. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is an established perfusion test; however, disadvantages such as radiation and low sensitivity are reported as well as a balanced reduction in blood flow to the myocardium in three-vessel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Many studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CMRI and MPS have used ICA diameter stenosis as a reference standard [16, 18[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which has been shown to be inaccurate in assessing the functional significance of a coronary stenosis compared to ICA-FFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis on MPS found an average sensitivity of 84 % for women and 89 % for men and a specificity of 78 % for women and 71 % for men using invasive coronary angiography&#x02013; quantitative coronary angiography (ICA-QCA) as a reference standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For CMRI, a meta-analysis of studies performed with ICA-FFR as the reference found an average sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 87 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The CADScor System (Acarix A/S, Denmark) is a newly developed technology, which automatically analyses sounds from the heart and extracts multiple acoustic features related to turbulent blood flow, which emerges in a coronary segment with stenosis, and other heart sounds characteristic to CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Based on these characteristics, the system calculates a score. This score can potentially be used for risk stratification prior to CCTA and in diagnosing CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The first objective of the present study is to determine the precision of MPS and CMRI as secondary examinations after CCTA when significant stenosis cannot be excluded.</p><p>Our second objective is to examine the diagnostic precision of the CAD score in patients with a low to intermediate risk of CAD and who have been referred to a primary examination by CCTA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Dan-NICAD is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, randomised, cohort trial examining patients without known CAD, who have been referred to CCTA due to a history of symptoms suggestive of CAD. Study subjects are being recruited at two regional hospitals (Department of Cardiology, Regional Hospitals of Herning and Silkeborg, Denmark). Approximately 2,000 patients with low to intermediate risk of CAD will be included and possibly supplied if needed until a minimum of 300 patients have been randomised and completed perfusion imaging. It is expected that 1,000 patients will be enrolled at each site, as the two centres have similar annual activity in terms of performed CCTAs. Patients with a normal CCTA will not undergo further evaluation, whereas patients with suspected obstructive CAD on CCTA are being randomised. Randomisation is 1:1 for either CMRI or MPS, with subsequent ICA with FFR analysis in both arms. A patient flowchart is included in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The patient has to lie down for 3 min during the recordings and will be asked to hold his/her breath four times for a duration of 7.5 s. As the equipment is sensitive to sounds coming from the outside, tests are conducted in an undisturbed room. Immediately afterward, the recording the equipment will automatically calculate a CAD score. The CAD score is estimated from a fully automated algorithm, which extracts multiple acoustic features from the diastolic heart sounds related to potential turbulence murmurs and other heart sounds characteristics related to CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The CADScor system analyses the quality of the heart sound; in cases of poor recording quality e.g. a high level of ambient noise, the CADScor device will request a new recording.

Ahead of scanning, most patients will be asked to take 50&#x02013;100 mg of metoprolol or 7.5 mg of ibravadin in order to obtain an optimal heart frequency below 65 beats per minute (BPM). Before imaging, patients with a heart rate higher than 65 BPM will be administered Seloken&#x000ae; (metoprolol tartrate 2.5&#x02013;20 mg intravenous) if there are no contraindications. Prior to the CCTA, all patients receive 0.8 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Imaging protocol</title><p>Scans are performed on a 320 multi-slice volume CT scanner (Aquillion One, Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) using prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) gating.</p><p>After anteroposterior and lateral scanograms, a non-enhanced scan will be performed using prospective ECG triggering over a single heartbeat with a gantry rotation and x-ray exposure time of 0.35 s, 0.5-mm slice collimation, tube voltage of 120 kV, and the tube current automatically adjusted with a noise index 80 standard deviation (SD). The start and end positions are determined using the non-enhanced scan. To minimize radiation exposure, the range is reduced as much as possible. In most cases, z-axis coverage is 140 mm but may range from 120 to 160 mm, depending on the length of the heart. The CCTA protocol is performed using a peak tube voltage of 100 kV, except for obese patients where 120 kV is required, a gantry rotation time of 0.35 s, and prospective ECG triggering. 50&#x02013;80 mL non-ionic contrast agent (Optiray 350 mg/mL, Mallinckrodt, Ireland) is administrated according to patient weight. Real-time bolus tracking is performed in the descending aorta and begins 5 s after the start of the contrast injection. Once a target threshold of 180 Hounsfield units (HU) is reached in the descending aorta, the CCTA will be initiated during the pursuing breath hold.</p><p>Data are typically reconstructed at 65&#x02013;75 % of the RR interval, with supplemental reconstructions when needed.

Tc99m-Sestamibi (10 MBq per kilogram of body weight) is injected at peak exercise or after 3 min of the adenosine infusion, when the target heart rate (= (220 - age) * 0.85) has been reached during the dobutamine infusion. Independent of the stress modality, the heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG are monitored throughout the test.</p><p>If the stress images are completely normal, no additional rest study will be performed.

The transmission and emission images are obtained simultaneously. The duration of the transmission scan determines the scan acquisition time based on the Gd-153 source strength; i.e. 20 s per frame for new attenuation correction-sources, increasing to 25 s per frame for older sources (to ensure enough counts in AC image).

The quality of the stress and rest images will be evaluated semi-quantitatively on a visual scale from 1 to 3. Scores defined as 1 represent a good image quality with no artifacts; scores defined as 2 indicate moderate image quality, acceptable for clinical or research diagnosis; and scores defined as 3 are consistent with poor image quality, and diagnosing is impossible due to severe artifacts. The MPS images are assessed using a 17-segment model. For each segment, perfusion defects are scored automatically by the software and adjusted visually on a five-point scoring system (0 is normal, and 4 is the absence of tracer uptake). The scores from the stress and rest images are summed, and a summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS), and summed difference score (SDS) will be produced. The images will also be evaluated qualitatively with a binary outcome (normal/abnormal).

The CAD score is dichotomized with a positive value above 20, 25, and 30, respectively, and performance is reported with sensitivity, specificity, positive predicative value, negative predicative value, and diagnostic accuracy.

Based on these assumptions, a final randomised study cohort of 300 patients is required for a minimum of 10 % absolute precision on both sides (half width of the 95 % confidence interval (CI)) of the expected sensitivity and specificity for both MPS and CMRI. A minimum of 300 patients are needed to achieve sufficient power in the randomised study. To establish this study cohort, we estimate that a primary cohort of approximately 2,000 patients referred to CCTA is needed based on the assumption that 15&#x02013;20 % of patients need further testing after CCTA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study follows the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Danish Data Protection Agency (Case no. 1-16-02-345-14), Danish Health and Medical Authority (Case no. 20140 71252), and the regional committee of Central Denmark engaged in health research ethics (Case no. 1-10-72-190-14) have approved the study protocol. Patients participate in the study only after providing informed written consent both for the randomised part of the study and for their blood samples to be stored in a biobank. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01344434).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of CCTA has proven to be a valid tool for ruling out CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in patients with a low to intermediate pre-test likelihood of CAD. However, the low positive predictive value of CCTA causes &#x02018;unnecessary&#x02019; downstream ICA examinations in the sense that no revascularization is required. The need for more specific strategies for non-invasive diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected CAD was demonstrated in a large study comprising 398,978 patients where elective cardiac catheterization showed obstructive CAD in only 38 % of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Dan-NICAD study aim to test the idea that more patients could potentially avoid unnecessary ICAs by performing a secondary perfusion-imaging test in patients where obstructive CAD could not be excluded with the CCTA. In prior studies looking at low to intermediate pre-test populations, approximately 70 % of the patients did not have obstructive CAD on CCTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients in the Dan-NICAD study in whom obstructive CAD is not excluded by CCTA will be randomised 1:1 to either MPS or CMRI with ICA-FFR as a reference standard for a head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of these two modalities.</p><p>Several other studies have tested the accuracy of these two techniques. In the CE-MARC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], 752 patients with intermediate to high pre-test risks of obstructive CAD underwent both MPS and CMRI with ICA-QCA as a reference standard. The study showed both higher sensitivity and specificity of CMRI compared to MPS. The MR-IMPACT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] also made a head-to-head comparison of the two techniques and showed superiority of CMRI. Here, the patients were highly selected. Patients had either undergone an ICA (positive or negative) or had a positive MPS and were scheduled for ICA. Both studies used ICA-QCA, a reference standard proven not to be ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as it compares functional tests with an anatomical test. ICA-QCA is shown to overestimate the severity of CAD compared to FFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The MARCC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with a population of low-to intermediate pre-test probability, tested the combined use of CCTA and CMRI for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected CAD using ICA-FFR as a reference standard when disease was suspected on either CCTA or CMRI. The study showed improved specificity and diagnostic accuracy using a combined set-up.</p><p>As the availability of CMRI is limited in most clinical settings, we chose a stepwise approach with CCTA as the initial examination based on the high negative predictive value of this approach. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The CAD score combined with the Diamond-Forrester score compared to Diamond-Forrester score alone has previously been shown to improve the risk assessment in patients suspected of stable CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Optimizing the risk assessment might reduce the use of more advanced diagnostic testing and can potentially serve as an easy, safe, and low-cost supplement in diagnosing CAD.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Perspective</title><p>Despite the advances in knowledge and research within the field of CAD large variations still exist in the diagnostic approach for this large group of patients. The effect of a secondary perfusion imaging examination after CCTA in a group of patients with low to intermediate pre-test probability of CAD could potentially reduce the number of unnecessary ICAs where no revascularisation is required. The results of this study are expected to make an important contribution to the improvement of diagnostic strategies for patients suspected of CAD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing.
