Alternative exercise such as Tai Chi has been investigated and the results are promising. However, the strengths and weaknesses of the exercise modality of Tai Chi, conventional PR and a combination of Tai Chi and conventional PR and the possible mechanisms underlying Tai Chi exercise remain unclear.

Participants will perform 30&#x02005;min of supervised exercise three times a week for 8&#x02005;weeks; they will receive sequential follow-ups until 12&#x02005;months after recruitment. The primary outcome will be health-related quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include 6&#x02005;min walking distance, pulmonary function, the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale, the COPD Assessment Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Berg Balance Scale, exacerbation frequency during the study period, and systemic inflammatory and immune markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been granted by the Clinical Trial and Biomedical Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No TCM-2015-82).

Skeletal muscle dysfunction is an important systemic manifestation, along with dyspnoea, which results in reduced physical activity, exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Robust evidence supports incorporation of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) into COPD management. PR is a comprehensive and individualised intervention with education, behaviour change and exercise training as the core component. PR addresses the systemic effects of COPD and has been clearly demonstrated to reduce daily symptoms and improve exercise capacity and quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Although the benefits of conventional PR in COPD are well established, patients have limited access to this intervention because of the cost and limitations of staff and equipment, even in developed countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, alternative exercise has been investigated in an attempt to overcome these barriers. Tai Chi has great potential because it addresses limitations related to time and venue as well as the medical cost of standard PR; Tai Chi could also be a community- or home-based practice.</p><p>Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind&#x02013;body exercise consisting of balance, posture alignment, weight shifting, circular movements, relaxation and breathing control.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Many studies have shown the potential beneficial effects of Tai Chi on various clinical conditions such as hypertension, osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (CVD).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Several meta-analyses have confirmed the therapeutic value of Tai Chi in COPD, in which it was associated with improved quality of life, physical performance and psychological status.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>However, we observed that the above conclusions could only be made based on comparison with a non-exercise or breathing training arm. We searched the literature using the terms &#x02018;randomised clinical trials&#x02019;, &#x02018;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#x02019; and &#x02018;Tai Chi&#x02019; in Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases, as well as the Chinese databases, CNKI and Wanfang, and 13 randomised controlled trials were identified up to 31 July 2015 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011297TB1">table 1</xref>).

Therefore, we will conduct a randomised, single-blind clinical trial comparing the exercise modalities of Tai Chi, conventional PR, and an integrated approach of Tai Chi and PR in COPD to examine (1) the differences in the therapeutic effects on COPD in terms of various clinical outcomes and (2) the potential mechanisms of Tai Chi related to systemic inflammation and immunity in COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>This is a parallel, single-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial.

The chronic sensation of dyspnoea is one of the most common symptoms in COPD and is invariably present in all severity stages either at rest or under conditions of exercise. The mechanisms of dyspnoea and exercise intolerance in COPD are complex and multifactorial.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Exercise capacity is often limited by dyspnoea, whereas exertional dyspnoea is partly a reflection of peripheral muscle dysfunction.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Exercise training is the best available means of improving muscle function in COPD and is considered the cornerstone of PR.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> PR has been clearly demonstrated to improve quality of life, reduce dyspnoea symptoms and increase exercise capacity in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>A symptom is an individual's consciously appreciated sensation of a physiological problem and is the result of an interaction of multiple physiological, psychological, social and environmental factors that affect the quality and intensity of the perception of the symptom.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> In COPD, strategies for the relief of dyspnoea can be physiological or cognitive/behavioural. The rationale underlying the use of cognitive/behavioural strategies is that there is an interaction between the mind and body and that individuals can be taught new patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving to cope with symptoms.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> A previous study has shown that yoga training was associated with significant symptomatic improvement in dyspnoea along with an improvement in exercise tolerance.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese martial art and exercise; its inherent features of isometric exercise, stretching, relaxation and body posture correction combined with breathing techniques provide a typical mind&#x02013;body exercise therapy for various diseases.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An increasing number of studies are attempting to explore the possibility of using this &#x02018;old exercise&#x02019; for a &#x02018;novel use&#x02019; in the treatment of COPD. The results appear to be quite promising; Tai Chi exercise has significant therapeutic effects on quality of life and exercise capacity and has an uncertain benefit on lung function based on several meta-analyses<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011297F3">figure 3</xref>). However, the above conclusions are drawn only in comparison with non-physical exercise or breathing training, which is mostly completed at home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011297TB1">table 1</xref>). The benefits of Tai Chi might partially come from the muscle strength and balance exercises; however, the components of mindfulness and breathing techniques in Tai Chi, which are not a required part of standard PR, may also contribute to the improvement in chronic dyspnoea. How Tai Chi compares with conventional PR in terms of improvement in patient-centred outcomes, including quality of life and severity of symptoms and other objective measures, is unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011297F3">figure 3</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we designed two parallel groups of Tai Chi and conventional PR to compare their effects in COPD.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011297F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Evidence and research gaps in previous studies of Tai Chi and conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): green arrows with solid line represent confirmed associations; blue arrow with solid line represents uncertain association; blue arrows with dotted line represent unknown associations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011297f03"/></fig><p>Conventional PR is characterised by exercise training to improve aerobic capacity and muscle strength. As one of the cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapies, Tai Chi exercise combines mindfulness and breathing control with functional movements. It is possible that the combination of these two exercise modalities would have complementary effects compared with Tai Chi or conventional PR alone on the clinical outcome of COPD including the severity of dyspnoea. This study will examine the effect of an exercise modality incorporating Tai Chi into conventional PR on COPD outcomes.</p><p>Tai Chi has the advantage of being convenient and easily implementable and could be performed at a local community centre or at home. Evidence drawn from systematic reviews revealed inconsistent results in terms of the comparison between hospital-based versus community-based rehabilitation on quality of life:<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> hospital-based rehabilitation was associated with greater improvements in all domains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), although the SGRQ showed no difference. Although the three types of exercise will all be supervised and completed in the hospital in our study, the findings might also provide information on the possibility of Tai Chi as a community- or home-based exercise requiring no special equipment, and this possibility deserves further study in the future.</p><p>Increasing evidence indicates that COPD is a complex disease characterised by airflow obstruction and airway inflammation. Systemic consequences and a variety of comorbidities are also involved. These systemic consequences and comorbidities include exercise intolerance, skeletal muscle dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, osteoporosis, CVD and excess mortality.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The mechanisms of these systemic manifestations are unclear, although systemic inflammation is hypothesised to be of predominant importance. Systemic inflammation is defined as elevation of proinflammatory cytokines or acute-phase reactants in the circulation.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> CRP and IL-6 are classic mediators representing the level of systemic inflammation in various diseases including COPD,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and our previous studies demonstrated the presence and their important role in COPD.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 are also crucial proinflammatory cytokines involved in the systemic inflammatory response in COPD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>
<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> A variety of mind&#x02013;body exercises, including Tai Chi, have been shown to be associated with decreased inflammatory markers such as CRP,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> monocyte-induced inflammation and immune regulation<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> in different clinical populations.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, the effect of Tai Chi on the levels of circulating inflammatory mediators in patients with COPD remains unclear. Given the benefits of Tai Chi on COPD and on other diseases&#x02014;for example, osteoporosis and CVD, which are the most commonly observed comorbidities of COPD&#x02014;it is possible that the suppression of systemic inflammation might be one of the mechanisms underlying the treatment effects of Tai Chi in COPD. Therefore, we will test the above hypothesis by examining the levels of these biomarkers before and after treatment inventions during the study.</p><p>In the absence of any maintenance strategy, the benefits of PR in terms of the 6MWD and quality of life declined after a standard PR programme but the improvements remained significant after 1&#x02005;year.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> The duration of the long-term maintenance of the benefits from Tai Chi has not been investigated, and we will address the question in the 12-month follow-up study. Although the previous study did not find an association between conventional PR and hospitalisation rate in stable COPD,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> we will record more comprehensive types of exacerbation including hospitalisations, ER visits, access to outpatients and changes in maintenance therapy prescribed by doctors or self-administered in this study.</p><p>There are several highlights of this study. We will compare the exercises of Tai Chi and conventional PR for the first time to investigate the pros and cons of the two rehabilitation strategies. For the conventional PR group, TBRS combining upper- and lower-extremity training will be used, which has been shown to be a preferred exercise for older adults<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and is recommended in an official statement.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> In addition, an exercise modality that integrates the components of mindfulness, breathing control and upper and lower extremity muscle training of Tai Chi and conventional PR will be examined. Moreover, a regular follow-up will be conducted to investigate the long-term benefits of Tai Chi exercise, in which comprehensive types of exacerbation will also be recorded. In the outcome measurements, we will include multiple dimensions of COPD assessments covering symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and functional and psychological status. We will examine the potential mechanisms of different exercise modalities related to systemic inflammation and immunity; this topic has not been addressed in previous Tai Chi studies of COPD.</p><p>This study has some limitations that should be considered. Although the sample size calculation was conducted based on previous studies, the study findings will need to be confirmed with a larger number of patients. CVD is among the most important comorbidities observed in COPD. We will exclude patients with symptomatic CVD for safety, although it has been shown that patients with CVD benefit from rehabilitation programmes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although previous studies have shown that PR is generally well tolerated in patients with severe COPD,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> patients with very severe lung function impairment and those who are unable to tolerate the exercise during the screening and run-in period will be excluded because of considerations of safety and compliance. The exclusion might affect the generalisation of study results to populations in a &#x02018;real world&#x02019; setting. Our rehabilitation protocols are not identical with other Tai Chi studies; however, the frequency and exercise intensity in this trial is comparable with previous studies of COPD rehabilitation and meet the requirements recommended in an official statement.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> A prior study found that patients in a Tai Chi group tended to show increased compliance with home exercise;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> therefore, home exercise will be documented in a patient diary. The cultural contexts and healthcare settings might limit the applicability of Tai Chi in other countries and populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This article presents the design and protocol of a clinical trial investigating the effects of Tai Chi exercise in patients with stable COPD.

Would Tai Chi affect systemic inflammation and immune functions that are potentially involved in the mechanisms of its therapeutic effects in COPD? Would an exercise modality combining Tai Chi and conventional PR be a superior approach to Tai Chi rehabilitation in COPD?
