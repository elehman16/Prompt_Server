Although the disease course is variable, it is most often chronic as characterized by ongoing function impairment and the frequent recurrence of acute psychotic symptoms. Relapse rates are substantial, resulting in re-hospitalization, decreased quality of life and increased economic burden. Successive relapses are also associated with a poorer prognosis and progressively declining outcomes.</p><p>Thus, the general goals of treatment are to quickly reduce symptom severity, improve patient functioning and prevent recurrences of symptomatic episodes and associated deterioration of functioning.</p><p>Antipsychotic medication is the primary intervention for the stabilization of acute episodes and the prevention of symptom recurrence in patients with schizophrenia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The atypical antipsychotics are associated with lower risk of reversible and irreversible movement disorders than conventional antipsychotics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] There is also evidence to suggest that atypical antipsychotics have an advantage in their ability to delay the time to relapse,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] although there is variability in both the efficacy and safety characteristics of these drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Optimal effectiveness and the risk of adverse events must be considered when evaluating longer-term treatment strategies as discontinuation rates remain high among the currently available oral preparations of antipsychotic agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of the well-established antipsychotic agent, risperidone. It has a pharmacological activity at monoaminergic receptors that is similar to risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown, but it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors and H<sub>1</sub> histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone has no affinity for cholinergic, muscarinic or &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong D<sub>2</sub>-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less catalepsy and decreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central serotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Paliperidone extended-release (ER) tablets provide a consistent and continual drug delivery for a period of more than 24 hours, thereby reducing the fluctuations in plasma concentrations. Importantly, this release profile of paliperidone ER permits initiation of treatment with a therapeutically effective dose which may reduce the need for initial dose titration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The present study was aimed for evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone ER tablets developed by Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India, in Indian schizophrenic patients.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 13 centers across India participated in this randomized, double-blind, multicentric study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paliperidone ER compared to olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Male or female patients aged between 18 and 59 years with diagnosis of schizophrenia as per diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM)-IV, and with PANSS score between 70 and 120 and clinical global impression (CGI) score &#x02265;4 were included in the present study.

The present Phase III study was planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paliperidone ER in comparison to olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed using PANSS score and CGI. There was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction observed in PANSS score from baseline to the end of 6 weeks of treatment in both paliperidone ER and olanzapine treatment groups. However, the difference between both the treatments for reduction in PANSS score was not statistically significant at each visit over a period of time and at the end of the trial. Statistically significant improvements were observed for all of the five symptomatic domains (PANSS Marder factor scores) of schizophrenia: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression/anxiety, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and disorganized thoughts. Robust symptom improvement was further reflected in the percentage of responders achieving at least 30% PANSS total score reduction from baseline. Rapid symptom control is a clear goal of treatment for the acutely ill patients. Clinically significant improvement based on PANSS total score reduction was observed just after 1<sup>st</sup> week of treatment with paliperidone ER.</p><p>Severity of illness and global improvement were assessed using CGI-S and CGI-I scales, respectively. After treatment of patients with schizophrenia, both the groups showed a decrease in the severity of illness and an improvement in symptomatology from baseline to end of the treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments.</p><p>Paliperidone ER was well tolerated in this study. The reported AEs were generally mild to moderate and tolerable with both the treatments.

There have been substantial health concerns over issues related to metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism, in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. The results from this trial are encouraging in terms of safety related to TEAEs. None of the patients in either group was associated with disturbance in random blood glucose level during the treatment. Additionally, only small increases in body weight were observed in both the treatment groups. QT interval was carefully assessed with multiple ECGs; no patient had any statistically significant change in QT interval from baseline to visit 4 and from baseline to the end of the trial in both paliperidone ER group as well as olanzapine group. This suggests little potential for QT-related cardiac risk. Although elevated prolactin levels were observed in both the groups, the incidences of potentially related prolactin AEs remained low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study indicates that paliperidone ER is effective in controlling a broad range of schizophrenia symptoms as well as exhibits favorable tolerability profile. Both paliperidone ER and olanzapine are equally efficacious for the treatment of schizophrenia. Thus, paliperidone ER has the potential to be a useful new treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This paper is based on the clinical trial funded by Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Ahmedabad.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lehman</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><name><surname>McGlashan</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Perkins</surname><given-names>DO</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, second edition</article-title><source>AM J Psychiatry</source><year>2004</year><volume>161</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>56</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15000267</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Csernansky</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahmoud</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Brenner R; Risperidone-USA-79 Study</surname><given-names>Group</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of risperidone and haloperidol for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2002</year><volume>346</volume><fpage>16</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11777998</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Association AP Practice Guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia second edition</article-title><source>Work group on schizophrenia</source><year>2004</year><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2006 Dec 5</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
