Proper nutrient intake is vital in attaining optimal adaptations to exercise, with the greatest benefits seen when nutrients are ingested in close proximity to the exercise bout <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. When carbohydrates and amino acids are consumed immediately before resistance exercise, protein synthesis following exercise is greater compared to when carbohydrates and amino acids are consumed immediately following resistance exercise <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Consuming a pre-workout supplement containing carbohydrate and protein provides additional fuel for the athlete while simultaneously increasing levels of blood glucose and insulin <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Insulin serves several roles in the body, including the stimulation of cellular glucose uptake <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, increasing the rate of protein synthesis <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and inhibiting protein breakdown <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Such effects may be viewed as positive among athletes, especially those involved in strength and power sports.</p><p>Another role of insulin is to inhibit lipolysis <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which may be viewed as a negative consequence among individuals attempting to decrease body fat as a primary objective of their exercise program. Carbohydrate supplementation 1&#x000a0;h prior to endurance exercise <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, or 4&#x000a0;h prior <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> results in increased insulin along with increased carbohydrate availability, which causes the body to favor carbohydrate over lipid as a fuel source. A beverage containing a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio administered immediately before and during endurance exercise leads to higher rates of carbohydrate oxidation and lower rates of lipid oxidation <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Miller et&#x000a0;al. demonstrated an attenuated rise in plasma free fatty acids when subjects ingested carbohydrate or non-fat milk during endurance exercise, compared to placebo <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Athletes and recreational exercisers may experience a dilemma in deciding whether or not to supplement during their workout, depending on their priorities regarding promoting muscle anabolism and accelerating recovery from exercise, or maximizing lipolysis and lipid oxidation in an effort to decrease body fat. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine differences in performance, blood glucose, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) which may occur when carbohydrates and protein are consumed during an acute bout of resistance exercise compared to when the same exercise bout is conducted while consuming a non-caloric placebo. Variables measured included power output, total volume of work, blood glucose, and RER. Blood glucose measurements were taken immediately before, once during, and immediately after two identical resistance training protocols. RER was measured during each of the two exercise sessions (supplement vs. placebo) at seven time points.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Subject characteristics are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>. Subjects completed an informed consent and medical history questionnaire and were free of any medical conditions including diabetes. RER was measured using the Cosmed K4B2 portable metabolic system (Cosmed USA, Chicago, IL). Blood glucose was measured using the Bayer Contour blood glucose monitor (Bayer Health Care, Mishawaka, IN). Blood samples were taken from the fingertip via capillary puncture. Power output was measured using the Tendo Unit (Tendo Sport Machines, Trencin, Slovak Republic). The supplement used in the present study was an 8% solution of glucose and hydrolyzed whey protein at an approximate 3:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio. The serving administered during the supplement trial (48&#x000a0;g dissolved in 600&#x000a0;mL of water) provided approximately 36&#x000a0;g of carbohydrate and 12&#x000a0;g of protein (approximately 392&#x000a0;kcal). During the placebo trial, subjects ingested the same volume of a non-caloric naturally flavored placebo beverage. Both the supplement and placebo were flavored with non-caloric natural orange cream flavoring. The beverages were consumed in two equal doses of 300&#x000a0;mL each at 12 and 26&#x000a0;min into exercise. Both the supplement and placebo were manufactured by True Protein Laboratories Inc. (Oceanside, CA).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics for subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Variable</th><th align="left">Mean</th><th align="left"><italic>s</italic></th><th align="left"><italic>N</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (yrs)</td><td align="char">25.3</td><td align="char">6.07</td><td align="char">10</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (lbs)</td><td align="char">184.2</td><td align="char">28.86</td><td align="char">10</td></tr><tr><td>Height (in)</td><td align="char">70.0</td><td align="char">3.71</td><td align="char">10</td></tr><tr><td>1RM squat (lbs)</td><td align="char">300.5</td><td align="char">70.65</td><td align="char">10</td></tr><tr><td>1RM bench (lbs)</td><td align="char">236.5</td><td align="char">52.50</td><td align="char">10</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>Subjects completed three visits to the laboratory for testing.

In the present study, the only performance benefit seen was an increase in work capacity for the bench press. The additional fuel provided by the supplement may have aided performance, perhaps by sparing muscular glycogen. The difference in work capacity for the squat did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10). Perhaps the results would have been different if the timing and amount of supplement ingested were changed. Also, the exercise type and duration, as well as initial glycogen levels, are likely to impact whether or not performance differences can be seen with supplementation.</p><p>Blood glucose was well maintained during exercise in the placebo condition, and increased in response to C&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;P ingestion. Blood glucose is regulated by glucose release into the blood stream, either from digested carbohydrates or hepatic glucose production, and glucose disposal, or uptake by cells. Glucose was measured via capillary puncture. Having subjects consume a beverage containing labeled glucose would have provided a more detailed picture of the contribution of the ingested beverage to changes in blood glucose. Since blood glucose was well maintained during the placebo condition, one may infer that the exercise protocol was not long or intense enough to threaten blood glucose homeostasis. In the present study, liver glucose output, whether from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis, was able to meet the demands of exercise during the placebo condition. Subjects were instructed to fast for at least 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;h prior to testing, and to record and match their food intake for 72&#x000a0;h prior to each testing session. Perhaps if the exercise bout had been greater in duration and/or volume, and if subjects were glycogen depleted at the beginning of exercise, a greater performance difference may have been observed. Also, the addition of an aerobic portion following the resistance exercise protocol would have offered another way to compare performance differences. During the placebo condition, no nutrients were consumed and thus blood glucose was maintained by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The increase in blood glucose seen after subjects consumed the supplement may have been due to increased glucose release from splanchnic tissue. In retrospect, a fourth glucose measurement taken 30&#x000a0;min following exercise may have helped to determine if glucose levels would return to baseline after 30&#x000a0;min of recovery in the supplement condition, and if 30&#x000a0;min of recovery would have led to any glucose changes in the placebo condition.</p><p>RER is a widely used measure in studies examining aerobic exercise, and has been examined less in studies involving resistance exercise <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In the present study, RER was measured throughout exercise in an effort to examine potential differences in fuel oxidation when nutrients are consumed during resistance exercise vs. when no nutrients are ingested. One aim of the study was to examine if the supplement would improve performance at the expense of limiting lipid oxidation. Many people who engage in physical activity are concerned more with changing body composition than with exercise performance. RER can provide us with an estimate of how much relative fuel is being oxidized from carbohydrates vs. lipids. RER changed significantly over time in both conditions, although the conditions were not statistically different from one another. The first RER measurement was taken before the start of exercise. The second was taken after two sets of each exercise, but before any beverage was consumed. The third was taken following two more sets of each exercise, and one half of the beverage. The fourth was taken following two more sets of each exercise, and the second half of the beverage. The fifth was taken following the final (7th) set of each exercise (conclusion of exercise). The sixth and seventh RER measurements were taken following 15 and 30&#x000a0;min of recovery from exercise, respectively. As expected, RER rose from rest to exercise during both the supplement and placebo trials, and returned toward normal during recovery. However, no differences in RER between conditions were found, suggesting that the supplement did not cause a statistically significant difference in fuel oxidation between the two conditions.</p><p>Results from the present study are in agreement with Ormsbee et&#x000a0;al., who reported a decrease in RER from before to after resistance exercise, indicating a shift toward greater lipid oxidation during recovery from exercise compared to pre-exercise <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the present study, RER was significantly lower 30&#x000a0;min following exercise compared to pre-exercise. At 30&#x000a0;min post-exercise, RER in the placebo condition was 0.70&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.032 compared to 0.76&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.029 in the supplement trial, suggesting a greater reliance on lipid oxidation during recovery in the placebo trial, however no statistical significance was found. Following the 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;7 ANOVA, a repeated measures <italic>t</italic>-test was used to examine for differences at time 7 only. However, no significant difference was found. Perhaps if a third portion of the beverage had been consumed immediately following exercise, or if RER was measured beyond 30&#x000a0;min of recovery, perhaps for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h post exercise, we may have witnessed an elevated recovery RER compared to placebo by allowing ample time for the ingested glucose to be metabolized. Although RER during exercise was not statistically different between trials, RER values during exercise were higher in the present study compared to other studies. Other researchers have reported slight differences in respiratory measurements when comparing the portable Cosmed K4b2 system to laboratory based metabolic carts <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>Several possibilities exist for future research. Measuring insulin and indicators of lipolysis such as glycerol would help to determine the effects of nutrient ingestion during resistance exercise on lipolysis. A longitudinal study would be interesting as well. Subjects could be divided into two groups and perform identical exercise programs for several weeks. One group could exercise while fasted, while the other group could supplement during exercise. Researchers could compare differences in body composition and performance improvements over time, as well as indicators of overall health such as insulin sensitivity, and markers of inflammation. Also, similar studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic patients could provide information regarding proper dietary and exercise prescriptions in order to manage blood glucose during and following exercise. In conclusion, in healthy active males, nutrient ingestion during resistance exercise improved upper body muscular endurance, but had no effect on power or substrate use as indicated by RER. The question remains as to whether supplementation during exercise will improve performance at the expense of lipid oxidation, and whether exercise in the fasted state will enhance lipid oxidation at the expense of limiting performance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"
