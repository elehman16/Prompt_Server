Unfortunately, however, there are currently no evidence-based criteria with which to determine the quality of various interhospital transport systems and their impact on the outcomes for patients. We aim to rectify this by assessing 2 scores which were developed in our hospital in a prospective, observational study. Primarily, we will be examining the Quality of interhospital critical care transportation in the Euregion Meuse-Rhine (QUIT EMR) score, which focuses on the quality of the transport system, and secondarily the SEMROS (Simplified EMR outcome score) which detects changes in the patient's clinical condition in the 24&#x02005;hours following their transportation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A web-based application will be used to document around 150 pretransport, intratransport and post-transport items of each patient case.</p><p>To be included, patients must be at least 18-years of age and should have been supervised by a physician during an interhospital transport which was started in the study region.</p><p>The quality of the QUIT EMR score will be assessed by comparing 3 predefined levels of transport facilities: the high, medium and low standards. Subsequently, SEMROS will be used to determine the effect of transport quality on the morbidity 24&#x02005;hours after transportation.</p><p>It is estimated that there will be roughly 3000 appropriate cases suitable for inclusion in this study per year. Cases shall be collected from 1 April 2015 until 31 December 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial was approved by the Ethics committees of the university hospitals of Maastricht (Netherlands) and Aachen (Germany).

In daily practice in Germany and the Netherlands, there are multiple varieties of ground ambulances available for use in transporting critically ill patients. These include standard ambulances, ICU ambulances and Mobile Intensive Care Units/Intensivtransportwagen (MICU/ITW). Transportation teams usually include a paramedic and a physician, and teams working within an MICU/ITW often include a physician and nurse trained and experienced with ICU therapy. Typically, the dispatch centre coordinates the transportation and the type of mode used is often based on the urgency and severity of the patient's illness.</p><p>Non-stop provision of interhospital transport demands a large amount of resources; however, it has been observed that regional cooperation and support has been useful in making this more manageable. A group within the Euregion Meuse-Rhine (EMR) was formed over the Dutch-German border in order to attempt to develop a plan of cooperation to improve emergency and MICU/ITW transportation. Substantial differences in organisation and legislation regarding interhospital transport in the different countries of the project group were discovered, prompting the group to express the necessity for development of a uniform manner of measuring quality of transport systems. Currently, parameters such as adverse event rate, short-term mortality and changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score before and after transport are used to describe quality of transport systems.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;19</xref> To combat difficulties in determination of whether a deterioration of a patient's condition during or immediately after transport is attributable to aspects of the transportation, or due to the natural course of the disease,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> the project group has initiated the &#x0201c;Quality of interhospital critical care transportation in the Euregion Meuse-Rhine trial (QUIT EMR trial)&#x0201d;.</p><p>The initial step of the trial was development of 2 scores: the QUIT EMR score which focuses on the quality of the transport system and SEMROS (Simplified EMR outcome score), which detects changes in the patient's clinical condition in the 24&#x02005;hours following their transportation. Scores can be both systematically and manually calculated.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p><italic>Primary objective</italic>: To assess the QUIT EMR score by means of a prospective multicentre study in which three different transport systems, commonly used within the study region, are compared.</p><p><italic>Hypothesis:</italic> The QUIT EMR score will be demonstrated as being reliable and accurate, and shall show that there is a difference in number and severity of adverse events between groups of patients transported with high, medium or low standard ground transport systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012861TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012861TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Definitions of different levels of ground transport systems</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum requirements of ambulance and equipment</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum requirements of first team member</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum requirements of second team member</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">System A (high)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MICU/ITW*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensivist&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICU nurse<break/>IC paramedic&#x02021;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">System B (medium)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IC ambulance&#x000a7;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICU physician&#x000b6;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paramedic</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">System C (low)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard ambulance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physician</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paramedic</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*High volume ambulance equipped with: a boarding ramp, ICU ventilation equipment as well as standard ambulance equipment, a minimum of six infusion pumps, invasive monitoring equipment, the ability to reach the patient from all sides, the ability to transport patients with additional medical devices (such as ECMO, NO, IABP), back-up systems for a ventilator/monitoring/defibrillation unit/suction unit and at least 6000&#x02005;L of oxygen (or 6000&#x02005;L of pressurised oxygen, if required by the particular ventilator system).

Therefore, we introduce a clinical score, laboratory value independent.</p><p>In the ongoing discussion of centralisation of healthcare facilities, a reliable, efficient and proven safe transport modality which meets the individual patient needs is regarded as the key factor for success in future developments in this field.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;25</xref></p><p>In clinical practice, the logistic and financial burden of 24/7 provision of transportation facilities remains high. To reduce these pressures, close cooperation within a regional network which prioritises monitoring of quality, such as the cross-border collaboration, the EMR, is necessary.</p><p>Simply evaluating the number of critical events or the number of interventions requiring physiological parameter changes during transportation cases cannot provide reliable assessment of the quality of a transportation system.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This is because such events can occur as a result of the natural course of a patient's illness. To overcome this, the QUIT EMR score combines performed interventions of the transportation team with changes in physiological status of the patient. Therefore, events such as a dramatic decrease in blood pressure requiring intervention, which is then adequately treated, would not result in a negative judgement. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach to determine quality of interhospital transportation has yet to be described.</p><p>Secondarily, this study examines the possibility of identifying clinically relevant factors which might potentially aid in prediction of 24&#x02005;hour post-transportation morbidity or mortality.</p><p>Currently available and validated scoring systems, such as the SOFA score, require laboratory values which are not always available at the time of transportation. The scoring systems assessed within this study provide a means to calculate the likelihood that a patient&#x02019;s condition will be worse 24&#x02005;hours after they have been transported, when laboratory values are unavailable.</p><p>Moreover, it is expected that sufficient information will be collected to create a new, concrete hypothesis for a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial examining the difference in outcomes of transportation of particular patient categories with either an ICU ambulance or MICU/ITW. This research can be conducted with the use of scoring systems for quality and outcome monitoring. Such research would provide insight into how best transportation resources can be used.</p><p>Certainly, the study is not without limitations. Potentially, the greatest limitation is that registration of transport data is voluntary, which may result in a registration bias. Moreover, the registration of transportation data is completed by the concerned transportation team, meaning that no online data are available. In an attempt to create an appropriate compromise between optimising data collected and keeping the registration procedure practical and manageable, it is possible that some aspects of the registration process are unclear, which could result in personal interpretation and discrepancies within collected data. Finally, there is a high logistic burden involved in following up all data; therefore, it might not always be available for all cases.</p><p>In conclusion, since it is important that resources are efficiently used, there is a necessity for reliable pretransportation analysis of an individual patient's transportation needs, in combination with standardised quality monitoring. It is hypothesised that outcomes of this study will be able to be used to help create a more evidence-based organisation of interhospital transportation of critically ill patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> US was coordinating investigator, involved in planning, drafting the original manuscript.
